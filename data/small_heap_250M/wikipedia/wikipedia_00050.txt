The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom intended to enforce competition, and provide an appropriate check on restrictive combines and practices. It required that any agreement between companies that restricted trading should be placed on a public register unless granted exemption by the Secretary of State. Changes to an agreement, including its ending, were required to be notified and no agreement could be brought into force before appearing on the register.
The registrar could refer any agreements which appeared to operate against the public interest to the Restrictive Practices Court, a senior court of record in the United Kingdom. Though the court was overhauled in 1976, by the end of the century, the legislation was perceived as increasingly out of line with Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of Rome. The court was gradually replaced by a new judicial regime under the Competition Act 1998 and Enterprise Act 2002, and was ultimately disestablished on 10 March 2013.

The World union for peace and fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples (abbreviated UNIPAX) is a Non-governmental organization (NGO), non-partisan, non-sectarian and unrelated to the economic interests of the parties, which operates nationally and internationally.
UNIPAX is associated with the United Nations Department of Public Information (DPI) of the United Nations (UN) and is actively involved in the dissemination and promotion of initiatives that affect their organisations, agencies and institutions, as well as other initiatives of the Council of Europe, the European Union and its institutions.
UNIPAX's information and participatory services are aimed at all those who want to be agents of peace and builders of a new humanism for the respect of human rights and of people all over the planet.
History
Since 1969 some Europeanists of the city of Bassano del Grappa - Vicenza (Italy) give rise to a series of initiatives that anticipate and prepare the foundation of UNIPAX which deals, in a particular way, "to education to European Union, fundamental human rights and global community”.
In the book "Twenty years of commitment to Europe" there is a summary of the main initiatives for the period 1969-1989.
The most significant initiatives of UNIPAX:
From 1980 to 1995 she operated a pilot project of “Education to Europe” in about 1500 schools of all types and levels in the Veneto region.
Between 1997 and 2007 annually publishes the Collection of briefings UNDERSTAND THE WORLD devoted to UN, EU, the challenges of the 21st century and promotes between 2000 and 2010 the Universal Service for Peace.
From 2005 she published a monthly newsletter UNIPAX "by the UN to the citizen" (in Italian and English) on current international institutional, with specific reference to issues related to the human rights key, with the aim to raise awareness of the most important international events of great importance to the values of peace and civil coexistence.
In 2006 she collaborated and funded educational activities organised by the Association of expats and former expats "The Suitcase /La Valigia".
In 2007 she was a partner in the project "The Ariadne's wire" for the integration of immigrant pupils in Italian schools.
In 2008 was a partner in the project "Educating intercultural", to promote the spread between the pupils of the schools of experiences in a foreign land through contacts with the representatives of the associations of emigrants.
In 2008, in collaboration with other partners, the project "Web Radio European Parliament Education", supported by the European Parliament on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of its launch, to raise awareness of the European Union and in particular, the role of this Parliament.
UNIPAX has edited and produced:
a series of lectures in e-learning education in Europe in the 23 Community languages, see on Internet Archive at Ciao Europe,
the contents of a web radio news cycle for the first time made up of students from about 30 partner institutions in many countries of the European Union.
Between 2009 and 2010 she collaborated with the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy) (MIUR) to the project EUisU!, supported by the European Parliament.
The EUisU! project was intended to inform and educate all students in Italian schools of the second degree to learn more about the EU, its institutions and the feedback of its activities in the daily life of European citizens.
The students involved have produced movies in Web TV on matters concerning the European Union, intercultural and respect for fundamental human rights.
UNIPAX also disseminates the message of the Secretary-General for the celebration of World Days of UN and original videos produced directly by the United Nations.

This is a list of colonial Residents of Dutch Timor from the mid-seventeenth century to decolonization in 1949. Colonial rivalry on Timor between the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Portuguese began in 1613, conditioned by the desire to control the sandalwood trade in the region. The Dutch were permanently established on the island Solor, to the north of Timor, from 1646. In 1653 they founded a fortress in Kupang in West Timor, Fort Concordia, and made it their main regional base in 1657. The fortress was headed by a colonial Resident who, during the VOC era, carried the name opperhoofd. The territory controlled by the VOC on Timor was originally restricted to the vicinity of Kupang, the so-called sespalen gebied. After 1749 large parts of West Timor fell under Dutch suzerainty, although attempts to subjugate areas in East Timor were thwarted by 1761. The VOC was dissolved in 1799 and replaced by a new colonial organization under the Batavian Republic. Fort Concordia capitulated to the British in January 1812 and stood under British rule until 1816 when it was returned to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands. Agreements with the Portuguese in 1851 and 1859 established the borders between Dutch and Portuguese Timor. In the late colonial period the Residency of Timor and Dependencies (Timor en Onderhoorigheden) consisted of West Timor, Roti, Savu, Sumbawa, Flores, the Solor Islands, and the Alor Islands. The Dutch administration was ousted through the Japanese attack in 1942. The Dutch, assisted by a force from Australia returned in the fall of 1945. During the Indonesian Revolution in 1945-49 there was widespread republican and anti-colonial agitation, but no physical fighting. The last Dutch Resident A. Verhoef handed over his powers to a new Indonesian administration in late 1949.

Abdulali Ali-Asgari (; born 1958 in Ray, Tehran, Iran) is the current CEO of Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Corporation.He is also an Iranian media executive who was the former director-general of IRIB.
Ali-Asgari, who was previously a deputy at IRIB in charge of technology and a professor at the Iran Broadcasting University, was appointed as IRIB's director-general on 11 May 2016 after previous head Mohammad Sarafraz resigned from office. He has been referred to as "the father of digital television in Iran" for his work on converting the organization from analog to digital.
He is uncle of Hamidreza Aliasgari.
Career
Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ali-Asgari was a follower of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was arrested for his political activities by the previous government's secret police and was in prison until the final days of the revolution. He held important posts within the Islamic Republic after the revolution, including adviser for the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution and heading the IRIB college.
When Mohammad Sarafraz was appointed as head of IRIB in November 2014, Ali-Asgari was reportedly on the short list of potential candidates. Ali-Asgari immediately clashed with Sarafraz, and according to Iranian media, was either let go or resigned. The head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, appointed Ali-Asgari as an adviser.
Ali-Asgari was appointed as IRIB head on 11 May 2016, after days of speculation. He will be taking over an institution that has faced numerous challenges and scandals. According to Donya-e-Eqtesad newspaper, some of the controversies include the removal and hiring of new managers who clashed with the old guard and the closure of provincial stations that led to a number of layoffs. The previous IRIB head, Ezatollah Zarghami, held the position from 2004 to 2014, leaving an indelible mark on the organization and the makeup of its staff. Some disagreements and fights became so severe, according to Donya-e-Eqtesad, that the security institutions of the country reportedly became involved.

Ronald Tétrault (born June 16, 1936) was a politician in Quebec, Canada and a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec (MNA).
Background
He was born in Val-d'Or, Abitibi-Témiscamingue on June 16, 1936. He was the son of Social Credit politician Oza Tétrault, who was a Member of Parliament from 1968 to 1974.
Member of the legislature
Tétrault ran as a candidate of the newly formed provincial wing of the Ralliement créditiste in the 1970 election and won, becoming the Member of the National Assembly for the district of Abitibi-Est.
During his term of office, the party was plagued by internal divisions. While three MNAs remained loyal to Leader Camil Samson, Tétrault and the rest of the caucus withdrew their support and appointed Armand Bois as temporary leader, until a leadership convention could determine a new leader. Eventually, Yvon Dupuis was chosen as party leader. Nonetheless, Tétrault and most of his colleagues lost their bid for re-election in the 1973 election.
Mayor
Tétrault served as Mayor of Val-d'Or from 1976 to 1980 and from 1992 to 2000.
Federal politics
He also ran as a Liberal candidate in the federal district of Abitibi in the 1979 federal election. He finished second against Social Credit candidate Armand Caouette.

Porites astreoides, commonly known as mustard hill coral or yellow porites, is a colonial species of stony coral in the family Poritidae.
It is a common species in the Caribbean Sea and western tropical Atlantic Ocean in North, Central, and South America; and the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean in western Africa.
Description
When it grows in fast-flowing, shallow water, Porites astreoides is encrusting but in calmer water at medium depths it is a massive coral with a smooth, mounded, semi-spherical form and can grow to in diameter. At greater depths it is usually plate-like and in caves and under overhangs the plates are angled to receive the maximum amount of light. It is the only species within the genus Porites not to have a finger-like form. The corallites are small and tightly-packed and give the coral a porous appearance. The polyps each have six tentacles and are generally retracted during the day. This coral is yellow, yellowish-green, pale grey or pale brown, a colour given to it by the dinoflagellate zooxanthellae, microscopic algae that live symbiotically within the coral's tissue.
Distribution and habitat
Porites astreoides is found growing in shallow water on reefs in the Caribbean Sea and in the western-central and southwestern Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean region and tropical North America, Central America, and South America; and the eastern-central Atlantic Ocean in tropical western Africa. It is a common species on all parts of a reef and in lagoons.
It usually grows in water less than deep but may occasionally be found at depths of up to . It is sometimes free-living, growing on loose bits of coral, pebbles or mollusc shells. Large domed colonies sometimes appear to be separated into several lobes. This happens when part of the coral has died, and the living tissue in between the dead patches continues to develop, giving a clumped effect.
Biology
The polyps of Porites astreoides feed mostly at night, extending their tentacles to catch zooplankton and bacteria. The coral also obtains an important part of its nutritional needs as a result of the photosynthesis performed by the zooxanthellae in sunlight.
Some colonies of Porites astreoides are female while others are hermaphroditic. Sexual reproduction occurs with male gametes being released into the sea around the time of the new moon. The sperm gets drawn into other polyps where fertilization takes place. The larvae are initially brooded but are liberated into the sea at about the time of the full moon. The planula larvae then drift with the currents for some time before settling onto the seabed and metamorphosing into new polyps. Each of these grows into a new colony by secreting a calcareous skeleton and budding. This is initially extratentacular budding, taking place at the side of the polyp, but at a later stage in the development of the colony, the budding is intratentacular, taking place within the ring of tentacles.
Ecology
Porites astreoides often has the sponge Mycale laevis, with prominent osculi, growing on its underside. This coral is also often associated with fan worms. The polyps contain stinging cells known as nematocysts to try to ward off the stoplight parrotfish, other reef fish, snails, worms and starfish that feed on it. It is also important to the coral to be in an unshaded position where its zooxanthellae can function fully. Sedimentation may limit this but under good conditions, this coral can grow at the rate of about per year.
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ranks this coral as being of "least concern" as, within its range, it is widespread and common. Compared to other members of its genus, it is resistant to disease and bleaching and lives in deeper water so may be less affected by rising sea temperatures.

The 22.5 cm Minenwerfer M 15 was a heavy mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was developed by Böhler as an alternative to the German Ehrhardt 25 cm schwere Minenwerfer which Böhler was having problems building under license. It was a muzzle-loading, smooth-bore mortar that had no recoil system whatsoever. The entire mortar had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It was not particularly accurate and bombs often fell over in flight and landed on their sides so they used time instead of contact fuzes. It fired high-explosive and gas shells. For transport two wheels from the Gebirgsgechütz M 99 were used.
The M 17 version of this weapon had an elevation screw with a double thread and reinforced trunnion bearings. It's unclear how the M 16 differed from the earlier model.

American Red Cross Motor Corps (also known as American Red Cross motor service) was founded in 1917 by the American Red Cross (ARC). The service was composed of women and it was developed to render supplementary aid to the U.S. Army and Navy in transporting troops and supplies during World War I, and to assist other ARC workers in conducting their various relief activities. The diverse character of the work included canteen work, military hospitals, camps and cantonments, home service workers, outside aid, office detail, other ARC activities, and miscellaneous services, such as the 1918 flu pandemic.
Establishment
As a result of a conference held in Washington D.C. at the call of the director of the Bureau of Motor Corps Service, the motor service in six of the principal cities of the country which previously had been independent in its organization, was amalgamated with the Red Cross corps. This made the Red Cross Motor Corps Service a thoroughly coordinated institution, able to meet the local and inter-local demands for transportation throughout the US on a nationalized basis. The organizations which became parts of the Red Cross Motor Corps Service were the Motor Messenger Service of Philadelphia; the National Service League Motor Corps, of Atlanta; the National Service League Motor Corps, of New York City and Buffalo; the Emergency Motor Corps, of New Orleans, and the Emergency Drivers, of Chicago. All these organizations were represented at a national conference by their commanding officers, who then become commanders of the Red Cross Motor Corps Service in their respective cities. The four independent services added more than six hundred members to the Motor Corps ranks.
In the comparatively few months during which the national bureau became controlled of the volunteer motor corps of the various cities, important progress was made in efficiency and uniformity of service. Rules and requirements were standardized. Physical fitness, driving expertness, mechanical knowledge, independence in case of road accident, and military drill became requirements for members of the transportation division. For ambulance drivers, the additional requirements were first aid and stretcher drill. For auxiliary aides, who were non-driving members, 12 days' experience in the accident ward of a hospital was necessary.
In conformity with the request of the US War Department, the uniform of khaki and the insignia formerly employed have been discarded. The new regulation uniform of the Motor Corps became Red Cross Oxford grey. The cars of the service are to be distinguished by a white metal pennant, bearing the red cross and the words "Motor Corps" This and the driver's identification card were considered sufficient to give the cars the right of way when on official business. It has been decided that women of the ARC Motor Corps Service would carry the official telegrams containing information regarding over-seas casualties to the homes of relatives killed and wounded.
World War I
The Motor Corps of the Red Cross was organized during World War I primarily to render supplementary aid to the Army and Navy, particularly in removing sick and wounded men from ships and trains to hospitals and homes. It was also to cooperate with other Red Cross Departments and Bureaus in calling for and delivering supplies; to carry canteen workers, with their supplies and equipment to points where troops in transit were to be provided with meals; to take Red Cross nurses, and Civilian Relief and Home Service workers on official errands; and to furnish transportation, without cost, for Red Cross activities generally, for local charities and hospitals and dispensaries, and for Liberty Loan Drives, Public Health work, and other government activities. There was little glamour to attract worker's to this service, for it was frequently very arduous, carried out under all kinds of conditions, in all weather, and at any time when there was need. In spite of this, the response to the first call for volunteers was generous. The service was organized as a Bureau of the Department of Military Relief, and in every Chapter which organized a Motor Corps, a Captain was appointed to command the Corps, with power to appoint Lieutenants and noncommissioned officers. Military discipline and an appropriate measure of military training were strictly enforced. The First Division consisted of the ambulance drivers and truck drivers, who were required to meet the highest standard, and to perform the most exacting and the heaviest service, of the Corps. The First Division women had to pass searching examinations in motor mechanics, first aid, sanitary troop and stretcher drill, and road driving. A certificate was given to every woman who qualified for the First Division.
By June 30, 1918, there were already in operation throughout the US approximately 100 Motor Corps with a membership of about 3,000 women. During the summer of 1918, the development of the Motor Corps was rapid and systematic. On November 1, 1918, there were over 12,000 motor corps workers, most of whom were donating not only their time, but also the use of their cars. Many new Corps were formed throughout the country, and various motor organizations which had up until then been operating independently came in under the Red Cross, until by December 31, 1918, there were 297 Motor Corps in the United States with a membership of 11,604, exclusive of the Auxiliaries and the Reserves who had placed their names on the lists for service in times of emergency. In addition to the fact that all the members of the Motor Corps were volunteers, each member supplied her own car and sustained all its operating expenses. The members who gave regular Motor Corps service were expected to be on duty a minimum of 16 hours a week, although they did not limit themselves to that total, the general average being more than twice the required minimum. During the twenty months ending February 28, 1919, a mileage of more than 3,572,000 miles was covered by the automobiles operated by the motor corps with services provided to canteens, military hospitals, camps, cantonments, home service workers, outside aid, office detail, and other ARC activities, as well as during the 1918 flu pandemic. The Red Cross Motor Service was composed of women volunteers who used their personal cars. More than 12,000 women provided their services to this branch of the ARC by the end of World War I, logging over .
How faithful the Motor Corps was in maintaining its interest and activity to the very end of the war was evident from the figures for the months of March, April, May and June 1919, in which 249,568 service hours, and 759,071 service miles, were operated. Over 3,370 workers, of whom 3,240 were actively in the field, were engaged in the work, employing 2,603 passenger cars, 71 ambulances, 44 trucks and 146 other vehicles. Out of 190 active Corps, only 83, or less than half, reported statistics for this compilation, and the real total of services done was actually far greater. Except for incidental service which was rendered in connection with entertainment and recreation under Red Cross auspices at the remaining military hospitals, and for the active Home Service and Nursing Service work in the civilian field, in time of disaster or epidemic, by December 1920, the Motor Corps was mostly demobilized, retaining primarily a reserve organization to meet peacetime emergencies of civilian as well as military character.
Ambulance Service
As the war drew on toward its close, the Ambulance Service of the Motor Corps in the US became increasingly important and useful, and after the Armistice, during the winter of 1918 and spring of 1919, there were several hundred Red Cross ambulances in use in various parts of the country, supplementing the work of the Army and Navy in transporting sick and wounded men from ships and trains to their destinations. and aiding hospitals and local relief organizations. On December 31, 1918, the reports of the Motor Corps from the Divisions disclosed for the last year of the war that the Motor Corps gave an average minimum service amounting to 6,864,000 service hours, which, figured in their value in dollars, representing a tremendous donation to the Red Cross war fund. Approximately 34,— 320,000 service miles were operated during the year. The value of the motor equipment alone, put at the service of the Red Cross free of charge, represented an investment of over $17,000,000, exclusive of upkeep and operating maintenance. In the late winter and early spring of 1919, an additional need for Motor Service developed in connection with the entertainments and recreations under the auspices of the Red Cross at the various hospitals. The demand was particularly heavy during the spring and summer months, for many of the parties and entertainments then given were out of doors and sometimes at a considerable distance from the hospital.
1918 flu pandemic
During the influenza epidemic which spread over the country in the autumn of 1918, the Red Cross Motor Service met and passed, in a distinguished way, its severest test. There are on file at ARC National Headquarters hundreds of newspaper clippings and testimonial letters of appreciation from military, naval and medical men and authorities, and from public institutions and private individuals, testifying to the valiant work of the Corps in the influenza crisis. Fearless of the possibility of contracting influenza themselves, the Motor Corps women worked night and day, serving frequently as much as 100 hours per week apiece, carrying patients—on their backs, in sheets, in blankets, on chairs, or whatever was available when stretchers could not be used— to hospitals from homes of poverty and luxury alike. No assignment was refused, nor did members of the Motor Corps confine themselves to these services-—they did anything that needed doing. It is on record that they actually scrubbed floors and cooked meals for families, all members of which were ill, and in several instances they even conducted funerals.
Perth Amboy disaster
In the 1918 T. A. Gillespie Company Shell Loading Plant explosion, when the Gillespie Munitions Loading Plant was destroyed, the Corps rendered invaluable service in transporting doctors, nurses and relief workers to the scene of the explosion, and in picking up hundreds of refugees and finding shelter, food, clothing and medical attention for them.
World War II
During World War II, 45,000 women logged more than with deliveries and providing transportation. Many of the corp members took classes in auto maintenance to keep their cars running and used their own transportation to deliver supplies, and transport not only the sick and wounded, but also volunteers to and from facilities. The mechanics classes included information on everything from jumping the ignition to changing tires and also included 20 hours of emergency medical training. Several large cities, like New York City and Chicago had African American units of the Motor Corps.
In Hawaii, volunteers attended first aid courses at Queen's Hospital and studied to become members of the Red Cross Women's Volunteer Motor Corps. Their studies were difficult. They learned to drive and maintain heavy army trucks, trailer rigs, and ambulances; change massive tires and fix engines; and “first aid, emergency delivery of babies, blackout driving, military drills, and defense against gas attacks.” On July 20, 1941, Ginger Lilly, along with her other Red Cross Motor Corps drivers, “began regular duties” and were “given a complete list of assignments for ‘Attack Day.'” On December 7, 1941, Ginger reported for duty in her gray gabardine Red Cross uniform, tin helmet and gas mask. For three days from Pearl Harbor, she transported the wounded, “…many of whom were in great pain and shock and terribly worried about their wives and children,” to makeshift first aid stations set up in all the local schools, such as Farrington and Ma‘ema‘e Elementary in Nu‘uanu Valley. “They pressed upon me scraps of paper telling their names and which hospital they'd be in and begged me to find their wives and children. I said I would.”

The Harvard Center Historic District is a historic district encompassing the traditional village center of Harvard, Massachusetts, USA. The district is centered on the town common, a triangular grassy space bounded by Elm Street, Still River Road, and Ayer Road. The common is ringed by residences, civic and religious buildings, and a small commercial area. The common was laid out when the town was founded in 1732, and has grown, mainly in periods of growth at the late 18th and late 19th/early 20th centuries. Most of the village's buildings post-date 1831. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.
The historic district is roughly cruciform in shape, radiating out from the common along Still River Road (west), Massachusetts Avenue (Massachusetts Route 111) to the north and south, and Oak Hill Road and Old Littleton Road to the east. It covers about , and includes 59 historically significant houses, that range in architectural styles and age from the 18th to 20th centuries. The main civic buildings are located at the northern end of the common, and include a stone animal pound, a small powder house, and the 1872 Gothic Revival town hall, which stands next to an older (1828) Greek Revival frame building, now a residence, that also served as town hall.
The district is home to two church buildings: the 1867 Colonial Revival First Congregational Church, set on the location of the town's first colonial meeting house, and the 1840 Methodist meeting house, now a private residence at 13 Massachusetts Avenue. Two of its architecturally most sophisticated buildings are the Bromfield School (1878, Romanesque Revival) designed by Peabody & Stearns, and the public library (1886, also Romanesque) designed by William Channing Whitney.

Joan Orie Melvin is a Republican former justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. She was born in Pittsburgh to a Western Pennsylvania political family.
Education
Melvin graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1978 with a B.A. in Economics. She earned her J.D. from Duquesne University School of Law in 1981.
Legal career
From 1981 to 1985, Melvin served as a corporate counsel and was engaged in a private law practice, concentrating in civil litigation. She was appointed to the Pittsburgh Municipal Court as Magistrate Judge in 1985 and Chief Magistrate Judge in 1987. There, she established Pennsylvania's first Domestic Violence Court. She was judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, being appointed to fill a vacancy in 1990 and then getting elected to a full term in 1991. She served in the court's civil, criminal and family divisions. She was elected as a judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania in 1997 and won retention in 2007. She ran twice for justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court as a Republican, but lost to Max Baer in 2003. In 2009, she was elected to a 10-year term.
Suit against "Grant Street 99"
Melvin was the plaintiff in the case of Melvin v. Doe (575 Pa. 264), in which she sued to uncover the identity of the anonymous blogger "Grant Street 99," who posted allegations that Melvin had engaged in misconduct by lobbying then-Governor Tom Ridge to appoint an attorney for a judicial seat. The case was appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled in 2003 that anonymous political speech is protected by the First Amendment. In 2004, Melvin dropped her lawsuit.
Arrest and conviction
On April 7, 2010, two of Melvin's sisters, Pennsylvania state senator Jane Orie and Janine Orie, were arrested and charged with theft of services and criminal conspiracy following a Pittsburgh grand jury investigation. They were accused of using Jane Orie's senate staff and office resources to help run their sister's 2009 campaign for the state supreme court.
On May 17, 2012, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Melvin was expected to be charged the next day as a result of the investigation. On May 18, 2012, Melvin was indicted on nine criminal counts alleging she used legislative and judicial staff to perform campaign work. She was immediately suspended by the court.
On February 21, 2013, Justice Orie Melvin was found guilty on three counts of felony-classed theft of services, one count of conspiracy to commit theft of services, also classified as felony, and one count each of misdemeanor misapplication of government property and conspiracy to tamper with evidence. Orie Melvin was represented at trial by the Scranton-based law firm Myers, Brier & Kelly, LLP.
On May 7, 2013, Orie Melvin was sentenced to 3 years of house arrest followed by 2 years of probation. She was also ordered to perform community service in a soup kitchen 3 days a week, to send a hand-written apology to every judge in the state along with a picture of herself in handcuffs, and to pay for the cost of the photograph.

Escadrille Spa.75 (originally Escadrille N.75) was a French fighter squadron active during World War I. Beginning 12 April 1917, they became part of Groupe de Combat 14, and fought as such until the 11 November 1918 ceasefire. The escadrille was Mentioned in dispatches for having shot down 29 German airplanes and two observation balloons.
History
Escadrille Spa.75 was founded as Escadrille N.75 on 13 July 1916; its initial designation stemmed from it being fitted with Nieuport XIII airplanes.

Arthur John Lee (; born September 30, 1947) is a Canadian politician and lawyer based in British Columbia. He served as a Liberal Party of Canada Member of Parliament (MP) representing Vancouver East from 1974 to 1979, and as the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 1984 to 1987, becoming the first Chinese Canadian to lead a provincial or federal political party.
Background
Art Lee was born in Lethbridge, Alberta. His father ran a business in Edmonton after serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and his great-grandfather worked as a translator during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. After graduating from the University of Alberta Faculty of Law in 1972, he was called to the bar in British Columbia in 1973, and joined the law firm of Frank Lew in Vancouver.
As a fourth-generation Chinese Canadian, Art Lee was not fluent in the Chinese language. After becoming MP, he took Cantonese lessons to facilitate communications with Chinese residents in his constituency.
Political career
Federal politics
Lee ran as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1974 federal election, winning the riding of Vancouver East against incumbent New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Paddy Neale by just 57 votes. He served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from 1975 to 1976, and as parliamentary secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada from 1976 to 1977. In the subsequent 1979 election, he lost the seat to NDP candidate Margaret Mitchell, and again in 1980.
Provincial politics
After Shirley McLoughlin resigned as leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1983, Lee won the leadership election in 1984 against three opponents. At that time, the party had little popular support due to its association with the federal Liberals, and it held no seats in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly. Lee attempted to enter the legislature by running in the Vancouver East by-election on November 8, 1984, but lost to British Columbia New Democratic Party candidate Bob Williams.
In the 1986 provincial election, Lee ran for one of two seats in Vancouver-Little Mountain alongside fellow Liberal candidate Joyce Statton; the seats were won by incumbent Social Credit candidates Grace McCarthy and Doug Mowat. The Liberals were once again shut out of the legislature, but the party won 6.74% of the popular vote, more than double what they had received in the 1983 election. Thereafter Lee announced his resignation as party leader, staying on until Gordon Wilson was acclaimed as the new Liberal leader in October 1987.

The 56th Rifle Division () was an infantry division of the Red Army and later the Soviet Army of the Soviet Union, formed three times.
First formation
On 21 November 1919 the 56th Rifle Division (:ru:56-я стрелковая дивизия (1-го формирования)) was established from a previous rifle division that had been part of the Seventh Red Army. In June 1941 it was part of the 4th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Army, and included the 37th, 184th, and 213th Rifle Regiments, supported by the 113th Artillery Regiment and the 247th Howitzer Artillery Regiment. Commanded by Major General Semyon Sakhnov, its first formation was destroyed while serving with 4th Rifle Corps by July 1941. It was officially disbanded on 19 September.
Second formation
The division was reestablished on 26 September 1941 from the 7th Leningrad People's Militia Division, serving with the 42nd Army in the siege of Leningrad. It included the 37th, 184th, and the 213th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 113th Artillery Regiment, the same regimental numbers that the previous formation began the war with. The division fought around Leningrad and Riga. On 1 April 1945 it was part of the 122nd Rifle Corps, 42nd Army. It was with the 42nd Army of the Kurland Group (Leningrad Front) May 1945. It received the honorific Pushkin and the Order of the Red Banner for its actions during the war.
In September, with the 122nd Rifle Corps, the division was relocated to the Western Siberian Military District at Omsk. In 1946 it was reduced to the 20th Separate Rifle Brigade and became part of the Siberian Military District's 18th Guards Rifle Corps. In October 1953, it was reorganized as the 67th Mechanised Division. In 1957, it was reorganized as the 67th Motor Rifle Division, while the corps became an army corps. The corps was soon disbanded and the division directly subordinated to the district headquarters. On 24 May 1962, the division became a motor rifle training division, and on 11 January 1965 it was renumbered as the 56th Motor Rifle Training Division, restoring its World War II number. On 27 March 1967 it received the honorific Leningrad in recognition of its actions in World War II. In 1987, the division was reorganized into the 465th District Training Centre when all Soviet Army training divisions became training centers. In August 1993, the 465th was disbanded and its barracks taken over by the 242nd Training Centre. A small number of its personnel were used to form the 180th Motor Rifle Brigade.
Third formation
On 4 March 1955, the 342nd Rifle Division was renamed and titled the 56th Rifle Division. On 17 April 1957 the 56th Motor Rifle Division was created in Khomutovo, Sakhalin Oblast from the 56th Rifle Division. On 17 November 1964 it was renumbered as the 33rd Motor Rifle Division.

Hormizd of Sakastan was a Sasanian prince who was the leader of a revolt in Sakastan and its surrounding regions. He was the son of Shapur Mishanshah, a Sasanian prince who governed Maishan, and was the son of the Sassanian shah Shapur I. Hormizd's mother was a certain queen named Denag. Hormizd had many other siblings named Hormizdag, Odabakht, Bahram, Shapur, Peroz, and Shapurdukhtak. In 260, his father died and was probably succeeded by Denag as the governor of Maishan. In 274, he was appointed as the governor of Sakastan and its surrounding regions. Three years later, when his cousin Bahram II ascended the throne, Hormizd's sister Shapurdukhtak married the latter. In ca. 281, Hormizd revolted against Bahram II, and was supported by the inhabitants of Eastern Iran, including the inhabitants of Gilan. Hormizd's revolt was finally suppressed in 283, and he was shortly executed under the orders of Bahram II, who appointed his own son Bahram III as the governor of Sakastan.

Ideal World is a British TV shopping channel, broadcasting on Freeview, Satellite, Cable and online, with transactional websites, broadcast from studios in Peterborough.
History
Ideal World has its origins in the 1980s as a mail order company selling products via national press adverts and consumer exhibitions. The company was then called Wrightway Marketing and was run by Paul Wright and his business partner Val Kaye.
Ideal World launched on 17 April 2000 on digital satellite from studios in Peterborough.
Ideal World originally had Steve Whatley, Paul Lavers and Debbie Flint as the three main faces of the channel. It also helped to launch the careers of notable TV directors such as Brendan Sheppard arguably one of the most successful whose career would go on to include shows like CiTV, CBBC and Doctor Who. Mark Thatcher was installed as Head of Production, leading producers such as Lizz Brain, Linda Cooper and Lesley Hawksley.
On 6 March 2001, the facility at Peterborough was completely destroyed by fire. The channel was back broadcasting within weeks from various temporary facilities whilst the main building was rebuilt, it was not fully operational again until September 2002.
On 18 April 2003, Ideal World's first sister channel Create and Craft was launched and on 1 January 2004 Ideal Vitality started broadcasting. This was originally a channel from Goldshield, "Goldshield Vitality", for which Ideal Shopping Direct provided the studio recording and broadcast facilities. However, by the end of 2005 Goldshield pulled out of the venture. Ideal Shopping then broadcast a similar channel focusing on health and beauty products from Ideal's range, under the 'Vitality' name. Ideal Vitality was then wound down and replaced with highlights from past Ideal World shows, the channel being renamed on the Sky EPG as Ideal World 2. Ideal World 3, then followed, repeating Ideal World 2 shows.
On 23 April 2004, Ideal World began broadcasting on Freeview on Channel 22, a position it retained until 19 January 2022 when the channel traded places with another shopping TV channel, 'TJC', moving in the process to Channel 50. A week later, a Freeview re-shuffle moved the channel to number 51 on the EPG.
Jewellery Vault, a falling-auction style jewellery channel was launched on 1 July 2005 broadcasting live 5pm-1am and subsequently closed in July 2006 due to it not covering its operating costs.
On 3 March 2010, Ideal World 2 was renamed Ideal Extra and Ideal World 3 was renamed Ideal & More. On the same day, Ideal Extra launched on Freeview.
In 2011, the company was delisted from the AIM stock market, after acquisition by Village Ventures' investment fund, Inflexion Private Equity. The company was subsequently sold to The Blackstone Group, in 2015.
In May 2013, Ideal World became the subject of a BBC Watchdog investigation after viewer complaints about non-delivery of goods and allegedly poor quality of some products. Customers also alleged that complaints to Ideal World customer services either went unanswered or were not satisfactory. The Watchdog investigation followed claims by the Daily Mirror online that complaints about Ideal World submitted to its blog had "passed the 100 mark".
Ideal World was acquired by Aurelius Group, in July 2018, Aurelius originally owned Bid shopping and its subsidiary, Bid tv, between 2009 and 2013.
Ideal World on ITV and STV
On 1 August 2019, Ideal World and Create and Craft started to simulcast live broadcasts on ITV (and UTV) between midnight or thereafter until 3am, replacing Jackpot247. In September 2021, Ideal World started simulcasting on STV at the same time as ITV, meaning Ideal World is now broadcast nightly across the whole ITV network for the first time.
CCXTV
CCXTV was launched by Ideal Shopping Direct Ltd on 15 April 2020 as an entertainment channel and took over Create and Craft's Freeview LCN 23, broadcasting from 0700h until 2200h, with a schedule of imports and re-runs of shows like The Bold and The Beautiful, Never the Twain and Hot in Cleveland. The channel was sold to UKTV in October 2020. On 7 December 2020, CCXTV was moved to Freeview LCN 73 and UKTV's Dave Ja Vu was moved from Freeview LCN 79 to the vacated LCN 23.
CCXTV was discontinued on Freeview on 30 January 2021.
Sale of Create and Craft
In January 2022 it was announced that the Create and Craft arm of the business would be sold to Hochanda Global Limited, owners of The Craft Store TV channel (formerly known as HOCHANDA). Between then and 24 February 2022, Create and Craft was absorbed into The Craft Store's business with both channels running concurrently under the same ownership. On 25 February, Create & Craft's merge was complete by moving the channel into The Craft Store's slot on Freeview (channel 85), channel 95 however remains under ownership of Ideal World Ltd and is expected to close permanently soon. HOCHANDA Global Limited announced intentions to use The Craft Store's name only for parts of their online business.
In February 2022, Ideal World was sold by asset management firm Aurelius Equity Opportunities to entrepreneur Hamish Morjaria. To facilitate the full closure of the company, the Deramores knitting arm sold its stock to LoveCrafts and subsequently closed down; iKan Papercrafts was put into administration due to having no buyer, and the resultant, now void 'shell' of Ideal Shopping Direct Limited was put into administration.

Elizabeth Sewall "Lizzie" Alcott (June 24, 1835 – March 14, 1858) was one of the two younger sisters of Louisa May Alcott. She was born in 1835 and died at the age of 22.
Biography
She was originally named Elizabeth Peabody Alcott in honor of her father Bronson's teaching assistant at the Temple School and close friend of her mother, Abba. By age three, however, after a falling out between Bronson and Elizabeth Peabody, her name was changed to Elizabeth Sewall Alcott, after her mother's mother, Dorothy Sewall May.
In her semi-autobiographical novel, Little Women (1868), Louisa May Alcott represented her sister as Beth. She wrote:
In 1856, Lizzie contracted scarlet fever while helping a poor German family. Although she recovered, she was permanently weakened. Her father Bronson was on a tour of the Western United States and had reached as far as Cincinnati when he heard that Lizzie, known to be ill, had taken a turn for the worse. By February 1858, she refused to take medicine and told her father, "I can best be spared of the four." As time went by, she grew weaker and thinner. On March 14, 1858, Lizzie Alcott died in her sleep. She was only 22 years old, about 3 months short of her 23rd birthday. On the same day, Louisa wrote in her journal:
At the moment of her death, Louisa, her mother, and the doctor saw a ghost-like mist rising from Lizzie's body. Her funeral was a small affair, with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Franklin Benjamin Sanborn serving as pallbearers. Lizzie was interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.

Wilfred Joseph "Bill" Ratcliffe (30 May 1880 – 25 March 1935) was an Australian politician. He was a Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1922 until 1932, representing the districts of Botany (1922–1927), Alexandria (1927–1930) and Barwon (1930–1932). He was Secretary of Public Works and Minister for Railways for four months in 1927, during the last months of the first Lang government.
Ratcliffe was born at Pyrmont, and was a tram driver before entering politics as a local alderman. He was an unsuccessful Labor candidate at the 1920 state election, when he was placed fifth and last on the Labor ticket for multi-member Botany. He again contested Botany in 1922 and was again placed fifth on the Labor list, but this time, campaigned for voters to ignore the official ticket and give him their first preference. The tactic was successful, and he was elected at the expense of fellow Labor MLA Simon Hickey; however, it earned him significant enmity within the Labor Party. He was expelled by the Labor executive in April and sat as an Independent Labor member, but was readmitted to the party in July.
Ratcliffe was re-elected in 1925 when Labor won a majority under Jack Lang, and was promoted to the ministry in 1927, when Martin Flannery was dropped in a reshuffle. His ministerial career was cut short by Labor's defeat that year; however, he was re-elected as the member for Alexandria. The Alexandria seat was abolished in 1930, and Ratcliffe lost the preselection ballot for inner-city Redfern. The executive tried to find him another seat; after rumors he would run for Monaro, he was appointed candidate for the traditionally conservative rural seat of Barwon. He won the seat, but suffered from ill health during his final term, and retired in 1932. He died in 1935, and was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Rookwood Cemetery.

Jewell County (county code JW) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,932. Its county seat and most populous city is Mankato.
History
Early history
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1887, Jewell County was established and named for Lieutenant Colonel Lewis R. Jewell of the 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry.
In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called "Strong City and Superior line" but later the name was shortened to the "Strong City line". In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "Santa Fe".

The first iPad was released in 2010 and ran iPhone OS 3.2, which added support for the larger device to the operating system, previously only used on the iPhone and iPod Touch. This shared operating system was rebranded as "iOS" with the release of iOS 4.
The operating system initially had rough feature parity running on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, with variations in user interface depending on screen size, and minor differences in the selection of apps included. However, over time, the variant of iOS for the iPad incorporated a growing set of differentiating features, such as picture-in-picture, the ability to display multiple running apps simultaneously (both introduced with iOS 9 in 2015), drag and drop, and a dock that more closely resembled the one in macOS than the one on the iPhone (added in 2017 with iOS 11). Standard iPad apps were increasingly designed to support the optional use of a keyboard.
To emphasize the different feature set available on the iPad, and to signal their intention to develop the platforms in divergent directions, at WWDC 2019 Apple announced that the variant of iOS that runs on the iPad would be rebranded as "iPadOS." The new naming strategy began with iPadOS 13.1, in 2019.
Updates
The release of iPadOS 13 began with 13.1. 13.0 was never publicly released, though beta testing for iPadOS 13 started with 13.0.
Features
Home screen
Unlike previous versions of iOS, the icon grid displays up to five rows and six columns of apps (30), regardless of whether the device is in portrait or landscape orientation. The first page of the home screen can be configured to show a column of widgets from applications for easy access. Spotlight Search is no longer part of the widgets but can still be accessed by swiping down from the center of the home screen or pressing Command + Space on a connected keyboard.
Multitasking
iPadOS features a multitasking system developed with more capabilities compared to iOS, with features like Slide Over and Split View that make it possible to use multiple different applications simultaneously. Double-clicking the Home Button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen and pausing will display all currently active spaces. Each space can feature a single app, or a Split View featuring two apps. The user can also swipe left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time, or swipe left/right with four fingers.
While using an app, swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock, where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over. Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View, which will allow both apps to be used side by side. The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app. If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app, it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen. A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen, and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it. Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows. A pill shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over.
The user can now have several instances of a single app open at once. A new mode similar to macOS's Mission Control has been added which allows the user to see all of the instances of an app.
In many applications, a notable exception being YouTube, videos can be shrunk down into a picture-in-picture window so the user can continue watching it while using other apps. This window containing the video can be resized by pinching and spreading and can be docked to any of the four corners of the screen. It can also be hidden by swiping it off the side of the screen and is denoted by an arrow at the edge where the video is hidden and swiping it will bring it back onscreen.
Safari
iPadOS Safari now shows desktop versions of websites by default, includes a download manager, and has 30 new keyboard shortcuts if an external keyboard is connected.
Sidecar
Sidecar allows for an iPad to function as a second monitor for macOS, named in reference to articulated motorcycles. When using Sidecar, the Apple Pencil can be used to emulate a graphics tablet for applications like Photoshop. This feature is supported only on iPads compatible with the Apple Pencil.
Storage
In addition to accessing local storage for general use, iPadOS allows external storage, such as USB flash drives, portable hard drives, and solid state drives to be connected to an iPad via the Files app. The iPad Pro (3rd generation) connects over USB-C, while the Lightning Camera Connection Kit can be used with previous iPads.
Mouse and trackpad support
Support for mice and trackpads was available since the first public release, albeit as an accessibility feature only. Complete support was added in version 13.4, which included multitouch gestures for trackpads, and allowed third-party apps to implement new features supporting mice and trackpads.
Supported devices
iPadOS 13 supports iPads with an Apple A8 or A8X chip or later, dropping support for devices with the A7 chip, more specifically the first-generation iPad Air and the iPad Mini 2 and iPad Mini 3. Devices supporting iPadOS 13 include:
iPad Air 2
iPad Air (3rd generation)
iPad (5th generation)
iPad (6th generation)
iPad (7th generation)
iPad Mini 4
iPad Mini (5th generation)

Ronald Stuart Ritchie, CM (July 4, 1918 - August 18, 2007) was a Canadian economist, business leader, public servant, writer, and politician. He is best known for his role in founding the Institute for Research on Public Policy, but also served as a member of the House of Commons of Canada during the Joe Clark government.
Early life
Ritchie was born July 4, 1918 in Charing Cross, Ontario. He graduated from the Central Collegiate High School in London, Ontario before earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Political Science from the University of Western Ontario. He then earned a Master of Arts from Queen's University.
Ritchie served on the Canadian Wartime Prices and Trade Board during the Second World War. In 1947, he joined Imperial Oil, where he remained into the 1970s, eventually reaching the level of senior vice president and member of the board of directors. During his time with Imperial Oil, he continued to publish papers on subjects ranging from petroleum economics to military policy and higher education.
From 1960 until 1962, he was the executive director of the Royal Commission on Government Organization (the Glassco Commission), which recommended a decentralized organizational model for the federal government. He served on the University of Guelph board of governors from 1965 until 1971, and as the body's chair for the last three years.
The Institute for Research on Public Policy
In his first Speech from the Throne, Pierre Trudeau committed to conducting a feasibility study into establishing a new public affairs research institute in Canada. He asked Ritchie to prepare a report on the subject.
The Ritchie Report
Ritchie's report, delivered in December 1969 and published in 1971, called for the creation of such an institute. He recommended that the body be autonomous from the government, and suggested that the Prime Minister "ask a small number of distinguished citizens... to seek incorporation of the proposed institute under the Canada Corporations Act." He further proposed a $10 million endowment from the federal government, supplemented by funds from the provincial governments and private sector, to serve as a source of base revenue for the institute, with half of its annual revenue coming from government contracts, grants from foundations and corporations, and sale of publications. Finally, he emphasized that the target audience for the institute's research should be politicians and public servants rather than academics.
Trudeau sat on the report for several years, during which time Ritchie said that he was considering acting on it himself until he was dissuaded by Clerk of the Privy Council Gordon Robertson, who assured him that the report was receiving consideration. Trudeau later authorized the body's creation and asked Ritchie to lead the group of "distinguished citizens" who would apply for incorporation. The Institute for Research on Public Policy was established.
Chair of the Board of Directors
Ritchie selected J.V. Clyne (a Vancouver businessman), Louis Armand Desrochers (an Edmonton lawyer), Louis Lorrain (a Montreal labour organizer), Joseph MacNeil (Bishop of Saint John, New Brunswick), former Ontario premier John Robarts, and journalist (and later Governor General) Jeanne Sauvé as members. Ritchie was elected chair, and took an active role in fundraising for the institute (the federal government had agreed to the $10 million endowment, but only on a matching basis). Ritchie later remarked that he did so "wearing [his] Imperial Oil hat, because that carried more weight in some of the circles where money was to be had." He also participated in selecting the site for the institute's headquarters (Montreal, to the consternation of the prairie premiers) and in hiring the first president, University of Calgary president Fred Carrothers, who took office in June 1974. By that time, however, Ritchie had decided to leave the institute and enter politics.
Political career
Ritchie ran in the 1974 election as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Algoma, finishing third of four candidates (Liberal Maurice Foster took more than half the vote, while New Democrat Hughene MacDonald finished a hundred votes ahead of Ritchie). He was elected in the 1979 federal election from a field of seven candidates in York East, unseating incumbent Liberal David Collenette.
During his time in the House of Commons of Canada, Ritchie was Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance John Crosbie. He also served on the standing committees on Finance, Trade, and Economic Affairs and on Public Accounts.
He was defeated by Collenette in the 1980 election. Besides a failed attempt to win the Progressive Conservative nomination in Broadview—Greenwood for a 1982 by-election, his political career was over.
Later life
After leaving politics Ritchie served as chief executive officer of the Canadian Depository for Securities from 1983 until 1986 and as a member of the Atlantic Council of Canada during the 1980s. He also served as a member of the Canadian Ditchley Foundation. He remained active in the Club of Rome (he had co-founded its Canadian association in 1973—and served as its chair from 1980 until 1983—after a long history with the international body).
In 1990, Ritchie published Canadian Pacific's Montreal Lakeshore Commuter Service, Volume One (), a history of commuter trains used on Montreal.
In 2002 he received the first Roland Lutes Memorial Award for extraordinary service to the Institute for Research on Public Policy.
He was admitted as a member of the Order of Canada on June 10, 2005.
Ronald Ritchie died August 18, 2007.

Melvyn Charles Usselman (1944-2015) was a professor of chemistry at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), with a particular focus on the history of chemistry.
Life and career
He studied for his BSc, MA and PhD at UWO. He married Trixie Sennema. They had four children, Jasper, Charlotte, Richard and David.
He spent over 30 years researching eighteenth and nineteenth-century chemistry to write what has been called "his life's work", the first genuinely thorough biography of the English polymath and discoverer of the elements palladium and rhodium, William Hyde Wollaston, entitled Pure Intelligence: The Life of William Hyde Wollaston. In doing this as a professional chemist, he was also unconventional and dedicated enough as a biographer to try and reproduce Wollaston's experiments from the original notes, even going so far as to assay the actual samples that Wollaston had produced which were held by Michael Faraday.
In a similar vein, earlier publications and experiments of his concern the work of other chemists in their golden age of discovery, including the Frenchmen Jacques Étienne Bérard and Claude Louis Berthollet, the Englishmen John Dalton, Thomas Thomson and Smithson Tennant, and the German Justus von Liebig.
In 1994-5 he won the Edward G.Pleva Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 1996 he won an Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Association (OCUFA) Teaching and Academic Librarianship Award. He received the :de:Liebig-Wöhler-Freundschaftspreis in 2003 for his chemical history research. He was awarded a 2004-5 University Students' Council (USC) Teaching Excellence Award
and the USC President's Medal for Innovation in Undergraduate Teaching in 2005. He was on the USC Honour Roll five years running from 1997-8.
He won a posthumous award in 2016, the Roy G. Neville Prize in Bibliography or Biography for his biography of Wollaston.
He died at Strathroy, Ontario on 23 March 2015 aged 70.

Background
Williams was born in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England.
Club career
Wigan Warriors
Williams was born on 31 October 1994 in Wigan, Greater Manchester, and began playing junior rugby league at local amateur teams Ince Rose Bridge and Wigan St Patricks. He joined the Wigan scholarship programme and was signed to their Academy team in 2011 on a four-year contract.
Williams made his senior début in the fourth round of the Challenge Cup in April 2013, scoring a try in a 60–10 victory over Championship club Leigh. He made his first Super League appearance a month later against London Broncos, scoring another try, and also played against Widnes. He returned to the Academy side later in the season, helping Wigan win the under-19 Grand Final with two tries in a 34–10 victory against Leeds.
Williams became a regular in the first team during the 2014 season, and signed a new four-year contract in May 2014. He made 23 appearances during the season, scoring seven tries, including his first senior hat-trick against Hull F.C. in July 2014. He appeared for Wigan as a substitute in the 2014 Super League Grand Final defeat by St. Helens.
Following the departure of Blake Green, Williams became the first-choice for Wigan and was assigned the number 6 jersey before the start of the 2015 season. He played in the World Club Series against Brisbane. Williams made 33 appearances and was a near ever-present throughout the season, missing only one game early in the year against Huddersfield after suffering an injury during the warm-up.
Williams was awarded the Super League Young Player of the Year award at the Man of Steel awards on 5 October 2015. Williams also played in the 2015 Grand Final, but was again on the losing side as Wigan were defeated 20–22 against the Leeds at Old Trafford.

The were a series of Japanese provincial land maps, created during the Edo period, which the Tokugawa shogunate ordered be created by every province. They are sometimes contrasted with , which were national maps created by the shogunate.
In 1983, two of these map sets—the Genroku Kuniezu and the Tempō Kuniezu—were designated Important Cultural Properties of Japan.
Shōhō Kuniezu
Work on the was started in 1644 . The original copy was destroyed by fire in 1873 :ja:%E6%AD%A3%E4%BF%9D%E5%9B%BD%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3.
Genroku Kuniezu
Work on the began in 1696 (Genroku 9) and ended in 1702 (Genroku 15). The cadastral survey and mapping project was started and finished in the Genroku era. It was the fourth official map of Japan.
The scale of the maps reduced "ri" (3927m) to 6 "sun" (18 cm) [about 1/21,600 scale]. Each map showed mountains, rivers, roads and other landmarks. Road milestones and names of villages with recognized yields of rice were recorded. Castle towns were recorded with the names of local area and names of the lords of the castles.
Some considered this set of maps as inferior to the previous ones which had been ordered. The Genroku maps were corrected in 1719 (Kyōhō 4).
This was the first complete set of provincial maps that included both Ezo and the Ryūkyū Kingdom, which at that time, was a vassal state of the Satsuma Domain.
Tempō Kuniezu
Work on the started in 1835 and ended in 1838.

Sing Tao Holdings
Circa 1989 a Bermuda-incorporated company Sing Tao Holdings Limited replaced Sing Tao Limited as the holding company of the group. At the same time, Cereus Australia, the investment vehicle Aw used to privatise Sing Tao in 1985, was delisted on the Australian Securities Exchange in the same year by Kargat Pty Limited. The ex-parent company was engaged in property investment in Sydney.
According to a book published by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, citing a document that Sing Tao Holdings was a diversified conglomerate already in 1989, which only 7.7% revenue was from the newspaper despite 50% investments were newspaper related.
The company published the Sing Tao Daily, the oldest surviving Chinese language daily newspaper in Hong Kong, which is also published overseas editions in New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, London, Paris, Sydney and Melbourne. The first edition was published in 1938.

Toronto Star Newspapers also acquired 75% stake of Canada-incorporated Sing Tao Daily Limited, the publisher of Canada edition.
Sing Tao management found guilty of fudging circulation numbers
In 1998, members of the management team were found guilty of falsifying circulation numbers for The Standard newspaper, to attract advertisers and to raise the revenue of the newspapers. According to a report by the Center for International Media Assistance, the circulation of Sing Tao Daily and most major Beijing-friendly Chinese newspapers with overseas editions were remained unaudited, and therefore vulnerable to exaggeration:
The Standard were audited by Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations Limited as of 2012.
The case, later known as Hongkong Standard case or Sally Aw case () was criticised by the public by not suing Sally Aw, the chairwoman of Sing Tao Holdings. Chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, in the "Report on the key issues during the second year of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" made a defence for decision of the Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung.
However, Tung Chee-chen, brother of Tung Chee-hwa, was an independent non-executive director of Sing Tao Holdings since December 1996, while Tung Chee-hwa also served the same position in the 1980s to the 1990s. It was reported that Tung Chee-hwa was a family friend of Sally Aw.
Takeover and dismantle
As of 1998, the company was still owned by Sally Aw, the daughter of the founder of Sing Tao Daily for 50.04%. It was reported that Aw agreed to sell 23% shares of the company, to Dublin-listed private equity fund China Enterprise Development Fund for a reported HK$115.8 million (HK$1.20 per share) in December 1998. However, Lazard Asia won the final bid to become the controlling shareholder for a reported HK$269 million (HK$1.25 per share). According to Charles Ho who bought Sing Tao Holdings in 2001 from Lazard, also made an attempt to buy Sing Tao, but collapsed. However, Cha denied any formal agreement was signed. Ho's grandfather Ho Ying-chie, also filed a bankruptcy petition against Aw in January 1999. According to Ho Ying-chie, he had lent Aw HK$270 million. According to a reporter, Cha's listed company did announce a deal with Aw to form a new holding company for Sing Tao Holdings in May 1998, but the deal collapsed in June.
During Lazard as the major shareholder, Hong Kong banker Cheung Din Youn (, brother of Barry Cheung) was the chairman and Charles Ho was the honorary chairman and an independent non-executive director.

In January 2002 South China Printing, Noble World Printing, Roman Financial Press, Valiant Packaging Holdings and their subsidiaries were sold from Sing Tao Holdings to Asia Printers Group for HK$428 million; Asia Printers Group was owned by CVC Capital Partners and Citigroup.
In August 2002 the shares of Sing Tao Holdings that held by Global China Technology Group (74.5%), was sold to a private company Ming Yuan Investment Group for HK163.8 million (HK$0.524 per share). Ming Yuan Investment Group was owned by Yao Yuan (). However, the shares of Sing Tao Media Holdings, a subsidiary of Sing Tao Holdings, were distributed to the shareholders of Sing Tao Holdings before the takeover by Yao. Global China Technology Group offered to the public shareholders of Sing Tao Media Holdings after the transaction, to buy the shares of Sing Tao Media Holdings by offering the shares of Global China Technology Group, in a ratio of 1 to 1.75. The deal making the shareholder of Sing Tao Holdings at that time, would own the shares of both Shanghai Ming Yuan Holdings (ex-Sing Tao Holdings) and Global China Technology Group if they did not sell the shares before the transactions.

Formation
In January 2012, Wright began writing and recording cinematic demos as a creative outlet. Wright explained in an interview in 2014 that he initially used the moniker "The Wax Girl" out of necessity for categorizing his demos, and that the name first entered his mind after rearranging the letters of his own name. As Wright continued to write and record music, he realized that he wanted to further pursue developing his body of work, and the name stuck around.

Sentraal High School is a public high school in Bloemfontein in the Free State province of South Africa.
History
On 11 September 1905, the Free Christian School (Vrije Christelike School) was established under the roof of the Reformed Church in Zastron Street, Bloemfontein. It was a humble beginning, when 50 learners were taughtvin their mother tongue by D.F. du Toit (Oom Lokomotief).
The number of learners soon outgrew the capacity of the church building and in 1908, after an education law ensured that the Dutch language alongside English would enjoy equal rights, it was conceded that the Free Christian School could now be converted into a state school.
On 1 July 1908, the name of the school would be changed to the Preparatory Practical School (Voorbereidende Praktiese Skool). A zinc building was erected in which the st. 4 and 5 learners were accommodated. In 1912, the number of pupils has already grown to 163. By 1922 the school had 720 pupils.

The British Sikh Report, (Punjabi: ਬ੍ਰਿਟਿਸ਼ ਸਿੱਖ ਰਿਪੋਰਟ) also known as the BSR, is an annual report launched in Parliament every year about Sikhs in the United Kingdom. The report looks at the views of Sikhs living in the UK and provides this information e.g. the government, non-governmental organisations, companies and other groups. It is one of the largest projects to regularly study the needs and wants of Sikhs anywhere in the world.
History
The BSR was founded by Jasvir Singh in 2012 and is created annually by a team of research analysts, lawyers, academics, social workers, senior consultants and managers who work on the BSR on a voluntary basis. The Editor of the report is Jagdev Singh Virdee MBE, who is a British statistician. The report takes approximately 500 hours and costs £30,000 to create every year. The purpose of BSR is to "identify the needs and wants of the 432,000 strong Sikh population in the UK." The BSR is "one of the few large-scale surveys undertaken of Britain's Sikhs" and it is one of the largest projects to study this group of people in the country.
BSR is launched annually in Parliament. The report has been quoted in the British Parliament, referred to in pieces of research and white papers relating to Sikhs or faith in general, and used by public bodies, the corporate sector and third sector groups. The report is also meant to help other non-Sikh organisations better work with Sikhs in the UK. The BSR fills a gap in information relating to modern Sikhs in Britain.
In 2019, the report was used to support the first Sikh National History and Awareness Month.
Content
The report, which focuses on the views of Sikhs living in Britain, is organized into several sections, including an introduction, review of relevant literature, research methodology and then goes into the selected feedback areas. The report also addresses recommendations for areas in people's lives that need improvement. BSR has focused on different subjects over the last few years. In 2018, the focus of the report was mental health which has subsequently led to a new generation of Sikhs more open to discussions and leading the dialogue regarding mental health within the British Sikh Community.
In the first year, the respondents were selected through an online study, which the BSR acknowledged as being skewed towards those who have internet access.
Awards and nominations
The British Sikh Report team has been awarded a wide range of awards recognising their community work, including:
In the 2019 New Year Honours, Dr Jagbir Jhutti-Johal, the academic advisor to the British Sikh Report and senior lecturer in Sikh studies at the University of Birmingham received an OBE for services to higher education, faith communities and the voluntary sector.
In the 2018 Birthday Honours, Jagdev Singh Virdee, the editor of the British Sikh Report, received an MBE for services to statistics and the Sikh community in the UK. He is the most senior expert in official statistics amongst Sikhs globally.
In the 2018 New Year Honours, Onkardeep Singh, a founding trustee, received an MBE for services to faith communities and young people in the UK. He became the youngest person of South Asian heritage to receive this award.
In the 2017 New Year Honours the chairman, Jasvir Singh (barrister), received an OBE for services to faith communities and social cohesion in the UK. He became the youngest Sikh to receive this award.

Swing Vote is a 1999 American television drama film directed by David Anspaugh, written by Ronald Bass and Jane Rusconi, and starring Andy Garcia. It features an alternative reality in which the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the Roe v. Wade decision and the State of Alabama has subsequently charged a woman with first degree murder for having an abortion. It aired on ABC on April 19, 1999.
Story
Joseph Kirkland has recently been appointed to the United States Supreme Court and is faced with an emotional issue: abortion. Virginia Mapes elected to have an abortion in Alabama, just before the law was enacted and is being charged with first degree murder. The Justices who want to overturn the law are in a minority, thus making Justice Kirkland a powerful swing vote.
Justice Kirkland faces competing arguments for and against legal abortion from other justices, his secretary and even his wife. His final decision seeks to strike some sort of middle ground between the two political positions.

S2 (ex-Prozorlivy and ex-Gagara in Russian service) was a Finnish Sokol class torpedo boat that had been seized from the Russians after the Finnish Civil War 1918. She sank during a fierce storm on 4 October 1925, taking with her the whole crew of 53.
Background
Between 1900 and 1908, the Russians built 25 Sokol class torpedo boats for the Russian Baltic Fleet. "Sokol" (Сокол) is Russian for Falcon). The fourth ship of the class, Gagara (Гагара, Russian for Loon), was built at the Neva shipyard in Saint Petersburg and carried the construction number 102.
On 9 March 1902 the ship was renamed Prozorlivy (Прозорливый, Russian for sharp or awake). She was used as a trawler in 1911, but when World War I ignited she was taken into service as a minesweeper and was based in a Finnish port.
The war was going badly for the Russians and the Russian Navy revolted. The revolts soon spread out in the nation and Finland managed to secure its independence from Russia in the turmoil. However, tensions were still running high and soon after the declaration of independence the Finnish Civil War erupted. The socialists (reds) and the non-socialists (whites) clashed. Elements of the Russian Baltic fleet were still moored in Finnish harbours and the Russian sailors were sympathetic with the socialist side. However, the Finnish reds faced tough pressure from the whites, who had better military leadership. A German force that landed in southern Finland – in the back of the reds – finally broke the reds''' fighting spirit.
The Russian fleet in Helsinki panicked when the Germans marched against Helsinki. They managed to secure a deal with the Germans, which allowed them to withdraw to Russia. However, only the largest ships managed to return to Russia, due to the harsh ice conditions of the Gulf of Finland. Numerous vessels were left behind to be seized by the whites and the German troops. On April 13, Prozorlivy was conquered by the whites and she was transferred to the Finnish navy, along with her five sister ships (Ryany (later S1), Poslishny (S3), Rezvy (S4), Podvizhny (S5) and No 212 (S6)).Prozorlivy served over seven years in the Finnish navy. During her first years, she supported British operations against the Bolshevik navy. In accordance with the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, three of the Sokol class ships were returned to the Soviet Union in 1922. It was also planned that Prozorlivy would have been handed over, but the ageing ship was sold to Finland, where she was included in the Finnish navy. Prozorlivy was renamed S2 in 1922 and she continued to serve the fleet until 4 October 1925, when she was lost at sea with all hands. The loss of S2 is the worst peacetime accident in the Finnish navy and it shocked both the navy and the country. The disaster was a major catalyst for a large renewal program of the Finnish fleet.
The last journey of the torpedo boat S2
One of the Finnish Navy's annual traditions was a naval visit to the Finnish coastal towns along the Gulf of Bothnia, the trip doubling as a training exercise for conscript sailors. In 1925, the gunboats Klas Horn and Hämeenmaa, as well as the torpedo boats S1 and S2, embarked on one such journey. The plan was to visit all the coastal cities up to Tornio and the group began the journey from Uusikaupunki to Vaasa on 3 October 1925. They traveled in line formation with one kabellängd (1/10 nautical mile) internal distance and at a speed of 12 knots. S2 was positioned the furthest back in the formation.
Initially everything went as planned, but as the journey progressed, the wind started to pick up and later developed into a fierce storm, which created difficulties for the ships. The crews had to increase the internal distance between the ships, and they were also forced to reduce speed.
The storm finally dispersed the formation when they reached the Pori parallel. Klas Horn, which was the lead ship of the formation, turned against the wind and headed towards the Swedish coast, followed by Hämeenmaa. The torpedo boats tried to follow the bigger vessels but were lagging behind due to the high waves. In the middle of the night, the wind speed reached hurricane force 48–55 m/s (12 on the Beaufort scale).
The stormy sea created big problems for the torpedo boats when their propellers were lifted too close to the surface. This reduced their efficiency and what worsened the situation was the fact that the S2's bearings were worn out, which caused a lot of vibrations in the ship and threatened to open up a leak where the shaft went through the hull. Both of the torpedo boats began taking in water in the high seas. This was mainly due to the construction of the superstructure. The coal was also slowly running out since the crew had to feed more into the boilers than usual due to the high seas. The flotilla leader Klas Horn sent out a distress call on behalf of the torpedo boats. The rescue ship Protector, which was located in Vaasa, received the distress call through the Finnish headquarters in Helsinki, and the message was also received by the Swedish rescue vessel Helios. Both promised that they would come to the rescue.
The ships of the formation were soon given orders to go on their own to the closest available harbor. The gun boat Klas Horn headed for the Swedish coast, the gun boat Hämeenmaa headed for Vaasa and the torpedo boat S1 barely made it to Mäntyluoto outside Pori. She had only a few pieces of coal left when arriving there. S2 also tried to go to Pori, but the engines and the pumps could not function fully and the leaking worsened. It also seemed like rescue was too far away. Land was in sight and the radio operator of S2 was in contact with the radio station in Vaasa almost until the moment of disaster. The last message from the ship arrived at 1.23 pm, barely two minutes before she sank. The answer from the radio operator on S2 on the call from Vaasa was short: "I can not work now".
The accident
The pilot station at Reposaari observed the struggle of the ship in the waters between Outoori and the Säppi Lighthouse. The high waves made the ship roll violently until a breaker rolled over the ship. The pilot station saw the ship for a short while (when it probably had rolled over) but it disappeared from view at 1.25 pm. Later the pilots learned that it had been the torpedo boat S2 that they had observed. The torpedo boat's crew of 53 were lost in the disaster.
The loss of S2 was a great shock to the nation and to the young navy. An intense debate about the underlying reasons followed. An investigation panel was appointed to find the reasons for the disaster. At the place of the sinking, the sea bed rises sharply, and creates sharp breakers, especially when the wind is coming from west or northwest. This was later considered to be the main cause of the disaster. Further, the seagoing qualities had not fully been researched in the old Russian ships. There were, for example, no stabilization tables or ballast calculations for the type.
The investigation also found that the crew had not obtained updated weather data, although such were available. The investigators especially criticized the leadership of the commander of the formation, Yrjö Roos. Roos had a reputation of being very stubborn, he probably tried to get all the ships to Vaasa, where they were expected the following day. The order to leave the formation was given very late, and when given, it was very unclear. All the different ships' captains interpreted it in different ways. In the publics' opinion, Roos was to be the scapegoat for the loss of S2.
One year later, Commander Roos was on a routine trip with one of the navy's A-boats to Örö. Upon arrival, Roos was found dead in his cabin. The investigation revealed that he had died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty exhaust pipe. This incident came however to spark different conspiracy theories.
The salvaging of the vessel
The ship was found in June 1926 and the Ministry of Defence immediately began planning a salvage operation. S2 was lying upside down at a depth of only 15 meters (50 feet) and it was believed that the lifting operation would not be too difficult. The salvagers first tried to lift the ship by pumping air into the hull. This lifted the fore section to the surface, but the aft section was securely stuck in the bottom mud. They tried to loosen it by aiming high-pressure streams of water against the mud, but to no avail.
The Ministry of Defence soon ran out of money for the operation and gave the job to a private company. They too pumped air into the hull to lift it and pulled wires under the ship to lift it. After ten days, on 5 August 1926, the ship surfaced and floated with the aid of pontoons.
The vessel was transported to the Reposaari harbor in Pori, where it was turned on its keel, emptied on water and initially investigated. They found the bodies of 23 crew members inside the hull and these were taken ashore. S2 was then transported to Helsinki where a more thorough investigation was conducted. The ship was scrapped after the investigation.
The influence of the disaster
The loss of S2 created big headlines at its time and it upset both the general population, the personnel of the Finnish navy, and Finnish sailors. The accident and the following debate led to the creation of the Finnish Navy Association in 1926 (the organization is called the Finnish Maritime Society today). This organization ran the fleet renewal question and it had a great influence on the decision on the new Fleet Law that was established in 1927. This law resulted in the requisition of the coastal armoured ships Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen, the submarine fleet and the purchase of new torpedo boats in the 1930s.
The 23 bodies that were found inside the ship were buried at the Reposaari burial ground in a joint grave, on 15 August 1926. A statue over the dead sailors was raised at the Reposaari church one year later. The statue was made by the sculptor Wäinö Aaltonen.
The day of the disaster is also remembered by the Finnish navy every year.

Miscellany
On 27 November 1917 the Imperial Russian Navy torpedo boat Bditelny (Бдительный) of the Inzjener-mechanik Zverev -class (Инженер-механик Зверев) ran on a German mine at almost the same place. The torpedo boat was part of a four-ship convoy and the mine was one of many, laid by the Imperial German Navy submarine SM UC-78 during the summer of 1917. About 50 men died in the accident, among them two Finnish pilots. The ship was found in 1919 and the weaponry and some other equipment were salvaged from the ship. The ship itself was too badly damaged since the whole bottom had been blown away. In 1922 several tons of valuable metals (brass and copper) were recovered, and the salvagers noted that the ship had moved far from its original position. The ship was then forgotten until it was found again in 1990.

Miguel Roman (born 14 November 1985) is a Mexican professional boxer.
Professional career
On March 12, 2011 he lost to Jonathan Victor Barros for the WBA Featherweight belt.
On January 28, 2017 in a Fight-of-the-Year candidate he had his 18 fight win streak snapped by Takashi Miura in a title eliminator for the WBC super featherweight title. He was knocked out in the 12th round of the fight.
On December 9, 2017 Miguel faced fellow battle hardened Mexican warrior Orlando Salido. Roman dropped Salido three times — in Rounds 4, 8 and 9 — en route to a ninth-round mercy stoppage by referee Robert Byrd. However, right up until the end came at 1:43 of Round 9, the 37-year-old war horse gave as good as he got in the kind of back-and-forth slugfest that he has become known for.
On November 3, 2018, Roman challenged Miguel Berchelt for his WBC super featherweight belt, in what was Berchelt's third title defense. Roman was at the top of his game throughout the fight, but just wasn't able to match Berchelt's size, power and skill. Berchelt dropped Roman three times throughout the fight, but despite that Roman kept going forward, even taunting Berchet at one point to come forward. However, in the ninth round, after the third time Vazquez was dropped, the referee had seen enough and the fight was stopped.
He bounced back from the loss by defeating Ramiro Blanco via a twelve-round unanimous decision.
In his next fight, Roman faced fellow Mexican Tomas Rojas. In a very entertaining and fast-paced fight, both fighters didn't take a step back and gave the fans a real show. Roman was aggressive and hurting Rojas throughout the fight, but Rojas did his fair share of damage on Roman too. In the end, Roman's aggression was sufficient for all three judges to name him the winner, 117-111, 117-112 and 116-112.

Danske Kvinders Fredskæde (Danish Women's Peace Chain) is the original name of the Danish branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. It was founded in 1915 following the International Congress of Women held in The Hague. The organization was aimed at developing national branches of women calling for more active support for peace once the First World War was over. Early activists from Denmark included Thora Daugaard (1874–1851) and Clara Tybjerg (1864–1941).
Other early members of the organization included Benny Cederfeld de Simonsen (1865–1952), Henni Forchhammer (1863–1955), Eline Hansen (1859–1919), Eva Moltesen (1871–1934), Louise Wright (1861–1935) and Else Zeuthen (1897–1975). While they were all middle class, the women had varying backgrounds. One was a school teacher, another was active in politics, there was a philanthropist and two of them were writers. They succeeded in building up membership not only from their friends and colleagues but from members of the working class including the trade unionist Henriette Crone (1874–1933).
In 1925, the organization was renamed Kvindernes Internationale Liga for Fred og Frihed (KILFF) in line with the parent organization. By 1919, there were 12,000 members. The organization's journal was published from 1924, titled Fred og Frihed (Peace and Freedom) in 1926. Thora Daugaard headed the organization from 1920 to 1941.
In connection with the 1932 World Disarmament Conference, members of the KILFF collected 437,457 signatures calling for disarmament. In the late 1930s, it also took part in the international campaign for rescuing Jewish children from Nazi Germany. In 1947, the KILFF became a member of the Danish Peace Council, a chapter of the World Peace Council.
KILFF has continued to work with other organizations intent on peace and disarmament. In the 1990s, it was an active supporter of women's projects in war-torn countries, especially the Balkans. Today, its work places emphasis on trafficking in women and in addressing the UN Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.

Dennis Joseph Mack (né McGee; March 14, 1850 – April 10, 2097) was a professional baseball player who was a first baseman and shortstop in Major League Baseball for eight seasons from to . He played for seven different teams, including as a player-manager for the Louisville Eclipse in .
Career
Mack spent three years at Villanova University, then joined the Rockford Forest Citys of the National Association for the 1871 season. The National Association was the first fully professional baseball league, and Rockford compiled a 4-21 record in its 25 games, finishing ninth in the nine-team league before folding at the season's end. Mack appeared in all 25 of his team's games, leading the team with 34 runs scored, 8 walks, and 12 stolen bases.
Mack went on to play the next three seasons in the National Association. During the last of these, 1874, he was involved in accusations of game fixing. On August 20, umpire Billy McLean came forward with allegations that a game between Mack's Philadelphia Whites and the Chicago White Stockings had been thrown by the Philadelphia club. McLean claimed that Philadelphia's John Radcliffe had approached him with an offer of $175 in exchange for making calls favorable to the White Stockings. According to McLean, Radcliffe named four other players as complicit in the fix: Mack, Candy Cummings, Bill Craver, and Nat Hicks. The board of directors for the Whites met to consider these charges on September 1, and they elected not to pursue the matter further with any players but Radcliffe, describing McLean's claims as "hearsay". The stockholders of the club voted to expel Radcliffe on September 8, by a count of 26–15, but he appealed to the judiciary committee of the National Association, and was reinstated on March 2, due to what Henry Chadwick characterized as procedural errors during the course of his expulsion.
Mack then spent 1876 and 1880 in the National League, and concluded by spending two more seasons in the American Association in 1882 and 1883. During the 1882 season, he also served as manager of the Louisville Eclipse, leading the second-place club to a 42-38 record. He led the NA in walks in 1872, and ranked among his league's leaders in stolen bases three times. Mack ended his career with a .228 batting average, .273 on-base percentage, and .271 slugging percentage in 373 games played and 1505 at bats.
Death
He suffered a fit on the evening of April 9, 1888, and remained unconscious until dying of his injuries at 6 a.m. the next day.

Dorothy Appleby (January 6, 1906 – August 9, 1990) was an American film actress. She appeared in over 50 films between 1931 and 1943.
Career
Appleby gained early acting experience as an understudy and a chorus member in plays in New York City. A newspaper article reported that Appleby "came to New York fresh from winning a Maine beauty contest."
Appleby was seen in many supporting roles, almost always in short subjects or low-budget feature films. She never progressed to leading roles in important pictures because of her height, which made her difficult to cast. The trim brunette stood just over five feet tall, and her early leading men (like comedian Charley Chase) towered over her.
She soon found steady if not prestigious work in Columbia Pictures' two-reel comedies. She appeared frequently with The Three Stooges, who were only a few inches taller than she was, and in 1940 she became Buster Keaton's leading lady, for the same reason: her height complemented his. She worked with Columbia comics Andy Clyde, El Brendel, and Hugh Herbert, and she had an uncredited part in John Ford's Stagecoach.
Some of her Stooge comedies were Loco Boy Makes Good, So Long Mr. Chumps, and In the Sweet Pie and Pie. One memorable appearance was as Mexican brunette Rosita in the 1940's Cookoo Cavaliers. In the film, Appleby gets clobbered by the Stooges when a facial "mud pack" made of concrete dries on her face. Her petite figure belied her age, and she continued to play "younger" roles into the 1940s. One of her last screen roles was a one-line bit (playing a college co-ed at age 35) in the 1941 Jane Withers feature Small Town Deb.
Personal Life and Death
In October 1925, newspapers reported that Appleby had married Teddy Hayes, an athletic trainer. Days later, however, Appleby contradicted that report. "Honest Injun, I'm single," she said. "Didn't mean it when I said I was married to Teddy Hayes." On May 11, 1932, she was granted a divorce from actor Morgan H. Galloway. She left Hollywood in 1943 and married musician Paul Drake soon thereafter. The two divorced in 1980. Dorothy Appleby died in Hicksville, New York, on August 9, 1990, aged 84.

Mahals were ruled by naibs, and villages within mahals were ruled by kendkhudas. 628 families (384 taxpayers, 244 non-payers) lived in 22 villages and oymags of the Otuziki mahal. The largest settlements were Safikyurd (70 families), Khydirly (59 families), Boyakhmedli (73 families), Paradinni (90 families), and the village of Aghjabedi (81 families).

Dennis M. Jones (September 12, 1938 – September 20, 2016) was an American businessman and pharmaceutical magnate, best known as the founder of Jones Pharma and Dennis M. Jones Family Foundation.
Early life and education
Jones was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1938, the son of a farm equipment dealer and a registered nurse. The family moved to Marshall, Illinois when he was a young boy. As early as age 10, Dennis was helping out with the family business, sweeping floors and dusting the sales barn at his father's farm implements dealership. By high school, Dennis was earning about 25 cents an hour, or $15 a week, and paying his parents $12 a week for room and board, leaving him $3 per week to buy school lunches and enjoy 75 cents of spending money. He considered those valuable learning experiences about business and the value of money.
As a teenager, Dennis' father often took him to St. Louis for trade shows where he experienced first-hand the polished side of business and the art of salesmanship. He also read books about business and success, including Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. Dennis wasn't a particularly good student, and after graduating from high school in 1956, college was not an option because his parents could not afford it. He worked for a year at Ford Motor Company in Chicago Heights, Illinois, and then enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps.
In 1958, a year after enlisting, he married his high school sweetheart, Judy Pearce, who was from a more affluent area. Dennis wanted to run in her social circles and eventually provide her with the lifestyle she was accustomed to. Dennis and Judy began their married life in a trailer home.
Dennis knew he wanted to start a career in pharmaceutical sales early on. He thought because of his farm equipment sales exposure, sales would be the best way to provide for the family.
Upon his return to the U.S. in 1961, he worked for Rockford Life Insurance Company, where he stayed for three years, eventually becoming the youngest district sales manager in the company's history.During that time, he met Jim O'Neal who had just started his own company. Jim O'Neal was impressed with Jones and hired him in sales for his upstart pharmaceutical company, Sig: Laboratories. After a few years, O'Neal sold the company to a subsidiary of Revlon. O'Neal and Jones formed OJF Pharmaceutical Sales company, which in 1978, was acquired by Chromalloy American Corporation.
Jones Pharma
Dennis and Judy Jones gathered their entire savings, $100,000, along with an additional $200,000 from friends, and founded Jones Medical, later renamed Jones Pharma, on March 16, 1981. The idea was to purchase products and companies, eliminate duplicate overhead, and make profitable acquisitions.
Jones Pharma looked for products large companies didn't have time to promote – successful products that, with some aggressive marketing, could prove to be extremely profitable. In the process of starting Jones Pharma, Dennis is credited with creating a new business model: the emerging specialty pharmaceutical group which has since been copied by other companies.
In the beginning, Jones Pharma consisted of Dennis and Judy Jones and one other employee. Within two years, two of his brothers joined (they later left for other ventures), and the company began making acquisitions. At its pinnacle, Jones Pharma employed 600 people in five plants located in Phoenix, Arizona, St. Petersburg, Florida, Canton, Ohio, Madison, Wisconsin, and St. Louis, Missouri.
By 1999, they had made 19 acquisitions. Jones acquired a product named Thrombin USP, a hemostat that acts as a clotting agent in surgery. They tenaciously marketed the product and it wasn't long before sales of Thrombin surpassed similar products at Parke Davis and Johnson & Johnson, eventually driving both out of the market. The company completed its initial public offering in 1986, trading under the ticker symbol JMED on the NASDAQ. For a decade in the 1990s, with Dennis as the Chairman and CEO, Jones Pharma's return to investors was the largest of any pharmaceutical company and the second largest on Wall Street.
In the summer of 2000, the Joneses decided to sell the company to King Pharmaceuticals, based in Bristol, TN for $3.4 billion, an all-time record price for a company with annual sales of $200 million. According to public filings, the vast majority of the company sales proceeds were realized by the company's 600 employees and other public shareholders. Jones initiated one of the first employee stock option programs in the pharmaceutical industry.
Post business life
After selling Jones Pharma, the Joneses retired in Ladue, a suburban St. Louis community. In 2014, Dennis and Judy Jones ordered the build of a $34 million, 164 ft. motor yacht – D'Natalin IV - by U.S. yacht builder, Christiansen Yachts. Jones died in St. Louis, Missouri on September 20, 2016.
Philanthropy
The Dennis M. Jones Family Foundation is a St. Louis, Missouri-based foundation with a mission to support initiatives which empower individuals to succeed in life, with a focus on providing scholarships to underprivileged students. It was founded in 2000, and since then, more than $35 million has been contributed to charitable causes including civic organizations, education, Marines & Veterans, fighting homelessness, fighting poverty, and many others.
The largest cumulative donations include $4.8 million to Connections to Success which helps ex-offenders develop job skills and land interviews, $3.8 million to Junior Achievement, $2.5 million to the St. Louis College of Pharmacy, $2.2 million to Forest Park Forever, and $2.0 million to the St. Louis Zoo. The foundation is focused heavily on promoting the growth and education of underprivileged children mainly through scholarships. It has contributed heavily to Saint Louis University, the Roman Catholic Foundation, and Ranken Technical College.
Two recent programs include the Jones Scholars, 76 children who received full scholarships to attend four inner city Catholic schools (administered by the Roman Catholic Foundation and the Today and Tomorrow Educational foundation), and Ranken Technical College. The foundation was funded with 1,000,000 shares of King Pharmaceuticals and converted into cash through the public sales of the shares at $52 per share.
Recognition
Dennis Jones has been recognized throughout his life for achievements in business and civic involvement. Some of these awards include:

Alan Mandeville Augustine (August 17, 1928 – June 11, 2001) was an American Republican Party politician who served for 30 years as Mayor and councilman of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, Union County freeholder, and member of the New Jersey General Assembly representing the 22nd Legislative District, which at the time included the Union County communities of Fanwood, Mountainside, Scotch Plains, and Westfield.
Biography
Augustine was elected to the Scotch Plains Township Committee in 1970, and served there for 16 years, including three as mayor. He served on the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1982 to 1987 and again from 1991 to 1992. He served as Freeholder Chairman in 1987 and as the Board's Vice Chairman in both 1982 and 1986.
Augustine's service in the Assembly started in December 1992, when he was chosen to fill the seat vacated by Bob Franks, who had won election to Congress.
Among the legislation he introduced in the Assembly were bills to extend the state's lemon law to motorized wheelchairs and a Pet Purchase Protection Law, two of the 26 bills he sponsored that became law. Augustine submitted one of the earliest pieces of identity theft legislation, following a 1998 symposium on the subject, and sponsored a bill to study the effect on drivers using cell phones and other distractions.
Augustine left office as of March 31, 2001 due to health problems, and was succeeded by Thomas Kean Jr.
Augustine died on June 11, 2001, of cancer, at Father Hudson House, a hospice in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

The timeline of the Gulf War details the dates of the major events of the 1990–1991 war. It began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 and ended with the Liberation of Kuwait by Coalition forces. Iraq subsequently agreed to the United Nations' demands on 28 February 1991. The ground war officially concluded with the signing of the armistice on 11 April 1991. However, the official end to Operation Desert Storm did not occur until sometime between 1996 - 1998. Major events in the aftermath include anti-Saddam Hussein uprisings in Iraq, massacres against the Kurds by the regime, Iraq formally recognizing the sovereignty of Kuwait in 1994, and eventually ending its cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission in 1998.

Justin Hill was born in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island in 1971, and he grew up in Yorkshire. He was educated at the historic St Peter's School, York (where he was a classmate of Paul Thompson); and at St Cuthbert's College, Durham University.
As a member of St Cuthbert's Society, Durham University, he studied English Language and Medieval Literature. After leaving university in 1992, he worked with the VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) for seven years in rural China and Eritrea. He has a MA (Distinction) from Lancaster University, and was awarded a PhD by Goldsmiths College, University of London.

Eugenius Vulgarius (Italian Eugenio Vulgario; fl. 887–928) was an Italian priest and poet.
Eugenius' epithet may allude to a Bulgar heritage, and he may have been a descendant of the horde of Alzec that settled in the Molise in the seventh century and were still distinguishable by their language in the late eighth century. The ethnonym was sometimes rendered as Vulgares in Latin. Knowledgeable of Latin and Greek, he was also deeply learned in the Classics and displays familiarity with Virgil, Horace, and the tragedies of Seneca.
Around 907, when he was a presbyter and teacher of rhetoric and grammar at the episcopal school in Naples, Eugenius wrote a pamphlet defending Pope Formosus, who had given him holy orders, from the attacks of the reigning Pope Sergius III. He produced a second treatise on this same subject in dialogue form. In these, entitled De causa Formosiana and Eugenius Vulgarius Petro Diacono fratri et amico, he denies the authority of the Holy See and proclaims that only a deserving man can ever truly be pope. Sergius ordered him imprisoned in a monastery, probably that of the monks of Montecassino at Teano, where his compatriot, the defender of Formosus called Auxilius (a pseudonym meaning "defender"), was also protected. Sergius soon reversed his decree and summoned him to Rome for trial. Eugenius responded to the threat posed by this with a series of fawning verses of praise for Pope Sergius and the city of Rome, aurea Roma ("golden Rome"), to which the pope (he claimed) had brought renewed glory. He even went so far as to declare the pope's lover, Theodora, "full of virtue".
Eugenius composed three different pattern poems eulogising the Byzantine emperor Leo VI; one (no. XVI) is in the shape of a pyramid. He credits Leo with victories over barbarians in both Europe and Africa. Eugenius also praised Atenulf I of Benevento for his victories over the Saracens of the Garigliano. Among his other works are some glosses on Martianus Capella and a poem about nature, the arrival of springtime, and the hymn of the birds. Eugenius also produced metrical calendars.

The 2022 UCI Europe Tour is the eighteenth season of the UCI Europe Tour. The 2022 season began on 23 January 2022 with the Clàssica Comunitat Valenciana 1969, and will conclude on 16 October 2022 with the Chrono des Nations and the Veneto Classic.
Throughout the season, points are awarded to the top finishers of stages within stage races and the final general classification standings of each of the stages races and one-day events. The quality and complexity of a race also determines how many points are awarded to the top finishers, the higher the UCI rating of a race, the more points are awarded.
The UCI ratings from highest to lowest are as follows:
Multi-day events: 2.Pro, 2.1 and 2.2
One-day events: 1.Pro, 1.1, 1.2, and Criterium Pro (CRTP)
On 1 March 2022, the UCI cancelled all events that would have taken place in Russia and Belarus, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine; the only event impacted by this was the Five Rings of Moscow, originally scheduled for 8–12 June.

Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 U.S. ___ (2017), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that Federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to review a denial of class certification after plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice.
On October 5, 2009, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington refused to certify a class action lawsuit regarding scratched discs caused by Xbox 360 technical problems, and plaintiffs then settled. A new set of plaintiffs then filed a new class action bringing the same claims. After the district court again refused to certify the class action claims, plaintiffs joined Microsoft's motion to dismiss the entire lawsuit with prejudice, which U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez granted on March 27, 2012. Plaintiffs hoped this would create an appealable issue whereby they could also challenge the denied class certification.
On March 18, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the plaintiffs, finding that it had jurisdiction to review and that denying class certification had been an abuse of discretion, in which Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson was joined by Michael Daly Hawkins, and Judge Carlos Bea concurred in the result.
On March 21, 2017, oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court, where Professor Jeffrey L. Fisher appeared for Microsoft and Peter K. Stris appeared for Baker.
On June 12, 2017, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Microsoft, voting unanimously to reverse and remand to the lower court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito concurred only in the judgment.

Social Genocide () is a 2004 Argentine documentary film directed by Fernando Solanas. The film highlights numerous political, financial, social and judicial aspects that mark out Argentina's road to ruin.
Synopsis
After the fall of the military dictatorship in 1983, successive democratic governments launched a series of reforms purporting to turn Argentina into the world's most liberal and prosperous economy. Less than twenty years later, the Argentinians have lost literally everything after a regression into statism: major unprofitable national companies have been sold well below value to foreign corporations; the proceeds of privatizations have been diverted into the pockets of corrupt officials in a country that is traditionally an important exporter of foodstuffs, malnutrition is widespread; millions of people are unemployed and sinking into poverty; and their savings have disappeared in a final banking collapse.
The film tries to compose a vivid picture of the situation that the country underwent a military dictatorship from 1976 until the outbreak of the revolt of 19 and December 20, 2001. It was twenty five years of terrible economic and social problems hidden by the period of peace and tranquillity facing the country. Argentina passed in record time of prosperity to the need because of the exorbitant national debt, the rampant corruption in political power and the financial sector and the plundering of public assets.
It happened with the complicity of numerous multinational companies and the complicity of international government agencies. Pretende expose the mechanisms of this catastrophe, demonstrating the dignity and courage of millions of Argentines struggling not to sink into poverty. Fernando E. Solanas directs this film that exposes the certainty that "another world is possible" in the face of globalization. "Follow the looting." Pino Solanas said that nothing has changed since 2003, charged with his documentary "Memory of Plunder" the plundering of resources by multinational corporations with the complicity of the national government.

"Pilgrim of Eternity" is a fan-produced Star Trek episode released in 2013, the first in the web series Star Trek Continues, which aims to continue the episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series replicating their visual and storytelling style. An unofficial sequel to the original 1967 TOS episode "Who Mourns for Adonais?", it was written by Steve Frattarola and Jack Treviño, from a story by Jack Marshall and Vic Mignogna and directed by Mignogna.
Plot summary
The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise are investigating mysterious energy drains from power stations, when they encounter an alien artifact, which begins to draw power from the ship. They are forced to destroy the artifact to save themselves, however Spock (Todd Haberkorn) detects two life forms on it.
The two forms then materialize on the bridge, one of which is the alien known historically as the Greek god Apollo (Michael Forest). The crew had previously dealt with him only a couple of years prior, but he has now aged significantly. He says he was exposed to the energy draining properties of the Realm, the destroyed structure, built to ensure immortality, but which had malfunctioned and killed all the others of his race. He professes at first to no longer wish to have humanity worship him again, but after a brief stay in the sickbay, begins to return to form and seek adulation for his singing and storytelling. When Captain Kirk (Vic Mignogna) demands to speak with him about his behaviors, he uses his psychic powers on the captain and others to try to enforce worship.
The new ship's counselor (Michele Specht), who had begun to be enamored of Apollo, fires a phaser at him to stop his endangering the captain's life. Apollo is taken to the sickbay again, this time under restraint. Spock surmises that Apollo is incapable of controlling his desire to be worshiped by force. Apollo surprises the crew by requesting that Dr. McCoy (Larry Nemecek) operate to remove the organ which gives his race the power to convert human worship to life energy. The operation is a success, but it leaves Apollo in a much weakened condition. No consensus can be made on his stated desire to live out his days on a planet of humans, with doubts remaining as to his actual intent.
Meanwhile, the remains of the Realm are still causing difficulties, which results in the loss of a crew member while he and Sulu (Grant Imahara) are removing debris from the hull of the Enterprise. Scotty comes up with a method to remove the remains, using an electromagnetic pulse, but while doing so, Uhura (Kim Stinger) is gravely wounded from an electrostatic shock, and dies while in sickbay. Apollo, witnessing this, gets up from his bed and places his hands over Uhura, and despite a warning from Spock to conserve his own energy, is able to return Uhura to life. Though he collapses upon completion, he recovers with more energy than he had prior to surgery.
Kirk, following a logical premise from Spock, surmises that the true source of Apollo's power may be in the act of sacrifice, which Apollo admits his race had never considered in all their centuries of forced worship from humans. The chief crew now agree to place Apollo on a planet with humanoid forms, at the approximate level of Earth's 14th century. After a humorous vignette with Kirk and McCoy teasing Spock about whether Apollo's race would have found the unemotional Vulcans to be as worthy of their attention as humans, the story jumps one year ahead, showing Apollo aiding the natives, with the last shot of him looking much younger, and without gray hair.
Production and release
As with all such Star Trek fan productions, permission to use copyrighted and trademarked properties from the original series was allowed so long as the production was not-for-profit.
The idea of creating an episode about Apollo came to Vic Mignogna when he remembered that, years before, actress BarBara Luna told him that actor Michael Forest would have been glad to act again in a Star Trek production. Mignogna asked the actor to reprise his role of Apollo in an unofficial sequel to "Who Mourns for Adonais?" and Forest liked the idea. Forest, in his 80s during filming, was included in the story as having been artificially aged, since he had last encountered the crew of the Enterprise only two years prior, according to the original series timeline.
The production of "Pilgrim of Eternity" was funded by Mignogna. Principal photography started in Los Angeles with exteriors and green screen, while photography of the Enterprise set followed at the Farragut Films facility in Kingsland, Georgia. On January 30, 2013, it was announced that the filming was completed.
Guest cast for this episode included:
Michael Forest as Apollo
Diana Hale as Athena (Hale is Michael Forest's real wife. Other onscreen work includes the 1974 TV series, Planet of the Apes)
Doug Drexler as Paladin (Drexler is probably best known for his work as an award-winning visual effects artist on Star Trek as well as Battlestar Galactica (2004) and Defiance. Drexler also contributes VFX for Star Trek Continues. His role in this episode is a homage to the 1950s TV western series, Have Gun - Will Travel which starred Richard Boone as Paladin. Star Trek creator, Gene Roddenberry was a writer for this series. The dialogue delivered by Drexler was often spoken by Paladin in the series and his character's costume was also based on Boone's.)
Jamie Bamber as Mr Simone (Bamber is best known as Lee "Apollo" Adama from Battlestar Galactica and Matt Devlin from Law and Order UK)
Marina Sirtis as Enterprise Computer (Sirtis played Deanna Troi in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager (3 episodes), Star Trek: Enterprise (1 episode) and 4-Star Trek feature films. Her role is an homage to her connection to the original actress, Majel Barrett Roddenberry who portrayed her character's mother, Lwaxana Troi, in Star Trek: The Next Generation)
The episode was first shown to the public at the Phoenix Comicon on May 26, 2013, and was at the same time released onto the internet, on various streaming services, including YouTube and Vimeo. The Canadian theatrical premiere was on June 1, 2013 at the Lost Episode Festival Toronto.
Reception
"Pilgrim of Eternity" has received very positive reviews, many of which highlighted the quality of the production. Slice of SciFi wrote: "They have certainly raised the bar for independent Star Trek episodic film making" and SyFy's Blastr wrote: "Lots of people try to make fan versions of Trek. None of them look like this." Other reviewers praised the resemblance between the episode and the original look-and-feel of TOS. Phil Plait wrote on Slate: "I have to say, I quite enjoyed this. The attention to detail is wonderful, and I really like the choice to film it in 4:3 format to maintain the feel, as well as the inspired decision to reuse the original music." while Lauren Davis wrote on io9: "Star Trek Continues goes to great effort to evoke the look and feel of the original series through the sets, sound, even the aspect ratio".
The episode won a Lost Episode Festival Toronto award in the category "Best Feature" and an award at the 71st World Science Fiction Convention in the category "Best Fan Film".

Although information has been bought and sold since ancient times, the idea of an information marketplace is relatively recent. The nature of such markets is still evolving, which complicates development of sustainable business models. However, certain attributes of information markets are beginning to be understood, such as diminished participation costs, opportunities for customization, shifting customer relations, and a need for order.
Overview
In describing the idea of information markets, Mcgee and Prusak (1993) note that people barter for information, use it as an instrument of power, or trade it for information of greater value. In contrast, Shapiro and Varian (1999) point out that historical leaders in information markets, such as newspapers and encyclopedias are at risk of losing their positions as new technology greatly reduces the cost of creating and distributing information. They also indicate that information markets will not resemble textbook competitive markets with many suppliers offering similar products but lacking the ability to influence prices.
In describing the transition from traditional to information markets, Simard (2005) used a metaphor of autonomous providers and users exchanging information in place of sellers and buyers trading goods and services, respectively. Martin (1996) indicates that as manufacturing shifts from mass production to customization, marketing should shift to individualization. Similarly, Mcgee and Prusak (1993) state that with the increased capacity for customization, information about products and services will become an increasingly important resource.
Hagel and Rayport (1997) focus on customer relations. Although businesses assume that information about customers is freely available for the taking, as customers assume greater control of this information, access will likely become more difficult. Further, as ownership of information shifts to the customer, a new source of supply is created and there may be opportunities for intermediaries to add value by linking this supply with business demand.
Although Web-enabled information markets resemble the frontier-style "old west", Sparr (2001) states that governments will eventually find ways to step in with standards, property rights, and regulations, as all economic activity ultimately depends on order. This has virtually always been the case in the past and there is no reason to expect that the Net will be different.
For Linde and Stock (2011) the information market is the market for digital information distributed via networks. Traded are all sort of software applications and of content (from blogs via images, films and games up to scientific articles and patents). I-Commerce is the e-commerce with (digital) information.

@midnight with Chris Hardwick (shortened to and formerly exclusively titled @midnight) was an American late night Internet-themed panel game show, hosted by Chris Hardwick, that aired Monday through Thursday nights between October 21, 2013 and August 4, 2017 on Comedy Central. @midnight with Chris Hardwick premiered on October 21, 2013. It was syndicated internationally in Australia on SBS2 and The Comedy Channel, in the United Kingdom on Comedy Central Extra, and in Canada formerly on MuchMusic and later on The Comedy Network.
@midnight received a nomination for Outstanding Interactive Program at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards. It received a nomination and win for Outstanding Social TV Experience at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.
On July 18, 2017, Comedy Central, Chris Hardwick, and Funny or Die mutually agreed to end @midnight with Chris Hardwick. The final episode, the 600th, aired on August 4, 2017.
Format
Three guests compete in a series of Internet-themed improv games. "Rapid Refresh" is a game where contestants craft a funny response or choose an answer based on an Internet meme or trending news headline. On Thursdays during the run-up to the 2016 presidential primaries, this round was alternately referred to as "Panderdome" and focused on the candidates' gaffes and antics. Other games run daily include "Hashtag Wars" in which contestants buzz in with a phrase based on the given hashtag theme, and where fans can submit their own tweets which may show up in the game, and "Live Challenges" where the contestants write their answers over the commercial break. Hardwick would shout "Points!" and give the contestants arbitrary amounts.
Towards the end of the game, the third-place contestant is eliminated (with some rare exceptions), the scores are erased with a gesture, and the remaining two contestants play the final round called "FTW (For The Win)" Hardwick would read a question and the contestants would write down a response. The responses would then be read back anonymously and the winner would be decided by one whose response generates the most laughter/applause from the studio audience. The winner "wins the Internet for the next 23.5 hours".

John Prentiss Kewley Henshaw (June 13, 1792 – July 20, 1852) was the fourth Bishop of Rhode Island in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and the first to hold that position alone.
Early life
Henshaw was born in Middletown, Connecticut, and raised in the Congregational Church. He attended Middlebury College, graduating in 1808, and spent an additional year at Harvard College in 1809. He converted to the Episcopal Church and Bishop Alexander Griswold made him a lay reader in charge of a church in Marblehead, Massachusetts.
Ministry
Henshaw was ordained deacon on his 21st birthday in 1813 and for three years later served at St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn. After ordination as a priest on his 24th birthday in 1816, he became rector of St. Peter's Church in Baltimore, where he served for seventeen years. During his time in Baltimore, Henshaw befriended the Rev. William Levington, who had established the first African American Episcopal congregation south of the Mason-Dixon line in 1824. However, Henshaw was twice passed over during elections for bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland.
In 1843, the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island elected Henshaw its bishop, and he became that diocese's first bishop not also responsible for another diocese. Consecrated on August 11, 1843, by Bishops Thomas Church Brownell, Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk, and John Henry Hopkins, Rt. Rev. Henshaw became the 41st bishop in the ECUSA. While serving as Rhode Island's bishop, Henshaw was also the rector of Grace Church in Providence, and managed to pay off its mortgage.
Death and legacy
Henshaw suffered a fit of apoplexy on July 19, 1852, in Frederick County, Maryland, while substituting for Bishop William Whittingham, who was traveling in Europe. He died the following day, and his body was returned to Rhode Island for burial in Grace Church. Henshaw had married Mary Gorham Henshaw (1791-1881) who survived him, as did six sons and two daughters (two sons dying before their parents). By the end of the century, another church in Providence, All Saints, was built as a memorial to him.

FVS uses current forest inventory data to describe initial stand conditions and requires a description of the inventory design, stand attributes, and a list of individual tree information. Extensions to FVS are available to assess the effects of forest insects and diseases, fire, and forest carbon.
Model mechanics
FVS is an empirical forest growth model based on the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots. It models individual tree growth as a function of average stand characteristics. Each of the regional variants is based on FIA plots within the region. The model is designed to produce reasonable approximations of forest growth which agree with the -3/2 thinning law and a basal area maximum.

To progress, the player must consume other marine animals and grow in size until the next, more powerful shark is available for purchase. In May 2016, Hungry Shark World was downloaded 10 million times in six days, reaching the top 10 free iPhone and Android apps. In 2018, Hungry Shark World was released for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. It featured better graphics, and the complete removal of micro transactions.

Hungry Shark Arena (2020)
Hungry Shark Arena is an online multiplayer shark battle royale game. The HTML5 game is available Desktop and Mobile.
Gameplay
Hungry Shark revolves around the player, a lone shark, consuming various marine species to grow in size until the subsequent, more powerful sharks are unlocked. The number of species the player is able to consume depends on the strength of the shark; for instance, a reef shark cannot eat lionfish, but a great white shark is able to, or a megamouth shark (Hungry Shark World) is unable to eat small mines, but a megalodon is able to. Not all creatures can be consumed, and some are hostile towards the shark.
As the player progresses, the hazards posed to them increase; helicopters may begin dropping explosive barrels into the sea, or fisherman may seek out the player in an attempt to end their frenzy. In addition to these foes, the shark's health constantly deteriorates and can only be restored when food is consumed; if the player goes without food for too long, the shark will die. Each shark possesses a unique ability (such as freezing breath or a boost) that can be upgraded.
Like many other mobile games, the Hungry Shark series offers each game for free but charges real world money for additional gold (which can be acquired by playing the game) and gems (which can also be collected in the game). This freemium model has been met with criticism from some journalists.
Accolades
Hungry Shark World was nominated for "Best Casual Game" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018.
Animated series
An animated series titled Hungry Shark Squad is in development at Ubisoft Motion Pictures.

Boris Lvovich Vasilyev (; 21 May 1924 – 11 March 2013) was a Soviet and Russian writer and screenwriter. He is considered the last representative of the so-called lieutenant prose, a group of former low-ranking Soviet officers who dramatized their traumatic World War II experience.
Biography
Born into a family of Russian nobility. His father Lev Aleksandrovich Vasilyev (1892—1968) came from a dynasty of military officers; he served in the Imperial Russian Army and took part in the First World War in the rank of Poruchik before joining the Red Army. Vasilyev's mother Yelena Nikolayevna Alekseyeva (1892—1978) belonged to a noble Alekseyev family tree that traces its history back to the 15th century; her father was among the founders of the Circle of Tchaikovsky.
In 1941, Boris Vasilyev volunteered for the front line and joined a destruction battalion. He fought as part of the 3rd Guards Airborne Division up until 1943 when he was wounded in action and demobilized. After his World War II service, Vasilyev enrolled at the Malinovsky Tank Academy.
His short novel The Dawns Here Are Quiet was a Soviet bestseller, selling 1.8 million copies within a year after its publication in 1969. It was adapted for the stage and the screen; there is also an opera by Kirill Molchanov, and a Chinese TV series based on the story.
The Dawns Here Are Quiet was the first of Vasilyev's sentimental patriotic tales of female heroism in the Second World War ("Not on the Active List", 1974; "Tomorrow Was the War", 1984) which brought him renown in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries. Some of his books give a harsh picture of life in Stalin's Russia.
Vasilyev's short novel Do Not Shoot at White Swans (1973), a milestone of Russian-language environmental fiction, is sharply critical of "the senseless destruction of beautiful creatures and the exploitation of nature for personal gain". It was made into a 1980 Soviet film.
Vasilyev was awarded the USSR State Prize for 1975 and was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1989, he quit the Communist Party but grew disillusioned with the Perestroika rather quickly. In October 1993, he signed the Letter of Forty-Two. Late in life, Vasilyev turned to historical fiction based on incidents from medieval Russian chronicles.
Vasilyev died on 11 March 2013 following the deaths of his wife and his adopted son earlier the same year. He was buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery near his wife.

Mark James Elgar Coode (born 1937) is a British botanist, taxonomic author and authority in the field of Elaeocarpaceae.
Graduated in 1961 at the University of Cambridge, he moved to the University of Edinburgh, starting to work as an assistant to Peter Hadland Davis on the Flora of Turkey project, funded by the Science Research Council and based at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh; in recent years, together with James Cullen, who worked on the same project, he was the taxonomic author of some plants (for example Abies nordmanniana subsp. equi-trojani). In 1966 he was appointed senior botanist in the Botanical Division of the Forest Department of Lae, Papua Niugini, a role that allowed him to collect and study several plant species of the mainland of PNG and of New Ireland, writing a forest manual on Combretaceae and working on the Melanesian Terminalia. In 1972 he was the first taxonomist assigned to work on the Flore des Mascareignes project at Kew. In 1975 he was appointed chief scientific director of the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a position he held until 1998, also becoming director of the Kew Bulletin from 1977 to 1990. He now lives near Monmouth, on the border with Wales.
In addition to Papua New Guinea, he participated in botanical scientific expeditions to the Congo (1959) and Turkey (1962, 1965).

José Ortiz Moya (1 September 1932 – 23 December 2013) was a Spanish comics artist, best known for several collaborations with Antonio Segura, such as the series Hombre.
Biography
José Ortiz was born in Cartagena, in the Region of Murcia.
His career began at an early age, winning an artistic tournament held by the Spanish magazine Chicos. After a period of making pocket sized comics, he created the series Sigur el Vikingo and Johnny Fogata in 1959, and Carolynn Baker for the English newspaper Daily Express in 1962.
Ortiz joined Warren Publishing in 1974 due to his connections with the Valencia studio of Selecciones Ilustradas. He would remain with Warren until 1983 and drew more stories for that company (approximately 120) than any other artist. His work included the series Apocalypse, Night of the Jackass and Coffin in Eerie, as well as Pantha in Vampirella and numerous stand alone stories. Ortiz would also draw Vampirella herself in issues 35 and 36 that title. He won the award for 'Best All Around Artist' at Warren in 1974.
Following this period in the U.S. comics industry making horror comics, he returned to Spain and formed a lasting and fertile working partnership with Antonio Segura in 1981, initiated by the serial publication of Hombre, a post-apocalyptic saga, in the magazine Cimoc.
By 1983, Ortiz and Segura joined with several other artists including Leopold Sánchez, Manfred Sommer and Jordi Bernet, to form the short-lived publishing house Metropol with the artists' interest in mind, responsible for three comics magazines, Metropol, Mocambo and KO cómics.
During the 1980s Ortiz also produced work for a number of British publications including The Tower King and The House of Daemon for Eagle and The Thirteenth Floor for Scream!. He then moved over to 2000 AD in 1984 where he contributed to a number of stories with most work on Rogue Trooper.
In addition to the continued run of Hombre, Ortiz and Segura created Ives and Las Mil Caras de Jack el Destripador (The Thousand Faces of Jack the Ripper) the following years, later renaming Ives to Morgan. In 1987, they began the humorous sci-fi series Burton & Cyb, followed in 1990 by the series Juan el Largo.
From 1993, Ortiz focused on the Italian comics market, illustrating stories for Tex Willer, Ken Parker and Magico Vento.
He died at Valencia on 23 December 2013.

"Burns' Heir" is the eighteenth episode of the fifth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 14, 1994. In the episode, Mr. Burns has a near-death experience that prompts him to find an heir to inherit his wealth after he dies. He chooses Bart as his heir because he admires the boy's malevolence. Marge convinces Bart to spend time with his benefactor, who allows his heir the money and freedom to do whatever he pleases. Soon Bart leaves his family to live with Burns instead.
The episode was written by Jace Richdale and directed by Mark Kirkland. "'Burns' Heir'" is Richdale's sole writing credit. David Silverman was originally set to direct the episode, but he was so swamped with his work as supervising director that it was reassigned to Kirkland.
Plot
Mr. Burns almost drowns while taking a bath after Smithers puts a sponge on his head, weighing down his puny body. Realizing that no one will carry on his legacy when he dies, Mr. Burns decides to find an heir to inherit his vast fortune. After years of devotion, Smithers thinks he should inherit his wealth. Burns believes he will receive a "far greater reward" by being buried alive with his boss to which Smithers agrees.
Burns auditions several boys for his heir, including Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse. Bart and Lisa also audition and fail: Burns disqualifies Lisa because she is a girl and Bart because he dislikes the poorly worded proposal Homer makes him read aloud, which isn't helped by Homer misspelling “Burns” as “Kurns” (and insisting that it is pronounced as such). The audition ends with Burns kicking him in the butt with a mechanical boot, much to Homer's amusement. Homer then tells both Bart and Lisa to "never try". Bart gets revenge by vandalizing his mansion. Burns is impressed by Bart's malevolence and accepts him as his heir, although he initially liked Nelson for a similar reason.
Homer and Marge sign a legal document that officially names Bart as Burns' heir. Marge suggests that Bart spend time with the lonely old man because he stands to inherit his fortune. Initially repelled by Burns' coldness, Bart warms to him after he promises to give him anything he wants. Soon Bart abandons his family because Burns allows him to do whatever he likes (including getting Krusty the Clown delivering him pizza while his show airs a rerun when Falkland islands were invaded). Bart's parents sue to get their son back, but after they hire Lionel Hutz as their lawyer, the court decides that Burns is "clearly the boy's biological father." The Simpsons hire a deprogrammer to kidnap Bart, but he abducts Hans Moleman by mistake and brainwashes him into thinking he is the Simpsons' son.
When Bart grows lonely and wants to go home, Burns tricks him into thinking his family no longer loves him by staging a fake video with actors portraying the Simpsons. Bart decides that Burns is his true father and they celebrate by randomly firing Springfield Nuclear Power Plant employees by dropping them through a trapdoor. Lenny is the first employee to suffer this fate, having been forced to defend his record as an employee without using the letter "E". When Homer enters the office (through tracking a trail of donuts), Burns tries to completely sever Bart's family ties by forcing him to fire his father. Instead, Bart "fires" Burns by dropping him through the trapdoor. Smithers quickly jumps into the shaft and implores his boss to "land on Leonard's carcass" to cushion his fall. Bart moves home after realizing that he loves his family.
Production
"Burns' Heir" was the first episode in which Jace Richdale received a writers' credit, although he was a part of the show's staff for several seasons. When he was starting out as a writer on the show, Richdale was told to come up with some story ideas and he came up with the basic plot off the top of his head. David Silverman was originally going to direct the episode, but he was so swamped with his work as supervising director that it was reassigned to Mark Kirkland. While the Simpsons are at a movie, there is a parody of the THX sound Deep Note. During that scene, a man's head explodes in a reference to the film Scanners. The THX executives liked the parody so much that the scene was made into an actual THX movie trailer, with the scene being redone for the widescreen aspect ratio.
A deleted scene from the episode sees Mr. Burns release a "Robotic Richard Simmons" as a way of getting rid of Homer, which dances to a recording of K.C. and the Sunshine Band's "Shake Your Booty". Simmons was originally asked to guest star; according to David Mirkin, he was "dying to do the show", but declined when he found out he would voice a robot. It was fully animated, but was cut from "Burns' Heir" because it often did not get a good reaction during table reads. According to Bill Oakley, there was a "significant division of opinion amongst the staff as to whether Richard Simmons was a target The Simpsons should make fun of" because it was "well-trod territory". They also felt it distracted viewers from the story. To the production staff's surprise, the scene would make the audience "erupt with laughter" when screened at animation conventions and college presentations, so they decided to insert it in the season seven clip show "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular".
Reception
Critical reception
The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that, "the episode lacks the emotional punch of others in which members of the family are separated."
DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode was "such a great concept that it's a surprise no [one] went for it earlier." He felt that it "occasionally veers on the edge of mushiness, but it avoids becoming too sentimental. It's a blast to see Burns' world from Bart's point of view. DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5 while DVD Verdict gave the episode a B.
Paul Campos of Rocky Mountain News described the Robotic Richard Simmons scene as "a level of surreal comedy that approaches a kind of genius".
Homer's quote, "Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try", was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in August 2007.
Ratings
In its original broadcast, "Burns' Heir" finished 53rd in ratings for the week of April 11–17, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 9.4, and was viewed in 8.85 million households. The show dropped four places in the rankings after finishing 49th the previous week. It was the third highest rated show on Fox that week following Living Single and Married... with Children.

The northwestern U.S. state of Washington's economy grew 3.7% in 2016, nearly two and a half times the national rate. Average income per head in 2009 was $41,751, 12th among states of the U.S.
The United States' largest concentration of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) workers reside in Washington state. The state has a large volume of seaborne foreign trade with Asia. Leading economic sectors are government, real estate and rental leasing, and information; manufacturing comes fourth (8.6% of the state's GDP). Fruit and vegetable production, and hydroelectric power, are other important sectors. Important firms based in Washington include Boeing, Starbucks, Amazon, Costco, and Microsoft.
Washington does not levy a personal income tax, but raises revenue through sales tax, property tax, and a gross receipts tax on businesses.
Taxes
The state of Washington is one of only seven states that does not levy a personal income tax. The state also does not collect a corporate income tax or franchise tax. However, Washington businesses are responsible for various other state levies. One tax Washington charges on most businesses is the business and occupation tax (B & O), a gross receipts tax which charges varying rates for different types of businesses.
Washington's state base sales tax is 6.5 percent which is combined with a local sales tax which varies by locality. The combined state and local retail sales tax rates increase the taxes paid by consumers, depending on the variable local sales tax rates, generally between 7.5 and 10 percent. As of March 2017, the combined sales tax rate in Seattle and Tacoma was 10.1 percent. The cities of Lynnwood and Mill Creek have the highest sale tax rate in the state at 10.4 percent. These taxes apply to services as well as products. Most foods are exempt from sales tax; however, prepared foods, dietary supplements and soft drinks remain taxable.
An "ex" applies to certain select products such as gasoline, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. Property tax was the first tax levied in the state of Washington and its collection accounts for about 30% of Washington's total state and local revenue. It continues to be the most important revenue source for public schools, fire protection, libraries, parks and recreation, and other special-purpose districts.
All real property and personal property is subject to tax unless specifically exempted by law. Personal property also is taxed, although most personal property owned by individuals is exempt. Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on assets such as bank accounts, stocks or bonds. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes; however, the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax.
Personal income
The per capita personal income in 2009 was $41,751, 12th in the nation.
Several notable billionaires, including Jeff Bezos, former Chairman & CEO of Amazon, and Bill Gates, technology advisor and former Chairman & CEO of Microsoft, live in the state. Other state billionaires include Steve Ballmer (Microsoft), Craig McCaw (McCaw Cellular Communications), James Jannard (Oakley), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), and Charles Simonyi (Microsoft).
Trade
Significant amounts of trade with Asia pass through the ports of the Puget Sound. Washington is the fourth largest exporting state in the United States, after New York, California, and Texas.
The ports of Washington handle 8% of all American exports and receive 6% of the nation's imports.
Industries
Washington industries by GDP value added 2011
Manufacturing and commercial
Key businesses within the state include the design and manufacture of jet aircraft (Boeing), computer software development (Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Valve), online retailers (Amazon, Expedia, Inc.), electronics, biotechnology, aluminum production, lumber and wood products (Weyerhaeuser), mining, and tourism.
A Fortune magazine survey of the top 20 most admired companies in the US included four Washington-based companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Costco and Nordstrom.
Washington was one of eighteen states which had a government monopoly on sales of alcoholic beverages, although beer and wine with less than 20% alcohol by volume could be purchased in convenience stores and supermarkets. Liqueurs (even if under 20% alcohol by volume) and spirits could only be purchased in state-run or privately owned-state-contracted liquor stores. This however was overturned by 2011's Initiative 1183 which ceased state-run liquor stores as of June 1, 2012.
Agriculture
Washington is a leading agricultural state. (The following figures are from the Washington State Office of Financial Management and the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Washington Field Office). For 2003, the total value of Washington's agricultural products was $5.79 billion, the 11th highest in the country. The total value of its crops was $3.8 billion, the 7th highest. The total value of its livestock and specialty products was $1.5 billion, the 26th highest. In 2010, the total value of the crops was $7.93 billion.
In 2004, Washington ranked first in the nation in production of red raspberries (90.0% of total U.S. production), wrinkled seed peas (80.6%), hops (75.0%), spearmint oil (73.6%), apples (58.1%), sweet cherries (47.3%), pears (42.6%), peppermint oil (40.3%), Concord grapes (39.3%), carrots for processing (36.8%), and Niagara grapes (31.6%). Washington also ranked second in the nation in production of lentils, fall potatoes, dry edible peas, apricots, grapes (all varieties taken together), asparagus (over a third of the nation's production), sweet corn for processing, and green peas for processing; third in tart cherries, prunes and plums, and dry summer onions; fourth in barley and trout; and fifth in wheat, cranberries, and strawberries.
Apples
The apple industry is of particular importance to Washington. Because of the favorable climate of dry, warm summers and cold winters of central Washington, the state has led the U.S. in apple production since the 1920s. Two areas account for the vast majority of the state's apple crop: the Wenatchee–Okanogan region (comprising Chelan, Okanogan, Douglas, and Grant counties), and the Yakima region (Yakima, Benton and Kittitas counties).
is a major apple disease here. SDHIs are commonly used, especially boscalid, which has produced a resistance problem. Yin et al., 2011 provides a molecular diagnostic for a particularly common succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutation. Using their own test they also noticed that SDH alone did not entirely determine SDHI resistance, indicating that other factors than the exact nucleotide sequence of this one enzyme are involved in the resistance problem here.
Apple maggots are such a problem here that the state has erected the Apple Maggot Quarantine Area between the west and the east.
Fuji is the most grown cultivar here.
The Washington Apple Commission regulates the industry.
Energy
Washington is the leading producer of hydroelectric power in the U.S. Hydroelectricity makes up over half of electricity state's electric generation and nearly 35% of its total energy consumption.
Employment

Real estate
At $43 billion, real estate and rental leasing forms 12.14% of total GDP in Washington. (see above)
On December 4, 2016 Bloomberg
compared the cost of housing
between Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle. There has been a 50 per cent increase in home prices in Seattle in the past five years, but the median home value is still less than in San Francisco and Los Angeles. As in Vancouver some of the increase in home prices is attributed to Chinese investors. On December 9, 2016, The Seattle Times mentioned proposed legislation to allow more and larger mother-in-law apartments and backyard cottages in neighborhoods zoned for single-family houses in Seattle.

Nassarius gayii is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Nassariidae, the Nassa mud snails or dog whelks.
Description
The length of the shell varies between 14 mm and 17 mm.
The small, pretty thick shell is elongated and conical. It is formed of six distinct, slightly convex whorls. The surface of the upper whorls appears to be shagreened by very small tubercles, formed by a multitude of very approximate longitudinal folds and transverse striae. Upon the lowest whorls the longitudinal folds disappear, and the transverse striae, on the contrary, become more apparent. The simple suture is accompanied by a small, very narrow scaffolding, formed by a row of granulations, a little larger, and like papillae. The whitish aperture is subrotund. The outer lip is smooth at its edge, and striated internally. The columella is arcuated and smooth. The general color of this shell is of a uniform red brown.
Distribution
This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean from Peru to the Strait of Magellan

Genderen is a village in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is located in the municipality of Altena.
The village was first mentioned in the late-11th century Ganderon, and means "settlement on the Gander River". Genderen is a stretch out village which developed in the Middle Ages along the Bergse Maas and was part of the Land van Altena.
The Dutch Reformed church dated from the 13th century, but was destroyed in 1944 during World War II. It was rebuilt in 1953, but the tower was constructed from the ruins of the medieval church.
Genderen was home to 499 people in 1840. Genderen was a separate municipality until 1923, when it was merged with Eethen. Before 1908, the name of the municipality was Heesbeen, Eethen en Genderen.

Plot
Sarah is a shy, introverted young woman who lives a quiet life and works at a crafts store. In her spare time she visits the grave of her mother, who died by suicide the year before. She also frequents the horse stable where her former horse Willow is boarded, and where she rode in her childhood; Sarah's recurrent visits visibly annoy the owners. On her birthday, she makes a feeble attempt to ask her Zumba class instructor to go out with her but fails to make her point. When her roommate Nikki finds Sarah home alone on her birthday, she invites Darren, her boyfriend Brian's roommate, over for a double date. The four smoke marijuana and have drinks. Sarah listens eagerly as Darren reveals details about himself and his past relationship, but the date is interrupted by Sarah getting a nose bleed. After Darren leaves, Sarah has a bizarre dream in which she is lying in a white room with a man and woman also lying down some distance away from her, unaware of their surroundings.
The following morning, Nikki awakens to find Sarah sleeping on the living room floor and large scratch marks running across the wall. Darren returns to the apartment to retrieve his car and asks Sarah on a date. At work, Sarah has another nose bleed. While recovering, she recognizes a man walking outside who resembles the one from her dream. Later, Sarah spends an afternoon with her childhood friend Heather who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a riding accident causing her to have recurrent seizures and short term memory loss.
A series of bizarre incidents soon befall Sarah. While driving home, Sarah stops at a red light near a water facility then finds herself in her kitchen with the tap running, unable to account for the elapsed time. She hears a woman talking indistinctly in another room when no one is home. She finds her car has been stolen from her apartment's garage.
Gary, Sarah's wealthy stepfather, notifies her the car has appeared at a tow yard as the registration is still in his name. He brings Sarah to retrieve it, and the tow driver informs them the car was abandoned near a water facility in the middle of the road.
Later, Sarah apparently sleepwalks out of her apartment and awakens standing on a sidewalk with an unexplained time loss. Her boss, Joan, suggests that Sarah visit a doctor given Sarah's familial history of mental health problems.
Sarah becomes convinced she is experiencing alien abductions and might be a clone, the latter triggered by a subplot in Purgatory, a fantasy television series Sarah watches regularly. Due to her striking resemblance to her deceased grandmother, Sarah worries she may be a clone of her. Meanwhile, she tracks the man from her dream, Ron, to a plumbing store that he owns. While on a date with Darren, Sarah manically confides her belief that she is a clone and has him drive her to her mother's grave to dig her up and retrieve her DNA. When Darren becomes disturbed, Sarah accuses him of plotting against her, and threatens him with scissors, forcing him to leave her there.
After Sarah strips nude at work having imagined that she was inside the shower, she is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. There, she recognizes another patient as the woman from her dream; when Sarah describes it, the woman reveals that they share similar elements in their dreams, such as an alien ramp in the middle of the ocean. Sarah takes this as confirmation of her belief that they are both alien abductees and soon joyfully tells her social worker that she is not delusional. Despite the social worker's reservations, Sarah is discharged after 72 hours in the hospital.
At home, Sarah dresses in her grandmother's dress. She covertly steals Willow from the stable and walks with her into the woods. In a clearing, Sarah stops and lies on the ground. Moments later, a spaceship appears; she levitates toward the sky and disappears.

Sam Roland Heughan (; born 30 April 1980) is a Scottish actor, producer, author, and entrepreneur. He is best known for his starring role as Jamie Fraser in the Starz drama series Outlander (2014–present) for which he has won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable Sci-Fi/Fantasy TV Actor and the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television, and received a nomination for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series.
Heughan has also starred in films such as the spy comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018), The Empty Train, and the superhero action film Bloodshot (2020). Among his numerous plays he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Most Promising Performer for his performance in Outlying Islands performed at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs.
Heughan and his Outlander co-star Graham McTavish co-wrote Clanlands: Whisky, Warfare, and a Scottish Adventure Like No Other which reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller List for hardcover nonfiction, and combined print and e-book nonfiction in November 2020. The same year Heughan launched his own whisky brand, The Sassenach (named after his Outlander character's nickname for his wife, Claire), winning consecutive double golds in the 2020 and 2021 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.
Education and early life
Sam Roland Heughan was born on 30 April 1980 in the historic county of Dumfries and Galloway. His parents had been part of a hippie community in London called Gandalf's Garden which was heavily influenced by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien inspiring them to name Heughan and his older brother after characters from The Lord of the Rings. Sam's mother, Chrissie Heughan, an artist and artisan papermaker struggled to raise the two brothers after their father left when they were both young.
Aged five, Heughan moved from Balmaclellan to nearby New Galloway where he attended Kells Primary School. During this time he lived in converted stables in the grounds of Kenmure Castle. Moving to Edinburgh at age twelve he attended James Gillespie's High School for a year and then the Edinburgh Rudolf Steiner School until the end of the sixth year.

While still a student Heughan appeared in Outlying Islands, a play by Scottish playwright David Greig. The play premiered at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh before moving to the Royal Court Theatre in London. Heughan was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Most Promising Performer for his performance.
In 2004 Heughan appeared in his first professional television role in the miniseries Island at War, a WWII drama about the German occupation of the Channel Islands. The following year he appeared in several episodes of the Scottish soap opera River City and portrayed adulterous husband Pony William in David Harrower's play Knives in Hens at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow. Between 2006 and 2009 Heughan appeared in a number of made-for-television films and miniseries including BBC and PBS's collaborative miniseries The Wild West (2006), Channel 4's docudrama, A Very British Sex Scandal (2007), and BBC Four's Breaking the Mould (2009). During that time he also made appearances in a number of television series, including an episode of ITV's Midsomer Murders, ITV's crime drama Rebus, and two episodes of BBC's political drama Party Animals. Between 2007 and 2009 Heughan made appearances in several live productions, including Noël Coward's The Vortex at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Citizen's Theatre, Iain F. MacLeod's The Pearlfishers at the Traverse Theatre, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet at the Dundee Repertory Theatre, Macbeth at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, and Nicholas de Jongh's Plague Over England at the Duchess Theatre.

In 2012, he performed the title role in Shakepeare's King John at the Òran Mór Theatre.
In 2013, Heughan was cast as Jamie Fraser in the Starz time-travel drama series Outlander. He was the first cast member officially announced, to great praise by the author of the series, Diana Gabaldon, who said, "That man is a Scot to the bone and Jamie Fraser to the heart. Having seen Sam Heughan not just act, but be Jamie, I feel immensely grateful to the production team for their painstaking attention to the soul of the story and characters." The role is recurring, with Heughan reprising the character of Jamie Fraser in seasons one (which premiered in 2014) through five and the upcoming season six.

Bloodshot premiered in March 2020. In November 2018, Heughan was cast as Tom Buckingham, the lead role in SAS: Red Notice, a film based on the novel of the same name by Andy McNab.
In 2019, it was announced that Heughan would play Paul Newman in To Olivia, a biopic about Patricia Neal and Roald Dahl starring Keeley Hawes and Hugh Bonneville. In 2020, Heughan was cast as Henry in the Regency-era romantic comedy Mr. Malcom's List, based on a book of the same name by Suzanne Allain. Heughan was also cast alongside Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Celine Dion in the romantic drama Text for You, a remake of the German film SMS Fur Dich.
In addition to acting Heughan served as the first Global Brand Ambassador for the English clothing label Barbour beginning in 2016. He released several collections since his initial autumn/winter line in 2017, all of which he co-designed.

The book became a bestseller, reaching No. 1 on the New York Times' Best Seller Lists for hardcover nonfiction and for combined print and e-book nonfiction and #1 on the Publishers Weekly Bestseller List for hardcover nonfiction, among other lists. Clanlands serves as a companion to Men in Kilts: A Roadtrip With Sam and Graham, an eight-part television series conceived by and starring Heughan and McTavish that premiered on the Starz channel in February 2021.
Also in 2020, Heughan launched his own whisky brand, The Sassenach, through the Great Glen Company, which he founded. The Sassenach is available in the UK and select US states and earned a double gold medal at the 2020 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.
To Olivia premiered on February 19, 2021 in the United Kingdom, via Sky Cinema. The film's North American distribution rights were acquired by Vertical Entertainment, and was released in the United States on April 15, 2022. The film received mixed reviews.
Another film starring Heughan, SAS: Red Notice, a British action thriller based on the novel of the same name by Andy McNab, was released the same year. The film premiered in the United Kingdom on March 12, 2021 via Sky Cinema. Vertical Entertainment and Redbox Entertainment released the film in the United States on March 16, 2021. The film was retitled SAS: Rise of the Black Swan on Netflix to avoid confusion with the Netflix-produced film Red Notice, which was also released in 2021. The film received mostly positive to mixed reviews.
Heughen has wrapped up filming of the romantic drama It's All Coming Back to Me (previously titled Text For You), as of early 2021, in which he will star alongside Priyanka Chopra and Celine Dion. The film is an English-language remake of the 2016 German film SMS für Dich, itself based on the 2009 novel of the same name by Sofie Cramer. The film is scheduled to be released theatrically on February 10, 2023, by Sony Pictures Releasing.
Political views and philanthropy
Heughan was a vocal supporter of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom during the 2014 independence referendum, going on record as saying, "I was a no and thought independence wasn't a good idea initially, but then I did a 180 and towards the end became quite vocal in the Yes campaign. I thought that ultimately it was a move towards more democracy for the people of Scotland."
Heughan credits much of his early success to his participation in youth theatre and, in August 2014, became a patron for Youth Theatre Arts Scotland. Of his position as patron, he has said, "I think that what I'd like to instill is that if you join the youth theatre, it's a gateway into greater career prospects." He supports the charitable organisation's mission 'to transform lives through youth theatre by providing inspiring participatory opportunities for young people in Scotland.'
In 2015, Heughan started the organisation My Peak Challenge, a training, nutrition, and support programme that provides participants with a sense of community as they work towards personal goals, while concurrently raising money for charity. The foundation has partnered with Leukemia Lymphoma Research, Bear Strength Clothing and Fight Camp Glasgow to raise funds for cancer research. In 2019, Heughan teamed up with Omaze, raffling off a date to the 2019 MPC Gala, which raised $2,892,080 for Bloodwise UK.
In September 2016, Heughan partook in the Great North Run to raise funds for Bloodwise, which he has supported since 2011, and became president of Scotland Bloodwise.
In 2018, he ran both the Stirling and EMF Edinburgh Marathons in the space of a month to raise money for Cahonas Scotland and their Testicular Cancer Education and Awareness Programme. He raised £38,224 for the charity.

Henry Cronjager Jr (1906-1991) was an American cinematographer who worked both in the film and television industries from the 1930s until the 1970s. He was the son of Henry Cronjager, brother to Edward Cronjager, and father to William Cronjager, all also cinematographers. Due to the similarity in names with his father, there is some confusion as to exactly when the senior Cronjager's career ended, and the younger one's began. Both were active during the 1930s, however the American Film Institute's entry for Henry Cronjager conflates the careers of the two cinematographers, while Imdb.com as the senior's career ending in 1933. The first reliable source wherein it shows that Cronjager Jr. was the cameraman and not his father is a Walter Winchell column from February 26, 1937, which shows that Cronjager Jr. was a cameraman on the film Wake Up and Live, for which his brother Edward was the cinematographer.
He worked as cameraman for films in the 1930s, 40s and into the 50s, working on such films as 1938's Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, 1941s Western Union, 1945's Nob Hill, 1948's An Innocent Affair, and 1950's The Capture. By the late 1950s he was being credited as the cinematographer on productions, and began to transition into television, although he did occasionally still work on films such as Squad Car and Hands of a Stranger. Some of his television credits include The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, The Jack Benny Program, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Joey Bishop Show, The Mothers-in-Law, and The Guns of Will Sonnett. His last credit was as the Director of Photography in 1972–73 on The Paul Lynde Show.

The cervical spinal nerve 1 (C1) is a spinal nerve of the cervical segment. C1 carries predominantly motor fibres, but also a small meningeal branch that supplies sensation to parts of the dura around the foramen magnum (via dorsal rami).
It originates from the spinal column from above the cervical vertebra 1 (C1).
The dorsal root and ganglion of the first cervical nerve may be rudimentary or entirely absent.
Muscles innervated by this nerve are:
Geniohyoid muscle- through Hypoglossal nerve
Rectus capitis anterior muscle
Longus capitis muscle (partly)
Rectus capitis lateralis muscle
Splenius cervicis muscle (partly)
Rectus capitis posterior major muscle
levator scapulae muscle (partly)

KOGN (1490 AM) is a radio station which is currently silent, but previously broadcast a Regional Mexican format. Licensed to Ogden, Utah, United States, the station serves the Ogden area. The station is owned by Radio Positiva Inc.The station was an affiliate of Dial Global's adult standard format. KOGN's signal was also simulcast on nearby KNFL 1470 kHz in Tremonton, Utah. The station was silent for quite some time beginning in 2009. In 2010, the station returned to air with a regional Mexican format. KNFL is no longer simulcasting KOGN, and had its license cancelled by the FCC in 2012.
History
The station was built by pioneer Utah broadcaster Arch Webb in April 1948 with call sign KVOG – the "Voice of Ogden" and subsequently changed to KJQN on December 1, 1978, and again on June 28, 1993, to KJOE. The radio station and its FM counterpart was acquired by the Bible Broadcasting Network from U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2004. The station went to non-commercial status and the call sign changed on May 16, 1994, to KYFO. KYFO aired primarily religious programming. The station was then sold to AM Radio 1490, Inc. in 2005, and changed to the call sign KOGN on May 1, 2006.
On May 29, 2009, The Fifth District Court of Utah in Washington County appointed a receiver to take over KOGN. This was done for US Capital, Incorporated of Boulder, Colorado, an investment group which foreclosed on Legecy Media, the owners of KOGN and several other stations. The receiver sold the station to Familia Broadcasting, LLC of Salt Lake City in a court-approved sale, at a price of $25,000; the purchase was consummated on May 31, 2013. On September 10, 2021, Positiva Radio Inc. agreed to purchase KOGN from Familia Broadcasting LLC.On December 20, 2021, KOGN ceased broadcasting. The transmitter site in Ogden has been sold, and the station's current status is unknown. Former KVOG and KJQN DJ Bill Allred reports that the KOGN studio building has recently been demolished.On July 22, 2022, Familia Broadcasting LLC consummated the sale of KOGN to Positiva Radio Inc.

The Tapandegan (Palpitaters in Persian) is an Iranian hacker group known for hacking twice the arrival and departure monitors at two major international airports in Iran (Mashhad and Tabriz) on May 24, 2018 and June 6, 2018 respectively, posting anti-government messages and images, forcing the airports' authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one.
The Tapandegan refers to its acts as an act of protest demanding from the Iranian leadership to improve the economy and to stop ignoring the demands of the Iranian people. News agencies categorized this group's acts as “a new form of protest in Iran.”
History
The Tapandegan first appeared publicly on May 24, 2018 when they hacked the arrival and departure monitors at Mashhad International Airport and on June 6, 2018 when they also hacked the arrival and departure monitors at Tabriz International Airport. The group posted anti-government messages and images, forcing the airports' authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one. Airport officials in both cities turned off the sign boards for several hours after the hacking and made apologetic public statements.
The Iranian authorities confirmed both cyber-attacks shortly after they took place and they were widely reported by the Iranian official press and the international newswires and agencies.
Name and alias
The group's name is in the Persian language meaning Palpitaters. Based on the messages they posted on those hacked monitors, the news sources noted that the group supports the national protests of the people in Iran demanding economic improvements.
Iran has seen frequent nationwide protests this year by demonstrators angered by local and national officials and business leaders who they accuse of corruption and oppression. The two anti-government hacks at Iranian airports are the only incidents of their kind since the protests began in late December.
Hacking history
Hacking attacks in Iran have been on the rise recently. In August 2016, Internet security experts warned that hackers have found access to banking and contact details of millions of Iranians by hacking into their Telegram accounts. However, it is not yet clear whether this was a genuine warning or an attempt by hardliners in the Iranian government to convince people to leave Telegram and migrate to home-grown messaging services, where the government has easy access to users' private information and can intercept their communications.
First hack: The Mashhad International Airport
According to The Associated Press' report from Tehran, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported that The Tapandegan “managed to interrupt routine broadcasts on monitors” at the Mashhad International Airport on Thursday evening, May 24, 2018, “replacing them with images of anti-government protests from January [2018]”“for several hours.”
Sources report that according to a statement posted by the hackers on the monitors, the group protested to “wasting Iranians lives and financial resources in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).” The message posted on sign boards also protested against the IRGC's presence in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region. The group also hacked the email of Mashhad airport civil aviation head, Mohsen Eidizadeh and sent the news of its hack from his account.
Mashhad is the city where massive anti-government demonstrations started on December 28 and spread to over 100 other Iranians cities. It is a religious city where the holy shrine of the 8th Shiite Imam is located. Local authorities and clerics in the city are among the staunchest hardliners. The group expressed support for the people of Kazeroon, a city in Fars Province, where people have been demonstrating against the state of months.
Second hack: The Tabriz International Airport
According to The Associated Press' report from Tehran, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported that on June 6, 2018, the hackers “have disrupted the arrival and departure monitors in the Tabriz international airport in the country's northwest.” The hackers defaced sign boards in the evening, showing a protest message against “wasting Iranians' resources" and expressing support for Iranian truckers who have been on strike across Iran for several weeks.
Iranian truck drivers went on strike for more than a week beginning May 22 in several parts of Iran, using social media to mobilize and share images of themselves protesting low wages and rising business costs.
The Iranian state-run site, Young Journalists' Club (YJC), “quoted Tabriz Governor Aliyar Rastgoo as saying the incident happened Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. local time.” A Tabriz airport official Mostafa Safaei confirmed the day after the cyber-attack that the monitors turned off following the hack and engineers quickly restored the system, and the incident was under investigation.
Translation of the message posted by the hackers on the monitors in Persian reads:
Attention, attention. We, Tapandegan, in another protest action, are currently taking control of the computer systems of this airport. Two weeks ago, in protest against the wastage of the Iranian people's money and lives by (Iran's) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, we took control of the computer systems in Mashhad airport. Today, by voicing our support for Iranian strikers, we are doing the same thing. Until when will this regime deprive people of their rights to have a better livelihood and economic situation?! Until when?! We will not choke off our voices. We will continue these actions. If you support us, take a photo of this and share it
The Tapandegan assumed responsibility for the hacking in a tweet on June 7.
News of the hacking broke almost immediately on social media as Iranians posted tweets and pictures of the incident. However, the posts came under pseudonyms as users inside Iran fear a heavy-handed clampdown by the government.
Sources report that The Tapandegan sent an email to Iranian journalists saying, “Two weeks ago, we took over the computer systems of Mashhad Airport in support of the national protests. We protested against wasting Iranian lives and assets by IRGC [The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. And, today, we support the truck drivers, the bazar, and the strikers”.
Third Attack: Hacking into the Islamic Republic International Broadcasting (IRIB) and the Iranian Embassy in Berlin
Chief of Iran's cyber police, Seyed Kamal Hadianfar, claimed that the hackers who attacked Mashhad and Tabriz airports have been identified and arrested. According to a report by AsiaOnline, on January 17, 2019, the Tapandegan hacked allegedly into IRIB's computer systems, including IRIB's director Mr. Asgari, his deputy Mr. Abutalebi, and IRIB's political news director Mr. Seyyed Mehdi, and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin Mr. Zamani, and sent out emails and SMS through them to IRIB's employees, the Majlis speaker Ali Larijani and other Majlis members, as well as journalists. This email, according to this report, claims that top secret information is leaked regarding the transfer of two Trillion Touman each year in USD, double to Iran's Foreign Ministry annual budget, by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to the Lebanese Hizballah, via his advisor Shirkhodaei, his special team, and the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. The group claims that they got hold of documents related to this information while hacking into IRIB's computer systems and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin. Tapandegan blamed Zarif for money laundering while he himself had been accusing other offices in Iran of money laundering. AsiaOnline.ir published the entire email allegedly sent by The Tapandegan.
Documents Exposed
This group hacked the emails of the Islamic Republic's authorities. They hacked Tehran Municipality's Gmail account, and this way entered the Municipality's Twitter and Instagram accounts, and sent an email through the municipality's email system to the members of the Iranian Parliament Majlis including the Speaker Ali Larijani, Ali Motahari, Mahmoud-Sadeghi and ten other Majlis members, complained concerning the economic mismanagement and absence of social justice, and asked for the trial of the corrupt individuals and for putting an end to the rampant corruption in the country. The Tapandegan calls to stop corruption by the Iranian leadership through exposing allegedly top-secret related information received from insiders and whistleblowers. August 2, 2018, the Tapadengan exposed a letter received from a whistleblower, which claimed that ministries and IRGC have been ignoring the direct order, by Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei to limit and downsize IRGC's involvement and control over the private sector and the economy. The leaked information included names of IRGC's subsidiaries, which operated as private companies. August 20, 2018: The Tapandegan exposed a top secret document, which was leaked to the group, regarding the purchase of a 5-star-hotel in the city of Mashhad for a price of US$28 million for the vacation of IRGC officers. The purchase was taking place in 2018 as the national protests broke out throughout Iran protesting the deteriorating economic conditions.
In a video posted on YouTube, The Tapandegan released information concerning its claimed infiltration to Iran's computer systems and claimed that it has hacked the email accounts of senior managers and employees of all the airports in the country. Documents released by the group show that Iranian authorities are concerned about Tapandegan's ability to hack the computer systems of the government agencies, financial institutions, and the military and "called upon the relevant responsible personnel to check them out quickly.

Zhang Enhua (; 28 April 1973 – 29 April 2021) was a Chinese professional football player and coach.
As a player, he was a defender from 1994 to 2006 and represented Dalian Wanda FC, Grimsby Town, Tianjin Teda and South China while internationally he was a participant at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
Club career
Dalian Wanda
Zhang Enhua began his professional football career when he joined his local native Chinese football team Dalian Wanda FC at the beginning of the 1994 league season. At the club, he would gradually establish himself in defence and help it win the league title. With Dalian he would establish himself as an integral member of their defence the following season, however they were unable to retain the league title and came third within the league. Nevertheless, the following season would see Zhang Enhua help Dalian stamp their dominance within the league and for the next three seasons they would win consecutive league titles.
Grimsby Town
In 2000, Zhang was made a transfer target of second tier English club Grimsby Town and was then brought to the club on a 3-month loan deal to play in the Football League Championship. The defender would be part of a new wave of foreign imports at the club as newly installed manager Lennie Lawrence brought in David Nielsen, Knut Anders Fostervold and Menno Willems. Enhua was originally sent in as cover for the injured Peter Handyside, and after a nervous first game, he settled into life at Grimsby, even scoring three times for the club. Lawrence admitted talking to the club over a possible deal being made more permanent but his wages were too big for the club, and Enhua departed the club after his loan spell. He is still regarded as a minor cult hero amongst Grimsby supporters, who took very well to the player while he played in England. His goal celebration in the 1–0 victory over Burnley was used by ITV Yorkshire Television in the opening credits for their "Goals on Sunday" television programme throughout the 2001–02 season.
Return to China
Zhang returned to China to play for Dalian Wanda (who had renamed themselves Dalian Shide) once more in time to help win another league title and would also be named in the Chinese squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Following his departure from Dalian in 2003, Zhang went on to play for Tianjin Teda F.C. for several seasons before joining Hong Kong football team South China in 2005 to extend his football career.
International career
Zhang Enhua would make his international debut against South Korea in a 0–0 draw on 19 February 1995 in the Dynasty Cup. After several further friendlies his performances would be impressive enough to see him included in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup squad, however, while he would score his debut goal for his country against Saudi Arabia in the quarter-finals he would, unfortunately, see his team lose 4–3 and get knocked out of the competition. A firm member of the national team he would play a large part in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) campaign that saw China narrowly miss out on a World Cup spot. He was, however, able to help China qualify for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup and while he started in the early stages he would miss the knock out stages of the competition and only play in the Third place play-off game which China lost 1–0.
On 19 May 2002, Zhang was included in China's 23-man squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but eventually did not make an appearance in the tournament as China was knocked out in the group stage.
International goals
Coaching career
Enhua retired in 2006 and took up coaching in Hong Kong. On 2 March 2011 it was announced that Enhua would be returning to England to complete his coaching badges with the Football Association, and that he would return to former club Grimsby Town as a special guest for the club's home fixture with AFC Wimbledon on 5 March.
Upon his return to Grimsby he presented the club with a gift that included Chinese writing which translated into 'it might be a long road back, but you can do it and will achieve success eventually'. He also described his visit to the club as a homecoming.
Death
Enhua died on 29 April 2021, one day after his 48th birthday. The cause of his death was reported to be cardiac arrest led by excessive drinking during his birthday party.

Anna Zippel, also spelled as Sippel or Sippela (died 29 April 1676), was an alleged Swedish witch, one of the most famous ones of the Katarina witch trials in Stockholm during the Swedish witch mania "Det stora Oväsendet" ("The Great Noise") of 1668–1676; She was called "The Queen of Blockula", and together with her sister Brita Zippel the most famous witch in Swedish history, famed for her proud defense.
Together with her sister, Brita Zippel, and her friend and business partner Anna Månsdotter, she was the first woman in Stockholm to be accused of abducting children to Witches' Sabbath of Satan in Blockula.
Background
Anna Zippel was a wealthy middle-class woman. Her brothers were sports instructors at the royal court, and her husband Bengt Bråk owned several bakeries, properties, and a mill. She sold medicines made by her close friend, the independent and attractive hatmaker, Anna Månsdotter. She supported her impoverished sister Brita Zippel, even though they were not close. Unlike her sister Brita Zippel, she was a respected and dignified woman. She had a place in high society and, according to witnesses, was on friendly terms with the mayor Thegnérs wife, the wife of the city-captain, Margareta Remmer, and madame de la Vallée, wife of the famed architect Jean de la Vallée of the Royal house. Aware that accusations of sorcery were not accepted against members of the upper-classes, Anna would later state this in the trial against her.
Anna was described as a tall, proud woman with elegant posture, and she seems to have been interested in fashion. The children described her as the "Queen of Blåkulla", dressed in expensive clothing, in diamonds, a train, and with her hair in curls. Teenage girls claimed she had dressed them for marriage to the Devil in Hell.
It is possible she was accused because of her sister and her friend. Her sister, Brita, had been accused of sorcery twice before, and her friend, Anna Månsdotter was called "Vipp-upp-med-näsan" ("Up-with-the-nose") because of her provocative confidence, disregard of gossip and public opinion, and her business selling medicines to wealthy people. Anna Månsdotter also had taught Anna Zippel's daughters to sew.
Accused
A child pointed her out in the street, screaming "She was the one who took me to the Devil!" before fainting. People claimed her medicine was really magical potions. Her former maid came forth with a litany of claims: Zippel sent her on mysterious missions in the middle of the night, Zippel met with Anna Månsdotter in her room in the night, the Devil filled Zippel's basement with money regularly, the ghost of a dog guarded her garden, and she bathed every time she made medicine. The maid also accused Zippel of asking for the first blood of her menstruation, telling her to smear her body with it and use it to write a name on her forehead. The maid also claimed she had been sick for three years after leaving Zippel's employment. Anna Zippel's husband was also accused to have abducted children to Blåkulla.
When the children of her sister and herself were questioned, they claimed she had taken them to the Sabbath of Satan. Her sister's children were even more eager to point at her than at their mother, saying that she took them to the Devil when their mother was indisposed. Zippel's friend, Anna Månsdotter, was also accused of abducting children, and of scraping the gold of the church bells on her way to Blåkulla. Anna Zippel was considered a very powerful witch. When she was taken to jail, she spat at a man who shouted at her and he fell dead. A caretaker at the jail who looked her in the face died as well.
Trial
Anna Zippel behaved with great dignity during the trial, defending herself with fearlessness and confidence. Fifty witnesses testified against her. She stated that she and her husband had made their wealth with hard work and companionship, and that she and her friend Anna Månsdotter had great skill in making medicine. She said she was proud of the way she treated her children and her servants, and that people had come with these allegations because of jealousy. She said it did not matter how many people testified against her—she was still innocent—and even if all the priests and bishops in the kingdom testified against her, it would not change that fact.
She refused all accusations made against her, her sister, and her friend, calling them accusations made of evil and aggression. When the three women were sentenced to be decapitated and burned at the stake, she replied, "Well! I am still innocent! God forgive you for the verdict you just made!"
Execution
During the execution, Anna seemed to have lost all will to fight. Unlike her sister, Brita Zippel, who fought every step of the way and drew a lot of attention when brought forward, Anna was described as completely numb, as if unaware of what happened. She was taken last. She said nothing, did not listen to the priests and did not even move. The executioner's helpers lead [led] her up to the platform as if she were a doll. On the platform, her head was cut off, her corpse was nailed to a ladder, and the ladder dropped on the stake.

Human Story 3 is a studio album by American electronic musician James Ferraro, self-released on June 14, 2016. Displaying a turn towards the style and aesthetic of modern classical, the album garnered critical acclaim and landed at number seven on Tiny Mix Tapes' year-end list of the best albums of 2016.
Composition and concept
Human Story 3 conceptually and, by its ambiguous narrative, revolves around a "smart planet" where service robots, performed by text-to-speech voices, attempt to cognitively interpret the world around them but are at the same time musically shown as still performing repetitive tasks. The aim and moral of the record is that while technology can do a lot of commands that are beneficial, it ends up only being used less usefully for commerce and, as a result, the technology may eventually end up subverting humanness. The word salads in the titles of cuts such as "Immanent Cloud," "Security Broker," or "Plastic Ocean" cause the meaning of symbols to be changed, much like how marketers alter the meaning of some objects to create what Ferraro described as strange and "contradictory" products.
The text-to-speech voices often display slight mispronunciations, which give the album a surrealistic feel regarding how technology sometimes fails to replicate human cognition. As Ferraro said, "Certain newer apps tend to bring people together – in a mechanical, artificial way – in shared space. I think that's probably the trend, post- this hyper-individual era. So it's obviously going to be unnatural if it's being manipulated through a third party like that—a bit alien." Human Story 3 follows several text-to-speech characters, male and female voices, that repeat brand names, buzzwords and phrases like "IKEA," "GPS," "Starbucks," "market crash," "mobile payments," "FedEx," "smart car" and "latte" at musical swells and crescendos, along with detailed speeches. Mehan Jayasuriya of Pitchfork wrote that this dialogue feels "like a torrent of audio pop-ups that can't be blocked."
Inspirations
The name of Human Story 3 is a play on the title of the Pixar film Toy Story 3 (2010). Ferraro named the album, given that the company's works were the "mimesis of our reality." He said, "we aggressively celebrate Pixar's cloud-like performance of human emotion, building emotional relationships with CGI characters and accepting them as powerful vehicles of meaningfulness. I personally see them as a marker of the hyper-individualistic age we live in."
The instrumental backing often moves into separated moods, repetitive structures and pauses throughout each song, along with abrupt key changes which signify dissonance. Musically, Human Story 3 is a modern classical album that returns to the commercial-like, overloaded vaporwave style of Ferraro's Far Side Virtual (2011), only sounding more 'clean' and less focused on pop structures. Most of the digitally made textures and clanging synthesizer sounds on the album blend in with organic instruments such as strings, woodwinds, pianos and professionally recorded real-life choirs. The choral vocals were performed by the Trojans choir of the University of Southern California. Ferraro's biggest reference point for Human Story 3 was 20th century American composer Aaron Copland. Ferraro described Copland as "the purest musical spirit," reasoning that "his music wasn't just appealing to the common denominator—it's pandering toward their higher mind. He does that really well: just bringing in all of humanity. It represented something really, really virtuous for me." Winston Cook-Wilson, writing for Bandcamp, observed influences from the works of Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie and Charles Ives in Human Story 3. Anna Gaca of Spin magazine compared the album's feeling to that of the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner (1982), where the record's mood of alienation and dystopia comes from how many of its elements representing AI are exaggerated or emotionally amplified.
Release and promotion
Human Story 3 was announced on May 18, 2016, with a trailer and Ferraro summarizing the album on Twitter as "a musing on hyper individualism and the marketability of neotenous plastics." The trailer consist of footage of Financial District, Manhattan. The second and third trailers of the album were released on May 24 and May 31 respectively. "Ten Songs for Humanity" was the first song released from Human Story 3 on June 7, 2016. Ferraro self-released Human Story 3 digitally and on cassette tape on June 14, 2016. The cassette release was a limited edition of only 200 copies. On June 28, 2016, Vice Media's THUMP publication premiered the video for "Plastiglomerate & Co," which they described as a "Web 1.0 rendering of a busy metropolis, gross in its idealized cleanliness; in it, almost faceless, bots bustle about and trample each other in algorithmic harmony."
Reception
Miles Bowe of Fact magazine called Human Story 3 "truly American music made by one of this generation's great composers." He highlighted that "the album builds on various qualities found in Ferraro's discography, dragging familiar sounds into exciting, unknown territories." The LP was number 12 on the magazine's year-end list of the best Bandcamp releases. The album received a five-out-of-five review from Tiny Mix Tapes, and landed at number seven on the publication's list of the best albums of 2016, where Jude Noel praised the arrangements as "unabashedly ambitious, towering structures built upon cozy clarinet melodies and unbridled ideology." The album's cover art was put at number 13 on the publication's list of the best album covers of 2016. However, in a five-out-of-ten review for Pitchfork, Jayasuriya mainly criticized the album for its lack of subtlety in how it presented its message. He gave descriptions of the record such as it being a "less artful, album-length version" of the song "Fitter Happier" by Radiohead and "just as tiring as" commercial music.

Territorial Revival architecture describes the style of architecture developed in the U.S. state of New Mexico in the 1930s. It derived from Territorial Style, an original style which had developed in the 19th century and before, in the wider region of Santa Fe de Nuevo México (since the founding of Albuquerque in 1706) and the New Mexico Territory (until 1912). Territorial Revival incorporated elements of traditional regional building techniques with higher style elements. The style was intended to recall the Territorial Style and was extensively employed for New Mexico state government buildings in Santa Fe.
The style was encouraged by a State Planning Board proclamation of 1934, which advocated the redesign of the state capitol in "the local Santa Fe type of architecture." Architect John Gaw Meem, a leading proponent of the related Pueblo Revival architectural movement, is considered to be the initiator of Territorial Revival architecture.
Description and history
The term Territorial architecture describes a variety of architectural features and regional styles in use during the American territorial period, particularly the New Mexico Territory from about 1846 until 1900. Territorial architecture was defined by the incorporation of elements from classical architecture—pediments, columns, and copings—into buildings that otherwise made use of regional architectural elements and materials such as flat roofs, adobe bricks, and wooden porch posts.
In Territorial Revival architecture, these elements were applied to much larger buildings, such as the New Mexico Capitol Complex, than those that existed during the territorial period. The style was also increasingly adapted to domestic architecture—typically residences of one story—in northern New Mexico, especially in the vicinity of Santa Fe and Albuquerque. Territorial Revival doors and windows sometimes featured lintels with pediments or decorative trim reminiscent of Greek Revival architecture, Gothic Revival architecture, and other classical revival styles. Other distinguishing features of the style are the use of adobe construction, low, flat roofs with a sharp brick edging, white-washed milled lumber columns, and sash windows with mullions.
Territorial Revival was developed in response to the increasing popularity of the Spanish-Pueblo Revival style, with which it shares many features and materials. Architect John Gaw Meem began to design homes in what he referred to as 'territorial' style in response to requests from clients, some of whom desired residences with cleaner, more conventional lines and symmetrical masses than were customary of his Pueblo Revival buildings. Meem's client Mrs. Robert Tilney specifically requested that the architect eschew many of customary Pueblo Revival elements for her 1929 house, saying that she wanted "nothing heavy or Indian", "as little Mexican as possible", and that "the interior of the house be American Colonial in spirit." So Meem took the liberty of blending the Spanish-Pueblo stylings reminiscent of Albuquerque's Old Town, which used the then conventional simpler stylings, into a building technique that simplified the "Indian" and "Mexican" forms into a minimalist style, so as to maintain the regional aesthetic. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Territorial Revival was sometimes preferred to Pueblo Revival, principally because its relative simplicity and symmetry resulted in lower building costs.
The Territorial Revival style is primarily confined to the US State of New Mexico, and continues to be popular into the 21st century, particularly for commercial and government buildings, small offices, residences, and strip malls.

The Constitution of Latvia, ratified on February 15, 1922, contains a provision regarding one of the reserve powers of the President of Latvia to initiate the dissolution of the parliament. According to Article 48-50 of the Constitution,
48. The President shall be entitled to propose the dissolution of the Saeima. Following this proposal, a national referendum shall be held. If in the referendum more than half of the votes are cast in favour of dissolution, the Saeima shall be considered dissolved, new elections called, and such elections held no later than two months after the date of the dissolution of the Saeima.
49. If the Saeima has been dissolved, the mandate of the members of the Saeima shall continue in effect until the newly elected Saeima has convened, but the dissolved Saeima may only hold sittings at the request of the President. The agenda of such sittings shall be determined by the President.
50. If in the referendum more than half of the votes are cast against the dissolution of the Saeima, then the President shall be deemed to be removed from office, and the Saeima shall elect a new President to serve for the remaining term of office of the President so removed.
Since 2009, Article 14 also foresees the right for the citizens without involvement of president:
14. Not less than one tenth of electors has the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima. If the majority of voters and at least two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections of the Saeima vote in the national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima, then the Saeima shall be deemed recalled. The right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima may not be exercised one year after the convening of the Saeima and one year before the end of the term of office of the Saeima, during the last six months of the term of office of the President, as well as earlier than six months after the previous national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima.
The electors may not recall any individual member of the Saeima.
Thus, the Constitution establishes one of the possible procedures to resolve a political crisis in a parliamentary republic by entitling the President, an otherwise largely ceremonial figure, to initiate the dissolution of parliament, but at the potential cost of his own office, should his initiative be rejected by popular vote.
This constitutional power was used for the first time in the history of the Latvian state by the President, Valdis Zatlers, on May 28, 2011. This move was in response to the parliament's refusal to sanction a search at the home of Ainārs Šlesers, a Saeima member and former Cabinet minister. The referendum on the dissolution of parliament has to take place no later than two months time after the President's decree. On May 30 the Central Election Commission resolved that the vote take place on July 23, 2011.
Previously, following the riots in Riga on January 13, 2009, President Zatlers promised to dissolve the Saeima unless it adopted amendments to the Constitution providing for the possibility of dissolving it by popular vote. These amendments were adopted by the Saeima on April 8, 2009, but on April 1, 2009, the President decided not to dissolve parliament.
The Latvian parliament, the Saeima, was also dissolved unconstitutionally on May 15, 1934 following a bloodless coup organized by then-Prime Minister Kārlis Ulmanis. The Cabinet declared a military state of emergency and suspended the activity of all parties which effectively put a ban on the work of the Saeima. This act was in direct violation of the Constitution and led to the establishment of an authoritarian regime.

The Heinkel He 119 was an experimental single-propeller monoplane with two coupled engines, developed in Germany. A private venture by Heinkel to test radical ideas by the Günter brothers, the 119 was originally intended to act as an unarmed reconnaissance bomber capable of eluding all fighters due to its high performance.
Development
Design was begun in the late summer of 1936. A notable feature of the aircraft was the streamlined fuselage, most likely as an evolutionary descendant of the 1932-vintage Heinkel He 70 record-setting single-engined mailplane design, but without the 70's protruding canopy-enclosed crew accommodation existing anywhere along the exterior. Instead, the 119's forward fuselage featured an extensively glazed cockpit forming the nose itself, heavily framed with many diagonally braced windows immediately behind the propeller spinner's rear edge. Two of the three-man crew sat one each side of the driveshaft, which ran aft to a "power system", a coupled pair of Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines mounted above the wing center-section within the fuselage, mounted together within a common mount (the starboard component engine having a "mirror-image" centrifugal supercharger) with a common gear reduction unit fitted to the front ends of each component engine, forming a drive unit known as the DB 606, the first German aircraft to use the "high-power" powerplant system. meant to provide German aircraft with an aviation powerplant design of over-1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output capability, but weighing 1.5 tonnes apiece.
The DB 606 was installed just behind the aft cockpit wall, near the center of gravity, with an enclosed extension shaft passing through the centerline of the extensively glazed cockpit to drive a large four-blade variable-pitch airscrew in the nose. An evaporative cooling system was used on the V1, with the remaining prototypes receiving a semi-retractable radiator directly below the engine to augment cooling during take-off and climb.
Only eight prototypes were completed and the aircraft did not see production, mainly because of the shortages of DB 601 "component" engines to construct the DB 606 "power systems" they formed. The first two prototypes were built as land planes, with retractable landing gear. The third prototype (V3) was constructed as a seaplane with twin floats. This was tested at the Erprobungsstelle Travemünde military seaplane test facility on the Baltic coast, and was scrapped in 1942 at Heinkel's factory airfield in the estuarine Rostock-Schmarl community, then known as Marienehe.
On 22 November 1937, the fourth prototype (V4) made a world class-record flight in which it recorded an airspeed of 505 km/h (314 mph), with a payload of 1,000 kg (2,205 lb), over a distance of 1,000 km (621 mi). The four remaining prototypes were completed during the spring and early summer of 1938, the V5 and V6 being A-series production prototypes for the reconnaissance model, and the V7 and V8 being B-series production prototypes for the bomber model.
These four aircraft were three-seaters with a defensive armament of one MG 15 machine gun in a dorsal position, V7 and V8 having provision for a normal bombload of three 250 kg (551 lb) bombs or maximum bombload of 1,000 kg (2,205 lb). V7 and V8 were sold to Japan in May 1940, and extensively studied; the insights thus gained were used in the design of the Yokosuka R2Y. The remaining prototypes served as engine test-beds, flying with various prototype versions of the DB 606 and DB 610 (twinned DB 605s) and the strictly-experimental DB 613 (twinned DB 603).

Klavdiya Mikhailovna Kudlenko née Blinova (; 24 December 1920 23 November 1988) was a Soviet fighter pilot. Originally assigned to the women's 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, an air defense regiment, she went on to fly in several predominantly male regiments, in which she engaged in intense aerial combat during the Battle of Stalingrad. Despite being shot down and taken prisoner by the Nazis during the Battle of Kursk, she soon escaped and returned to combat.
Early life
Blinova was born on 24 December 1920 to a Russian peasant family in Kaluga Governorate. Her family relocated to Ochakovo in Moscow oblast in the 1930s, where she went on to attend the local Osoaviakhim aeroclub and eventually become a flight instructor.
World War II
Several months after the German invasion of the Soviet Union Blinova voluntarily joined the Red Army to join the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment. After brief training at Engels Military Aviation School the unit was the first of the three women's aviation regiments deployed to combat, having been tasked with defensive aerial operations in Saratov. Although they were trained to fly the Yak-1 fighter, she and several other women pilots in the regiment were transferred to fight in the Battle of Stalingrad to regiments that used other aircraft; Blinova, along with Antonina Lebedeva, Klavdiya Nechaeva, and Olga Shakhova were assigned to the 434th Fighter Aviation Regiment, while Lidiya Litvyak, Yekaterina Budanova, Raisa Belyaeva, and Mariya Kuznetsova went to the 437th Fighter Aviation Regiment. Upon arrival to the all-male regiments the women were initially met with hostility, with the men unwilling to fly with them, although eventually their attitudes changed. Blinova, eager for combat, was offered the opportunity to take fighter pilot training courses, but declined in favor sooner joining the 653rd Fighter Aviation Regiment to enter active combat as soon as possible. There, while the unit was station on the Kalinin front, she made 37 sorties, 12 being combat sorties, for which she received her first military medal, the Medal "For Courage". Later in February 1943 the regiment was moved to the Northwestern Front and on 18 March it was renamed to the 65th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. Soon Blinova's old friend from the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, Antonina Lebedeva, joined the regiment while it underwent training in the reserve until May 1943. In July the unit saw action during the battle of Kursk; on her first day in the battle Blinova participated in a dogfight, and by late August she had distinguished herself in combat, having gained three shared shootdowns over the course of 48 flights, 23 of them being combat sorties, and 15 aerial dogfights. Earlier that month on 4 August 1943 she had been shot down and forced to parachute out over enemy territory. She attempted to flee for Soviet lines, but was wounded after being shot in the leg from a German machine gun. Captured and taken as a prisoner of war, she is has violently beaten during interrogations before eventually being loaded on a train with other prisoners, but she and other prisoners managed to escape after one of the prisoners concealed a penknife, which they used to cut a hole in the boxcar and climb out of one by one. Having returned to Soviet-controlled territory, she was questioned by SMERSH and originally supposed to be sent to a NKVD camp for former POW's, but Vasily Stalin rescued her from further detainment and helped her get a prompt return to aviation. After briefly training at the Higher Officer School of Air Combat in Lyubertsy she returned to her regiment, with which she fought on the 1st Baltic and 3rd Belorussian fronts.
Later life
After the war she married fellow aviator Grigory Kudlenko, navigator of the 65th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment that she served in during the war. As a civilian she worked as a flight attendant and was an active participant in the veterans movement before her death on 23 November 1988.

Don Clark (born December 27, 1936) is a former all-star running back in the Canadian Football League.
Clark played his college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes. Playing from 1956 to 1958, he was a member of their 1957 Rose Bowl victory and national championship. An All-American, he was drafted in the first round by the Chicago Bears, even though he was injured.
Clark eventually signed with the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1959. After rushing for 343 yards, he couldn't agree on contract terms with Ottawa, and was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, who promptly dealt him to the Montreal Alouettes.
Clark was part of a Lark's backfield which also included George Dixon. He rushed for 902 yards in 1960 (Dixon had 976) and 1143 yards in 1961, when he was selected as an Eastern All Star. Injuries took their toll during his last two years, as he played only 12 games and rushed for 435 and 447 yards (while Dixon won the MVP award rushing for 1520 yards.) Clark retired in 1964, only 27 years old, due to knee, rib and kidney injuries.

Ramla Left Battery (), also known as Belancourt Battery () or Xagħra Battery (), was an artillery battery in Ramla Bay, limits of Xagħra on the island of Gozo, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715–1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The battery now lies in ruins.
History
Ramla Left Battery was built in 1715–1716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. It was one of several fortifications in Ramla Bay that also included Ramla Right Battery on the opposite side of the bay and Ramla Redoubt in the centre. These were all linked together by an entrenchment wall. Ramla Bay was further defended by Marsalforn Tower on the plateau above the bay, and an underwater barrier to prevent enemy ships from landing within the bay.
The battery originally had an irregularly shaped gun platform with a parapet having six embrasures. A small blockhouse was located at the rear of the battery. Construction cost around 295 scudi.
The battery saw use during the French invasion of Malta in 1798, when it fired on the approaching French fleet.
Present day
Today, all that remains of the battery are some ruins. These ruins, along with the rest of Ramla Bay, are managed by the Gaia Foundation.
At least one iron cannon from the battery is now located at the Cittadella.

The cuneiform U sign is found in both the 14th century BC Amarna letters and the Epic of Gilgamesh. It can be used for the alphabetic u, instead of the more common 2nd u, (ú). It has two other uses, commonly. It can be used for the number 10 (especially the Amarna letters from Tushratta of Mitanni, or Burna-Buriash II the king of Babylon), but its probable greater use is for the conjunction, u, with any of the conjunction meanings: and, but, else, etc.
Of the three u's, by graphemic analysis (Buccellati, 1979), the commonness is as follows:
Ù (cuneiform), conjunction only (but also rare, for alphabetic "u")
ú (cuneiform), alphabetic 'u'
u (cuneiform), alphabetic (minor), 10, conjunction (the highest use)
Both Ù (cuneiform) and ú are in the top 25 most used signs, but E (cuneiform) and "u (cuneiform)" are not; other vowels (or combination) in the 25 are: a (cuneiform), i (cuneiform), and ia (cuneiform), (which has a secondary use as suffix, "-mine", or "my", thus in top 25 most used signs). Suffix "iYa" is used in the Middle East\Southwest Asia at present day to end placenames, or other names: "My Xxxxx".
Amarna letters uses
The use of u for numeral 10 has been explained above. It is used in the letters from Tushratta, speaking of the ancestral relations with former father kings: ...my father loved your father (the Pharaoh) 10 times more, and I have 10 times more love now. May our relations... be forever "inter-related". (Amarna letter EA 19, 2nd paragraph, setting up the letter of a 13-paragraph letter, topics about daughter for Pharaoh's wife, love, gold, etc.)
Amarna letter EA 252, Labaya to Pharaoh, titled: Sparing One's Enemies, explains his actions in defending 'his position', after cities have been overtaken. He states in idiomatic iconography: "....my parts are eaten!..(.U.)And..I am slandered!. He continues in parable form: ".....if an ant is attacked (pinched), should it just sit (take it), or bite (the) hand back!?".... He continues to then discuss the men who have taken a city, (and a cult statue), and defends his past, and future actions.
Partial list of signs beginning with wedge (u)
Partial list of signs beginning with u, from the Epic of Gilgamesh (Parpola, 1971), and the Amarna letters:
Cuneiform-u--Sign No. 1----(conjunction use, and "10"; occasionally for u)
Cuneiform-AMAR, ṣur, zur--Sign No. 2---; Sumerogram: See!-(AMAR) (Akkadian, "amāru")-(Note: minus the vertical stroke)
Cuneiform-di--Sign No. 3---
Cuneiform-ki--Sign No. 4---
Cuneiform-mi-(Sign 5)
Cuneiform-ši, lim, or IGI ("in 'face' of", "before" Sumerogram)--Sign No. 6-----(Abdi-Ashirta), Abdi-A-Ši-iR-Ta, (wedge-sign, 4th sign)
Cuneiform-u--Sign No. u-1---
Cuneiform-ú--Sign No. u-2----(approximate: only 3 verticals for ú, (the common alphabetic u))
Cuneiform-Ù-(u-3)--Sign No. 7---
(With an added horizontal, ,after the left vertical)

Motor torpedo boat PT-617, also known as Big Red Cock and Dragon Lady, "is the sole surviving 80' Elco type PT boat and represents the United States's most heavily used, highly favored, and combat-tested PT boat type in World War II." She is a museum ship at the PT Boat Museum in Fall River, Massachusetts. The Elco type boat was the predominant type and is the same type as the famous commanded by John F. Kennedy; the "Higgins" boat is the other type.
PT-617 was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989.
Design
PT-617 is a PT-103-class ELCO motor torpedo boat. The hull was constructed of two layers of mahogany planking laid diagonally over laminated spruce, white oak, and mahogany frames, reinforced with longitudinal battens, secondary transverse frames, and clamps. A layer of fabric, impregnated with marine glue, was laid between the two layers of planking.
The boat had a displacement of (fully loaded) and was in length, with a beam of , and a draft of . Her three liquid-cooled, supercharged, 12-cylinder Packard 4M-2500 engines each drove a single shaft, giving the boat a top speed of . With a full load of 3,000 gallons (9 tons) of high octane aviation fuel she had a maximum cruising radius of .
PT-617 was very heavily armed for her size with four Mark 13 torpedoes, a and two guns in the bows, a Bofors 40 mm gun at the stern, and two twin .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns in mounts each side of the cockpit. There were also two depth charges mounted on racks on the stern, along with a smoke generator. Two Mark 50 rocket launchers and a mortar were also installed. In addition the crew were issued with small arms, each man carrying a M1911.45 caliber pistol, and the boat carried a .30 caliber Browning Automatic Rifle, M1903 Springfield .30-06 bolt-action rifles, .45 caliber Thompson submachine guns, 3-inch rockets, and Mk 2 grenades.
Ship history
PT-617 was built by the Electric Launch Company of Bayonne, New Jersey. Laid down on 29 March 1945, and launched on 28 July, she was not completed until 21 September, after the end of the war. The boat was assigned to MTB Squadron 42 and slated for service with the Pacific Fleet, but this was later cancelled. The boat was placed out of service on 28 January 1946, and finally sold on 23 October 1947.
In private hands the boat served as a yacht, and as a salvage and as a diving platform. She was bought by PT Boats, Inc. in 1979, and after restoration to her World War II configuration officially went on display on 1 September 1985.

Garry Brown (born 27 October 1954) is an Australian former track and field athlete who specialised in the 400 metres hurdles. He was the champion in that event at the 1982 Commonwealth Games after winning two minor medals at the 1978 Commonwealth Games. His personal best of 49.37 seconds was set as part of his Commonwealth win.
Career
Raised in Queensland, he began to reach the top level nationally in the late 1970s, taking the runner-up spot at the Australian Athletics Championships behind Peter Grant in 1977. He was coached by former hurdler Gary Knoke. Brown's first international appearances came at the 1977 IAAF World Cup (sixth in the final) and the 1977 Pacific Conference Games, where he was the gold medallist at the Canberra-hosted event. He also came third in the 400 m hurdles at the AAA Championships in England that year, beaten by Rich Graybehl and Alan Pascoe.
Brown was among the favourites for the 1978 Commonwealth Games, but in the strong wind of the final both he and Alan Pascoe of England (the defending champion) were beaten by Kenya's Daniel Kimaiyo, who was the newly minted All-Africa Games champion. Brown was left with the silver medal in the hurdles. After his individual medal, he added a further bronze medal with the Australian 4×400 metres relay team of Chum Darvall, John Higham and Rick Mitchell.
After missing 1979, the 1980 season saw Brown become the Australian national champion in the hurdles for the first time. He repeated that feat two consecutive times and his 1982 time of 49.89 seconds was the fastest electronically recorded time at the championships until 1988. He placed sixth at both the 1981 IAAF World Cup and the 1981 Pacific Conference Games, but came away with a relay gold medal at the latter competition.
In the last major season of his career, he began with a runner-up finish at the AAA Championships behind America's James King. The 1982 Commonwealth Games was held in Brisbane and he was the home favourite for the 400 m hurdles. Coming into the final straight, Ugandan Peter Rwamuhanda was in first place but, after a stumble at the final hurdle Brown, took the lead. Brown had a lifetime best in the race, running 49.37 seconds to become the Commonwealth champion. This time placed him second to Bruce Field (49.32) on the all-time Australian ranking and 15th in the world rankings that year. Although only in his late twenties, this proved to be the last major outing internationally as he was not part of the Australian relay team and withdrew from the first ever Australian squad for the 1983 World Championships in Athletics. He still competed successfully at a national level up to 1984.
After his retirement from active competition, he went on to become an athletics coach, specialising in teaching hurdling technique. He also published articles on the subject. The Queensland Club Championships was titled the Garry Brown Shield in his honour.

The Aston Martin CC100 Speedster is a concept car produced by the British car company Aston Martin to celebrate its 100th anniversary, announced in May 2013 at the ADAC Zurich 24 Hours of Nürburgring race. Only two were produced and both were sold to very loyal customers. One of the owners plans to keep it in his private collection, while the owner of the second car plans to get regulatory approval so it can be driven on public roads.
The CC100 is powered by a naturally aspirated V12 engine mated to an automated sequential manual 6-speed gearbox, enabling a claimed limited top speed of , and acceleration from 0 to in under 4 seconds.
Design
The CC100 is inspired by the 1950s DBR1 with an open split cockpit, cutaway doors and twin rear buttresses. It was designed by Miles Nurnberger and is built on Aston's VH platform, with a carbon fibre body designed and built at the company's headquarters in Gaydon.

Our Lady's Catholic College (OLCC) is a mixed sex secondary school for pupils aged 11–18. It is located in Skerton, just off the A6 road, north of the River Lune, Lancaster in the North West of England. Formerly Our Lady's Catholic High School, it changed its name after being awarded Specialist Sports College status in September 2003.
The college teaches Key Stage 3 and Keystage 4 and a sixthform. The sixth form is part of the North Lancashire Learning Partnership, with Carnforth High School and Central Lancaster High School.
From September 2015 ,the head teacher is Helen Seddon, a former pupil of the school. She took over from Brendan Conboy, who retired in July 2015. Conboy had been at Our Lady's since September 2007.
Description
This is an 11-19 secondary school principally for Roman Catholic pupils and students: it draws from 28 feeder primary schools from Lancaster and Northern Lancashire.
Pupils entered the school in 2016 with a significantly lower prior attainment than national average. While at the school, low-and middle-ability pupils make the fastest progress while high-ability pupils make progress in line with the national average. By the end of year eleven the proportion of pupils attaining at least a C grade in both English and mathematics mirrors the national average. Mathematics is stronger than English: impressive rates of progress were made in vocational courses, information technology and religious studies.
Curriculum
Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'.
The school has to decide whether Key Stage 3 contains years 7, 8 and 9- or whether year 9 should be in Key Stage 4 and the students just study subjects that will be examined by the GCSE exams at 16.
Our Lady's aim that all students experience a broad and balanced curriculum in their first three years, with an academic approach to the curriculum in order to prepare for KS4 studies. The KS3 curriculum encompasses the core subjects of English, Maths and Science, plus RE, history, geography and languages.
The practical and creative subjects; PE, Technology, including Product design, Food, Textiles and also Art, Drama, Dance and Music are an important part of a students education, the school believes, so has decided to maximise the time available doing a full three year KS 3.
In Key Stage 4 students principally study a range of GCSE courses. The English Baccalaureate subjects of
English, Maths, Science, History, Geography and languages were at centre of the curriculum in KS3 and they are available to all students, so they each have the opportunity to study for the English Baccalaureate and obtain an EBacc APS. Too few pupils choose to study a language so can't obtain an EBacc. The course is structured on the Progress 8 model. Students study the core subjects of English maths and science. RE is also compulsory. Students then choose the humanity from Geography, History and French. They then have choice of options from a range of GCSEs and vocational subjects. A small minority of students will not take a Humanity but do the Work skills BTec and an IT qualification.
At Key Stage 5 a range of A levels and Level 3 BTECs are on offer. For example, in 2020, Art and Design, Biology Chemistry, Drama, English and English Literature, Geography, History, Mathematics, Physics, Religious Studies and Sociology were offered at A level and Applied Science, Art and Design, Business Studies, Food Science and Nutrition, Health and Social Care (optional Childcare module), ICT, Performing Arts, Sport and Travel and Tourism as BTECs. Modern Foreign Languages are notable by their absence.
Notable events
On 22 June 2012, the Olympic Flame passed through the college as part of the Olympic Torch Relays of 2012.

Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho, also spelled as Terreiro Lobanekum Filho, or Casa de Mae Lira, is a Candomblé terreiro in Cachoeira, Bahia, Brazil. It was founded by Amazilia Matias da Conceição (1906-1997), better known as Mãe Lira de Iemanjá Ogunté. Unlike other terreiros that cover large urban or rural spaces, Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho is located in a long, narrow single-story row house. The terreiro is protected as a historic structure by the state of Bahia.
History
Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho was founded in 1930 by Amazilia Matias da Conceição (1906-1997), better known as Mãe Lira de Iemanjá Ogunté. Mãe Lira was an initiate of Terreiro Loba'Nekun, a Candomblé terreiro in Terra Vermelha, a rural area north of the town of Cachoeira. She was dedicated to the orisha, or deity, Iemanjá. Mãe Lira was 17 at the time of her initiation, and left Terreiro Loba'Nekun in 1925 to found an independent terreiro, called Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho, filho meaning "son" in Portuguese. Mãe Lira and members of the terreiros are of nagô origin, or descendants of enslaved people from Fon-speaking people of present-day Nigeria and Benin.
Leadership of the terreiro was passed to Zuleide da Paixão Lima, better known as Mãe Ledinha de Oyá, after the death of Mãe Lira. Mãe Ledinha is the niece of the founder. The terreiro expanded after the death of Mãe Lira to occupy an adjacent, narrow house.
Location
Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho is located on a street that descends from the rear of the Church of Nossa Senhora do Monte, constructed in 1795. Unlike other Candomblé terreiros in Cachoeira, it is located within the urban center of Cachoeira. The terreiro is in a long row of connected, single-story houses.
Grounds and structures
Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho is located in a long, narrow, single-story house. The rear of the terreiro opens to a small yard.
Festivals
Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho holds public festivals in June, August, and December. The June 1st festival coincides with a public commemoration honoring the Independence of Bahia. They include a water offering to the orixa Iemanjá, as well as celebrations in honor of Obaluaê, Ogum, Oxossi, Xangô, and Caboclo Juremeira, a Brazilian Amerindian folk deity.
June: Iemanjá, Ogun, Oxossi, Xangô
August: Nanã and Obaluaê
December: Caboclo Juremeira.
Heritage status
Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho is a protected structure by the Bahian Institute of Artistic Culture and Heritage (Instituto do Patrimônio Artístico e Cultural da Bahia) under Decree no. 15.681 of 2014.

William Heard Kilpatrick (November 20, 1871 – February 13, 1965) was an American pedagogue and a pupil, a colleague and a successor of John Dewey (1859–1952). Kilpatrick was a major figure in the progressive education movement of the early 20th century.
Biography
Kilpatrick was born in White Plains, Georgia. He had an orthodox upbringing and was educated at Mercer University and Johns Hopkins University where he later became a mathematics teacher at High School and at Mercer University. He first met John Dewey in 1898 and again met him in 1907. Kilpatrick decided to make philosophy of education his specialty and attended all courses given by Dewey at Teachers College, Columbia University. From this developed a cooperation, which persisted up to Dewey's death in 1952. Both men's ideas directly impacted the 1932 founding of Bennington College in Vermont: they were both on the original College Board of Trustees, with Kilpatrick soon becoming President of the Board, and two of the original 12 houses on campus are named after them.
His first teaching job was at Blakely Institute, a combined elementary and secondary public school in southwest Georgia, required that he attend a July 1892 summer at Rock College Normal School, Athens, GA. There he learned of the educational theories of German educator Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel (1782-1852), kindergarten founder and learning-through-play advocate. He again studied at Johns Hopkins University, summer 1895, then taught seventh grade and was principal at Anderson Elementary School, Savannah, GA, 1896–97. He was at Mercer University, 1897–1906, taught mathematics, was vice-president, 1900, and acting president, 1904–06, but resigned when the trustees were concerned about his doubting the virgin birth of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ.
In 1907-1909 Kilpatrick was a student in Teachers College at Columbia University (New York City), where he took courses in history of education under Paul Monroe (1869-1947), philosophy of education under John Angus MacVannel (1871-1915), psychology under Edward Lee Thorndike(1874-1949), and philosophy under Frederick James Eugene Woodbridge (1867-1940) and John Dewey. In 1908 Kilpatrick wrote in his diary: "Professor Dewey has made a great difference in my thinking." Dewey wrote to MacVannel and said the following about Kilpatrick: "He is the best [student] I ever had." Dewey was Kilpatrick's most important professor and mentor while Kilpatrick was a student at Teachers College. Kilpatrick spent his professional career and the rest of his long life at Teachers College, Columbia University (TCCU), where he was instructor in history of education (1909-1911), received a Ph.D. in 1911 with his thesis (supervised by Paul Monroe) titled The Dutch Schools of New Netherland and Colonial New York (published in 1912 in various editions), was assistant professor of philosophy of education (1911–1915), associate professor of philosophy of education (1915–1918), full professor of philosophy of education (1918–1937), and emeritus professor thereafter.
Kilpatrick's 1st wife was Mary (Marie) Beman Guyton (November 12, 1874 - May 29, 1907). William and Mary married on December 27, 1898, and they had three children. William's 2nd wife was Margaret Manigault Pinckney (December 4, 1861 - November 24, 1938). William and Margaret were married on November 26, 1908. William's 3rd and final marriage was to Marion Isabella Ostrander (December 23, 1891 - January 29, 1975) on May 8, 1940, she's having been his secretary.
Kilpatrick taught summers at the University of Georgia, 1906, 1908, and 1909; the University of the South (Sewanee), 1907; was visiting professor, Northwestern University, 1937–38, and taught summer sessions there, 1939–1941; taught summer sessions, Stanford University, 1938; University of Kentucky, 1942; University of North Carolina, 1942; and University of Minnesota, 1946. His trips abroad included school visits, lectures, and meetings with prominent educators in Italy, Switzerland, and France, May–June 1912; Europe and Asia, August 1926-June 1927; and round the world, August–December 1929.
He received honorary LL.D. degrees from Mercer University, 1926; Columbia University, 1929; and Bennington College, 1938 (which he helped found in 1923 and where he was president of the board of trustees, 1931–38); the honorary D.H.L. degree from the College of Jewish Studies, 1952; and the Brandeis Award for humanitarian service, 1953.
After retiring from TCCU, 1937, he was president of the New York Urban League, 1941–51; chairman of American Youth for World Youth, 1946–51; chairman of the Bureau of International Education, 1940–51.
Kilpatrick had several critics but many more admirers and followers. His eighty-fifth birthday, November 20, 1956, celebrated at Horace Mann Auditorium, TCCU, resulted in a special March 1957 issue of Progressive Education, "William Heard Kilpatrick Eighty-Fifth Anniversary," containing 10 articles. Both heralded and criticized as John Dewey's chief educational interpreter, Kilpatrick was a leading advocate of progressive education. He died after a long illness at age 93 on February 13, 1965 in New York.
Philosophy of education
Kilpatrick developed the Project Method for early childhood education, which was a form of Progressive Education that organized curriculum and classroom activities around a subject's central theme. He believed that the role of a teacher should be that of a "guide" as opposed to an authoritarian figure. Kilpatrick believed that children should direct their own learning according to their interests and should be allowed to explore their environment, experiencing their learning through the natural senses. Proponents of Progressive Education and the Project Method reject traditional schooling that focuses on memorization, rote learning, strictly organized classrooms (desks in rows; students always seated), and typical forms of assessment. He has been described as a developmentalist.
Kilpatrick published Foundations Of Method - Informal Talks On Teaching in 1925.
Political views
Kilpatrick was a democratic socialist and served on the board of directors of the League for Industrial Democracy.

Thomas Feuerstein (born 1968, Innsbruck) is an Austrian contemporary artist. His works and projects are realized in different media. They include sculptures, installations, environments, objects, drawings, paintings, radio plays as well net art and BioArt. Feuerstein's work is known for growth and transience, processes of transformation, biological metabolism and entropy.
Biography
Thomas Feuerstein was born in Innsbruck, Austria, and lives in Vienna, Austria. He studied art history and philosophy at the University of Innsbruck from 1987 to 1995. From 1992 to 1994 he was co-editor of the magazine Medien.Kunst.Passagen. In 1992 and 1993 he worked on research assignments on electronic space as well as on art and architecture.
Since 1997 he has held lectureships and guest professorships at University of Applied Arts Vienna, University of the Arts Bern, F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich, Mozarteum University Salzburg and University of Innsbruck.
Work
Feuerstein's work involves digital and biochemical processes and transmutations, with specific materialities playing a central role. Processes and materials are used both as carriers of meaning and narrations and in the form of materials, and ultimately become agents in art.
Essential aspects are the interplay of linguistic, visual and molecular-processual elements, the detection of latent links between facts and fictions as well as the entanglement between art and science. Feuerstein developed the artistic method of "conceptual narration" for this purpose.
At the border between nature, art and science, Feuerstein's works set in motion pataphysical cycles of the production of meaning and possibilities. The works contain pataphysical references to Alfred Jarry, Raymond Roussel or Marcel Duchamp. In contrast to historical pataphysics, machines, apparatuses and scientific methods are not only attributed metaphorical and symbolic meanings, but used for real processes. Feuerstein speaks of "patachemistry" and "patabiology" in the context of projects involving biological organisms and processes. Examples of this are metabolic processes in which artistic materials are produced, altered or digested in the form of objects and sculptures. References to aspects of entropy in Robert Smithson's work or to Robert Morris' form and anti-form can be found in works with biofilms, slime, fungi, and myxomycetes.
Digital Art
Since the late 1980s Feuerstein has developed algorithmic and cybernetic art. Initially as an extension of abstract art and concrete poetry, from the early 1990s he has used software to process online data: Hausmusik (1993) transposes stock market data into chamber music, Realdata Stampede (1994) converts news data into techno beats, Manifesto (2009) draws a cloud based on data from the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Proustmachine (1994) or Borgy & Bes (2008) use artificial neural networks to generate literary texts and linguistic dialogues.
Feuerstein's digital works examine cybernetic culture in the context of economy, politics, and posthumanism. For this purpose, he evolves a cybernetic demonology that, based on the Greek daimon, investigates cultural informatization from the Maxwell demon through server processes to big data and AI.
BioArt
The project Biophily (1993-2002) dealt with Internet geography and biotechnology. Feuerstein realized performative works in Tanzania, Namibia, India, California and Kyrgyzstan. In Trivandrum he had a Hindu avatar marry him to a rubber tree, to which his own genes were later added by means gene gun.
From the end of the 1990s, works and exhibitions with biological model organisms, own body cells, fungi and algae, bacteria and archaea followed.
In Manna Machines he cultivates algae, which are processed into pigment for monochrome paintings, food and spirits. In the exhibitions Psychoprosa, he extracts tyrosine from algae and psylocibine from mushrooms to synthesize a novel psychotropic substance that he describes as a molecular sculpture or ironically as the world's smallest sculpture.
An exemplary "patabiological" machine is the installation Pancreas, which feeds and nourishes glucose, extracted from the cellulose of books according to Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, to a culture of human brain cells.
In Prometheus delivered chemolithoautotrophic bacteria decompose a marble sculpture and in return nourish a culture of human liver cells.

Richmond Hill United Church, at 10201 Yonge Street, is a designated heritage building in the town of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. The main body of the building dates back to 1880, then as Richmond Hill Methodist Church, with later additions built in 1932 and in 1957 (Christian Education building). Originally the Methodist Church, it was renamed the United Church in 1925 when the Methodists, the Congregationalists, and the Presbyterians entered into a union.
The church is, and always was, first and foremost a place of worship. In its early days there is a possibility that, aside from general church related uses, it could also have served as a Sunday school. With time and with the extensions the functions expanded in range. The church began to gain recognition not only as a religious venue but also as an important community marker. This church has a strong social justice orientation, and became an affirming ministry in June 2013. Currently, the church has tenants that use parts of its space, which include a dance school, a drama group, ESL training, and a math enrichment program. Occasionally the building is also used as a place for committee meetings and as a gathering space for community groups concerning cultural, social, or other issues.
History and architecture
The United Church boasts a history of over 200 years, where it began as a simple log schoolhouse that acted as a place of worship for the local Methodists. Later a frame building was constructed in 1847 as a replacement but this structure did not survive: in 1879 it burned down to the ground. Five months later, in 1880, work began on what was to be the last building.
The present church was designed by Charles Albert Walton (1845-1908), a Toronto architect. Construction was carried out for a year until the church was completed in 1881. In its time, the church cost $17,000 to be built, which was a very significant figure, and the property was purchased for $950 as a deed. During those times the church was large enough to accommodate everyone who lived in the area together.
The United Church was built in the High Victorian Gothic Revival style. This is heavily embodied through sharp edges and arches, stained glass windows, and, mostly, the two flanking steeples. Its front entrance is within a projecting exterior Gothic arch with side buttresses. A secondary entrance into the church is available on the south side of the main tower, which also has a datestone inscribed with “A.D. 1880” at its base. The southwest corner of the church features the prominent three-tier steeple that seems to be the defining element of the structure. This steeple is the tallest among all historic church steeples in the town of Richmond Hill.

Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham (1678/79 – 1758), was a British courtier in the court of Queen Anne, and the husband of her favourite, Abigail Masham (née Hill), Baroness Masham.
Biography
Masham was born 1678/9, the eighth son of Sir Francis Masham, 3rd Baronet, and Mary Scott, in Otes in High Laver, the same house where John Locke spent his final years. He was introduced to the Royal Household as page to Prince George of Denmark, the husband of the future Queen Anne. In 1701, he was promoted to the position of equerry. He was commissioned a captain in the 2nd Regiment of Foot Guards on 10 January 1704, and breveted a colonel of foot on 20 October.
He met his future wife, Abigail Hill, in about 1704, when she was appointed Lady of the Bedchamber to Anne, who was now Queen. This was the year that the Queen confided to the Earl of Godolphin that she did not believe that she and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough – her closest friend up until now – could ever be true friends again. The Duchess, a Whig, was frequently absent from the Court, sometimes for long periods, and had become too overbearing for the Queen. Abigail, a Tory – helped by her flattery and subservience – quickly began to supplant the Duchess in the Queen's affections.
The Tory leader, Robert Harley, probably advised Masham of the advantages of marrying a royal favourite. However, Masham himself described it as a love match. The couple were married some time in 1707, in the presence of the Queen who contributed £2,000 to Abigail's dowry. The duchess, who was not consulted, learned about the marriage several months later and her subsequent argument with the Queen included accusations of lesbianism. This turned the Queen completely against her and paved the way for Abigail's rise.
Meanwhile, Masham was enjoying the rewards of Abigail's position. He was promoted to brigadier general in the army, and in 1710 became MP for Ilchester. In 1712, Robert Harley, now Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, requested that the Queen create twelve new peers to pass negotiations for the Treaty of Utrecht which the Whigs were firmly against. Masham was one of those suggested to the Queen; but she only consented on the condition that Abigail continued to act as her dresser (a peeress was not expected to carry out the more menial duties of the bedchamber). He became Baron Masham of Otes, one of the twelve new creations known as "Harley's Dozen".
After Queen Anne's death in 1714, the new king, George I, reinstated the Whigs – and the Marlboroughs – to favour. Abigail retired into private life, but Samuel Masham became King's Remembrancer in 1716. He died in 1758, long outliving his wife.
In popular culture
Samuel Masham is portrayed by actor Joe Alwyn in the 2018 film The Favourite.

"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken" is the sixth episode of the fifth season of HBO's medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones. The 46th episode overall, it was written by Bryan Cogman, and directed by Jeremy Podeswa. It first aired on HBO on May 17, 2015.
In the episode, Arya Stark is shown the secret of the Faceless Men of Braavos; Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont are captured by slavers; Jaime Lannister attempts to take Myrcella Baratheon out of Dorne by force; Petyr Baelish meets with Cersei Lannister; Loras Tyrell is interrogated by the High Sparrow; and Sansa Stark marries Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell. The episode polarized critics and viewers for its ending, depicting a violent sexual assault. It received a rating of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes, and was the lowest-rated episode until "The Bells" in season 8. Nonetheless, director Jeremy Podeswa received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for this episode.
The name of the episode comes from the House Martell motto Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, words about strength that are put in contrast with the fates of several main characters, especially women, as these take a turn for the worse.
Plot
In Braavos
The Waif tells Arya that to pass the Game of Faces she must be able to convincingly lie. Arya plays with the waif, who is able to detect that Arya is lying about her hatred for the Hound, despite her insistence to the contrary. Later, when a man brings his sick daughter to the temple so that she can die in peace, Arya lies to her that she was ill like her in the past and gives her the temple's poisoned water to end her suffering. Jaqen takes Arya to a chamber where the Faceless Men store the faces of all the people that have died in the temple and tells her that she is not yet ready to become no one, but she is ready to become someone else.
On the Valyrian peninsula
Tyrion tells Jorah that his father Jeor is dead. Soon after, they are captured by slavers. After hearing that Daenerys has reopened the fighting pits, Tyrion convinces the slavers to take them to Meereen, saying that Jorah is an accomplished warrior.
In King's Landing
Baelish arrives in King's Landing and tells Cersei that Sansa will marry Ramsay at Winterfell, and gets her approval to lead the Knights of the Vale to destroy the victor of Stannis' attack on the Boltons and be named Warden of the North. Olenna arrives and tells Cersei that her actions have put the Lannister-Tyrell alliance in peril, but Cersei claims that she had nothing to do with Loras' arrest. At Loras' inquest, the High Sparrow interrogates Loras and Margaery, who both deny that Loras is homosexual. Olyvar testifies against Loras and the Faith Militant arrests Loras; Margaery is also arrested for perjury.
In Dorne
As the Sand Snakes prepare to abduct Myrcella, Bronn and Jaime disguise themselves as Dornish guards and infiltrate the Water Gardens to rescue her first. A skirmish between the two parties ensues before Dornish guards, led by Areo Hotah, arrive and arrest both groups. Ellaria Sand is also taken into custody.
At Winterfell
Before her wedding to Ramsay, Sansa is visited by Myranda claiming she was ordered to bathe her. While doing so, Myranda tries to intimidate Sansa by telling her not to bore Ramsay like "all the other girls".
After his wedding to Sansa, Ramsay brings her to his chambers and takes her virginity by raping her. A horrified Reek attempts to leave, but Ramsay forces him to stay and watch.
Production
Writing
This episode was written by the series producer Bryan Cogman, who has written at least one episode in every season of the show. It contains some content from George Martin's novel A Feast for Crows, chapters Arya II, The Queenmaker, Cat of the Canals, and Cersei X and A Dance with Dragons, chapters the Ugly Little Girl, Tyrion X, and the Prince of Winterfell, though series consultant Elio Garcia describes the portrayal of some of these events as "vastly different" from the original.
Like other episodes this season, it also included content and storylines written specifically for the television adaptation. Myles McNutt of A.V. Club points out that this changes the way the viewers interpret the showrunner's decisions. When describing his opinion of the decision to show Sansa raped by Ramsay on their wedding night (a storyline given to a different character, Jeyne Poole, in the books), he compares the scene to a similar one between Daenerys and Drogo in season one (which was consensual in the novels): "While we could frame the shifted events of Dany and Khal Drogo's wedding night in light of where we knew Dany's story was going, here we have no idea what this does to Sansa's storyline." Most critics questioned the decision to show Sansa raped on her wedding night, but, as Business Insider pointed out, "The book version of this scene was much, much worse," with Theon ordered, graphically, to participate in Jeyne's mistreatment. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, show writer Bryan Cogman was asked about the decision to decrease the level of violence, responding, "Lord no. No-no-no-no-no. No. It's still a shared form of abuse that they have to endure, Sansa and Theon. But it's not the extreme torture and humiliation that scene in the book is."
However, in other ways, the episode veers back to book canon: "Whereas Loras' arrest suggested the show was replacing Margaery's alleged dalliances with his homosexuality, here the show gradually builds to Margaery's arrest for lying on her brother's behalf."
Filming
"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken" was directed by Jeremy Podeswa. He also directed the previous episode, "Kill the Boy".
Reception
Ratings
"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken" was watched by 6.24 million American viewers during its first airing. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 8.79 million viewers, and a 4.5 in the 18-49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 2.285 million viewers, making it the highest-rated broadcast that week. It also received 0.126 million timeshift viewers.
Critical reviews and controversy
The episode received polarized reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode received a 54% approval rating from 50 critics with a rating average of 7.55 out of 10, the lowest of any episode in the series at that time. The critical consensus states: "Unbalanced storytelling and unnecessary, excessive brutality add up to disturbing viewing, although 'Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken' still includes enough plot revelations to offer hope for future episodes." The majority of professional criticism concerned the decision to have Ramsay rape Sansa on their wedding night, with most critics describing the scene as gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. "This grim scene was difficult for the show to justify," said Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph. Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair added, "this rape scene undercuts all the agency that's been growing in Sansa since the end of last season. [...] I'd never advocate that Game of Thrones (or any work of fiction) shy away from edgy plots out of fear of pushback or controversy. But edgy plots should always accomplish something above pure titillation or shock value and what, exactly, was accomplished here?" Christopher Orr wrote in The Atlantic, "I continue to be astonished that showrunners Benioff and Weiss still apparently believe that their tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence of George R.R. Martin's source material is a strength rather than the defining weakness of their adaptation." Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club wrote, "The issue with the show returning to rape as a trope is not simply because there have been thinkpieces speaking out against it, and is not solely driven by the rational concerns lying at the heart of those thinkpieces. It's also that the show has lost my faith as a viewer." Writers from Vanity Fair, The Mary Sue and The Daily Beast all disapproved of the decision to use Sansa's victimization as a motivating agent for Theon, saying that the scene undermined Sansa's character development: "Was it really important to make that scene about Theon's pain?" wrote Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair.
Other critics responded positively to the scene. Sean T. Collins of Rolling Stone wrote: "[B]y involving a multidimensional main character instead of one introduced primarily to suffer, the series has a chance to grant this story the gravity and seriousness it deserves. Sarah Hughes of The Guardian wrote: "I have repeatedly made clear that I'm not a fan of rape as a plot device – but the story of Ramsay and Sansa's wedding was more than that. [...] The writers are walking a very fine line here. They handled it well tonight, telling a gothic tale of innocence sacrificed". Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post wrote that the scene "managed to maintain a fine balance, employing a dignity and care for the experiences of victims that Game of Thrones has not always demonstrated."
Some critics questioned why this scene in particular should generate outrage when similar scenes have not. Sara Stewart of the New York Post pointed out that the rape and sexual abuse of both female and male characters is typical for Game of Thrones: "Why are we suddenly so outraged about the rape of Sansa Stark, when this show has served up a steady diet of sexual assault and violence against women since its first season began?" Cathy Young of Reason magazine, writing in Time noted what she calls a lack of complaint in response to the sexual mistreatment of male characters in earlier seasons, specifically the literal emasculation of Theon Greyjoy and the sexual assault of Gendry.
Criticism of the scene has not extended to the quality of the acting. Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair wrote, "And if we can say one positive thing about that scene it's that Allen nailed his performance. Theon's horror mirrored our own and the camera—focusing on his reaction—let our minds fill in the blanks." Sophie Turner defended the scene as an artistic challenge for herself as an actor, saying, "When I read that scene, I kinda loved it. I love the way Ramsay had Theon watching. It was all so messed up. It's also so daunting for me to do it. [...] I think it's going to be the most challenging season for me so far, just because it's so emotional for her. It's not just crying all the time, like seasons 2 or 3, it's super messed up." She had since gone on to interview for the DailyMail about it and that the scene had inspired her to work for organizations to stop violence against women and to help underprivileged girls and women in Africa in similar situations. Iwan Rheon (Ramsay Bolton) agreed, referring to Turner's performances this season as "absolutely amazing."
Some viewers, including U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, announced that they would stop watching the show because of this scene. According to Business Insider, this scene and increased use of streaming services are likely reasons why ratings dropped from 6.2 million viewers for this episode to 5.4 million for the next episode, "The Gift." However, there is some question as to how much of this drop is attributable to its Memorial Day weekend air date. Rebecca Martin of Wetpaint maintains that the air date was probably the only reason for the decrease in ratings. The season two episode "Blackwater," which also aired on Memorial Day, also suffered a notable drop in ratings. No episode was aired on Memorial Day weekend in either season three or season four. Whatever the reason, the ratings for the episode after "The Gift," "Hardhome," were higher than those of both previous episodes.

Intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) is a nutritional support therapy (medical nutrition therapy) for people on hemodialysis who have a difficult time maintaining adequate nutrition. It is administered directly into the bloodstream of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an effort to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality experienced in patients with kidney failure. IDPN contains protein (amino acids), carbohydrates (dextrose), and fats (lipids) in an attempt to meet a patient's weekly nutritional needs. Solutions can be individualized for each patient based on weight, needs, medical history and enteral intake.
History
Prior to 1990, traditional therapies for dialysis patients, such as liberalized diet and oral supplements, led to protein and/or calorie malnutrition.
Efforts to supplement nutritional intake by providing nutrients during the dialysis procedure were attempted. As a result, IDPN became an established therapy to replete malnourished CKD-5 dialysis patients in the early 1990s. Generally the patients received a set formulation containing standard amounts of dextrose, amino acids and lipids regardless of the patient's weight, dialysis time, and complicating co-morbid conditions.
New approach to IDPN therapy
To address specific nutritional needs of individual patients, several providers of IDPN therapy developed formulations that take clinical variables into account in order to best fit the patient's individual needs and condition. Specific formulations address distinct differences between nutritional needs of those patients who exhibit protein malnutrition and those patients who exhibit calorie malnutrition.

Metzudat Ze'ev (, lit. "Ze'ev's fortress / stronghold") is an office building on 38 King George Street in Tel-Aviv, Israel. It is also known as Beit Jabotinsky (, lit. "Jabotinsky's House") or HaMetzuda (, lit. "the fortress / stronghold").
History
Metzudat Ze'ev is one of the oldest towers in Tel Aviv. It is built on the site of the shack that, during the 1930s, served as the headquarters of the Revisionist Zionism movement, Betar youth movement, and as the secret meeting place of the Irgun fighters.
In 1936, these movements consolidated a plan for a new building. The building's architect was Mordechai Ben-Horin. Built in a Brutalist style, its construction lasted until 1963. Upon completion, at , it was one of the tallest buildings in Tel Aviv.
The building is named after the founder of the Revisionist Zionism movement, Ze'ev Jabotinsky and served as the headquarters of the Herut party headed by Menachem Begin, the predecessor of the Likud party.
When it was still a three-floor building, the Betar youth conducted their meetings in the inner courtyard, where a big mural slogan stated: "The Betar Bow has not turned back, and the sword-head of Betar shall not return in vain, Amen!"
On the night of the 1977 "political upheaval", when for the first time in Israel's history, the right wing won an election, Menachem Begin delivered his victory speech to an audience of party activists in the Independence Hall of the building.
Today, the building houses the Likud party's staff, the Betar movement, the Herut Women organization, the Mishkei Herut Beitar settlement movement, the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel and Jabotinsky Museum, the Irgun Museum and the Partisans and Fighters Museum. The rest is occupied by businesses.

Red House (also: Kamana Court) located in Kingston, Georgetown, was the official residence of the Colonial Secretary and later the Premier of British Guiana. As of 22 March 2000, it houses the Cheddi Jagan Research Centre.
History
The Red House is a wooden colonial building from the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the building was owned by Eustace Woolford, a former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. In 1925, the building was acquired by the government of British Guiana to serve as official residence of the Colonial Secretary.
In 1961, the Red House became the official residence for Cheddi Jagan, the first Premier of British Guiana. Forbes Burnham was elected in 1964 and changed the official residence to Castellani House. From 1964 onwards, the Red House was used by various governmental agencies. In 1972, the Non-Aligned Conference was held in Georgetown, and the Red House was renamed Kamana Court. The building was declared a national monument of Guyana.
Cheddi Jagan Research Centre
On 22 March 2000, the Cheddi Jagan Research Centre, a centre dedicated to the life and work of Cheddi Jagan, opened in the Red House. The centre is operated by friends and family of Jagan who had signed a 99-year lease on the building. On 29 December 2016, the lease was revoked by President David A. Granger who had planned to move the National Trust of Guyana into the building. The centre took the matter to the courts who ruled on 16 August 2020 that Granger's revocation was illegal and unlawful, and that the centre could retain the lease.

Marco Kartodikromo (1890 – 18 March 1932), also known by his pen name Mas Marco, was an Indonesian journalist and writer.
Born to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family in Blora, Dutch East Indies, Kartodikromo's first employment was with the national railway. Disgusted by the racism shown there, in 1911 he moved to Bandung and found work as a journalist for Medan Prijaji. The following year he moved to Surakarta and worked with two publications, Saro Tomo and Doenia Bergerak; he soon began to write pieces critical against the Dutch colonial government, which led to his arrest. After a period as a correspondent in the Netherlands, Kartodikromo continued his journalism and critique of the government; he also wrote several pieces of fiction. Involved with the Communist Party of Indonesia, after a 1926 communist-led revolt Kartodikromo was exiled to Boven-Digoel prison camp in Papua. He died in the camp of malaria in 1932.
Kartodikromo, who preferred writing in Malay, experimented with new phrasings at a time when the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise the language. According to literary critic Bakri Siregar, he was the first Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country. For this vocal criticism, the Dutch government decried him as a "crazy" man who could spark unrest among the native populations.
Biography
Early life and career
Kartodikromo was born in Blora, Central Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1890 to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family. At the age of fifteen, he took up a job at the Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg, the national railway company of the Indies, in Semarang. In 1911 he chose to leave the company as he was disgusted by its racist policies, including the use of race as a basis for the amount paid in wages.
Kartodikromo made his way to Bandung, West Java, where he found employment at Medan Prijaji, a newspaper run by Tirto Adhi Soerjo. When the paper was closed by the Dutch, in 1912 Kartodikromo went to Surakarta. There, he joined Sarekat Islam, an organisation of Muslim merchants, and found employment at the Sarekat Islam-backed weekly Saro Tomo. In 1914 he took lead of the magazine Doenia Bergerak. The paper was the mouthpiece of the Native Indonesian Journalists' Group (), which Kartodikromo led and had helped establish with Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo and Darnakoesoemo. That same year, he published the three-volume work Mata Gelap (Dark Eyes); this led to a long polemic between Doenia Bergerak and the Chinese-owned Tjoen Tjioe in Surabaya due to perceived racism.
While with Doenia Bergerak, Kartodikromo wrote an attack on the Dutch Advisor on Native Affairs R.A. Rinkes; in his editorial, he wrote that the Dutch loved themselves far more than the natives they were subjugating. On 26 January 1915, Kartodikromo came under investigation by the Justice Office of the Dutch East Indies for publishing several further anti-Dutch editorials. The journalist unsuccessfully attempted to raise money to protest this at the Dutch parliament in The Hague. He was convicted of revolutionary activity and sentenced to nine months at Mlaten Prison; however, due to public outcry he was released after 100 days. When Doenia Bergerak went bankrupt, Kartodipuro then headed the Saro Tomo.
Further career, exile, and death
Kartodikromo was soon chosen by Goenawan, chief editor of the daily Pantjaran Warta, to go to the Netherlands as a correspondent. In his five months there at the end of 1916 and beginning of 1917, the journalist published Boekoe Sebaran Jang Pertama (The First Publication Book). After his return to Indonesia, he became an editor for Pantjaran Warta and based himself in Batavia (now Jakarta). Within a month he was imprisoned again for his writing.
On 21 February 1918 Kartodikromo was released from prison. He moved to Semarang and became a commissioner of the Sarekat Islam with Semaun; he also joined the newspaper Sinar Djawa (later Sinar Hindia). In a conference that year, Kartodikromo stated that there were two kinds of press in Indonesia: the "black press" (), which struggled against the imperialistic Dutch; and the "white press" (), which worked to subjugate the Indonesian people.
In 1918 he published Student Hidjo (Student Green), which told of a young Indonesian student who falls in love while studying in the Netherlands despite already having a fiancée in Indonesia. The work, originally published as a serial, was novelised in 1919. Also in 1918 he published a collection of poems, Sair-sair Rempah (Poems on Spices).
Kartodikromo published another novel, Matahariah, in 1919. It was based on the life of the Dutch spy Mata Hari. On 15 December 1919, Kartodikromo left Sinar Hindia and took a position as head of Soero Tamtomo, published by the Forestry Union Staff Union Wono Tamtomo. He was imprisoned for six months for one of his writings, Sjairnja Sentot (Sentot's Poem), with the paper. In 1921 Kartodikromo moved to Salatiga and became involved with the press there. He was sentenced to two years in a Batavian prison for another of his writings.
In 1924, Kartodikromo published Rasa Merdika (A Sense of Independence), which dealt with a young man who goes against his priyayi father, a tool of the Dutch colonial government, and tries to find personal independence. Another novel, Cermin Buah Keroyalan (Mirror of the Fruit of Royalty), and stage play, Kromo Bergerak (Kromo is Moving), were published not long after.
Kartodikromo was exiled to Boven-Digoel, Papua, in 1926 for his writings and involvement in the 1926 revolt led by the Communist Party of Indonesia. He died there of malaria on 18 March 1932.
Themes and styles
Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works took place in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most nationalist writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he did write several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, phrases, and scenes which had never before been used.
Socialist literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Kartodikromo drew on his experiences while visiting the Netherlands in writing Studen Hidjo. He also writes that, unlike writers published by Balai Pustaka, Kartodikromo was heavily against the "white superiority" which the Dutch impressed upon native Indonesians; this was achieved through showcasing the "depravity of bourgeois morals and the Dutch colonials."
Reception
Due to his vocal criticism of the Dutch, the East Indies government banned Kartodikromo's books several times. In response to his critiques in Doenia Bergerak, they described him as a "crazy" man who could spark unrest among the native populations. Kartodikromo himself enjoyed baiting the colonial government, reportedly inviting his readers to work together and criticise the Dutch for their "mismanagement and caprice".
Siregar described Kartodikromo as the first Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country; he also notes that the writer was the first Indonesian to consciously depict class struggles in his works. As Siregar considered Indonesian literature to have been born from a nationalist understanding, he considered Marco one of the first truly Indonesian writers.
Hendrik Maier, a lecturer at Leiden University, writes that Kartodikromo was "primarily inspired by dreams and ideals", noting that the writer intended to create a community of politically aware Indonesians to work against the colonial government in solidarity and equality. Kartodikromo described his ideal political state as having "" ("the same standards, the same feelings").

The field elm cultivar Ulmus minor 'Stricta', known as Cornish elm, was commonly found in South West England (Cornwall and West Devon), Brittany, and south-west Ireland, until the arrival of Dutch elm disease in the late 1960s. The origin of Cornish elm in England remains a matter of contention. It is commonly assumed to have been introduced from Brittany. It is also considered possible that the tree may have survived the ice ages on lands to the south of Cornwall long since lost to the sea. Henry thought it "probably native in the south of Ireland". Dr Max Coleman of Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, arguing in his 2002 paper on British elms that there was no clear distinction between species and subspecies, suggested that known or suspected clones of Ulmus minor, once cultivated and named, should be treated as cultivars, preferred the designation U. minor 'Stricta' to Ulmus minor var. stricta. The DNA of 'Stricta' has been investigated and the cultivar is now known to be a clone.
Mature trees are now largely restricted to Australia, where it was introduced in the 19th century.
Description
Growing to a height of up to in sheltered situations (in exposed situations it is usually half the size), the Cornish elm is a slender, slow-growing deciduous tree, distinguished by its long, straight trunk, which culminates in a narrow fan-shaped crown comprising short, straight, ascending branches. The leaves are small, obovate to oval, typically acuminate at the apex, 6 cm long by 3.5 cm broad, with a dark-green upper surface, glossy and smooth. The perfect apetalous wind-pollinated flowers occur in clusters of 15–20 on very short pedicels. The samarae rarely ripen in England, but when mature are very similar to those of others in the field elm group, being mostly obovate, 16 mm long by 10 mm broad. A survey of Cornish elms in County Cork, Ireland (2007), found some variation in smoothness or roughness of leaf-surface and in basal asymmetry.
Dr Oliver Rackham (1986) noted that Cornish elms with "more spreading" crowns grow around Truro and on the Lizard Peninsula, illustrating the variety, which he called 'Lizard Elm', with a 1980 photograph. The large old specimen of Cornish elm in Castletownbere Cemetery in County Cork, Ireland (see 'Notable trees' below) matches Rackham's description and photograph of his 'Lizard Elm'.
Pests and diseases
Cornish elm is very susceptible to Dutch elm disease, but suckers remain a common component of hedgerows in parts of Cornwall, and thus the genetic resources of this cultivar are not considered endangered. Like other field elms, propagation is almost entirely by suckers, which the tree produces copiously.
Cultivation and uses
Cornish elm was traditionally considered the best shelter-belt tree along the Cornish coast. Its timber was much prized for its strength, and was commonly used in wheel and wagon construction. Working Cornish pilot gigs were traditionally built from Cornish elm: the Rules of the Cornish Pilot Gig Association specified that to take part in gig races the boat should be made from "Cornish narrow-leaved elm". Ley (1910) described Cornish elm as "abundant in Brittany, very abundant in West Cornwall, becoming less abundant in East Cornwall and West Devon". Cornish elm was later cultivated as an ornamental tree in parts of southern England and southern Ireland, and, more rarely, in UK urban plantings. Hillier & Sons nursery, Winchester, Hampshire, was among the nurseries that supplied it, carefully distinguishing it from Wheatley elm. The locations of notable plantings of Cornish elm, both in Cornwall and beyond, are listed in Henry (1913), Richens (1983), and Mitchell (1996).
Few mature specimens are known to survive in the wild in England. Only one is known in Cornwall (see under 'Notable trees'), while about 18 reputedly grow in the Brighton & Hove enclave. Another two have been reported (2009) from East Sussex at Selmeston, near the footpath across the grounds of Sherrington Manor. Two specimens survive in Edinburgh (2019), an old tree in Dean Gardens, and a younger by Greenside Church, Calton Hill.
The Wheatley or Guernsey elm (Ulmus minor 'Sarniensis') was often misnamed "Cornish elm" in the UK by the local authorities who planted it extensively.
Introduced to the US, Ulmus campestris cornubiensis, 'Cornish elm', appeared from the 1860s in catalogues of the Mount Hope Nursery (also known as Ellwanger and Barry) of Rochester, New York, later catalogues distinguishing it from Wheatley Elm. Cornish Elm also appeared separately from Wheatley Elm in the catalogues of the Perry Nursery Co. of Rochester, N.Y.
A cultivar supplied as 'Cornubiensis' remains in cultivation in Australia, but Spencer, describing it in Horticultural Flora of South-Eastern Australia (1995), noted that it was not type-'Stricta'. He gave as an example the elms beside St. Stephen's Church, Mittagong, NSW. The tree labelled (2022) 'Cornish Elm' in Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria (Melbourne), is the hybrid 'Purpurea', cultivated in south-eastern Australia and thought by Dutch elm-authority F. J. Fontaine to be a Cornish elm "cross".
Notable trees
The Great Elm of Rosuic, an ancient pollard elm which attained a d.b.h. of over before succumbing to disease, continues to produce suckers.
, the Woodland Trust lists only one verified mature Cornish elm surviving in Cornwall, a specimen in girth at Tregoose near Helston. A large specimen with a forked trunk stands in Castletownbere Cemetery in County Cork, Ireland, with a bole-girth (2007) of 450 cm (making it about 150 years old), a height of 25 m and a crown diameter of 20 m, along with a small number of younger Cornish elms with an average d.b.h. of 143 cm.

Varieties
An Ulmus stricta parvifolia, a "less common" form of Cornish elm, was described by Lindley in A Synopsis of British Flora, arranged according to the Natural Order (1829), from trees in Cornwall and North Devon, with "leaves much smaller" than Cornish elm, "less oblique at the base, finely and regularly crenate" and "acuminate" rather than, as in Cornish elm, "cuspidate". Melville considered Goodyer's elm a variety of Cornish elm. Some nurseries listed 'Dickson's Golden Elm' as form of Cornish elm.
Hybrids
It has been suggested that the cultivar 'Daveyi' is a natural hybrid of Wych elm and Cornish elm; likewise 'Exoniensis'. The botanist F. J. Fontaine conjectured that the cultivar Ulmus 'Purpurea' is related to the Cornish elm.
'Stricta'-like elms
An U. campestris cornubiensis (syn. U. glabra cornubiensis) was distributed by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the late 19th century and early 20th. Henry stated that the "beautiful narrow pyramidal tree" he had seen by that name in Späth's nursery differed from true Cornish elm, bearing instead "leaves similar in size and appearance to a common form of U. nitens" [:U. minor]. One specimen of Späth's U. campestris cornubiensis was supplied to the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada in 1897, and three to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902, one being planted in the Garden proper and cultivated as U. stricta, the other two being planted in the city. In 1958 Melville likewise queried Späth's Cornish elm (see External links below, herbarium specimen E00824799); Edward Kemp, however, RBGE curator (1950–71), accepted it. A specimen of what appears from herbarium specimens to be the same clone survives (2016) in Edinburgh (height about 25 m, girth about 2 m), in Douglas Crescent Gardens. The latter also matches an 1825 herbarium specimen labelled "U. suberosa var., Hort. Millburn".
In art
Landscape-paintings depicting Cornish elm include Holman Hunt's watercolour Helston, Cornwall (1860), showing hedgerow elms, and the watercolour Egloshayle, Cornwall by Thomas Campbell-Bennett (1858-1948), showing Cornish elms beside the River Camel, opposite the church of St Mary, Egloshayle. The latter illustrates Gerald Wilkinson's observation that "In its normal habitat the Cornish elm often has a flat, wind-cut top".

Pidgin Madam is a term describing a language that is a mixture of Lebanese Arabic and traditional Sinhalese. Since the oil boom of the 1970s, several forms of Pidgin Arabic, such as Gulf Pidgin Arabic, evolved to become a popular form of communication due to foreign workers coming from South and South Eastern Asian countries. These workers tend to live and work in urban cities.
History
Pidgin Madam is largely spoken by Sinhalese/Sri Lankan women working in the Levant area of the Middle East, and involved the communication mostly between Lebanese Madames, and Sinhalese servants, hence the name Pidgin Madam. Pidgin Madam was constructed through pidginization, and locally recognized in the areas where the language is spoken. There are an estimated 730,000 Sri Lankan Domestic workers abroad, 350,000 of which are working in the Middle East and spread between the following countries; 160,000 in the UAE, 80,000 in Lebanon, 40,000 in Kuwait, 40,000 in Oman, 30,000 in Qatar, and 30,000 in Jordan. The Pidgin tends to be spoken by all Sinahalese workers in this region, apart from areas where an English Pidgin is more popular. Although we know an estimate of the number of Sinahalese workers in the Middle East, the number of fluent speakers of the Pidgin is unrecorded, and would need to be investigated through studying Arabic families (with Sinhalese servants) in the regions.
Sociological context
Sri Lankan woman started to arrive specifically in Lebanon in the late 1970s, and represent three quarters of immigrant female domestic workers in Lebanon. The workers would be placed with large upper-class Lebanese families (typically with many young children) through recruitment agencies, and would be contracted under 3 year agreements. These domestic workers tend to live with the family and may participate in special occasions such as holiday's abroad, or religious celebrations. Workers are usually confined with the family within the 3 years, and may renew their contract with the same family if a close relationship is established between the family, children, and foreign worker. The worker may take on tasks to help the family such as laundry, preparing food, and other day-to-day chores.
Linguistic context
Lebanese and Sinhalese are very different languages which have been combined to form this Pidgin. Lebanese is a Semitic language belonging to the Eastern Dialects of Arabic, with a long historical contact to Syriac. There is French influence over the language to the colonial history of France in the Levant. Lebanese Arabic is a language belonging to the Levant dialects of Arabic. Sinahala is within Indo-Aryan context, with a dravidophone environment, as well as contact with Hela/Elu, an instinct indigenous language.
Language acquisition
The Family host "Madam" takes charge of educating the newly arrived domestic worker by introducing her to basic, simple sentences, emphasizing communication through eye contact, and touch. The worker may take different lengths of time to become accustomed to the new environment, but after a typical 6-7 months, the pidgin tends to evolve in a personalized way to form a communication method between the hosts and the worker. As time evolves and the worker becomes more comfortable and familiarized with the new environment and means of communication, reliance on physical gesturing to assist communication diminishes.
There is a third-person feminine singular, which is the most common designation. The "Madam" tends to be the only one who truly masters the Pidgin, and translates between Sri Lankan as communication becomes deeper. There are two primary dilemmas that are involved in adopting a pidgin between the servant and the master. The first involves the need of privacy, where a family may use complex forms of communication to purposely exclude the servant from communication. The second involves a need for an upgraded effort to adopt the language further when necessary.
In the Pidgin, there are "imperative forms that are used as a verbal base, forms of the modal incompleteness which, in fact, are the forms that are hard inside the prohibitive, minus the article".

The Fay B. Kaigler Children's Book Festival is an annual book festival that was founded in 1968 and is sponsored by The University of Southern Mississippi.
History
Early years
In 1968, Dr. Warren Tracy, chairman of the Library Science Department and university librarian for The University of Southern Mississippi, saw his vision for a children's literature conference come to life. The university, under the leadership of Dr. William D. McCain, and the Library Science department hosted the Conference on the Writing, Illustrating, and Publishing of Children's Books, the first of what soon became the annual Children's Book Festival.
Two years earlier, Dr. Lena de Grummond, professor of Library Science, with Dr. Tracy's blessing, had begun to procure early children's books to support the Library Science program. She spent countless hours writing to authors and illustrators of contemporary children's books to acquire original material for the library. Contributions of artwork and manuscripts flowed in from across the United States and Canada. Today, more than 1200 authors and illustrators are represented in the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection.
In his original vision for a children's literature conference, Dr. Tracy saw the conference as a way to highlight the de Grummond Collection. That first conference in May 1968 was designed to announce the opening of the special children's literature collection. Librarians, teachers, parents, and other adults interested in promoting children's literature were invited for three days of exhibits, workshops, and panel discussions led by publishers and editors of children's books. Dr. Francis Lander Spain, past president of the American Library Association and former head of the children's department of the New York Public Library, spoke at the first evening session, which was open to the public.
In 1969, the conference became known as the Children's Book Festival and included an event that became an honored tradition – presentation of The University of Southern Mississippi Medallion, an award for distinguished service in the field of children's literature. A committee of professionals associated with children's literature selects the recipient each year. Unique among literary prizes, the medallion is awarded for an individual's total body of work, rather than for one particular work, and each medallion is different. Cast in silver for the recipient and for permanent display in the de Grummond Collection, in bronze for sale to the public, a profile of the honoree is engraved on the face, or obverse, of the medallion, and an illustration from the honoree's work is engraved on the reverse side. Since the first award to author Lois Lenski at the Second Annual Children's Book Festival, the Southern Miss Medallion has been presented to an outstanding array of children's authors and illustrators.
1970s–1980s
From 1977 to 1980, Dr. Onva K. Boshears served as director of the festival. Dr. Jeannine Laughlin-Porter assumed the directorship in 1980. That was the year Ezra Jack Keats, internationally acclaimed author and illustrator for children, was invited to accept the Southern Miss Medallion. Following his visit, Keats became one of the strongest supporters of the Children's Book Festival and the de Grummond Collection. Since his death, the university has acquired his personal and professional papers, original artwork, typescripts, and dummies and preliminary sketches for 36 of his books. The materials are now housed in the de Grummond Collection. In 1985, the Keats Foundation established an Ezra Jack Keats lectureship, with Barbara Cooney as the artist honoree and Brian Alderson as the first Keats lecturer. Children's Authors Speak, a collection of speeches compiled by Dr. Laughlin-Porter and Sherry Laughlin, was published in 1993 and includes a number of Keats lectures, as well as speeches by Southern Miss Medallion honorees.
1990s–present
Dr. Boshears, during Dr. Laughlin-Porter's directorship of the festival, continued to work closely with her and chaired the Medallion Selection Committee through spring 1993. In 1994, he resumed directorship of the festival and continued as director until his retirement in 2001. Dr. Rosemary Chance, an assistant professor in the School of Library and Information Science, became the director of the festival in 2002. Upon Dr. Chance's retirement in 2004, Dr. Catharine Bomhold became the director of the Fay B. Kaigler Children's Book Festival.
In 1998, Miss Fay B. Kaigler, a retired elementary school teacher and native Mississippian, funded the first Kaigler–Lamont Award to be given for distinguished service to children by a librarian or teacher. On December 5, 2001, the festival was renamed in honor of Miss Kaigler, who contributed a planned gift to the festival.
The University of Southern Mississippi Medallion
The University of Southern Mississippi Medallion, sometimes promoted as the Southern Miss Medallion, annually recognizes one person for "outstanding contributions in the field of children's literature". It was inaugurated at the second annual Festival in 1969.
"Silver medallions are cast for the recipient, for the president of The University of Southern Mississippi, for members of the medallion selection committee, and for the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection's permanent display. In addition, bronze medallions are cast and are available for purchase during the festival." —2010 Program
Recipients
The Medallion is a lifetime achievement award that will be conferred for the 47th time at the annual conference in April 2015.

Imma chlorosoma is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1906. It is found in Assam, India.
The wingspan is about 27 mm. The forewings are dark purple fuscous with an ochreous-whitish basal patch, the outer edge running from the base of the costa to one-fourth of the dorsum, more ochreous towards the costa. There are very indistinct dots of ochreous suffusion on the costa at two-fifths and three-fifths and before the apex and some slight ochreous suffusion towards the tornus. The hindwings have the dorsal area clothed with dense long hairs. They are fuscous, becoming dark fuscous posteriorly. There is a basal patch of white suffusion and an irregular elongate-triangular patch of white suffusion in the disc, on which the lower margin of the cell appears as a dark fuscous intersecting line.

The Caverns Historic District comprises the central developed area of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The complex was built between the early 1920s and 1942, initially in Pueblo Revival style, and later in New Mexico Territorial Revival style in the area around the natural entrance to Carlsbad Caverns. The earlier structures are built of local limestone, the later buildings in adobe. Thirteen buildings in the district are considered contributing structures. Buildings built between 1940 and 1942 were constructed with labor provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
Design
Early planning for the development of the park started with work by Daniel Ray Hull of the National Park Service Landscape Engineering Division in Los Angeles, who established the Pueblo Revival style in the park. Thomas Chalmers Vint continued Hull's work from the division's new location in San Francisco, renamed the NPS Western Field Office, as its chief. During survey work in the caverns, Vint slipped and fell, breaking his leg. A cowboy named Jim White was sent for help, which arrived after several hours. Vint had to make a long train ride to El Paso, Texas to have his leg set. The incident highlighted the need for safe, well-planned visitor accommodations in the park.
The rustic designs proved popular with park visitors and became a feature of the park. A similar structure was built in the town of Carlsbad as a residence for the park superintendent.
Description
Bunk House and Mess Hall, NPS Building 16 The Pueblo style building was designed by Thomas Chalmers Vint of the National Park Service and was built in 1932 by Armstrong and Armstrong contractors of Roswell, New Mexico. The building incorporates a 1927 residence designed by park superintendent Thomas Boles. The one-story building is on several levels following the contour of its hillside site, with eleven original rooms. A lounge space, now known as the "chapel," featured a higher level of finish.
Employee Residence, NPS Building 6 was designed in 1927 by Thomas Boles as a residence for cave guides. Buildings 7, 8 and 9 are substantially similar, all in Pueblo Revival style. They were enlarged under the direction of Thomas Vint in 1932.
Employee Residence, NPS Building 13 was designed by Vint in 1931, enlarged to a duplex in 1932 and eventually converted to a men's dormitory.
Employee Residence Duplex, NPS Building 14A/B was designed as two connected residences by Vint in 1932.
Employee Residence, NPS Building 15 was designed by Vint in 1932. Like Buildings 13 and 14, it was built by Armstrong and Armstrong. All of these buildings are in matching stone Pueblo Revival style.
Powerhouse: The center portion was designed in 1928 by Vint, with wings added for shops in 1931, in Pueblo GRevival style. The building was converted to a maintenance shop and storage area.
Multiple Dwelling Unit 1 and 2, NPS Buildings 25-A/B/C and 28-A/B/C These triplex residences were designed by architect Ken Saunders of the NPS Santa Fe office and revised by Lyle E. Bennett in Territorial Revival style in from 1940 to 1942, in a landscape designed by J.C. Miller, and were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
Warehouse, NPS Building 26 was designed by Saunders in 1941 in Territorial Revival style and built by CCC labor. Building 27, a garage, was also probably designed by Saunders
An elevator building for access to the caverns was completely enclosed by the 1957 park visitor center. Other buildings, now demolished, included a concessions building, built in 1928, and operated by the park concessioner, the Caverns Supply Company.
Bat flight amphitheater
From the end of May to October, the National Park Service hosts visitors in the Bat Flight Amphitheater to view Mexican free-tailed bats leaving the Carlsbad Cavern in large numbers at nightfall through its main entrance.
Built between 1963 and 1966, the amphitheater is made of limestone. It is about wide and made up of 22 rows of seating arranged in tiered arches and separated by a central aisle with a staircase. Overall, it drops down about .
The amphitheater is a contributing property to the Caverns Historic District, which mainly houses administrative buildings northwest of the amphitheater and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The upper part of the amphitheater is reached by the Carlsbad Caverns Trail, a hiking trail leading from the park's tourist office in the southwest, which then sinks into the cavern in the northeast. The trail has also been listed as a National Recreation Trail since 1983.
Landscaping
The parking terraces were designed by A.W. Burney of Yellowstone National Park's engineering division. Construction was supervised by park superintendent Boles, who was also an engineer. The terraces are designed to fit the local environment with rustic stone walls and landscaping with native plants. A cactus garden was established at the end of the parking area, designed by Park Service architect W.G. Carnes, incorporating a prehistoric mescal pit. A switchback trail leads to the natural cave entrance, with other footpaths and terraces to the residences and the administration building.
An amphitheater, built from 1963 to 1966 to allow visitors to view evening bat flights, continues the design tradition, blending with earlier construction.
Civilian Conservation Corps
A Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established at the separate Rattlesnake Springs unit of Carlsbad Caverns National Park in 1938. The arrival of the CCC coincided with a shift to Territorial Revival style architecture in the park, incorporating adobe construction. The camp remained until 1942, when it was disbanded.
Recent history
The ticket office, chief ranger's house, concessions building-comfort station, original powerhouse and the nursery-kennel building were demolished between 1959 and 1974 as intrusions in the area of the natural cave entrance. By 1984 the removal of toilet facilities was regretted, and a rustic stone structure was built near the bat flight amphitheater.
The Caverns Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 18, 1988.

The vegetarian finch (Platyspiza crassirostris) is a species of bird in the Darwin's finch group of the tanager family Thraupidae. It is the only member of the genus Platyspiza. It is endemic to the Galápagos Islands. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Systematics
The vegetarian finch is one of Darwin's finches, a group of closely related birds that evolved on the Galápagos Islands. The group is related to the Tiaris grassquits, which are found in South America and the Caribbean. An ancestral relative of those grassquits arrived on the Galápagos Islands some 2–3 million years ago, and the vegetarian finch is an early evolutionary radiation from that ancestor.
When Darwin first collected the species in 1835, he assumed it was a finch. John Gould, who formally described the vegetarian finch in 1837, placed it in a new genus Camarhynchus and coined the binomial name Camarhynchus crassirostris. The vegetarian finch is now placed in the genus Platyspiza that was introduced by Robert Ridgway in 1897. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Darwin's "finches" are actually members of the subfamily Coerebinae within the large tanager family Thraupidae.
The vegetarian finch is the sole member of the genus Platyspiza, which some taxonomists still subsume into the genus Camarhynchus. The genus name Platyspiza comes from the Greek platus, meaning "broad" and spiza, meaning "finch". The specific name crassirostris comes from the Latin crassus, meaning "heavy" or "thick" and rostris, meaning "-billed" (rostrum = bill). The "vegetarian" of its common name refers to its primary diet.
Description
The vegetarian finch is one of the largest Galápagos finches, measuring in length and ranging from in mass. Its upright stance is described as "parrot-like". Its beak is broad and stout, with a strongly curved culmen. The male's upperparts are olive-colored while his underparts are whitish, with smudgy streaking on the lower breast and flanks; some birds show rufous on the underparts. His lower flanks and undertail coverts are buffy. He has a black hood, throat, breast and upper flanks. His iris is dark, and his bill is black in the breeding season and horn-colored during the rest of the year. The female is principally brown above and off-white below, with a buffy rump and flanks. She is streaked with brown on the face, crown, upperparts, throat, breast and flanks, and shows two indistinct buffy wingbars on her brown wings. Her beak is two-toned; the upper mandible ranges in color from dusky brown to black, while the lower mandible is dull orange or dull pink. The immature male is intermediate between the adult male and the adult female. While he shows blackish on his face and throat, he is more streaked below than is the adult male.
Voice
The song of the vegetarian finch is nasal and drawn out, with each note lasting about two seconds. Transcribed as ph'wheeeuuuuu-íííúúú, it is accented towards the end. The bird's primary call is high-pitched and squealing, said to resemble the sound of a radio tuner. It also gives a whiny pheep.
Range and habitat
Endemic to the Galápagos, the vegetarian finch is found on eight islands: San Cristóbal, Santa Cruz, Floreana, Isabela, Marchena, Santiago, Pinta and Fernandina. Although it was previously found on Pinzón and Santa Fé, the species is now extinct on both islands. It is found from above sea level. Although it is most common in montane evergreen forest, particularly the transition zone, its range also extends up into the humid zone and down into the arid zone.
Behavior
Breeding
Little is known about the breeding ecology of this species. It breeds primarily in the wet season, building a grassy domed nest with a side entrance. Courtship feeding is known to occur throughout courtship and incubation, with some pairs passing food items back and forth several times.
Feeding
As its name suggests, the vegetarian finch is largely a plant-eater. It feeds primarily on buds, leaves, flowers and fruit, and will strip the bark off twigs to get to the cambium and phloem which lies underneath. Although it forages mainly in trees, it will descend to the ground to search for fallen fruits and young plant shoots. It also occasionally eats caterpillars. It feeds primarily at mid-levels, in what has been described as a "rather leisurely" manner. Because its principal food items are soft, the vegetarian finch has a beak morphology unlike those of Darwin's finches which specialize on hard seeds. Described as "parrot-like", the beak is small and stout, with a steep profile and a strong curve in the upper mandible. Its primary function is food manipulation at the tip, rather than seed crushing at the base. The vegetarian finch has a disproportionately large gizzard, as well as a long intestine and a disproportionately small heart. These allow it to process the "relatively indigestible" leaves and buds that make up a large proportion of its diet.
Conservation and threats
Although the vegetarian finch is uncommon, it is widespread across the Galápagos Islands. Its numbers appear to be stable, though they have not been quantified. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as a species of the least concern, as neither its population size nor its range size approach thresholds for concern. Like all endemic wildlife on the Galápagos Islands, though, it is impacted by some human activities. Fires, overgrazing by domestic and feral animals, and the introduction of exotic species are among the most serious threats it faces. It is found in seven of the important bird areas established on the islands.

USS Cahaba (AO-82) was an acquired by the United States Navy for use during World War II. She had the dangerous but necessary task of providing fuel to vessels in combat and non-combat areas primarily in the Pacific Ocean. For her brave efforts, she received eight battle stars during the war.
Cahaba, a T2-SE-A2 tanker hull, was launched on 19 May 1943 as Lackawapen (later changed to Lackawaxen) by Marinship Corp., Sausalito, California, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1261), sponsored by Mrs. B. Bloomquist. Transferred to the Navy on 15 August 1943 and commissioned on 14 January 1944 and reported to the Pacific Fleet.
World War II Pacific Theatre operations
Cahaba cleared San Pedro, California, on 11 February 1944 for Pearl Harbor and Majuro, arriving on 1 April. After two weeks as station oiler there, she put to sea to fuel task force TF 58 from 13 April to 2 May, as the massive task force hurled air attacks against the Palaus, Truk, and Hollandia. Returning to Majuro, the oiler based there for two fueling runs to Kwajalein and one refueling voyage to Pearl Harbor between 3 May and 13 June.
With the development of the Marianas operation, Cahaba's base became Eniwetok from 28 June, as she fueled 5th Fleet ships for their strikes on Guam, Saipan, and Tinian. As the fleet she served moved westward, Cahaba followed, serving as station oiler at Ulithi from 13 October to 27 December, along with refueling 3rd Fleet units at sea from 14 to 30 October. Supporting the Lingayen Gulf Covering Force, the oiler took station in Kossol Roads from 28 December 1944 to 26 January 1945, then returned to Ulithi. She contributed to the successful assault on Iwo Jima by fueling TF 58 ships at sea from 23 February to 4 March.
End-of-war activity
Following a much-needed overhaul, Cahaba sailed from San Pedro, California, to the kamikaze-ridden waters off Okinawa, delivering oil to the station tanker at Kerama Retto late in June 1945. Through the close of the war, she sailed out of Ulithi refueling the 3rd Fleet at sea as it carried out its final smashing raids on the Japanese homeland.

This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1644.
Events
April 15 – The second Globe Theatre is demolished by the Puritan government to make room for new housing.
November 23 – Publication in London of Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Print, to the Parlament of England.
December (end) – English Puritan controversialist Hezekiah Woodward is questioned for two days about "scandalous" pamphlets.
With the London theatres closed by the Puritan regime, playwriting activity shifts to closet drama. The publication of an anonymous satire against Archbishop William Laud, titled Canterbury His Change of Diet, is one mark of the shift.
The publication of The Bloody Tenet of Persecution marks the start of a major controversy between Roger Williams and John Cotton on religious tolerance in a Calvinist context. The controversy plays out through a series of works issued by both men in the coming years, down to Williams' The Bloody Tenet Yet More Bloody (1652).

The Oregon and Transcontinental Company was a 19th-century holding company in the United States, organized by Henry Villard in 1881 to control the Northern Pacific Railroad and Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. It was incorporated in Oregon. New Jersey passed legislation in 1889 to facilitate the control of other companies by another corporation with a goal of encouraging trusts to convert into holding companies and relocate to that state. Oregon and Transcontinental in 1890 re-incorporated as a holding company in New Jersey and became the North American Company so that it could take advantage of these expanded corporate powers and invest in a wider range of businesses.

Terese Nielsen (born March 11, 1966) is an American freelance fantasy artist and illustrator.
Early life, education, and family
Nielsen was born in Aurora, Nebraska, in 1966. Nielsen's brother, Ron Spencer, is also an artist.
In 1984 Nielsen followed her brother and relocated to Rexburg, Idaho, where they studied art at Ricks College. Upon completing her studies there, she studied at the Art Center College of Design (ACCD) in Pasadena, California, graduating with "great distinction" in 1991.
She married Cliff Nielsen, another ACCD graduate, and they illustrated Ruins (1995); they have since divorced. She has four children and resides in Temple City, California, with her wife.
Career
Landmark Entertainment hired Nielsen to help design its themed amusement parks, and DC and Marvel Comics hired her to illustrate several superhero trading cards. She illustrated Marvel graphic novels, one of which was Ruins, which she did with her then-husband, Cliff Nielsen. For Topps, she painted several Xena covers, as well as Star Wars covers for Dark Horse.
Nielsen illustrated the graphic novella that was included as part of the 1993 video game Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers. In a favorable review, Scott A. May wrote, "Nielsen's dark, disturbing visions carry over to many of the game's hand painted back-drops, drawn from a gloomy palette of deep red, blue, and black." In the video game genre, her influence can be seen in Sierra's Gabriel Knight series, and in her work for 3DO's Meridian 59, and she worked with Mythic Entertainment creating the look for the advertising campaign promoting the interactive internet game Dark Age of Camelot.
She began working for Wizards of the Coast in 1996. Nielsen has gained a fan following mainly because of her illustrations for the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. Nielsen has produced art for both Magic and Wizards of the Coast's other products since 1996, in addition to her work as an illustrator of book covers & interiors and movie posters. She has served as a juror for the Spectrum Awards. She created several images for the Harry Potter Trading Card Game, released in 2001.
In reviewing her work "Savant" in the Wildstorm Gallery collection released in 1996, critic Joseph Szadkowski wrote, "Imagine British artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti tickled into a mood by a Sex Pistols album to fully appreciate the Nielsen style." Szadkowski also praised Nielsen's work in the Marvel Comics Code of Honor series (1997).
She created the look for the Sembia series of Forgotten Realms novels, and for Greg Keyes' Age of Unreason series published by Del Rey. Endorsed by Lucas, she was involved in several Star Wars pieces for The New Jedi Order, also published by Del Rey. Nielsen did the cover artwork for the Dungeons & Dragons settings Jakandor, Land of Legend and Jakandor, Isle of Destiny in 1998 and illustrated the covers of three issues of Dragon.
In 1999 the Alderac Entertainment Group published the Gamemasters' guide for the 7th Sea role-playing game, with all art covers since then (main guides and supplements) primarily painted by Nielsen. Also in 1999, she received a nomination for a Chesley Award for Best Gaming-Related Illustration for her illustration of the Magic: The Gathering card "Ertai, Wizard Adept".
Nielsen was a Gen Con artist guest of honor in 2014.
Nielsen has contributed art to the digital collectible card game Hearthstone.
Controversy
On June 18, 2020, during the "Weekly MTG" Twitch stream, Wizards of the Coast revealed that they had ended their relationship with Nielsen and that "the last product that will have any reprint art" by her would be released in the coming fall.
This action by Wizards coincided with growing fan concerns over Nielsen's views, notably regarding trans people, her liking or retweeting of alt-right activists, conspiracy theorists and racists tweets. Among other things, Nielsen gifted and signed some of her art to QAnon and conspiracy-focused YouTube channel Edge of Wonder.

Henchir Bez is an archaeological site in Tunisia, located at 36° 00′ 23″ N, 9° 32 in the hills overlooking the Oued Miliane river, west of Tunis. Identified by a recently discovered inscription, it is the ruins of the Roman civitas of Vazi Sarra, which include a Christian Basilica and a Byzantine/Roman fort.
Ruins
The ruins at Henchir Bez have been identified as the remains of Vazitana Sarra Civitas (Vazi Sarara), a civitas of the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis.
The remains at Henchir Bez include a Bascilica and a fort. The fort was originally a temple dedicated to Mercury Soberus.
Etymology
The name Henchir Bez means the "ruins of Bez" where 'bez' probably derives from the ancient "Vaz[i]" through Linguisitic Fortition. The name Vazitana Sarra Civitas is supported by recent epigraphical finds
Bishopric
The ancient Roman town of Vazi-Sarra was also the seat of an ancient Catholic Bishopric. It existed until the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, and is now a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.
Another ancient Bishopric, Marcelliana, was located nearby. However, its exact location is unknown.

In January 2014, Nauru's President Baron Waqa fired the country's only magistrate Peter Law, and cancelled the visa of its Chief Justice Geoffrey Eames (both Australian-based justices). Law was fired after issuing an injunction to temporarily halt the deportation of three foreign nationals. Eames issued an injunction in an unsuccessful attempt to temporarily halt Law's deportation. Eames was in Australia at the time and his visa was cancelled, preventing his return to Nauru.
In the same month, the application fee for visas for foreign journalists was raised from $200 to $8000.
In May and June 2014, Waqa suspended 5 of the 7 members of Nauru's Opposition from Parliament indefinitely.
Three of the MPs, Mathew Batsiua, Kieren Keke and Roland Kun, were suspended in May 2014 for making comments to international media critical of the government and the alleged breakdown of the rule of law. Another two, Sprent Dabwido (a former president) and Squire Jeremiah were suspended a month later for behaving in an unruly manner.
In June 2015, Jeremiah, Dabwido, and Batsiua were arrested and Kun had his passport cancelled amid claims that they had been trying to destabilise the Government by talking to foreign media.
19 people were charged with unlawful assembly and other offences following a protest outside the Parliament of Nauru on 16 June 2015. 3 pleaded guilty and the District Court sentenced 2 to imprisonment for 3 months and the 3rd to 6 months imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Nauru allowed an appeal, finding that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and increased them to 14 months and 22 months imprisonment. The High Court of Australia quashed the decision and remitted it to the Supreme Court "differently constituted, for hearing according to law."
The charges against Jeremiah, Dabwido, and Batsiua had a long and complex history. On 21 June 2018 Justice Geoff Muecke in the Supreme Court of Nauru ordered Nauru to pay their costs of defending the charges, in the amount of $224,021.90. Nauru did not pay this amount and on 13 September 2018 Justice Muecke ordered a permanent stay of the proceedings against them. The Nauru government is appealing this decision to the Nauru Court of Appeal and will be heard by Michael Scott, the former Chief Justice of Tonga, John Muria, the Chief Justice of Kiribati and Nicholas Kirriwom, a judge of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea.

The Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle (WWK) is a German statutory body for the adjustment of the Lippe water level and service water supply from the West German shipping canals and artificial watercourses in connection with the rivers Rhine, Lippe and Ruhr.
Responsibilities and Tasks of the Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle (WWK)
Responsibilities and tasks of the WWK (= water board West German canals) are defined in the related statutes, enacted December 3, 1969, based on a treaty between the German Federal Ministry for Transport and the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and an executive order of the Environment Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany).
The WWK is a public German water board (“Wasserverband”) located in Essen (North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany) and responsible for the adjustment of the river Lippe water level and service water supply from the West German shipping canals and artificial watercourses in connection with the rivers Rhine, Lippe and Ruhr. The responsibilities are solely covering the water supply sector and not the operation of the shipping canals that are under direction of the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung). The catchment area of the WWK comprises the Rhine-Herne Canal, the Wesel-Datteln Canal, the Datteln-Hamm Canal and the Dortmund-Ems Canal.
The main tasks are
operation and development of (new) pumping stations at sluices,
cooperation with the water supplier Gelsenwasser regarding the water exchange facility between the river Lippe and the Datteln-Hamm Canal in Hamm and from the Dortmund-Ems Canal to the river Stever in Senden,
the provision of water for the replenishment of Lippe flow and
in the role of the supplier of water services to calculate and charge the arising costs in cooperation with the Federal Waterways Authority.
Though being a statutory body the WWK has no sovereign power but depends on permissions of governmental institutions. For the amount of water tapped by local clients individual permissions from the responsible municipal or District Council departments are obligatory. Regulating authorities are the District Council of Düsseldorf and the Environment Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Moreover, the distributed volume of water depends on pump capacities and demands of the shipway trafficability. As the canals are designed for navigation all other interests are second-rank.
Members of the WWK decide about the guidelines of the association, the business plan and fees, elect the chairman (“Verbandsvorsteher”) and chief operating officer (“Geschäftsführer”). The number of votes depends on the quantity to be received
of water that is used and has to be treated separately and discharged as waste water and/or
of water that has been removed, warmed-up and discharged again into the canal.
The control and supervision is carried out from a centralized telecontrol station in Datteln
History
Origins and early development of WWK
The West German shipping canals serve the mass transportation in the Ruhr region between the rivers Rhine and Ems direction North Sea and via the Mittelland Canal to the Weser, Elbe, Oder and Vistula.
This canal network shows the highest traffic density in Europe. The canals are state-owned by the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung”).
The construction of artificial shipping canals was necessary in the industrialisation period of the Ruhr due to lacking transportation routes via capable, navigable rivers. The oldest part, the Dortmund-Ems Canal, is connecting the eastern Ruhr since 1898 with the North Sea. In 1914 the connection to the Rhine followed via the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Datteln-Hamm Canal was opened, too. In 1930 the Wesel-Datteln Canal was finished. All these connected waterways need to bridge altitude differences between the starting point, the connected harbours and the arrival point. For these purposes there are today e.g at the Rhine-Herne Canal 5 sluices and at the Wesel-Datteln Canal 6 sluices; at the Henrichenburg boat lift two ancient and two actually utilized sluices facilitate the bypassing of the altitude difference within the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal to Dortmund harbour.
To feed the planned canal system with water already in 1905 before the construction of the Datteln-Hamm Canal the decision was passed by the Prussian State to use 10 m3/second water from the river Lippe – the only relevant river in the area – for the compensation of evaporation, infiltration and loss of water from the sluices). That was leading from 1914 on to severe water management problems in the river Lippe where in dry summers only 4 m3/second water was left downstream. From 1926 on the newly established water board Lippeverband negotiated with the competent authorities and finally the governmental waterway administration (“Reichswasserstraßenverwaltung”) confirmed to reduce the water abstraction to 7.5 m3/second from 1938 on.
The industrial development of the coal and steel industry and especially the coal-fired power stations after World War II meant a growing demand of service water (from the canals and the river Lippe) and a growing discharge of too warm and/or unsatisfactory treated waste water into the river Lippe.
Negotiations of the Lippeverband with the government of North Rhine Westphalia and with the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung) were finally from 1968 on leading to new regulations: The ''Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle'' WWK was established, consisting of representatives of the Lippeverband and the water users, accompanied by the Federal Waterways Authority and the Environment Ministry of North Rhine Westphalia
. Moreover, the permission for maximum discharge of the Lippe into the West German canal system was increased to 10 m3/second again but now with the additional limitation to guarantee a minimum discharge of 10 m3/second in the Lippe, too, otherwise the water abstraction for the canals had to be limited. This regulation was possible because of already constructed pumps at the sluices that started compensating partly the loss of water from locking.
In the years 1973-1978 a series of new pumping stations was established that could serve the canals “upstream” from the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and discharge “downstream” in case the Lippe has enough water to supply with. Parallel pumping systems had been developed along the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Wesel-Datteln Canal/ Datteln-Hamm Canal, all controlled and supervised from a centralized telecontrol station.
The WWK at present
Today the Lippe and the West German canal system still play a decisive role regarding the supply of industry and businesses with service water, even though the water demand in total is declining. Circular economy, energy efficiency in all kind of businesses and the reduced water demand due to the changing energy policy (reduction of thermal power stations) unburden the river. Moreover, the discharge of warmed water back to the river has been regulated by public law. Improved municipal waste water treatment and the decline of coal mining have had positive impact on the water management, too.
The water demand for shipping nevertheless is important in the West German canal system. To compensate the loss of water from evaporation, infiltration and locking in the sluices annually 500 million m3 of water have to be injected. To reduce especially in dry weather periods the demand of water that gets lost from the sluices it is locally pumped up again. The total water demand from the canal system of up to 800 million m3/year is mainly covered by supply from the Lippe and Ruhr.
The permission to withdraw up to 25 m3/second from the Lippe still today is limited to a remaining discharge in the Lippe of 10 m3/second. If the water level in the river falls below that flow rate the Lippe receives up to 4.5 m3/second out of the canal system for low water replenishment. For example in the 12 months period from November 2014 to October 2015 the Lippe discharged on 257 days water into the Datteln-Hamm Canal and on 102 days canal water was pumped into the Lippe.
Drinking Water
The Stever is a tributary of the Lippe which is fed by water out of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and has a huge meaning for drinking water supply for the northern Ruhr region. To balance the whole system the Stever – after being fed out of the canal in Senden – is backed-up in two water reservoirs (Talsperre Hullern and Halterner Stausee) of 32 million m3 capacity. Two-thirds of the Stever flow is discharged downstream; one-third is used by the drinking water supplier Gelsenwasser AG for drinking water processing via soil infiltration from groundwater wells (of all together approximately 129 million m3/year). Additionally the municipal utilities Stadtwerke Münster use water from the Dortmund-Ems Canal to supply the groundwater wells for drinking water processing. In total, via several water works annually 250 million m3 of water are transported in pipework from the Ruhr to the area at the canals.
The regionally diversified origin and processing of drinking water – pumped water from the Rhine and Ruhr, various groundwater wells, replenishment with infiltrated canal water – guarantees constantly the regional supply with water of the highest quality in Ruhr and Münsterland region. Hereby it is also possible in case of calamities (like exceeding threshold values at certain groundwater wells) to substitute the water supply from other sources (like the infiltration of canal water).
Service Water
Along the canals industry and businesses consume about 60 million m3 annually for cooling, production, irrigation and the afore mentioned processing of ground water wells. Frequent measurements of state-approved inspection authorities show results and values close to drinking water quality in the canals.
The network of the canals in the densely populated Ruhr region and the high water quality is (since 1989 the Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park took place) frequently topic in scientific, public and political debates about the utilisation of attractive urban water fronts, also in context with climate change aspects.
Members and data
Members of the WWK are according to the status 31.12.2014:
the Lippeverband (with focus on the water level of the river Lippe),
36 water abstractors of canal water (industry and businesses),
6 enterprises for public water supply as canal water abstractors for drinking water purposes and for service water supply to third parties.
Customers with lower water demand may draw insignificant amounts without becoming a formal member. In cases of water shortage they have to renounce the supply for the benefit of the regular members. The need of service water varies very much – for example annually for a public pool 500 m3/year up to 15 million m3/year for a thermal power station. All together the withdrawal is on the average 60 million m3/year (with downward drift). The technically possible maximum of 400 million m3/year has never been used. The discharge of canal water via the Stever into Halterner Stausee and Talsperre Hullern depends on the annual rainfall, for example the discharge in 1976 was 11.5 million m3 but in “wet years” nothing is discharged.
The withdrawal of service water that is used and has to be treated separately and discharged as waste water is invoiced with 0.0353 €/m3 (waste water is invoiced separately by the operator of the wastewater treatment facility). For water that has been removed, warmed-up and discharged again into the canal the invoice value is 3.3% of that amount. The fees cover the costs that appear from operation and maintenance of the pumping stations and other costs related to the water services.

Julián Romero and Saint Julian is a 1612-1614 painting by El Greco, now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.
It depicts the Spanish military hero Julián Romero, as identified by an inscription at the base of the column, kneeling in prayer accompanied and presented by his armoured name-saint and patron Julian the Hospitaller (sometimes confused with Saint Louis of France due to the fleur-de-lys on his cloak). Romero was a senior military leader as Maestre de Campo in the army of Philip II of Spain and a Knight of the Order of Santiago. He had died in 1577.
The inscription had been added later and describes Romero as Julian Romero of the Exploits, born Antequera, Commander of the Order of San Tiago and Maistre de Campo in the Army in Italy and Flanders, whose deeds were legendary. In fact he was born at Huélamo.

Campionato Primavera 3, formerly Campionato Nazionale Dante Berretti (or simply Campionato Berretti), is an Italian football competition played by youth teams (under 19) organized by the Lega Pro, and mainly composed by Serie C clubs but also by some Serie A and Serie B teams. The first edition was held in the 1966–67 season for Serie C clubs only, but the competition was opened to other series' clubs in the 1968–69; since there the championship awarded multiple winning trophies, usually one for Serie C champion and one for the other categories' champion. From 1996–97 to 2003–04, only one winner was awarded.
Format
In 2011–12 season, the age limited was age 19 (calendar age) at the end of competition (born on or after 1 January 1993), one year below Primavera (born 1992). In 2012–13 Primavera had changed its age limited to age 19 (calendar age) at the end of competition, matching Berretti's 19. In 2020, the toutnament was reduced to 30 clubs, following the transformation in Primavera3.

Abraham Diskin (born 1947) is an Israeli political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a Professor at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya.
Diskin was the Chair of the Political Science Department of the Hebrew University and the Chair of the Israel Political Science Association. He also served as a visiting professor at several universities in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. Diskin has published over twenty books and monographs, mostly about Israeli politics.
In the 1970s, Diskin analyzed the critical importance of the domination of the ‘pivotal point' (i.e. the balance between the left wing bloc and the right wing bloc), and the significance of voters floating between two major political blocs. During the 2000s, he helped to write the Constitution proposed by the Institute for Zionist Strategies and advised the Constitution Committee of the Knesset.
Diskin's research focuses on comparative politics, democracy, game theory, electoral systems and voting behavior. During the 2000s he published (often in conjunction with Moshe Koppel) two solutions to John Nash's bargaining problem, a solution of the Voting Power measurement, a proof of the association between ‘strategic non-voting' and ‘decisiveness' of electoral competitions in the United States and Britain in the twentieth century, a proof of homogeneity in Swiss referenda, and a new measure of electoral malapportionment, volatility and disproportionality.
Diskin often appears as a political analyst on the Israeli and international media. In the 1980s and the early 1990s, he chaired the Cadets' Committee of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the 1990s he has served as the statistician of the Central Committee of Elections in Israel. He is known as a political centrist and was one of the founders of the Third Way party in 1996.
Literary and artistic career
For his non-academic and artistic work, Diskin uses the pen name “Bertie.” Diskin has written and illustrated several children books, among them “Gorgozula" and "The Mice and the Magic Ball. He co-authored a book on the World Soccer Championships (“Mondial”) with his son Tommer. Diskin has published two satirical works (On the Sinking Ship and The Lagado Travel). In 2008 he published The Presidents – Ha'Nesi'im), a book about American presidents.

The American D-22 and American D-33 microphones are dual-impedance, omnidirectional, dynamic microphones made by the American Microphone Company. They were used extensively in the broadcast industry in the 1950s because of their modern sleek looks and tapered waist design.
Background
The D-22 and D-33 were introduced as part of the full-vision (FV) series of microphones in the early 1950s. Their major innovation was their slim profile. Other microphones were typically large and bulky. This blocked the view of the presenter on TV.
The sleek design was achieved with a precision-machined "Duraluminum" case with a two-tone color scheme.
The D-22 and D-33 featured a micro-metal alloy diaphragms which was unaffected by temperature changes. The diaphragm also had an anti-corrosion treatment to protect it from air-borne contamination from the presenter's voice.
The D-22 and D-33 were dual-impedance microphones with the high or low impedance selected using an innovative "linkage bar" under the name plate and a unique "slide-lock" microphone stand mount.
Specifications
Type dynamic micro-metal alloy diaphragm
D-22 frequency response 100 Hz to 8 kHz (+/− 5 dB)

Arch Glass Mainous, Sr. (April 7, 1899, in Owsley County, Kentucky – August 17, 1990 in Lexington, Kentucky) was the founder of:
Citizens Union National Bank & Trust Company in Lexington, Kentucky (merged out of existence)
First Federal Savings and Loan of Lexington, Kentucky (closed)
Kentucky Family Life (Merged with Jefferson Pilot)
Executive Vice President of the American Bankers Association in 1955
President of the Kentucky Bankers Association in 1956
He married Juanita Nell Cornett, the daughter of Kentucky politician William Manon Cornett & Clara Belle Eversole on January 27, 1927, in Miami, Florida.
Arch's beginnings in Banking
During the late 1910s Arch Glass Mainous moved from the farm to Appalachia, Virginia to work for a bank founded by his half-brother, Edward Chester Mainous. Edward Chester Mainous (1882-1922) assisted his brothers, Arch Glass Mainous (1899-1990), William Lazarus 'Laz' Mainous (1890-1983), and Isaac 'Ike' Sylvester Mainous (1903-1955) to enter the world of Finance. Laz ran The First National Bank of Applachia, Arch ran the Citizens Union National Bank in Lexington, Kentucky and Ike was Assistant Vice President of First National Bank in Bristol, Tennessee.
When Edward Chester Mainous was killed in an auto accident in 1922, Arch went to business school and attended what would become Sue Bennett College. After school, Arch Glass moved to Miami, Florida, and took a job working at First National Bank of Miami as head of its savings department. In Miami, Arch Glass Mainous appeared three (3) times in the Miami Herald newspaper discussing his management of the savings department.
While working at the First National Bank of Miami, FL, Arch eventually lost his job after the 1926 hurricane caused a run on bank deposits. The hurricane caused an economic depression in South Florida at the time.
Nevertheless, on January 27, 1927, Arch Glass is recorded as obtaining a wedding license in Miami, Florida, to marry Juanita Nell Cornett. Arch stayed in Miami through 1927 continuing to work at the First National Bank of Miami while his first child was born at the end of 1927 at Victoria Hospital.
Upon returning to Kentucky in 1928 he left his wife and child at his parents house in Owsley County, Kentucky and lived with his sister in Cleveland, Ohio at 636 East 94th Street and worked for the Humphrey Company selling popcorn and peanuts in the Theater district for about a year. While there, a comedian named Bob Hope and his brother also sold popcorn and peanuts with Arch while trying to get into vaudeville. A reference to this event is recorded in a 1978 Lexington Herald Leader article about Arch Mainous.
In 1929, his father-in-law, former Deputy Insurance Commissioner William Manon Cornett helped his son-in-law Arch Glass obtain a job as a Trust Examiner for the Kentucky Banking Department and he and his family moved initially to Georgetown, Kentucky. During his examination of various banks he evaluated one in 1931 in Lexington, Kentucky called 'Deposit Guaranty Bank'. Arch moved to Lexington in 1930 and lived in several rental houses before purchasing his first home in the fall of 1931. Deposit Guaranty was closed due to insolvency and, in 1932 upon re-opening, Arch Glass was offered the position of Assistant Cashier and began purchasing stock.
Deposit Guarantee becomes Citizens Bank
After the closure of the Deposit Guaranty Bank, the bank was re-organized and re-opened as 'Citizens Bank and Trust Co' in 1932. During the period from its formation in 1932 through the 1950s the bank grew and eventually merged with the adjacent 'Union Bank' creating the 'Citizens Union bank'. The Merger of the two occurred on January 1, 1955.
Arch Mainous was appointed president of the Lexington Clearinghouse (a consortium of banks in Lexington, Kentucky) used to process the clearing of checks and bank drafts.
In December 1946 the existing chairman of Citizens Bank, Thomas C. Bradley died and Arch Mainous was elected to the position of chairman of Citizens Bank and Trust.
In 1958 the bank became a National bank becoming 'Citizens Union National Bank and Trust Company' whose offices were at 201 to 203 Short Street in Lexington, Kentucky, opposite Court House square.
Arch Glass Mainous was known for being innovative. During the banking holiday established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 Arch was able to re-structure Citizens Bank with an infusion of preferred stock bought by the US Government. This allowed Citizens Union to continue and grow, eventually becoming the second largest bank in Lexington, Kentucky.
In 1955 he was elected an executive vice president of the American Bankers Association and in 1956 was made president of the Kentucky Bankers Association. Over the years, Arch established a variety of branch banks throughout Lexington, Kentucky. Near his retirement, in 1971 he helped orchestrate the building of 'Citizens Bank Square' in Lexington and Citizens Union also became known as 'The gold bank' (for the gold glass along the exterior of its new building). It was the first major urban renewal project in Lexington, Kentucky.
Eventually, in 1982 he sold Citizens Union to Tennessee banker Jake Butcher. After Mr. Butcher's financial problems the bank moved through several owners and became part of Bank One.
Formation of First Federal Savings and Loan
In 1935, Arch Glass Mainous was first in line to file for the name "First Federal Savings and Loan", a mutual (depositor owned) association that was approved by the US Federal Savings and Loan Act created under the New Deal. He served as its chairman for the remainder of his life. The Savings and Loan continued in operation until the early 2000s when it was closed.
Formation of Kentucky Family Life
In the 1950s, Arch Glass Mainous worked with another individual to establish the Kentucky Family Life company. It was eventually merged with Jefferson Pilot. The life insurance company was initially sold in 1966 to Financial Security Corp of Bowling Green, Kentucky, and much later was absorbed into Jefferson Pilot.
Civic involvement
Arch Glass Mainous and the various organizations he ran were involved in various civic affairs. In 1942, Arch Glass Mainous and other finance leaders in Kentucky established a 'Bond Defense Group'.
Arch won a medal from the US Treasury in 1945 for assisting in selling large amounts of US war bonds during World War II.
Arch served as the President of the Lexington, Kentucky Chamber of Commerce for a number of years.
He assisted in providing banking services (through Citizens Union National Bank) to bring IBM to Lexington, Kentucky where they opened a factory in 1956 to build 'Selectric' typewriters. He was a member and Treasurer Emeritus of the Oleika Shrine in Lexington, Kentucky and ran their yearly Shrine Circus to benefit the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children. He was also a life member of the Lexington, Kentucky Salvation Army Board and served in lay positions with First United Methodist Church.
Family and Death
Arch Glass Mainous, Sr had three children; Joseph Edward Mainous, Jane Carol Mainous and Arch G. Mainous, Jr. Arch died on August 17, 1990 about 4 weeks after his wife. Both are buried at Hillcrest Memorial Park in Lexington, Kentucky.
Over the period of his life, the media have run a variety of articles on his life and banking career. One was 'Arch Mainous Sr: A banking Career based on caring'. Another was on June 5, 1967, entitled "50 years of banking". Even as early as 1957, Lexington, Kentucky media wrote of his rise from farming in Eastern Kentucky and the impact that his older half-brother had in helping Arch and two of his brothers enter the world of Finance.

Scotland fields a representative county team in the All-Britain Junior Football Championship. 2014 was a breakthrough year for the team as they lifted the All-Britain Junior title for the first time. The team had only ever made the final once before back in 2006, but lost the final, in extra-time, to Warwickshire. On the way to the title they beat Yorkshire and Kilkenny before beating Warwickshire in the final to a scoreline of 3-10 to 2-07.
This set up an All-Ireland Junior Semi-final with Cavan. However they were defeated on the day to a scoreline of 1-17 to 0-06. Most recently the Scotland Men won the All-Britain title in 2019 against a tough Warwickshire team. They went on to contest the All-Ireland Quarter Final versus Kerry.
In 2014, it was reported that Scotland would be joining the Connacht Championships in 2015 as part of GAA expansion plans throughout the UK. It was decided to put them in Connacht as opposed to Ulster to allow more rivalry between Scotland and London, but this ultimately didn't happen. This turned out to be an April Fool's joke.
2015 became a momentous year for the Scotland ladies team as they reached the All-Ireland Junior Final to be played at Croke Park. They beat Derry with a score line of 1-13 to 2-05 at Fingallians GAA ground. They played a tough game against Louth at Croke Park on 27 September 2015.
Hurling
In 1905, Lancashire and Glasgow entered the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship at the quarter-final stage. Lancashire returned for one more championship campaign in 1913, whilst Glasgow returned for the 1910 and 1913 championships. In 2019, Ceann Creige Hurling and Camogie Club, based in the Craigend neighbourhood of Glasgow, was formed. They have teams of all ages in hurling and camogie, ranging from minor to senior level. The Ceann Creige senior hurling team compete in the Lancashire Hurling League and the Britain Hurling Shield.

Sir Gervase Helwys (1 September 1561 – 20 November 1615), also known as Jervis Yelwys, was a Lieutenant of the Tower of London found guilty of complicity in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury and hanged in 1615. The scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished King James I's court with an image of corruption and depravity. There are variations in the spelling of Helwys: Helwis, Helwiss, Helewyse, Helwysse, Yelwys, Ellowis, Elwys, Elwis, Elvis, Elwes, and Elwaies.
Background
Gervase Helwys was born on 1 September 1561 in Saundby, Nottinghamshire, the first child of parents John Helwys (1535–1600) and Mary Blagden of the Thames Ditton. His cousin, Thomas Helwys (1575–1616), one of the joint founders, with John Smyth, of the Baptist denomination, was thrown into Newgate Prison by the king for libel, where he died in 1616. As a student Helwys studied law at Middle Temple after completing his studies at New Inn, at the University of Oxford. His uncle, Geoffrey Helwys, a successful merchant, Alderman and Sheriff of London, was also a member of the Inn. Soon after, he married Mary Brooke, daughter of Thomas Brooke of Norfolk.
On 7 May 1603, Helwys was knighted by King James I. A decade later, on 6 May 1613, he was appointed by the same king as Lieutenant of the Tower of London after being recommended to the post by Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. As was common practice at the time, Helwys had to pay for the title, in this instance £2,000; £1,400 going to Northampton and £300 to Sir Thomas Monson, Master of the Armory in the Tower and a friend of Helwys'. Whilst there, Helwys had been involved on 10 March 1614 in the "examination" of prisoner Edmond Peacham, a rector of Hinton St. George who had been charged with having written a libel against the king, at the request of the king's Attorney general, Sir Francis Bacon.
Overbury Affair
When his Secretary of State, the Earl of Salisbury, died in 1612, the king had the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with his young Scottish favourite, Robert Carr carrying out many of Salisbury's former duties. But James's inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.
The Howard party, consisting of Henry Howard; Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk; his son-in-law William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury; Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, and Sir Thomas Lake, soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Overbury for assistance with government papers, fell into the Howard camp. He had done this after beginning an affair with the married Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, whom James assisted in securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr. Seeing as Overbury distrusted the Howards and still had Carr's ear, he tried to prevent the marriage. To remove him from court, the Howard faction manipulated Overbury into seeming to be disrespectful to the queen. Then it was no small feat to persuade the king to offer Overbury an assignment as ambassador to the court of Tsar Michael of Russia, with the Howards being fully aware that his refusal would be seen as tantamount to treason. The plan worked and Overbury declined, sensing the urgency to remain in England and at his friend's side. On 22 April 1613, Overbury was placed in the Tower at the king's "request", eventually dying there five months later on 15 September "of natural causes."
In July 1615, after rumours began circulating at court, it subsequently emerged that Overbury had in fact been poisoned the discovery of the crime being revealed by a boy in the employment of one of the apothecaries responsible.
Investigations were made and proofs were abundantly forthcoming. At a dinner in Whitehall with the king's new Secretary of State, Sir Ralph Winwood, Helwys admitted that he suspected there might have been some foul play. He immediately became suspect after correspondence surfaced between himself and Northampton concerning Overbury's conduct and health. In his letters to Helwys Northampton wrote with contempt of Overbury and expressed a desire that his own name should not be mentioned in connection with his imprisonment. Northampton also introduced one of the royal physicians, John Craig, to Helwys to report on the prisoner's health. Helwys made the mistake of corresponding with Howard, the chief suspect in Overbury's poisoning. When the matter was judicially investigated, Helwys felt his political enemies trying to credit him with a direct hand in the murder. On 1 October 1615, he was arrested and forced to exchange his lodgings for a cell in the Tower.
Trial and execution
In 1615, Helwys was put on trial, along with Monson, Richard Weston (the gaoler and ex-servant of Howard and Carr's), Mrs Anne Turner (widow of a fashionable London doctor), and a disreputable apothecary named James Franklin, in Guildhall, London for complicity in the murder of Overbury. The hearings were presided over by Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and Sir Francis Bacon. It was ruled that "poisons" had been "administered" in the form of "jellies" and "tarts" by Weston, Turner and Franklin at the direction of Frances Howard.
When Howard and Carr were tried she admitted a part in the murder, but her husband did not. Fearing what Carr might say about him in court, James repeatedly sent messages to the Tower pleading with him to admit his guilt in return for a pardon. "It is easy to be seen that he would threaten me with laying an aspersion upon me of being, in some sort, accessory to his crime." Carr refused and the couple were found guilty and sentenced to death. The king commuted their sentence to life imprisonment and they were eventually pardoned along with Monson.
The only evidence against Helwys was that of Franklin, who asserted that the Lieutenant had been in league with Frances Howard. Through letters to Howard that were not read at the hearings, it was clear that Helwys initially had no idea that Overbury was being poisoned. He confessed later that he had entertained suspicions of this after discovering earlier attempts to poison Overbury on the part of the gaoler Weston, who had been placed in that position at the suggestion of Northampton. Considering the powerful people protecting Weston, and assuming him, indeed, to be no less than their agent, Helwys had hesitated to interfere in what seemed to him to be a matter of state. He had, however, done his utmost surreptitiously to save Overbury. It was plain both from Weston's statements and from Helwys' own, that the Lieutenant had done his very best to defeat the Turner-Essex-Northampton plot to poison his prisoner, throwing away the "rosalgar" and later "draughts", as well as substituting food for Overbury from his own kitchen for that "sent in" by Turner. He had made Weston recognise the "hideousness" of what he had done and made him promise to desist from further attempts upon the prisoner's life. Although Helwys maintained that he kept a close watch on Overbury after this event, he nevertheless suspected that the "thing was done" the moment his vigilance had been relaxed.
On 18 November, – Helwys, Weston, Turner and Franklin – were found guilty as "accessories before the fact done" and, lacking powerful connections, were sentenced to death. On the day of his execution on the following Monday, 20 November at Tower Hill, Helwys gave an impassioned speech to the crowd in attendance protesting his innocence:
I was so far from thinking myself foul in the fact, that until these two Gentlemen, (Doctor Felton and Doctor Whiting, the physicians for my soul) told me how deeply I had imbrued my hands in the blood of (Overbury) making me, by God's law, as guilty in the concealing (of it) as if I had been a personal actor in it. Till then... I held myself ignorant of the deed, and my conscience so clear, that I did never ask God forgiveness...
He did, however, beg God's forgiveness for both his guilt in the crime and for being “much addicted" to gambling. Helwys left behind him eight children with his wife Mary: William, Thomas, Nathaniel Gervase John, Elizabeth Bridget, Maria, Jane, Anna and Francesca.

Stargate: Resistance was an online third-person shooter owned and operated by the American studio Dark Comet Games, powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and based on the television series Stargate SG-1. It was originally released in 2010 by Firesky and Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment, however Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment went into receivership in March 2010 and Firesky entered into an agreement with Dark Comet Games for the maintenance, operation and development of Stargate Resistance. The game used a "buy to play" business model, with a one-off purchase fee and no monthly subscription fee. The game servers were shut down on January 15, 2011.
A fan powered central server solution has been put in place, making the game once again playable.
Plot
Stargate Resistance is set in the second decade of the Stargate Program, after the end of Stargate SG-1. Samantha Carter has been promoted to General according to an Easter egg on the SGC level and is in charge of the Stargate program. Over the last decade, the SGC has spread Earth's influence throughout the galaxy, freeing enslaved peoples and developing a free Galactic culture of humanity once enslaved by the System Lords. But the System Lords do not accept this change in the status quo. Intent on regaining what they once held, the new System Lords are beginning an organized assault on key locations throughout the galaxy. Their goals are to drive out the SGC and re-enslave these "lost" populations.
The System Lords will not stop at conquering a handful of worlds. As their dominion increases they will push resistance all the way back to Earth, and enslave all of humanity. The SGC must defend each of these worlds, engaging the System Lords with carefully placed strike teams to preserve the peace.
Overview
Stargate Resistance lets players take on the role of Stargate Command or the Goa'uld System Lords, with the fate of the galaxy in the balance.
Each of these two factions have three character classes: Soldiers, Commandos, and Scientists on the SGC side, and Goa'uld, Jaffa, and Ashrak assassins on the side of the System Lords. Each class has its own unique blend of weapons, items, and weaknesses, many of them iconic from the TV show such as the P90 or Staff Weapon. Players work with teammates in five multiplayer modes (up to 16 players at once): "Team Death Match," "Capture the Tech," "Domination," "Arena" and "King Of The Hill" over four maps, all but one of which has multiple game types available. The Galactic Struggle is represented by Domination Points earned in each match which contribute to buffs for the winning team. Additional game modes and maps, weapons and skins are planned in the future. The game is available for the PC only though expansion to a console platform is possible in the future. It will be open to future expansion packs.
"Resistance brings to our fans the kind of gameplay Stargate Worlds never planned to deliver," said Chris Klug, the game's creative consultant and the creative director for Stargate Worlds. "Resistance delivers the combat, weapons and tactics seen so often on the show that many of you have been asking for. I know this game will excite fans who have longed to go toe-to-toe with a Jaffa as well as those who always wanted to dominate the galaxy in ways the MMO could only hint at."

Béla Uitz (8 March 1887, Mehála, Kingdom of Hungary (today part of Timișoara, Romania) – 26 January 1972, Budapest, Hungary) was a Hungarian painter and communist activist.
In 1907 he studied at the Hungarian National School of Applied Arts before moving on to the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts in 1908.
He was a contributor to the anarchist-pacifist magazine A Tett, published by Lajos Kassák 1915-1916. After A Tett was suppressed by the authorities, Kassák launched MA in 1917 and Uiotz joined the editorial team.
He attended the "Russian Evening" organised by MA on 20 November 1920 in Vienna. This led him to rethink his political-artistic stance. In "Jegyzetek a 'Ma' orosz estélyéhez" (Notes on MAs Russian evening) an article published in MA he was very critical of the Russian Proletkult movement which he viewed as an obstacle to the parallel progress of the material and spiritual revolution he envisaged. Nevertheless he later developed a more sympathetic view of Proletkult,
He then joined the Communist Party of Hungary who sent him with Alfréd Kemény to attend the 3rd Congress of the Communist International. Whilst in Moscow he met Jolán Szilágyi, a Hungarian studying at VKhUTEMAS.
He was the editor of Egység, a radical art journal published in Vienna and Berlin, 1922-1924. Aladár Komját was his co-editor.

"Hurt Me" is a song by British singer Låpsley. It was released on 20 August 2015 as the fourth single from Låpsley's debut studio album, Long Way Home.
Reception
James Rettig from Stereogum said "The track begs for feeling, even if it's a bad one, and the ticking clock of a beat in the background makes everything just a little bit more urgent". Nic Kelly from Project U called the song "Pop Perfection" saying it "is emotional balladry at its most divine, honest and relevant".

William Joseph Weaver (1759-1817) was an artist born in London who came to prominence in North America. He is perhaps most famous for his portrait of Alexander Hamilton which hangs in the United States State Department, and his full-length portrait of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, which hangs in Province House (Nova Scotia), Canada. He also worked for Joseph Booth's Polygraphic Society.
Former Director and Chief Curator of the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute Paul Schweizer writes that Weaver's work "convey [s] a chaste elegance that is similar in look and mood to the finest neoclassical portraits made in North America." Weaver's composition reflects a knowledge of British and French military portraiture. He painted portraits and miniatures in many of the principal cities along the Atlantic seaboard from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Savannah, Georgia. He also produced portraits of Martha and George Washington, though their locations are unknown.
Weaver was one of the first professional artists to work in Halifax (c. 1797). He made portraits or miniatures of the city's merchants, aristocrats and military officers. Currently, six small portraits that Weaver painted in Nova Scotia have been identified. Five of these were painted on tinplate. There are likely more that are unsigned.

Justin Sun (Chinese: 孙宇晨; pinyin: Sūn Yǔchén; born July 30, 1990) is a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the founder of Tron (founded July 2017), a blockchain DAO ecosystem. Sun is the Permanent Representative of Grenada to the WTO.
Education
Sun was born in 1990. He holds a B.A. in History from Peking University and an M.A. in East Asia Studies from the University of Pennsylvania.
Career
Sun studied at Hupan University and became the cover figure of Yazhou Zhoukan in 2011 and Davos Global Youth Leaders in 2014. In 2015 he was named CNTV's most noteworthy new entrepreneur, and was named in Forbes China 30 Under 30 from 2015 through 2017.
Sun placed the record-breaking $4.6 million bid to have a private lunch with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett in June 2019, before cancelling it to widespread surprise. The lunch with Buffett eventually occurred in January 2020.
On 11 March 2021, Sun was the underbidder on the historic $69M auction at Christie's New York of the Beeple non-fungible token (NFT) collection Everydays: the First 5000 Days.
In October 2021, Sun participated in a $65 million funding round in Animoca.
In December 2021, Sun announced he was the winner of the New Shepard auction with a bid of $28 million to be the first paying passenger to fly on the Blue Origin vehicle in July 2021. He was not able to fly on this July 2021 mission due to a scheduling conflict. However he purchased (supposedly with the $28 million auction bid, which he paid to Blue Origin in 2021) privately a full flight of New Shepard for himself and intends to select five other participants to fly with him into space in late 2022.
In December 2021, Justin Sun retired as a CEO of TRON to become a diplomat for Grenada.

The Battle of Sarimbun Beach was the first stage of the Japanese assault on Singapore in February 1942 during World War II. Sarimbun Beach, in the northwestern corner of mainland Singapore, was the area in which Japanese troops, under the direction of Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita, first attacked Allied forces (predominantly British) in Singapore. The commander of all Allied forces in Singapore, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, did not expect the Japanese to make their main attack on the island from the northwest and subsequently failed to reinforce the 22nd Australian Brigade, which took the brunt of the Japanese assault. The main Japanese objective to be attained following their landing at Sarimbun Beach was the capture of Tengah Airfield.
Prelude
Percival gave Major-General Gordon Bennett's two brigades, from the 8th Australian Division, responsibility for the north-western sector of the island. The terrain was primarily mangrove swamp and tropical forest, broken up by rivers and creeks. The 22nd Australian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Harold Taylor) and most of the Australian 2/4th Australian Machine Gun Battalion, was assigned a sector wide along Sarimbun Beach with the Jind Infantry Battalion of the Indian States Forces, which was guarding Tengah and a company of Dalforce, a guerilla militia recruited from Singaporean Chinese. The 27th Australian Infantry Brigade was assigned an adjoining wide area to the north, adjoining the causeway. The 2/4th Australian Machine Gun Battalion was distributed among the infantry units.
Battle
At 8:30 p.m. on 8 February, Australian machine-gunners opened fire on vessels carrying the first wave of 4,000 Japanese troops from the IJA's 5th and 18th Divisions towards Singapore Island. The Japanese wasted no time in assaulting Sarimbun Beach, which was held by the 22nd Australian Brigade. Fierce fighting raged throughout the night in the area but the increasing Japanese strength in numbers – as well as their superiority in artillery, tanks, planes and military intelligence – eventually began to take their toll on the ill-reinforced defenders. The Japanese managed to exploit several gaps in the thinly-spread Allied defence line along the coast, such as via small rivers, streams and creeks. By midnight, the two Australian brigades involved in the defence of the beach had lost communications with each other and the 22nd Brigade was forced to retreat in confusion. At 1.00am, yet more Japanese troops were landed and the last Australian reserves went into the fray of the battle.
Towards dawn on 9 February, some elements of the 22nd Australian Brigade had been overrun or surrounded and the 2/18th Australian Infantry Battalionin the centre, had lost more than half of its personnel. The 2/20th Australian Infantry Battalion, holding on to the right flank, was also heavily committed in resisting the Japanese troops. The 2/19th Australian Infantry Battalion, to the left side, was being outflanked, and only "B" Company was left to face the initial landings and assaults by the Japanese. Percival did not reinforce the depleted 22nd Australian Brigade until Tengah Airfield was threatened with capture. Before some British and Indian infantry reinforcements arrived, the badly-battered Australian and Singaporean defence units, along with the Jinds, retreated to the "Jurong Line", stretching south from the village of Bulim east of the airfield. Tengah Airfield was taken by the Japanese at around mid-day on 9 February.
Aftermath
Shortly after dark on 9 February, three British Fairmile B motor launches were sent on a raid up the western channel of the Straits of Johor at the area of the coastline adjoining Sarimbun Beach. Their primary objective was to attack Japanese landing-craft and disrupt enemy communications. They came under fire from enemy forces on both shores (coming from Malaya to the north and Sarimbun Beach to the south) but pressed on almost as far as the Causeway. A few Japanese landing-craft were sunk before the launches returned to Singapore, suffering minimal to almost no damage. Some Allied soldiers saw this as an example of effective defensive tactics that were used too little and too late by their senior commanders.

The figure skating events at the 1972 Winter Olympics were held at the Makomanai Skating Rink and the Mikaho Indoor Skating Rink.
The results of both the men's and ladies' singles events were dominated by placements in the compulsory figures, which at the time were nominally worth 50% of the total score but in fact weighted more heavily than the free skating due to being judged using a wider range of marks.
In the men's event, Ondrej Nepela, the winner of the compulsory figures segment, took the gold in spite of placing only 4th in the free skating after falling on his triple loop jump. The free skating winner was Sergei Chetverukhin, who skated one of his best performances at this event to take the silver medal. Patrick Péra, second in the figures, had a poor free skating in which he fell on a triple salchow jump early in his program and then made other mistakes. Nonetheless, the weight given to figures allowed him to take the bronze medal ahead of John Misha Petkevich, Kenneth Shelley, and Toller Cranston, who all skated dynamic programs with at least one cleanly landed triple jump apiece.
The effect of the figures was even more pronounced in the ladies' competition, where gold medal winner Beatrix Schuba placed only 7th in the free skating, performing mostly single jumps. The free skating was won by Janet Lynn, who received a perfect mark of 6.0 despite falling on a flying sit spin. Lynn's skating captivated the Japanese audience, especially when she got up smiling from her fall. Lynn took the bronze while Karen Magnussen, second in the free skating with a strong performance, took the silver. The third place skater in the free skating, Sonja Morgenstern, included a triple salchow in her program, which at this time was very rare for a female skater. She placed 6th overall.
The pairs competition was a tight battle between the two top Russian teams. Irina Rodnina / Alexei Ulanov did not skate their best, with Ulanov missing his required double salchow jump in the short program and Rodnina making an error in the jump combination at the beginning of their free skating. They eventually won a 6–3 decision over their teammates Liudmila Smirnova / Andrei Suraikin. The bronze medal team of Manuela Groß / Uwe Kagelmann made no major errors and received the highest technical merit marks from some of the judges for their program. Their elements included a throw double axel which at this time was rarely attempted.

, commonly shortened to simply Furifuri, is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by 130cm released on August 29, 2008, for the PC as a DVD. Furifuri is described by the development team as an , and is the fifth title to be developed by 130 cm, after their previous titles such as Princess Bride. The gameplay in Furifuri follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters.
Gameplay
The gameplay in Furifuri requires little player interaction from the player, as most of the duration of the game is only spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, representing either dialogue between characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a "decision point", where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all five plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction.
Plot
Setting and themes
The main part of Furifuris story takes place in a seaside town called , known for its observations of , mysterious objects that fall from the sky. Hoshifuri-dai is split into several regions. To the center of the town is , a mysterious building under investigation located on the top of a hill. Next to the palace is , and the town's largest shopping district, where the protagonist's house and the town's waterfront locates nearby. To the other side of the palace is the , a park built to commemorate the location of the earliest known waste fall. Close to the park is a school called , which the main characters attend. Other locations off-island includes the Odds and Ends Laboratory, which investigates the waste, the , and the .
Skies and astronomy are recurring themes in Furifuri. The mysterious object, waste falls from the sky. The names of various locations in the game are attributed to astronomy, the town's shopping district shares its name with stardust, and the park is named after the planet Venus. The school is named after a sextant, and the beach's name refers to the sky's beach.
Principal characters
The player assumes the role of , the protagonist of Furifuri. Haruaki is a fan of the mysterious object waste, and is the president of the waste club at school. He is skilled at housekeeping tasks, and believes that everyone can get along well if they have delicious food together. , the main heroine of Furifuri, is the follower to , the king of devils. Although loyal, Minori is rarely ever useful to Horobi due to her energetic and gluttony personality. , another heroine, is the apprentice to the hero . Though proud of this fact and works hard in becoming a hero, she wishes of a romantic interest of someone her age. She maintains a calm personality, and never hesitates before helping anyone. , both heroines, are twins born to the royal family of a pirate country. Despite their selfish personalities, they care about others, though in a subtle way. , the fifth and last heroine, is a first year student from Haruaki's school. She is a model student, and is the only other waste club member other than Haruaki, joining due to her crush with Haruaki.
Story
The story of Furifuri revolves around the male protagonist Haruaki Aki, a young high school student who lives in the town of Hoshifuri. One day, on his way home from school, Haruaki observed the falling of a waste. Having always been a fan of the waste, and because of the rare chances to obtain waste even to locals, Haruaki heads straight to where the waste has landed. Upon his arrival, Haruaki discovers a small piece of light. As he reaches out for it, the light disappears, leaving only the piece of waste. As Haruaki slips it into his pocket and decides to go home, two lights suddenly blows from the sky, and along with the lights, two girls, Minori Momose and Zyun Ōtori lands on the ground. The two girls then engaged in battle while Haruaki watches by the side thinking they are shooting a film. Haruaki is then seriously injured, but is able to recover with the power of the waste he found earlier, absorbing Minori's master, Horobi in the process. With Horobi now residing in Haruaki's body, Minori decides to stay at Haruaki's house, with Zyun staying in town to monitor them.
Development
Furifuri is the fifth title to be developed by 130 cm, after previous titles such as Princess Bride. Art direction is headed by Iko Izumi, who has also provided the character designs used in the game, and will be the artist's first work on a visual novel project. Planning for Furifuri is headed by Makoto Hyōtō, with the scenario being provided by Kansei Nishisora. Music used in the game is composed by U-ma. Both Makoto Hyōtō and U-ma has previously been in the development team of Kanojo-tachi no Ryūgi, 130 cm's previous game.
Release history
On July 25, 2008, a free game demo of Furifuri was released to the public online, which gave the player a glimpse into the characters and the story of the game through the typical gameplay of a visual novel in which the player reads the text that appears on the screen. The full game was released on August 29, 2008, as a DVD playable only on a Microsoft Windows PC.
Music
The visual novel has one theme song. The opening theme, entitled "Stars Biscuit" was performed and written by Kotoko, and composed and arranged by Maiko Iuchi. An original soundtrack disc containing the opening theme song was released on December 28, 2008, alongside a paperbag as part of 130 cm's Comiket 75 product set.

Dionisio "Dennis" Chávez (April 8, 1888November 18, 1962) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1931 to 1935, and in the United States Senate from 1935 to 1962. He was the first Hispanic to be elected to a full term in the US Senate and the first US Senator to be born in New Mexico, which was still a US territory at the time of his birth.
Early life
Chávez was born in Los Chavez in the New Mexico Territory. His parents, David and Paz Chávez, were members of families that had lived in Los Chavez for generations. There was no school in that town. In 1895, David Chávez moved his family to the Barelas section of Albuquerque, New Mexico to work on the railroad and Dennis attended school until 7th grade when financial hardships necessitated that he work. His first job was delivering groceries at the Highland Grocery store. Later on, he studied engineering and surveying at night, and worked as an engineer for the City of Albuquerque for several years. Dennis's younger brother, David Chávez, served as the 34th Mayor of Santa Fe, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, and as a member of the New Mexico Supreme Court.
Career
Early career
Chávez worked briefly as editor of a Belen weekly newspaper, as a court interpreter, and as a private contractor until 1916, when he obtained temporary employment as a Spanish interpreter for Senator Andrieus A. Jones' election campaign. In 1917, he was offered a position as assistant executive clerk of the Senate in Washington, D.C. by Senator Jones. He accepted this position, passed a special admission exam at Georgetown University Law Center and studied law at night. He graduated from Georgetown in 1920, and returned to Albuquerque to establish a law practice. He was successful in defending organized labor and as a defense counsel in high-profile murder cases, where he used his popularity to run for office.
House
In 1922, Chávez was elected to the New Mexico state legislature, but he did not seek another term. In 1930, he was elected to New Mexico's one at-large seat in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat, and was re-elected in 1932. Chávez served as chairman of the House Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation. He did not seek re-election to the House in 1934, becoming a candidate for the United States Senate.
Senate
Chávez was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senator from New Mexico in 1934. He lost narrowly to Republican incumbent Bronson M. Cutting. However, Cutting was killed in an airplane crash on May 6, 1935, and five days later, Chávez was appointed to fill the vacancy pending a special election. In 1936, Chávez was elected to the remaining four years of Cutting's term, and then won a full term of his own in 1940, becoming the first person of Hispanic descent to be elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. (Octaviano Larrazolo, also from New Mexico, was the first Hispanic to be elected to the Senate, but he was only elected to the remainder of an unexpired term and never served a full term.) Chávez was re-elected again in 1946, 1952 and 1958, and served until his death in 1962. He served as chairman of the Committee on Public Works from 1949 to 1953, and again from 1955 until his death.
In 1954, Senate Republicans attempted to remove Chávez from his seat, claiming that irregularities from the 1952 election meant the election results could not be trusted. A resolution that claimed no candidate had won the 1952 election, and therefore requiring the Republican governor of New Mexico to appoint a new senator, was defeated by a vote of 36-53.
Personal life
In 1911, Chávez married Imelda Espinosa, a member of a prominent New Mexico family. In 1914, they moved to Belen. The couple had three children: Dennis, Jr., Gloria and Ymelda.
Dennis Chávez died of cancer, attributed to his being a lifelong smoker, in Washington, D.C. on November 18, 1962, and was buried at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Congress honored his memory with a minute of silence, and then-Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke at his funeral. At the time of his death, he was fourth-ranking in Senate seniority.
Legacy
Chávez, only the second-ever Hispanic member of the US Senate, was the first US-born Hispanic elected to the Senate (Octaviano Larrazolo was born in Mexico). He was also the first person born in New Mexico elected by the state to the Senate. By a large margin, he is the longest-serving Hispanic US senator.
He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 35¢ Great Americans series (1980–2000) postage stamp.
His daughter, Ymelda Chavez Dixon, wrote a successful women's column for the Washington Evening Star from 1965-1981 called "Your Date with Ymelda."
A granddaughter, Gloria Tristani, followed in public service, serving as chair of the New Mexico State Corporations Commission in 1996, as a member of the Federal Communications Commission from 1997 to 2001, and as the Democratic nominee for New Mexico's other U.S. Senate seat in 2002 where she lost to Senator Pete Domenici.

Ingham railway station was a railway station in Ingham, Suffolk which was located was on the route between Thetford and Bury St Edmunds.
History
The railway line between Bury St Edmunds and Thetford was proposed by the Bury St Edmunds and Thetford Railway (B&TR) and authorised on 5 July 1865; but the company had problems in raising the necessary money. After assistance was given by the Thetford and Watton Railway (T&WR, see Bury and Thetford (Swaffham Branch)), the plan was modified, and instead of running to the main station at , a curve was built so that T&WR trains from could run directly to the Bury St Edmunds line without reversing at Thetford. The B&TR line between and was opened on 1 March 1876. The B&TR was purchased by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1878.
Trains on the B&TR were operated by the T&WR until 1879, when operation was taken over by the GER; after this, trains from Bury began to run to Thetford; the east to south curve at Thetford Bridge was not used after 1880. Thetford Bridge was then the last station before .
The station was closed to passenger traffic on 8 June 1953 although goods traffic lingered on for a few years before withdrawal on 24 June 1960. The station had a single platform with a ticket office and a small goods yard.

Rodney Graham (born January 16, 1949) is an artist and musician born in Abbotsford, British Columbia. He is most often associated with the Vancouver School.
Work
Coming out of Vancouver's 1970s photoconceptual tradition, Rodney Graham's work is often informed by historical literary, musical, philosophical and popular references. He is most often associated with other West-coast Canadian artists, including Vikky Alexander, Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, Roy Arden and Ken Lum. He was taught by fellow Vancouver school artist Ian Wallace while at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, from 1979 to 1980. Around this time, he played electric guitar in the band UJ3RK5 with fellow artist Jeff Wall on keyboards and Ian Wallace on electric bass, among others. His wide-ranging and often genre-busting work has frequently engaged with technologies of the past: literary, psychological and musical texts, optical devices, and film as an historical medium.
Among his earliest works is Camera Obscura (1979; destroyed 1981) a site-specific work that consisted of a shed-sized optical device on his family's farm field near Abbotsford, British Columbia. Entering the shed, the observer was confronted with an inverted image of a solitary tree. Both prior to this (with Rome Ruins [1978]) and throughout the 1980s and 90s, Graham employed the technique of the camera obscura in his work.
Beginning in the early 1980s, Graham took found texts as the basis for his bookworks—at once conceptual and material—inserting bookmarks with additional pages, inserting textual loops or incorporating books into optical devices in works such as Dr. No* (1991), Lenz (1983) and Reading Machine for Lenz (1993) respectively. Many of these were carried out with esteemed Belgian publisher Yves Gevaert and/or the gallerist Christine Burgin. His extensive body of work related to Sigmund Freud (beginning in 1983) has developed out of this text-based practice, though, later, found object books would be integrated unmodified into Donald Judd-like sculptures, for example The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (1987).
Until 1997, when he represented Canada at the Venice Biennale with the film loop Vexation Island, Graham was most well known for his series of photographs of Welsh oaks seen upside-down. For this project, he employed a photographer to take black and white negatives of majestic, isolated trees in the English countryside with a large-format camera. He then hung the pictures upside down, like camera obscura images. In 1998 Graham produced his definitive work on this theme, a series of seven monumental images of Welsh oaks printed on color paper to produce warm deep sepia and charcoal hues.
A postage stamp depicting Graham's photograph, Basement Camera Shop circa 1937 was issued on March 22, 2013 by Canada Post as part of their Canadian Photography series. The image is a recreation of a snapshot discovered by the artist at an antique store. Graham places himself in the photograph as the owner standing at the counter, waiting for a customer.
Film
In 1994, Graham began a series of films and videos in which he himself appears as the principal character: Halcion Sleep (1994), Vexation Island (1997) (shown at Canadian pavilion of the 1997 Venice Biennale), How I Became a Ramblin' Man (1999), and The Phonokinetoscope (2002). In The Phonokinetoscope Graham's engagement with the origins of cinema and its eventual demise surface. In this work, Graham takes up a prototype by Thomas Edison and puts forward an argument for the relation between sound and image in film.
In Vexation Island (1997), a shipwrecked sailor, played by Graham, wakes up on a tropical island only to be knocked unconscious by a falling coconut that he has succeeded in shaking out of a palm tree; after a while he reawakens, returns to the tree and the cycle repeats. Later, in Rheinmetall/Victoria 8 (2003), two increasingly obsolete technologies, the typewriter and film projector, face off against one another—with the latter projecting a film of the former.
The film Lobbing Potatoes at a Gong (1969) (2006), shot on 16mm and presented as a looped projection, fictitiously documents a 1969 performance strongly reminiscent of the Fluxus movement. The artist, played by Graham, is shown sitting on a chair in the setting of an alternative cultural institution, with an audience watching him trying to hit a gong with potatoes. All the potatoes that actually hit the gong were subsequently used to produce vodka in a small still. The bottle is displayed in a showcase, both an end product and part of the work. As in many of Graham's films, the relatively simple plot is in stark contrast to the effort that went into the production, with the artist conducting extensive research and hiring a professional film crew.
Drawing and painting
In 2003, Graham turned to drawing and painting for the first time. Adopting a persona in a host of related photographic, installation and painted works, The Gifted Amateur, November 10, 1962, 2007, indicates both continuing performative and art historical directions in his work.
In 2009, Graham exhibited a series of film installations with Harun Farocki, called "HF/RG," at the Jeu de Paume, Paris.
Exhibitions
Graham's solo exhibitions include the Vancouver Art Gallery (2012); a retrospective at MACBA, Barcelona (2010), travelling to Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Basel; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2004); Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia (2005), Whitechapel Gallery, London (2002), and Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin (2001). The artist was included in documenta IX (1992), the Venice Biennale in 1997, the Whitney Biennial in 2006, and the Carnegie International in 2013.
Recognition
Graham represented Canada at the 47th Venice Biennale (1997) and among awards he has received the Gershon Iskowitz Prize, Toronto (2004), the Kurt Schwitters-Preis, Niedersächsiche Sparkassenstiftung, Germany (2006) and the Audain Prize for lifetime achievement in visual arts, British Columbia (2011). In 2016, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada for his contributions to Canadian contemporary visual arts.
Personal life
Graham lives in Vancouver and is married to the artist Shannon Oksanen. Though they have not divorced, she lives separately with her two children and their father. Together they own Liberty Bakery in Vancouver.

Mesocco Castle is a ruined castle in the municipality of Mesocco of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
The Castello ruins are among the largest in the canton. Originally the seat of the noble family von Sax, from the 12th century until 1480 it was held by the Freiherr of Misox/Mesocco. From 1480 until 1549 it was held by the Trivulzio family.
History
A small fortified church, the Church of S. Carpoforo, was built on the hill top around the 7th century as a refuge castle for the surrounding villages. Around 1000, the fortifications around the church began gradually expanding and a bell tower was added to the church. A bergfried was added between 1150 and 1200, changing the shape and location of the walls. By the 12th century the fortified church and occasionally used fortifications had expanded into a permanently occupied castle with a nobleman who ruled over the nearby valley. By 1219 it was mentioned as Mesocco Castle. In the 13th century the castle was expanded again. A ring wall now encircled the entire hill top and a large residential wing was added to the tower. Around 1400 the residential wing was expanded and now formed an inner castle with the tower.
The first ruler of the castle was the local Baron of Sax/Misox, who by the 13th century ruled over the entire Val Mesolcina and controlled a number of castles. By the end of the century, the baron's power crossed over the San Bernardino Pass and by the 14th century they reached the peak of their power. Baron Albert von Sax-Misox was a founding member of the Grey League and the family's future looked bright. However, Albert's murder in 1406 led to the gradual decline of the family. In 1480 they sold Mesocco castle and its associated demesne to General Giacomo Trivulzio.
Trivulzio had been sent by Milan to acquire the castle and strengthen their claims in the strategic valley. After he paid a deposit on the castle and occupied it, he refused the pay the remainder of the agreed upon price of 16,000 Rheingulden. In 1483 the Baron of Sax and local forces besieged the castle in an unsuccessful attempt to force Trivulzio to pay. However, over the following years, he broke with Milan and paid the remaining money to improve local relations. In 1490 Trivulzio expanded and strengthened the castle and sited cannons on the walls.
In 1496 he signed a treaty with the Grey League to support them with weapons and supplies in the event of a war, which he was called to do during the Swabian War and Musso War. Despite the extensive fortifications, in 1526 the newly formed Three Leagues ordered the castle abandoned and moved the administrative center of the valley to Palast Trivulzio in Roveredo.
The castle fell into ruin until 1925-26 when it was excavated and reinforced. A further project in 1986-90 restored a polygonal tower and northern and north-western walls.
Castle site
The castle sprawls over the entire top of a small mountain. The walls form an irregular pentagon with five towers. The interior of the castle was home to the count's family and his soldiers as well as armories, a foundry, a bakery, a dairy, a cistern and a charnel house. The church of S. Carpoforo also stood inside the castle walls. At the foot of the castle is the Church of Santa Maria al Castello. The church was first mentioned in 1219. It houses several frescoes from the workshop of Seregnesi from the mid-15th century.

Sweet Hours (Dulces horas) is a Spanish film, written and directed by Carlos Saura and released in 1982. The title comes from the words dulces horas de ayer (sweet hours of yesterday) in the soundtrack song Recordar (To Remember) sung by the soprano Imperio Argentina.
Plot
The past is a riddle to Juan, a well-off bachelor playwright aged around 40. He is obsessed by it, by memories of the older father who went off to Argentina with another woman and the lovely young mother who then committed suicide. He has written a play called Sweet Hours, which contains what he recalls as key scenes of his early life. The play is in rehearsal and he attends the sessions, watchful and absorbed. He is searching for something. Juan slips in and out of the acted reconstructions and his own not necessarily reliable memories of childhood during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. Prodded by his sister Marta, who neither idolised her mother nor was her pampered darling, Juan begins to see that under her beauty and charm his mother was selfish and manipulative, driving her husband away and by her suffocating affection warping her son for life. Berta, the stunning young actress who is rehearsing the role of the mother and with whom he is falling in love, realises that for her and Juan to be happy together she must replace the dead mother. So the past repeats itself, inescapably it seems.

Reception
The film was reviewed by Pauline Kael in The New Yorker; " This movie has the kind of subtle obviousness that is generally described as literate. What it comes down to is that Carlos Saura has a feeling for dark, autumnal elegance, and a dexterous technique that he puts at the service of tired ideas. What saves him from pedantry is that his films have occasional moments of erotic vibrancy. Scenes that aren't explicitly sexual in content are sexualized, so that they become ambiguous and disturbing - even haunting...In a Saura film, something more directly sexual is often impending; it hovers in the atmosphere. ..the wide-eyed Assumpta Serna, when she smiles, has a teasing elusiveness..She makes the atmosphere hum..perhaps Saura means us to see that the cycle is inescapable..The enigma of Saura is his addiction to enigma."

Philotheca virgata, commonly known as Tasmanian wax-flower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae and is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It is a slender, erect shrub with wedge-shaped to oblong leaves and white or pale pink flowers at the ends of branchlets. It is the only philotheca with four sepals and petals.
Description
Philotheca virgata is a slender, erect shrub that typically grows to a height of about and has prominently glandular warty branchlets. The leaves are sessile, narrow wedge-shaped to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide and glandular warty on the upper surface. The flowers are arranged singly on the end of branchlets on a thin pedicel long. The four sepals are more or less round, fleshy and about long. The four petals are white or pale pink, broadly elliptic and about long and the eight stamens are about long and hairy. Flowering occurs from May to December and the fruit is about long with a short beak.
Taxonomy
Tasmanian wax-flower was first formally described in 1840 by Joseph Dalton Hooker from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham who gave it the name Erisotemon virgatus. Hooker published the description in The Journal of Botany. In 1998, Paul Wilson changed the name to Philotheca virgata in the journal Nuytsia.
Distribution and habitat
Philotheca virgata grows in heathland and forest in coastal areas of southern and western Tasmania, south of Eden in New South Wales and in the extreme north east of Victoria.

St-y-Nyll is a large detached house near the village of St. Brides-super-Ely in the Vale of Glamorgan.
It was built in 1924 by the Welsh architect Percy Thomas in the Neo-Georgian style. A Tudor mansion dating from the 1480s had previously stood on the site. It has been listed Grade II by Cadw since June 1977. It was put up for sale in 2000 for £715,000 and was described as having of grounds. The interior is noted for its plaster cornices, parquet floors, and original fireplaces dating from the 17th century, the Georgian period, and in the style of Robert Adam. It sold for £1.5 million in June 2020.

Burgess Hill Girls (previously named Burgess Hill School for Girls) is an independent, girls-only day and boarding school for girls aged between 2½ and 18 years (full boarding is offered from 11 years), founded in 1906 by Miss Beatrice Goode. The school is located in Burgess Hill, West Sussex, having moved to its present location in 1928. The school also has boys attending the nursery.
Overview
The multi-building school is situated on Keymer Road, in the West Sussex town of Burgess Hill, and is a five-minute walk from Burgess Hill railway station, which is on the Brighton Main Line. Coaches and minibuses collect girls from outlying areas in Sussex.
The school was last visited in 2014 by the Independent Schools Inspectorate. The main findings were that the school met its aims successfully and the achievement and personal development of all pupils was excellent. The school met all the requirements of the Independent School Standards Regulations (2010) but did not meet all the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools (2013). The majority of boarders were found by the report to be from Nigeria and China.
Mrs Kathryn Bell (Head 2014–2017) took the place of Mrs Ann Aughwane (Head 2006–2014) in 2014. In September 2015, she rebranded the school, changing its logo, colours, and name. The name changed from Burgess Hill School for Girls to Burgess Hill Girls.
After 11 years as Deputy Head, Mrs Liz Laybourn became Head in 2017 until she retired in 2022.
In August 2022, Mr Lars Fox became the new Head of Burgess Hill Girls.

Admiral Sir Algernon Frederick Rous de Horsey (25 July 1827 – 22 October 1922) was a Royal Navy officer, appointed aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria. He distinguished himself in Canada during the Fenian raids, and was thanked in Parliament for suppressing riots in Jamaica.
Early life
De Horsey was the son of Spencer de Horsey, of Great Glemham Suffolk, and Lady Louise, a daughter of the first Earl of Stradbroke. His only sister was the Countess of Cardigan, whose reminiscences caused a scandal when they were published.
Naval career
De Horsey joined the Royal Navy in 1840 and served on the coast of Syria later that year. He received the Naval General Service Medal and bar for his service in Syria as well as a medal for his service in Acre given by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Promoted to Lieutenant in July 1846 and to Commander in June 1853, he was given command of the paddle sloop HMS Devastation that same month and of HMS Victor from November 1855. Promoted to Captain in September 1857, he commanded HMS Brisk from May 1859, HMS Wolverine from May 1864, HMS Aurora from November 1865 and HMS Hector from May 1868. He was Senior Officer on the Lakes of Canada during the Fenian raids; for this he was awarded the Canadian Medal. In 1871 he was made ADC to Queen Victoria. In July 1872, having been promoted to Commodore, he became Senior Naval Officer in Jamaica with his pennant in HMS Aboukir and responsible for superintending Jamaica Dockyard. He captured the Spanish slave ship Manuela, and suppressed riots in Jamaica for which he was thanked in Parliament.
He was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station in 1876, with his flag in HMS Repulse, HMS Shah and then HMS Triumph. In this capacity he engaged with the Huáscar during the Peruvian civil war. He was made Commander-in-Chief, Channel Squadron with his flag in HMS Northumberland in December 1884. He was promoted to full Admiral in April 1885 and placed on retired list in July 1892.
On 8 September 1878, Admiral de Horsey in the Shah visited Pitcairn Island.
His Admiralty report includes the remark, "One stranger, an American, has settled on the island – a doubtful acquisition." This line inspired Mark Twain to write the short story The Great Revolution in Pitcairn (1879).
He was appointed KCB on 9 November 1903 and lived at Melcombe House in Cowes. He frequently contributed letters to The Times and wrote An African Pilot and The Rule of the Road at Sea. He was chairman of Isle of Wight magistrates for many years and Deputy Lieutenant. On 7 November 1913, he was appointed a deputy governor of the Isle of Wight. He died on 22 October 1922 and was described by The Times as "Doyen of the Navy". He is buried, together with his wife Caroline, at Carisbrooke (Mountjoy) Cemetery within sight of Carisbrooke Castle.
Family
He married Caroline, daughter of Admiral Andrew Drew, in 1861 and was the father of Louisa Mary Adeline de Horsey Phillips and grandfather of Admiral Tom Phillips. His son was Vice Admiral Victor Yorke de Horsey while his other daughter married Major William Croughton of the 3rd Dragoon Guards.
Legacy
De Horsey Island at the mouth of the Skeena River on the North Coast of British Columbia, Canada, was named for de Horsey, as was De Horsey Passage, which separates it from Smith Island to its west.

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. is an American bank headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, which operates in the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington DC.
Between 1988 and its 2014 initial public offering, Citizens was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The group sold its last 20.9% stake in the company in October 2015.
Citizen operates 1,003 branches and 4 wealth centers as of June 22nd, 2022 and over 3,100 ATMs across 11 states under the Citizens Bank brand.
Citizen ranks 17th on the List of the largest banks in the United States as of the last day of Q1 2022.
History
Early history
Citizens are established in 1828 as the High Street Bank in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1871, the Rhode Island legislature gave a second charter to establish the Citizens Savings Bank which eventually acquired its parent group to form Citizens Trust Company. The bank then expanded through Rhode Island, opening a total of 29 branches in that state. It established Citizens Financial Group as a holding company when the bank acquired The Greenville Trust Company in 1954.
In 1985, Citizens changed status from a mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank. Expansion into other states began with Massachusetts in 1986.
RBS ownership
In 1988, Royal Bank of Scotland Group acquired Citizens. Under RBS ownership, Citizens acquired several smaller banks in New England to become the second largest bank in the region. In 1996, in conjunction with the acquisition of First NH Bank, the Bank of Ireland gained a 23.5% stake in Citizens, which RBS then acquired two years later to resume 100% ownership.
In 1999, Citizens acquired the United States Trust Company of Boston and the retail banking business of State Street Corporation, significantly increasing its footprint in Massachusetts.
Expansion outside New England began in 2001, when RBS purchased the retail banking division of Mellon Financial Corporation in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware for $2 billion. At one stroke, Citizens Bank became the second-largest bank in Pennsylvania, and a major bank in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
In July 2003, the bank purchased the naming rights to the new home field of the Philadelphia Phillies, which was named Citizens Bank Park.
On January 17, 2003, Citizens Financial Group purchased Commonwealth Bancorp, the holding company for Commonwealth Bank, based in Norristown, Pennsylvania.
In 2004, RBS purchased the credit card division of Connecticut-based People's Bank. This purchase allowed Citizens to issue and market its own credit cards.
In October 2015, RBS sold its remaining stake in Citizens Financial Group, having progressively reduced its stake through an initial public offering (IPO) started in 2014.
Charter One Financial
In August 2004, Citizens Financial acquired Cleveland-based Charter One Financial, parent company of Charter One Bank, with branches in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, upstate New York, and Vermont for $10.5 billion. Because Citizens Republic Bancorp of Flint, Michigan already operated under the Citizens Bank names in most of Charter One's territory, Citizens Financial elected to keep the Charter One name in Charter One's Midwestern footprint. However, it re-branded the New York and Vermont branches as Citizens Bank. This purchase made Citizens Financial the 12th largest bank in the United States with over $131 billion in assets and 1,530 branches across 13 states.
In early 2005, the Charter One name replaced the Citizens Bank banner on seven branches in Butler County, Pennsylvania. This rebranding resolved a 3½-year-old name dispute with Butler-based Citizens National Bank. By mid 2005, Citizens National and Citizens Financial agreed to a compromise. Citizens National Bank changed its name to NexTier Bank, while the Citizens Financial Group branches reverted to the "Citizens Bank" name.
A new corporate logo designed to show Citizens Bank's connection to the Royal Bank of Scotland debuted on April 26, 2005.
In July 2006, Citizens Bank eliminated the mortgage department in Michigan and terminated over 100 employees.
On September 1, 2007, the individual banks under Citizens Financial Group, excluding Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, merged into RBS Citizens, N.A.
In November 2008, Charter One sold its network of 65 branches in Indiana to Old National Bank which rebranded them under the Old National Bank banner. The transaction closed in June 2010.
In 2014, Citizens sold 94 branches in metropolitan Chicago to U.S. Bancorp.
Citizens Republic Bancorp was founded in Flint, Michigan in 1871 and merged with Republic Bank in 2006. In 2007, Citizens Republic prevailed in a case to prevent Citizens Financial from using the similar name in Michigan and Ohio. FirstMerit Bank acquired Citizens Republic in 2013 and rebranded all branches as FirstMerit until 2016 when Huntington Bancshares acquired FirstMerit. With conflicting names no longer an issue, Citizens Bank announced June 30, 2014, that Charter One branches in Michigan and Ohio would be rebranded as Citizens Bank. The name change officially took place on April 27, 2015, bringing to an end the name Charter One in Cleveland; the city in which it was founded.
Financial crisis
In May 2008, Citizens Financial Group failed to publicly announce that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its involvement in the sub-prime mortgage crisis that devastated the U.S. housing market and bond investors around the world. The SEC only investigated banks if suspected of involvement in the purchase and sale of subprime securities.
In 2008, the company lost $929 million and anticipated writing off $2 billion in bad loans. Royal Bank of Scotland posted the biggest loss in British corporate history and announced cost-cutting measures at Citizens.
A Philadelphia developer sued Citizens Bank January 27, 2010, for $8 billion, under a claim that the bank used sham accusations of default to recall loans in an effort to prop up its failing parent companies, Citizens Financial Group and "its ultimate parent, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group."
The Road to IPO
Following the effective nationalization of RBS in 2008, speculation arose as to whether RBS would retain Citizens Bank. In 2012, public pressure in the United Kingdom grew for RBS to focus on its home market and sell foreign assets, including Citizens Bank, in order for UK taxpayers to earn their money back. Substantial interest in Citizens Bank had been rumored from other foreign banks such as Brazil-based Itaú Unibanco and Canada-based Toronto-Dominion Bank, the latter of which already had an existing U.S. branch network that overlapped with the existing Citizen footprint east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Bank of Montreal, with its existing U.S. presence, was also mentioned as a possible buyer. U.S. banks mentioned as potential Citizens buyers included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services, and Fifth Third Bank.
In February 2013, RBS confirmed at least a partial spinoff of Citizens through an initial public offering within the next two years. Then in October 2013, RBS announced it would sell its Chicago-area branches, which represented 6% of its U.S. deposits; Citizens later agreed to sell those branches to U.S. Bancorp on January 7, 2014. Finally in November 2013, RBS announced that it would divest all Citizens Financial Group.
The bank began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CFG on September 24, 2014, raising $3 billion. By April 2015, RBS Group's shareholding in the bank had dropped to 45.6%. A further sale in July 2015 reduced RBS' stake to 23.4%. RBS sold its remaining stake in the bank in October 2015. However, Citizens still uses the RBS "daisy wheel" logo.
In June 2016, it was announced that Citizens Financial Group had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.
Misappropriation of depositor funds
In August 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other federal regulators levied nearly $35 million in penalties against Citizens Bank "for failing to credit to customers' accounts the full amount of their deposits". The regulators declared that, from 2008 to 2013, "The bank's actions resulted in consumers being shorted millions of dollars". Joint action by the CFPB, the FDIC, and the Comptroller of the Currency determined that Citizens Bank had engaged in "deceptive practices" by "fail[ing] to give customers their full deposits at times when the size of the deposit didn't match the number written on deposit slips", despite promising to correct such discrepancies, instead pocketing the difference. The bank was required to reimburse its customers for lost funds as well as pay roughly $20 million in fines to the three agencies. The New York Times said that Citizens Bank's misconduct "is appalling precisely because it is so basic", demonstrating that "regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are a necessary defense against a system prone to abuses".
Paul Manafort investigation
On May 12, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice requested from numerous banks, including Citizens, Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort's transaction records. According to the article, the request was related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Manafort reportedly secured a 2.7 million-dollar loan from Citizens in 2016.
On February 26, 2018, Bloomberg News reported that Citizens' stock price dropped 4.1 percent after U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of Manafort was released, appearing to indicate that Citizens was the "Lender B" cited as having lent 3.4 million dollars to the former campaign manager of President Trump.
Franklin American Mortgage
In August 2018, Citizens completed its acquisition of Franklin American Mortgage in a deal valued at $511 Million, expanding its presence into Tennessee and Texas.
HSBC Bank USA Acquisition
On May 26, 2021, Citizens entered into an agreement with HSBC Bank USA to purchase HSBC's retail operations on the East Coast, including 80 branches in New York City, Washington D.C., and Southeast Florida. Under the agreement, Citizens will acquire approximately $9.0 billion in deposits and approximately $2.2 billion in loans.
Investors Bancorp Acquisition
In July 2021, Citizens announced plans to acquire New Jersey-based bank holding company Investors Bancorp for $3.5 billion. Citizen anticipates taking over more than 150 branches with the deal.
Branches
Like several other banks, Citizens has agreements with several supermarket chains to locate bank branches in the stores. The greatest number of these are in Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle stores, most of which were acquired in the acquisition of Mellon Financial Corporation's retail banking division. Citizens also operates branches inside many Stop & Shop and Shaw's stores in New England. One unique aspect at Citizens branches inside supermarkets is full-service banking from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays; historically, USA banks were often closed on Sunday and even Saturdays.
In September 2010, Giant Eagle announced a new agreement with Huntington Bank in which Huntington would open branches in several stores in Ohio and West Virginia and will replace existing branches of other banks when the store's agreements with those banks expire.
On June 25, 2008, Citizens Bank announced would sell 18 branches in upstate New York as it prepared to open 57 branches downstate. Community Bank System Inc. of DeWitt, New York purchased the branches in Ausable Forks, Champlain, Fort Covington, Indian Lake, Lake Placid, Lyons Falls, Long Lake, Malone, Newcomb, North Creek, Plattsburgh, Saranac Lake, Ticonderoga, Tupper Lake and Whitehall. The sale completed on November 7, 2008.
In October 2009, Citizens Bank opened a full-service branch inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The branch offers teller windows, a full-service automated teller machine (ATM) and Dunkin' Donuts promotions for using the bank's services.
Citizens was one of the first banks in the US to use Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on its ATM cards, via MasterCard PayPass. In late 2009, however, Citizens began reissuing its cards under Visa without the RFID technology.
In April 2022, Citizens completed the acquisition of 80 branches from HSBC in New York City, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia, and Florida.

St. Madoes () is a village in the Carse of Gowrie, Scotland. It was developed near Pitfour Castle. It is believed that there have been settlements since around 1000 C.E based on discoveries of several standing stones and the St. Madoes stone, a well-preserved Pictish cross.
Local amenities at St. Madoes include a small shop, two parks, a primary school and an 18th-century church built upon the remains of an earlier church. It is believed the original drawings for the church were done by the architect Robert Adam (1728-1792); the design and layout are very similar to the only other known Robert Adam country kirk (Kirkoswald near Culzean Castle) with the most noted similarity being the gallery (or Laird's Loft) on the back wall, facing the central pulpit. Adam also designed Pitfour Castle. Both buildings were funded by the laird John Richardson (1760-1821), a wealthy local man involved with the salmon fisheries of the Tay.
Recently the village has started expanding due to the building of a large housing estate.
It is located near Errol, between Dundee and Perth.

Michael J. Mumma is an American astrobiologist at the Goddard Space Flight Center; he is best known for his investigation of the chemistry of comets.
Education
Mumma graduated from Franklin and Marshall College in 1963, with an A.B. in physics. He received a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1970, and joined NASA's GSFC thereafter.
Career
Mumma is the founding director of the Goddard Center for Astrobiology (2003–present) and Senior Scientist in the Solar System Exploration Division (2005–present). He has had adjunct professorships at Pennsylvania State University, University of Toledo and University of Maryland during his tenure with GFSC.
Mumma's major research interests have been largely directed towards understanding life's origin and its distribution in the cosmos through the study of planetary and cometary chemistry. Mumma pioneered the first detection of water in comets. Using similar spectrometric methodology Mumma has identified many other gaseous species found in comets. He posits that it is possible that comets "seeded life" on the Earth, filling the oceans with water and essential molecular building blocks. He uses information gleaned from Comet LINEAR showing the same isotopic composition as water on the Earth. Recent cometary data on water confirms the data from Comet LINEAR. For his longstanding contribution to planetary science, in 1999 the International Astronomical Union named asteroid 8340 "Michael J. Mumma".
Mumma's group at GFSC was the first to report methane plumes on Mars, and suggested that pores in the soil might open only during certain seasons. These findings have been recently confirmed. The source of the methane is still unresolved, whether it is geochemical or from living systems, which would indicate life on Mars. As far as further findings and conclusions, Mumma stated: "There will be surprising results."
Mumma reports that the most important thing he does is working "intensely" with young scientists, exposing them to the "exciting" research at GFSC. At Goddard, he has mentored 31 post-docs and senior visiting scientists and has codirected eight Ph. D. theses. So, every day brings something new to us. It's the newness, the continued discovery-rather small ones, larger ones, it doesn't matter, and in my view it's not work, you see. This is the way we spend our lives, in discovery, and this is an opportunity to continue doing that daily.
In 2019 Mumma was part of the team that found water vapors on Europa. This is important as Europa is a prime target in looking for life forms in the solar system.
Mumma appeared as himself in a 2007 episode of The Universe.

The Sadgop sub-caste is a Bengali Hindu Yadav caste, found in West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and parts of Bihar state in India. Traditionally they are engaged in dairy-farming and cultivation. However, historically Sadgop kings had ruled some parts of Bengal such as Gopbhum, Karnagarh, Narayangarh and Balarampur. They are one of the fourteen castes belonging to 'Nabasakh' group. They are recognized as a General caste.
Origin of the Caste
The Sadgops are an offshoot of the pastoral Gop or Goala caste who broke away from the main jati before the middle of the sixteenth century. Their switch to agriculture was only 'the starting point of rise to eminence'. Through extending their activities to trade, they established control over the land they had put under the plough. Thus, leaders from the group acquired political power at the local level. Later on the group also ventured into trade and worked as officials of the state and the big jamindars. Members of the new group also made achievements in the fields of religion, and from dissident Gop families came popular saints like Syamananda and the founder of the influential Kartabhaja sect, Aulchand. In the process, they changed their jati affiliation by adding sad (sat, 'clean') to their name, thus becoming Sadgops.
The Sadgops are generally recognized as a purified section of the Goala caste, who are associated, like Krishna from whom they trace descent, with tending cattle and providing milk and milk products. They attained their higher position by adopting agriculture as their caste-related occupation.
History and varna
Sadgops have generally been considered as clean shudras (sat-shudras) in the caste structure of Bengal. Like south India social groups of east India usually divided in two grades - Brahmins and Shudras. In the 1910s, Sadgops along with Ahirs, Gops, Gopals, and Goalas began claiming kshatriya status based on claimed descent from the legendary king Yadu. The Yadav-kshatriya movement attracted communities in the Gangetic plain who were associated with a combination of cultivation, cattle-herding, and dairy farming. According to some, Sadgops believe they have descended from Lord Krishna.
Present circumstances
The Sadgop consist of a number of sub-divisions. They are an endogamous group and practice gotra exogamy. The Sadgop are mainly a landholding community, but many Sadgop have settled in Kolkata and other cities of West Bengal. Their own community organization is named as Bangiya Sadgop Samiti.

Erik Paulson (born 1966) is an American mixed martial artist. He is the first American to win the World Light-Heavy Weight Shooto Title in Japan.
Biography
Erik started his career in martial arts starting with Judo at age of 8. However, he got disillusioned after failing to use it in self-defense, when a bully blocked his hip throw by pulling his hair and forced Erik to strike him in order to win. Convinced that striking arts were the best to defend himself, he took up Taekwondo, Boxing, Karate, Aikido, Wrestling, and Jujutsu. Many years after, he moved to California and became a student under Dan Inosanto, Gene Lebell, and Benny Urquidez, learning styles like Kickboxing, Jeet Kune Do, Savate, Arnis/Kali/Eskrima, Kung Fu, Sambo, Muay Thai, Chin Na, Dumog, Panantukan, and Silat.
In 1988, however, Paulson returned to explore grappling when he started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Rorion, Royce and Rickson Gracie in his garage. Upon returning to Inosanto's academy, he met Yorinaga Nakamura, who taught him Shoot Wrestling. Paulson also trained extensively in Catch Wrestling under Billy Robinson. Paulson got hooked with the style, and through Nakamura he got in touch with Satoru Sayama in order to fight in Shooto. In 1993, Erik had his first fight there, submitting Kazuhiro Kusayanagi. He also asked to compete in Ultimate Fighting Championship, but the Gracies refused as Royce was already going to compete there, so Paulson ended up cornering him instead.
Later, in 1995, Paulson took part in an MMA tournament similar to UFC, World Combat Championships, which divided its participants in "strikers" and "grapplers" in order to pit them against each other in the finals. Again, a Gracie participated in the event, Renzo, but this time Paulson got the green light to take part in the tournament. Unfortunately, Paulson was put into the striker block, in which rules prohibited submission finishes, and it took away Erik's best field. Moreover, his long hair played against him, as he couldn't cut it due to his role as a film stuntman. His first match, against Muay Thai exponent Sean McCully, evidenced both disadvantages, with Paulson having to endure hair pulling and a significant punishment in order to finish him by ground and pound. At the second round, he faced Kickboxing champion James Warring, heavier and better rested, and this time Paulson's hair weakness took dramatic proportions; Warring grabbed the cage in order to avoid being taken down and literally dragged Paulson around the cage by the hair, making his corner throw the towel. After returning to the Gracie academy, Rickson expelled him without explanation and forbade him to train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu again, but Paulson simply moved to train it with the Machado brothers.
Paulson still competed in Shooto, being sent as a representative to the Vale Tudo Japan event, where he was submitted in 0:41 by Canadian grappler Carlos Newton. He retired shortly after, focusing in teaching as opposed to fight, though he came out of retirement in October 2007 to headline the first HDNET MMA fight card. Paulson took on Jeff Ford in the main event of the night. Paulson made quick work of Ford, winning by spinning armbar in the opening minutes of the first round.
Erik is the founder of Combat Submission Wrestling, and STX Kickboxing. He runs the CSW Training Center in Fullerton, California, where he trains MMA fighters such as Josh Barnett, Ken Shamrock, Renato Sobral, Cub Swanson, and James Wilks. He is closely affiliated with Sean Sherk and Brock Lesnar of the Minnesota Martial Arts Academy. As well, Paulson was the striking coach for Team Lesnar on The Ultimate Fighter: Season 13, and he is the coauthor of a book along with American Combat Association president Matthew Granahan and JD Dwyer on the History of American Submission Wrestling. He also has a younger brother, Leif Paulson, who is an up-and-coming grappler in his own right.
Erik played Kumite fighter Stellio in Bloodsport III, where he faced Daniel Bernhardt and had trained Djimon Hounsou in Shoot Wrestling for his role of Mixed Martial Arts instructor Jean Roqua in the 2008 action drama Never Back Down

The 2000 Kaduna riots were religious riots in Kaduna involving Christians and Muslims over the introduction of sharia law in Kaduna State, Nigeria. It is unclear how many people were killed in the fighting between Muslims and Christians, that lasted with peaceful intervals from 21 February until 23 May 2000; estimates vary from 1,000 to 5,000 deaths.
When in February 2000, the governor of Kaduna announced the introduction of sharia to Kaduna State, of which non-Muslims form almost half of the population, the Kaduna branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) organised a public protest against it in Kaduna city. Muslim youths then clashed with them and the situation spiraled out of control, with massive violence and destruction on both sides. The violence happened in two main waves (sometimes referred to as "Sharia 1" and "Sharia 2"): a first wave from 21 to 25 February, with further killings in March, followed by a second wave from 22 to 23 May. The initial violence left more than 1,000 people dead; a judicial commission set up by the Kaduna state government reported the official death toll to be 1,295. However, Human Rights Watch estimated the total number fatalities, including those from March and May and many from February the commission had not counted, to be much higher, somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000. Several media reported a number of about or more than 2,000 deaths (and 2 to 300 deaths in May). Eventually, the army interfered to end the bloody clashes when it became clear the police could not control them.
These became the first so-called "Sharia clashes", the start of the religious riots phase of the Sharia Conflict (1999–present).

Pat Ford is a Canadian retired ice hockey player and head coach, most recently leading the Findlay Oilers in their final season as a Division I program.
Career
Pat Ford played four years at Wisconsin in the mid 1980s, winning the WCHA tournament in his senior season. After graduating with a degree in bacteriology Ford briefly was a member of both the Canadian National Team and Swindon Wildcats before retiring as a player.
In 1990 he started his coaching career as an assistant at Madison Edgewood while also working as a graduate assistant with his alma mater. He became a full-time assistant with Northern Michigan in 1992 and two years later returned to Madison to take the same position with the Badgers. In the summer of 2002 Ford was hired as an associate coach for Findlay shortly after his former boss Jeff Sauer announced his retirement. While things appeared to be heading in the right direction for Ford, a year later the administration at Findlay changed and he soon was named as head coach after former bench boss Craig Barnett resigned. by January the following year Findlay announced that the team would be reduced to club status once more but Ford provided one final achievement for the program, winning their only playoff game in the 2004 CHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. Rather than continue to search for coaching opportunities Ford hung up his whistle after the season was over and continued his career working for Hellenbrand Water, a company in Waunakee, Wisconsin.
Personal life
Pat Ford has three sons with his wife Cammie, Jason, Keegan and Kevin. Jason is entering his junior year with Wisconsin. Keegan had attended Wisconsin in 2014 but, after playing only twelve games, left the program and transferred to Michigan Tech where he is set to begin playing in the fall of 2016. Kevin is currently playing junior hockey for the Kirkland Lake Gold Miners. (as of 2016)

The Assassin's Creed series, by Anton Gill, Andrew Holmes (both under the pen name Oliver Bowden), Christie Golden, Matthew J. Kirby and Gordon Doherty is a collection of novels set within the Assassin's Creed video game universe. The books are set across various time periods and, like the games, revolve around the secret war fought for centuries between the Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar Order. Most of the novels are direct adaptations of one of the games, with several added or slightly modified elements.
Renaissance
The first official Assassin's Creed novel, Assassin's Creed: Renaissance, was written by Anton Gill (under the pen name Oliver Bowden) and is a novelization of Assassin's Creed II. It was released on 20 November 2009 in the United Kingdom, and on 23 February 2010 in the United States. While the novel follows the game's events involving Ezio Auditore da Firenze (with the modern-day aspect entirely excluded), it changes most of the dialogue, the appearances of certain characters, and how some events occurred. It also omits certain events, while adding in others not featured in the game (some of these, such as Ezio's relationship with his first girlfriend, Cristina Vespucci, would later be adapted in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood).
Brotherhood
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the second novel in the series, was also written by Gill and is based on the video game of the same name. It was released on 25 November 2010 in the United Kingdom, and on 30 November in the United States. Like Renaissance, the novel changes some elements of the game, including omitting or adding in certain events, to better fit its narrative, but is overall a much more faithful adaptation.
The Secret Crusade
Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade is the first novel in the series written by Andrew Holmes (using the same name pen name of Oliver Bowden), and depicts the story of Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, as told by Niccolò Polo, adapting the events of Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, and the Altaïr sequences from Assassin's Creed: Revelations. It also features many events not depicted in any of the games, including Altaïr's childhood and his life in exile after being deposed as Mentor of the Assassin Order by his former friend, Abbas Sofian. The novel is presented as Niccolò's journal, which is recovered by Ezio at the beginning of Revelations. The epilogue reveals that Ezio is the actual narrator, as he is reading through the journal on his way to Constantinople during the events of the game. The Secret Crusade was released on 23 June 2011 in the United Kingdom, and on 28 June in the United States.
Revelations
Assassin's Creed: Revelations is the final novel in the series written by Gill and is an adaptation of the video game of the same name, focusing on Ezio's side of the story. The novel also describes the final years of Ezio's life, after the events of the game. It was released on 24 November 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 29 November 2011 in the United States.
Forsaken
Assassin's Creed: Forsaken, again written by Holmes, is based on Assassin's Creed III, but is not a direct adaptation. Instead, it tells the story of Haytham Kenway, the game's main antagonist, from his childhood until his death, showing a mirrored perspective to what the game portrays. Similarly to The Secret Crusade, the novel is presented as Haytham's journal, which is recovered by his son Connor (the game's main protagonist), who proceeds to read through it to better understand his father, and later completes it with events that occurred after Haytham's death. Forsaken was released on 4 December 2012 (the in-universe birth date of Haytham).
Black Flag
Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, again written by Holmes, is based on Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. The novel is presented as the journal of protagonist Edward Kenway, and explores his early life and his thoughts on the events that occur in the game. It was released on 26 November 2013.
Unity
Assassin's Creed: Unity, again written by Holmes, is based on the video game of the same name. Similarly to Forsaken, it presents the events of the game from the perspective of a different character (in this case, Élise de la Serre), as well as the experiences of protagonist Arno Dorian after the game. It was released on 20 November 2014 in the United Kingdom, and on 2 December in the United States.
Underworld
Assassin's Creed: Underworld was again written by Holmes and is based on Assassin's Creed Syndicate. The first two thirds of the book follow Henry Green, a major supporting character from the game, and Detective Frederick Abberline in 1862, with the final third covering the events of the game itself six years later. It was released on 5 November 2015 in the United Kingdom, and on 1 December in the United States.
The Official Movie Novelization
Assassin's Creed: The Official Movie Novelization, written by Christie Golden, is an adaptation of the live-action Assassin's Creed film released in 2016. In addition to retelling the film's events, it also includes an anthology of short stories from Nathan, Emir, Moussa, Lin, and their respective ancestors, and an excerpt from Assassin's Creed: Heresy. The novelization was released on 21 December 2016, the same day as the film.
Desert Oath
Assassin's Creed Origins: Desert Oath, again written by Andrew Holmes 31, is a prequel novel to Assassin's Creed Origins, telling the story of a young Bayek of Siwa and his father Sabu in Ptolemaic Egypt. It was published on 10 October 2017.
Odyssey
Assassin's Creed Odyssey (The Official Novelization), written by Gordon Doherty, tells one of the possible story paths of Assassin's Creed Odyssey featuring Kassandra, one of the two protagonists of the game. It was published on 30 October 2018 by Ace Books.
Valhalla – Geirmund's Saga
Assassin's Creed: Valhalla – Geirmund's Saga, written by Matthew J. Kirby, is a tie-in novel to Asssassin's Creed Valhalla. It does not follow the events of the game, instead telling the story of the Viking Geirmund Hel-hide within roughly the same time frame as Valhalla. It was published on 10 November 2020.

The church stands in woodland to the east of the hall.
History
The church was built in 1769. It was designed by Robert Adam for the owner of Gunton Hall, Sir William Harbord, to replace a former medieval church. It is the only building designed by Adam in Norfolk, and his only complete church in England.
Architecture
Exterior
St Andrew's is constructed in gault brick, parts of which are rendered, with stone dressings. It is in the form of a temple with a tetrastyle (four columns) prostyle (protruding forward) portico. It is in Neo-Palladian style. The portico is set on three steps. It has four Doric columns along the front, and another similar column on each side, making it two bays deep. The architrave is plain, the frieze above it is decorated with four rosettes, and the cornice has dentils, as does the pediment. In the centre of the west end of the church is a doorway with a square-headed window on each side. Above each window and the doorway is a blank square with a recessed panel. The body of the church is four bays deep. On both the north and south sides are four niches, three square-headed windows, a plain architrave, rosettes in the frieze and dentils in the cornice. On the east side are three blank rectangular panels, the central one with a memorial tablet inscribed with the date 1665.
Interior
The doorway leads to a circular entrance lobby with two doors. The door on the right leads to a stairway. The other door leads into the church, which is paved in stone with black diamond-shaped inserts. At the east end of the church is a step, then two curved steps leading up to the altar. Behind the altar is an oak reredos with fluted Corinthian columns having gilded capitals. In the central panel of the reredos is a painting of the Virgin and Child and other figures. The pews have wrought iron candleholders, and at the west end of the church are two box pews with brass gas lamps. The west gallery is supported by fluted pilasters with gilded capitals. The west wall is panelled, and the other walls have ornate plasterwork. In the ceiling is an oval panel containing guilloché and a central rose. On the north, south and west walls are hatchments. In the west gallery is a two-manual organ.

The bronze roof and the bronze lions are imported from Hong Kong. Four bronze plaques imprinted with inscription account of Lim's life in English, Chinese, Tamil and Jawi, were installed around the memorial. The memorial occupied the site which was donated by the government measuring by .
Unveiling of the Memorial
On 29 June 1954, the completed Memorial was unveiled by Sir Charles Loewen, the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Land Forces in front of a crowd of people with Lim's widow, her children and some members of the Force 136 in present at the 10th death anniversary ceremony of Major-General Lim Bo Seng.

Philip McNeely is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the riding of Ottawa—Orléans for the Ontario Liberal Party.
Background
McNeely was born in Cumberland, Ontario and is bilingual. He was educated at Lisgar Collegiate and McGill University, earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the latter. He later earned the equivalent of a Master's Degree in engineering from the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London. Before entering politics, he was the CEO of McNeely Engineering, a firm which operated in the Ottawa region. He sold this firm in 1997, claiming it had suffered under provincial cutbacks to infrastructure spending.
Municipal politics
In 2000, McNeely was elected as a municipal councillor for the Cumberland Ward of the amalgamated City of Ottawa, defeating incumbent Robert van den Ham. In 2002, he played a key role in the successful Hay West project, in which hay from eastern Canada was shipped to the drought-stricken west. He was also active in opposing the creation of a hog farm in the village of Sarsfield part of the Cumberland Ward of Ottawa.
Provincial politics
In the provincial election of 2003, he defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Brian Coburn in Ottawa—Orleans by about 4500 votes. He was named a government whip on October 23, 2003.
In July 2006, McNeely described Israel as a "rogue state", arguing that Israel's military campaign in Lebanon was resulting in collective punishment for the Lebanese people. Dalton McGuinty expressed "serious dismay and disappointment" for these remarks, and McNeely later offered an apology for the language of his comments.
He was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 2007, beating Conservative candidate Graham Fox by almost 9,000 votes. In the 2011 election he was re-elected with a margin of 2,854 votes.
In 2005, McNeely proposed an amendment to a no smoking bill that would ban power wall cigarette advertising from convenience stores and retail businesses. The "McNeely Amendment", which came into effect on May 31, 2008, has helped keep cigarettes out of the sight of children.
During his time in office, McNeely has served as Parliamentary Assistant to a number of ministers including Minister of Transportation, Minister of Health and Long Term Care and most recently as PA to the Minister of the Environment.
In 2014, McNeely announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2014 contest.

Derivation
Hogge is a Scottish surname originally derived from hoga, an Old English term meaning prudent or careful.
During the 19th century many immigrants from Scotland settled along the east coast of what would become the United States and Canada. Many Hogge settlers came during this time but there were others who came much earlier during the 17th century. The majority of Hogge's were farmers. Settlers who remained faithful to the crown and called themselves United Empire Loyalists while others participated in the American War of Independence. That spirit lives on today and is evident in the highland games that dot North America.
Passenger and immigration lists indicate that members of the Hogge family came to North America quite early: Daniel Hogg settled in Boston in 1651; along with John and Neile, Bernard, Charles, James, John, Peter, Richard and William Hogue all arrived in Philadelphia between 1840 and 1860.
In the early 20th century the Hogge family located in New Kent, Virginia married into and became a part of the Chickahominy Indians Eastern Division and currently holds 2 seats on the Tribal Council.
Variations
With spelling practices being non-standardized in the Middle Ages, scribes could only rely on the sounds of words for spelling. Spelling variations in names, even within a single document, were a common result. Over the years Hogge has appeared Hogge, Hoge, Hoag, Hogue, Hodge, Hogg, Hoig, and others.

HSFCruise Bonaria is a Ro-Pax high speed ferry, built in 2000 at the Sestri Ponente shipyards by Fincantieri and owned by Grimaldi Lines previously owned by Minoan Lines. It can accommodate up to 2,500 passengers and 700 cars, and has 758 beds plus 742 airseats for passengers. The vessel is powered by four 4x Wärtsilä 16V46C diesel engines with a combined power of 67,517 kW, which give her a top 'speed of 31,6 knots. In November 2020 Minoan Lines announced that Knossos Palace exchanged with her former ship Cruise Bonaria previously named Olympia Palace. The first sold to Grimaldi Lines and renamed it Cruise Bonaria and the other one renamed Knossos Palace. The former Knossos Palace was under the Minoan Lines 20 years. For 20 years did the Piraeus-Heraklion route. The ship left Greece forever on 24 November and arrived in Napoli, Italy after two days. In there will change signals and name.
Route
Knossos Palace served the overnight route Piraeus - Heraklio and Heraklio - Piraeus, except for some rare occasions in which it replaces other ships of Minoan Lines in their routes. During the holiday season, it occasionally operated during daytime, completing her voyage in 8 hours.
Accidents and incidents
On November 19, 2003 Knossos Palace was sailing 40 nm northwest of Heraklion en route from Piraeus when a fire broke out on board. The fire was caused by a truck in the vessel's garage that was carrying chemicals. The crew swiftly dealt with the emergency and the fire was put out using the sprinkler system before causing major damage. However, the fire damaged the cables powering the passenger drawbridge, which became inoperable. As a result, an airport staircase had to be brought to the port in order to allow safe disembarkation.

Invaders from Mars is a 1986 American science fiction horror film, directed by Tobe Hooper from a screenplay by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. It is a remake of the 1953 film of the same name, and is a reworking of that film's screenplay by Richard Blake from an original story by John Tucker Battle. Its production was instigated by Wade Williams, millionaire exhibitor, science fiction film fan and sometime writer-producer-director, who had reissued the original film in 1978 after purchasing the copyright to the property. Elaborate creature and visual effects were supplied by Stan Winston and John Dykstra.
Plot
George Gardner (Timothy Bottoms) encourages his 12-year-old son David's (Hunter Carson) dreams of becoming an astronaut by stargazing with him. A thunderstorm wakes David, and he observes a strange alien spaceship landing on Copper Hill, just beyond the house. His father agrees to investigate, but returns behaving strangely and with an unexplained mark on the back of his neck. David's mother Helen (Laraine Newman) and others as well soon become similarly changed from their normal selves, worrying David.
At school, David discovers that his teacher Mrs. McKeltch (Louise Fletcher) and classmate Heather (Virginia Keehne) have also been changed. David shares his fears with Nurse Linda Magnusson (Karen Black) after seeing she has no neck mark. Linda is skeptical but begins to share David's concern after seeing the change in Mrs. McKeltch and his parents. After evading capture by Mrs. McKeltch, David follows her to a cave in Copper Hill and discovers that the alien ship is real, crewed by brutish drones and their large-brained leader who is controlling many people around the town via brain implants inserted through the neck. David flees and reveals what he has learned to Linda. The two of them investigate further and decide to seek outside help.
David and Linda meet with General Wilson (James Karen), commander of the military base that employs David's father. The general begins to believe them when two alien abductees at the site are exposed, confronted, and die from the killswitches in their implants activating. Wilson meets with NASA and SETI scientists who insist on proceeding with a scheduled launch to Mars, but the rocket is destroyed by a bomb planted by George. The scientists conclude that the Martians interpreted the launch as an act of war and are invading Earth preemptively.
Wilson leads his troops against the alien encampment at Copper Hill. While they prepare for a raid, David and Linda are captured by the Martians, prompting Wilson to launch a rescue mission. After unsuccessfully pleading with the Martian leader, David escapes while an unconscious Linda is prepped for implantation. David leads Wilson's force to the control room where a short but intense battle occurs. Linda is rescued and the invaders are forced to initiate a retreat. The human survivors plant charges and flee the ship as its liftoff sequence begins. David runs for the safety of his home, pursued by his parents, still under alien control. As the rising alien ship explodes, David's parents recover and try to protect him as the massive fireball races toward them.
Suddenly, David awakens in his bedroom. His parents assure him that his ordeal was just a dream and leave him to continue sleeping. However, David soon sees the same alien ship appear. He runs to his parents' room and screams in horror at what he sees.
Cast
Vietnam War veteran Dale Dye has a small role as the Squad Leader, future stunt coordinator Scott Leva plays a Marine Officer, and Joseph Anthony Cox appears in costume as a Drone.
Associations with other films
Jimmy Hunt, who plays the Police Chief in the 1986 version, played David MacLean in the 1953 film (renamed David Gardner in this version). David is seen watching this film's director Tobe Hooper's previous film, 1985's Lifeforce, on television when his mother surprises him.
When the indoctrinated police officers are searching for David and Nurse Magnuson in the school's basement, they briefly shine a flashlight on some stored theatrical props, one of which is the Supreme Intelligence alien inside its clear orb as depicted in the original 1953 version. It is not known if this is the original prop or a replica made for the 1986 film. The Gardner's mailbox shows the name of the town as Santa Mira, an homage to the town where another sci-fi film, 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, was set.
Filming locations
The scenes shot on location at David's school were filmed at Eagle Rock Elementary School in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The school bore a temporary fake nameplate in the film that read "Menzies Elementary School" as a tribute to the 1953 film's director, William Cameron Menzies. The Gardners' home in the film is the same house that was purpose-built for the 1948 Cary Grant/Myrna Loy film, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, and still stands as the administrative offices for park employees at Malibu Creek State Park. Other locations include Simi Valley, California.
Release
Box office
Invaders from Mars was released on June 6, 1986, opening in seventh place. In total, it earned $4,884,663 at the US box office, a loss from its $7,000,000 budget.
Reception
Nina Darnton wrote in The New York Times that Hooper "knows how to construct a horror film so it builds to a screaming pitch" and also praised the "excellent cast," but thought that when the Martians are finally revealed, "the film becomes less terrifying. We get lost in the complexities of the inventions and finally they seem overdone and overproduced." Variety panned the film as "an embarrassing combination of kitsch and boredom," adding that a remake of the 1953 original was a reasonable idea but "Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby's inferior screenplay fails to bring in new ideas or provide interesting dialog. The story elements here have been done to death in the interim." Sid Smith of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, "Much of what is lovable about Hooper's fun, scary and refreshingly silly movie is all its in-jokes." Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times stated, "If you can tap into Hooper's oddball rhythms and cold sendups, you can enjoy yourself. And, though the 1953 'Invaders' was an effective movie, it's not really the classic that people remember. Except for Menzies' superb production designs, everything in the remake is better: the acting, the camerawork, definitely the Martians. It may not grip audiences in the same way, but that's because Hooper is trying something harder, a conscious campiness that's tough to bring off." Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post wrote that "despite its occasional sparkle, 'Invaders From Mars' is an overlong movie with a tiny spirit. It plays to a certain smug superiority of an audience nurtured on junky television, and while that smugness is in some ways justified—movies like the original 'Invaders From Mars' had their obvious failings—it's also, over the course of a feature film, more than a little annoying." Time Out wrote, "... whereas the original worked by building up an increasingly black mood, this version relies almost entirely on the special effects; and such limited brooding tension as it has is gratuitously undermined by a string of sequences played purely for laughs". Thomas Kent Miller in his book Mars in the Movies called it "unredeemingly awful [if seen for the first time by a 21st century adult]. Otherwise, some children who saw it for the first time, with little or no knowledge of the 1953 version, derive much pleasure from the film."
As of April 2021 the film holds a 38% approval rating at film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.
It was nominated for two awards at the 7th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Supporting Actress for Louise Fletcher and Worst Visual Effects.
Novelization
A novelization of Invaders from Mars, by horror novelist Ray Garton, was published by Pocket Books in the United States and Grafton Books in the United Kingdom.

The Teacher Salary Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness surrounding the working conditions and salaries of public school teachers throughout America. The mission of The Teacher Salary Project is to address the concerns and issues facing our education system through the eyes and experiences of teachers. It proposes that teacher salary reform is an effective method of attracting and retaining top-quality teachers to the field of education. The project began with the New York Times best-selling book Teachers Have It Easy: The Big Sacrifices and Small Salaries of America's Teachers, co-authored by teacher and journalist Daniel Moulthrop, co-founder of 826 National Nínive Calegari, and writer Dave Eggers. In 2011, The Teacher Salary Project released the feature-length documentary film American Teacher. The film was officially released at select theaters in several major U.S. cities in the Fall of 2011. In fall of 2013, The Teacher Salary Project launched a Governors' Challenge to take stock of and showcase what each of the fifty state governors are doing to recruit and retain the best teaching force that can most effectively serve their states' students.
Teachers Have It Easy
Teachers Have It Easy: The Big Sacrifices and Small Salaries of America's Teachers was released in June 2005 and is co-authored by Nínive Calegari, Dave Eggers, and Daniel Moulthrop. The book utilizes a large catalog of teacher testimonies in portraying the working conditions of public school teachers throughout various urban and rural areas across America. The subject of teacher salary reform is addressed in light of the teacher accounts therein that portray a job that, however rewarding, is demanding and trying upon one's time and finances. The book follows the wide range of teacher testimonies with a chapter that contrasts a typical day of a teacher alongside that of a pharmaceutical salesman. The book also investigates several districts and schools that have made successful reforms on the teacher salary level.
Examples of successful reform are highlighted in Denver's ProComp system, which was initiated in 2006 and rewarded teachers performance bonuses for education, student achievement, and for teaching in hard-to-staff and/or hard-to-serve positions; The Vaughn Next Center Learning in Los Angeles, California for their innovative methods in evaluating teachers and rewarding them for effective performance; and, lastly, the public school district in Helena, Montana in how they were able to free up $1 million to be used in attracting and rewarding top-quality teachers.
The book has appeared on the New York Times extended best-seller list and has been featured on CSPAN, and NPR's Marketplace.
American Teacher
American Teacher is a feature-length documentary created and produced by The Teacher Salary Project. Following the format of the book Teachers Have It Easy: The Big Sacrifices and Small Salaries of America's Teachers, the film utilizes a large collection of teacher testimonies and contrasts the demands of the teaching profession alongside interviews with education experts and education reform news from around the country.
The Governors' Challenge
The Governors' Challenge began with the November mailing of American Teacher, along with a brochure about teachers, teachers' finances, and action steps for governors to take with their staff, to every U.S. governor, governors' spouse, and Chief State School Officer. Based on the premise that, as leaders of their states, governors have tremendous influence and ability to generate political will to prioritize important policies like teacher pay, the Governors' Challenge aims to showcase what each governor is doing (or not) to support improved teacher salaries with the goal of attracting and retaining great teachers for every student. The Teacher Salary Project developed an online interactive map to publish the latest and most innovative efforts to improve teacher pay throughout all fifty states in one comprehensive site, where governors will be applauded for their efforts to help elevate the prestige of teaching in their state and to attract talented individuals to the teaching profession. The site is intended to enable governors across the country to learn from one another and adopt similar strategies for elevating the teaching profession in their own states to be a financially attractive, prestigious, and sustainable profession.

The Bangkok Biennial is a biennial exhibition of contemporary art which was inaugurated in 2018. The first edition ran from July 1 until September 30. It was the first biennial/biennale event to take place in Thailand. Organised in a decentralised and open-access manner, the 2018 Bangkok Biennial did not have a central curatorial team and was made up of autonomous, self-organised pavilions. Most of the pavilions were located in the city of Bangkok, additional pavilion were located in other parts of Thailand and in the Netherlands and Japan online.
Preceding the Thailand Biennale and the Bangkok Art Biennale, the Bangkok Biennial is one of three very different biennial art events all inaugurated in Thailand in the second half of 2018
The founders of the Bangkok Biennial have remained anonymous to date. They have claimed this is in an effort to work against traditional 'top-down' approaches
Artist in 2018 edition
An unknown number of artists were included in the first edition of the Bangkok Biennial. Originally billed as "150+" artists, the event's website, published materials and mobile application listed 249 artists when the event opened in July 2018. The actual number is likely higher.

Étienne-Hyacinthe de Ratte (1722, Montpellier – 15 August 1805) was an 18th-century French astronomer and mathematician.
De Ratte made some verses in his youth, but he soon turned away from his natural tastes to engage with ardor in the study of mathematics. At twenty-one, he was secretary of the .
De Ratte also wrote a number of contributions to the Encyclopédie on physical issues such as froid, glace, gelée, etc.
Although Ratte pursued diverse scientific interests, he devoted himself mainly to astronomy. In this discipline, he made a large number of observations, such as the Venus transit on 6 June 1761. The minor planet 159409 Ratte, discovered at Pises Observatory in 1999, was named in his memory.

In molecular biology, the YjeF N terminal is a protein domain found in the N-terminal of the protein, EDC3. The YjeF N-terminal domains occur either as single proteins or fusions with other domains and are commonly associated with enzymes. They help assemble the processing body (P-body) in preparation for mRNAdecay. Structural homology indicated it may have some similarity to the enzyme family, hydrolase.
Function
At the cellular level, the YjeF-N terminal domain is vital to the assembly of the processing body (P-body). This aids mRNA decay and is thought to bring together different complexes to aggregate mRNPs. At the organism level, in bacteria and archaea, YjeF N-terminal domains are often fused to a YjeF C-terminal domain with high structural homology to the members of a ribokinase-like superfamily or belong to operons that encode enzymes of diverse functions. Examples of such include:
pyridoxal phosphate biosynthetic protein PdxJ;
phosphopanteine-protein transferase;
ATP/GTP hydrolase;
and pyruvate-formate lyase 1-activating enzyme.
In plants, the YjeF N-terminal domain is fused to a C-terminal putative pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase. In eukaryotes, proteins that consist of (Sm)-FDF-YjeF N-terminal domains may be involved in RNA processing.
Structure
The YjeF N-terminal domains represent a novel version of the Rossmann fold, one of the most common protein folds in nature. The YjeF N-terminal domain is a three-layer alpha-beta-alpha sandwich with a central beta-sheet surrounded by alpha helices. The conservation of the acidic residues in the predicted active site of the YjeF N-terminal domains shows some similarities to the amino acids found in the active sites of diverse hydrolases.

Steinsberg Castle is a ruined castle in the former municipality of Ardez (now Scuol) of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
During the High Middle Ages a fortified church with a ring wall and perhaps a tower was built near the current castle. By the end of the 12th century, these fortifications were demolished and a new castle was built above formerly fortified plateau and the Church of St. Lazius. It was probably built for a local noble family. In 1209 Albert von Frickingen sold all his estates and villages as well as the castle above Ardez to the Bishop of Chur. Count Albert von Tirol also had a claim on the lands, but in 1228 relinquished his claim to the Bishop of Chur. The castle became the center of the ecclesiastical estates in the area. In 1348 the Bishop pledged the castle and lands to the Planta family for a loan of 150 Marks. In 1359, the Bishop again pledged the castle to the Lords of Katzenstein for 700 Gulden. In 1411 it was pledged to Georg Scheck. Despite attempts from the Bishop to regain ownership of the castle, the Scheck family retained it until 1502.
In 1499, during the Swabian War, the castle was captured by imperial troops on 25 March. They burned the castle and the current owner Balthasar Scheck was taken to Merano and executed. In 1502 the heavily damaged castle was pledged to Hans von Planta. He and his son spent the remainder of the 16th century trying to get the Bishop of Chur to pay interest owed on the loan. At some point during that century, they abandoned the ruined castle. As the Three Leagues grew in power, they repeatedly denied the Bishop the right to appoint a vogt over Steinsberg. The nearby church was abandoned during the Protestant Reformation. In 1861 Emanuel von Planta-Wildenberg purchased the ruins and surrounding lands from the Bishop for 1000 Gulden. The ruins were repaired in 1964 and 1985.
Castle site
The castle is located on a hill outside the village of Ardez. The top of the hill has about of space for buildings with steep sides all around. The castle occupies the highest point on the hill. Its four-story keep was about in size. The style of the stone work changes above the second story, indicating that it was either added later or repaired. The high entrance was to the south on the second floor. The upper stories have window seats from the 14th century and were either added then, or they were part of the new construction or repair. A residential wing was built east of the tower, against the ring wall. The castle was probably encircled by the ring wall, though only traces remain.
The ruins of the Romanesque church of St. Luzius are north of the castle. Unusually, the nave of this church runs north and south.

Ambrosia psilostachya is a species of ragweed known by the common names Cuman ragweed and perennial ragweed, and western ragweed.
Distribution and habitat
The plant is widespread across much of North America (United States, Canada, and northern Mexico). It is also naturalized in parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America. It is a common plant in many habitat types, including disturbed areas such as roadsides.
Description
Ambrosia psilostachya is an erect perennial herb growing a slender, branching, straw-colored stem to a maximum height near two meters, but more often remaining under one meter tall. Leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and vary in shape from lance-shaped to nearly oval, and they are divided into many narrow, pointed lobes. The stem and leaves are hairy.
The top of the stem is occupied by an inflorescence which is usually a spike. The species is monoecious, and the inflorescence is composed of staminate (male) flower heads with the pistillate heads located below and in the axils of leaves. This bloom period is from June through November.
The pistillate heads yield fruits which are achenes located within oval-shaped greenish-brown burs about half a centimeter long. The burs are hairy and sometimes spiny. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting up from a creeping rhizome-like root system.
Ecology
Ambrosia psilostachya is a host plant for the caterpillars of Bucculatrix transversata, Cosmopterix opulenta, Exaeretia gracilis, Gnorimoschema saphirinella, Schinia sexplagiata; the beetles Zygogramma disrupta, Zygogramma suturalis; and the grasshopper Spharagemon collare.
Medicinal uses
This plant had a number of medicinal uses among several different Native American tribes, including the Cheyenne, Kumeyaay (Diegueno), and Kiowa people.
Chemistry
Ambrosia psilostachya contains a group of phytochemicals called psilostachyins.

The 2011 Brunei Premier League, also known as 2010/11 DST Group Brunei Premier League I was the seventh season of the Brunei Premier League. It was the second season that it was administered by the Football Federation of Brunei Darussalam (FFBD), the football association that replaced Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) after the latter's de-registration by Brunei's Registrar of Societies.
The season was abruptly ended in June 2011 due to the establishment of the National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (NFABD) which is the sole association recognised by FIFA to oversee Brunei football after lifting the ban, thus invalidating the current league.

Kenneth Charles Bolton (August 18, 1906– May 1, 1996) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1969 to 1971 representing the riding of Middlesex South. Other than his two years as MPP, he was an Anglican priest and archdeacon serving in Ontario and British Columbia.
Background
Born in Birmingham, England, Bolton immigrated to Canada and settled in Winnipeg in 1925. He studied arts and theology at St. John's College, where he studied for the ministry and was ordained an Anglican priest in 1932. He served as a minister throughout Canada and was later chaplain of Huron University College and associate professor of pastoral theology at the University of Western Ontario as well as Archdeacon of Bishop Cronyn Memorial Anglican Church in London, Ontario. He married Lucy Mary Margaret Cheyne December 1936. Together they raise 5 children, Robin, Margaret, David, Ken and Patricia.
Bolton was active in social justice causes with groups such as Oxfam and Amnesty International.
Politics
He was elected to the legislature in a 1969 by-election. The victory was a surprise coming in an area where the NDP did not traditionally win seats. His campaign was a struggle which was complicated because of traffic accident three months before the by-election in which he broke several bones. His victory was credited to campaigning on the issue of Medicare at a time when the Progressive Conservative government of John Robarts was reluctant to join the plan. His victory is credited with helping to pressure the government to agree to bring the province into the plan.
As an MPP he was correctional services critic. He was defeated in the 1971 general election by Robert G. Eaton after serving in office for two years.
His son, Kenneth, ran for the NDP in the 2008 federal election in the riding of Yukon. He finished fourth.
Later life
In 1971, he became a missionary in the Windward Islands in the West Indies. He also served for a short time in 1975 as acting secretary of the Primate's World Relief and Development Fund.
Later, he assisted at St. Martin-in-the-Fields Anglican Church in London, Ontario before moving to British Columbia in 1995 to be closer to his children. He died of heart failure during a flight from London, England to Vancouver, BC.

Wittingen () is a town in the district of Gifhorn, Lower Saxony, Germany. It is about northeast of Gifhorn, and southeast of Uelzen.
Division of the town
Wittingen consists of 27 districts:
History
The earliest identified record of Wittingen appears in a document dated 781 which defines the territorial borders of the Bishopric of Hildesheim. Another early mention dates from 803 during the reign of Charlemagne, this time identifying the borders of the newly established Bishopric of Halberstadt. Neither of these sources pins down a date for the foundation of Wittingen, however.
During the Medieval period Wittingen was not merely a frontier point, but also a focus for traffic crossing into and out of the Altmark. The town was a trading point and an overnight stop for east-west commerce. Its significance was signaled in the ninth century when The Bishopric had the Church of St Stephen built. By the beginning of the thirteenth century Wittingen had been granted Town privileges, and was a part owner of the Lüneburg Mint. The fourteenth century was a period of political instability in this part of Europe and in 1340 ownership of Wittingen was transferred to the Welfs of Celle. Later, with the outbreak of the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud, the town was almost completely destroyed in 1519. Consequently, the building of town fortifications began shortly afterwards.
Demographic data
According to the Lower Saxony State Department for Statistics 12,291 people lived in the town of Wittingen in 2005 in 3,745 buildings with a total of 5,399 homes at an average floor space of per person. Since the formation of the borough, the population grew steadily, both by natural population increase and immigration. 21.3% of the population in 2005 were under 18 years old, 7.1% from 18 to 25, 27.0% from 25 to 45, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 20.3% were 65 years old or older. The unemployment rate stood at an average of 11.3% (men: 9.4%, women: 14.0%). 2,247 people commute regularly out of the town and 1745 into it daily.

Third-placed qualifiers
At the end of the first stage, a comparison was made between the third placed teams from the seven groups of six teams. The one best third-placed teams advanced to the 2010 AFC U-16 Championship.
Because three groups has one team fewer than the others, following the withdrawal of Sri Lanka, Mongolia and Maldives, matches against the sixth-placed team in each group are not included in this ranking. As a result, four matches played by each team will count for the purposes of the third-placed table.

The 1978 smallpox outbreak in the United Kingdom resulted in the death of Janet Parker, a British medical photographer, who became the last recorded person to die from smallpox. Her illness and death, which was connected to the deaths of two other people, led to the Shooter Inquiry, an official investigation by government-appointed experts triggering radical changes in how dangerous pathogens were studied in the UK.
The Shooter Inquiry found that Parker was accidentally exposed to a strain of smallpox virus that had been grown in a research laboratory on the floor below her workplace at the University of Birmingham Medical School. Shooter concluded that the mode of transmission was most likely airborne through a poorly maintained service duct between the two floors. However, this assertion has been subsequently challenged, including when the University of Birmingham was acquitted following a prosecution for breach of Health and Safety legislation connected with Parker's death. Several internationally recognised experts produced evidence during the prosecution to show that it was unlikely that Parker was infected by airborne transmission in this way. Although there is general agreement that the source of Parker's infection was the smallpox virus grown at the Medical School laboratory, how Parker contracted the disease remains unknown.
Background
Smallpox research at the Birmingham Medical School
Smallpox is an infectious disease unique to humans, caused by either of two virus variants named Variola major and Variola minor. The World Health Organization (WHO) had established a smallpox eradication programme and, by 1978, was close to declaring that the disease had been eradicated globally. The last naturally occurring infection was of Variola minor in Somalia in 1977.
At the time of the 1978 outbreak, a laboratory at University of Birmingham Medical School had been conducting research on variants of smallpox virus known as "whitepox viruses", which were considered to be a threat to the success of the WHO's eradication programme. The laboratory was part of the Microbiology Department, the head of which was virologist Henry Bedson, son of Sir Samuel Phillips Bedson.
A smallpox outbreak in the area had occurred in 1966, when Tony McLennan, a medical photographer working at the medical school, contracted the disease. He had a mild form of the disease, which was not diagnosed for eight weeks. He was not quarantined and there were at least twelve further cases in the West Midlands, five of whom were quarantined in Witton Isolation Hospital in Birmingham. There are no records of any formal enquiries on the source of this outbreak despite concerns expressed by the then head of the laboratory, Peter Wildy.
In 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) had told Henry Bedson that his application for his laboratory to become a Smallpox Collaborating Centre had been rejected. This was partly because of safety concerns; the WHO wanted as few laboratories as possible handling the virus.
Janet Parker
Parker was born in March 1938, and was the only daughter of Frederick and Hilda Witcomb (née Linscott). She was married to Joseph Parker, a Post Office engineer, and lived in Burford Park Road, Kings Norton, Birmingham, UK. After several years as a police photographer she joined the University of Birmingham Medical School, where she was employed as a medical photographer in the Anatomy Department. Parker often worked in a darkroom above the laboratory where research on smallpox viruses was being conducted.
The infection and related events
Parker's illness and death
On 11 August 1978, Parker (who had been vaccinated against smallpox in 1966, but not since) fell ill; she had a headache and pains in her muscles. She developed spots that were thought to be a benign rash, or chickenpox. On 20 August at 3pm, she was admitted to East Birmingham (now Heartlands) Hospital and a clinical diagnosis of Variola major, the most serious type of smallpox, was made by consultant Alasdair Geddes.
By this time the rash had spread and covered all Parker's body, including the palms of her hands and soles of her feet, and it was confluent on her face. At 10pm she was on her way to Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital near Solihull. By 11pm all her close contacts, including her parents, were placed in quarantine. Her parents were later also transferred to Catherine-de-Barnes. The next day, poxvirus infection was confirmed by Henry Bedson, then Head of the Smallpox laboratory at the Medical School, by electron microscopy of vesicle fluid, which Geddes had sampled from Parker's rash. (Samples of the fluid were also collected by a biomedical scientist for examination at the Regional Virus Laboratory, which was in East Birmingham Hospital). Parker died of smallpox at Catherine-de-Barnes on 11 September 1978. She was the last recorded person to die from smallpox.
Special disease control measures had to be put into place for Parker's funeral. Ron Fleet from Sheldon, who at the time of Parker's death worked for Solihull funeral director Bastocks and later for the BBC at Pebble Mill, recalled that he was told that authorities would not allow the body to be stored in a fridge in case the virus managed to multiply:
Concerns over the survival of infectious virus in Parker's body were well-founded, and at the inquest the coroner, who signed Parker's cremation certificate, disallowed an autopsy for safety reasons.
Quarantine and containment
Many people had close contact with Parker before she was admitted to hospital. The outbreak prevention response included 260 people being immediately quarantined, several of them at Catherine-de-Barnes Hospital, including the ambulance driver who transported Parker. Over 500 people who had been (or had possibly been) in contact with Parker were given vaccinations against smallpox. On 26 August, health officials went to Parker's house in Burford Park Road, Kings Norton, and fumigated her home and car. On 28 August, five hundred people were placed in quarantine in their homes for two weeks.
Parker's mother contracted smallpox on 7 September, despite having been vaccinated against the disease on 24 August. Her case was described as "very minor" and she was subsequently declared free from infection and was discharged from hospital on 22 September. Other than Parker's mother, no further cases occurred. The other close contacts, which included two biomedical scientists from the Regional Virus Laboratory, were released from quarantine in Catherine-de-Barnes on 10 October 1978.
Birmingham was declared officially free of smallpox on 16 October 1978. Over a year later, in October 1979, the university authorities fumigated the Medical School East Wing. The ward at Catherine-de-Barnes Hospital in which Parker had died was still sealed off five years after her death, all the furniture and equipment inside left untouched.
Related deaths
On 5 September 1978, Parker's 71-year-old father, Frederick Witcomb, of Myrtle Avenue, Kings Heath, died while in quarantine at Catherine-de-Barnes Hospital. He appeared to have died following a cardiac arrest when visiting his daughter. No post-mortem was carried out on his body because of the risk of smallpox infection.
On 6 September 1978, Henry Bedson, head of the Birmingham Medical School microbiology department, committed suicide while in quarantine at his home in Cockthorpe Close, Harborne. He cut his throat in the garden shed and died at Birmingham Accident Hospital a few days later. His suicide note read: In Bedson's Munk's Roll biography published by the Royal College of Physicians, virologist Peter Wildy and Sir Gordon Wolstenholme wrote:
Subsequent investigations and reactions
The Shooter inquiry
An official government inquiry into Parker's death was conducted by a panel led by microbiologist R.A. Shooter, and comprising Dr Christopher Booth, Prof. Sir David Evans, J.R. McDonald, Dr David Tyrrell and Prof. Sir Robert Williams, with observers from the World Health Organization (WHO), The Health and Safety Executive and the Trades Union Congress.
The inquiry's report noted that Bedson had failed to inform the authorities of changes in his research that could have affected safety. Shooter's enquiry discovered that the Dangerous Pathogens Advisory Group had inspected the laboratory on two occasions and each time recommended that the smallpox research be continued there, even though the facilities at the laboratory fell far short of those required by law. Several of the staff at the laboratory had received no special training. Inspectors from the WHO had told Bedson that the physical facilities at the laboratory did not meet WHO standards, but had nonetheless only recommended a few changes in laboratory procedures. Bedson misled the WHO about the volume of work handled by the laboratory, telling them that it had progressively declined since 1973, when in fact it had risen substantially as Bedson tried to finish his work before the laboratory closed. Shooter also found that while Parker had been vaccinated, it had not been done recently enough to protect her against smallpox. A foreword by the Secretary of State for Social Services, Patrick Jenkin, noted that the University of Birmingham disputed the report's findings.
The report concluded that Parker had been infected by a strain of smallpox virus called Abid (named after the three-year-old Pakistani boy from whom it had originally been isolated), which was being handled in the smallpox laboratory during 24–25 July 1978. It found that there was "no doubt" that Parker had been infected at her workplace, and identified three possible ways in which this could have occurred: air current transmission; personal contact; or contact with contaminated apparatus. The report favoured air current transmission and concluded that the virus could have travelled in air currents up a service duct from the laboratory below to a room in the Anatomy Department that was used for telephone calls. On 25 July, Parker had spent much more time there than usual ordering photographic materials because the financial year was about to end.
Since Shooter's Report potentially played an important role in the court case against the university for breach of safety legislation, its official publication was postponed until the outcome of the trial was known, and it was not published until 1980.
Once it was published it had a significant impact. Shooter's report was debated by Parliament. Nicolas Hawkes wrote, in 1979, that:
Prosecution
On 1 December 1978 the Health and Safety Executive announced their intention to prosecute the university for breach of safety legislation. The case was heard in October 1979 at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.
Although the source of infection was traced, the mode and cause of transmission was not. Evidence presented by several internationally recognised experts, including Kevin McCarthy, Allan Watt Downie and Keith R. Dumbell, showed that airborne transmission from the laboratory to the telephone room where Parker was supposedly infected was highly improbable. The experts calculated that it would require of virus fluid to have been aspirated (meaning, in this context, removed by suction of fluid and cells through a needle) and it would take 20,000 years for one particle to travel to the telephone room at the rate the fluid was aspirated. It was additionally found that although the Shooter Inquiry noted the poor state of the duct sealing in the laboratory, this was caused after the outbreak by engineers fumigating the laboratory and ducts. The university was found not guilty of causing Parker's death.
Other litigation
In August 1981, following a formal claim for damages made by the trade union Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs in 1979, Parker's husband, Joseph, was awarded £25,000 in compensation.
Conclusions and impact
Although it seems clear that the source of Parker's infection was the smallpox virus grown at the University of Birmingham Medical School laboratory, it remains unknown how Parker came to be infected. Shooter's criticisms of the laboratory's procedures triggered radical changes in how dangerous pathogens were studied in the UK, but the inquiry's conclusions on the transmission of the virus have not been generally accepted. Professor Mark Pallen, who wrote a book about the case, says that the air duct theory "was not really believed by anyone in the know". Brian Escott-Cox QC, who successfully defended the university in the subsequent prosecution, said in 2018:
In light of this incident, all known stocks of smallpox were destroyed or transferred to one of two WHO reference laboratories which had BSL-4 facilities: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Russia.
At the time of the outbreak, the WHO had been about to certify that smallpox had been eradicated globally. It eventually did so in 1980.

The Boeing-Canada A-213 Totem was a Canadian single-engine pusher monoplane flying boat intended for forestry and fisheries patrols as well as light utility transport for the British Columbia coastline, where there are few flat places for runways, and waterways are plentiful. The sole example, CF-ARF, CB10 was designed and built by Boeing Aircraft of Canada. The name refers to the Totem poles used by the First Nations in British Columbia.
Design
The Chief Engineer, Edward Fothergill Elderton was British, and had previously worked at Short Brothers and Saunders-Roe before coming to Canada to work for Canadian Vickers and Boeing of Canada.
Despite being developed while the Boeing 40H-4 and C-204 were under construction, the Totem's design owed little to Boeing aside from the Boeing 103 airfoil section and the rudder shape. Indeed, previous Boeing flying boats used wood extensively in the hull, and the 40H-4 used welded steel tubes for its fuselage structure. Instead, its tumblehome and heavy external ribs on the hull showed a strong Saunders-Roe influence, which is unsurprising given the Chief Engineer's background. The model number A-213 fits numerically in the Boeing sequence but the significance of the 'A' prefix remains unexplained. It may be a coincidence that Saunders-Roe was using an A as a prefix for all their aircraft at that time.
The bottom of the hull was built up as a three-ply Alclad sandwich, riveted to frames with external longitudinal stringers. The sides and top of the hull used sheet metal with widely spaced corrugations or ribs. There were five bulkheads separating six watertight compartments, and it made extensive use of stainless steel components to limit corrosion. The roomy 4 seat cabins was positioned ahead of the front wing spar and was accessed through a folding roof hatch. Dual controls were offered, while the stick could be removed on the passenger side.
The main fuel tank was behind the cabin and between the wing spars, with a smaller fuel tank in the engine nacelle that was fed by a fuel pump. The Wasp Jr. radial engine was mounted as a pusher, which made passenger egress safer, and reduced cabin noise. Starting was accomplished with an inertial hand starter.
The wings were built around two spruce spars, with ribs and leading and trailing edges in spot welded chromium-molybdenum alloy (chrome-moly) steel, all covered in fabric sealed and tightened with aircraft dope. The wings were braced with parallel steel struts to the hull chines, and fitted with metal tip floats.
The high mounted elevators, fin and rudder were like the ribs, made up from spot welded chrome-moly steel, covered in fabric.
All controls were actuated via push-pull rods, with no cables or pulleys to jam.
Unusually for the time, a retractable water rudder was fitted that would pivot back and up if it struck an obstacle.
Operational history
The sole Totem built, serial number CB10 was registered as CF-ARF. The first known flight is believed to have been on 16 June 1932, by William J. Holland. Test flights were being made in July by company pilots, and on September 25, an official test flight was made, with government observers. One of the test flights was to Garibaldi Lake, the first visit by an airplane to that lake, at an altitude of where it experienced no difficulties.
Boeing of Canada had been having difficulty selling its flying boats, and the Totem was no exception, with it remaining in Boeing's hands for almost a year before being sold to a private operator.
In May 1933, the Victoria Daily Times reported that Holland was taking the president of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, (part owner of both Boeing and Boeing of Canada) for a "leisurely" flight up the British Columbia coastline to Juneau, Alaska.
In July 1933, Holland took the Totem to Amethyst Lake in Jasper National Park, to Lake Louise in Banff National Park and to Lake Minnewanka. He gave joyrides to the locals for $5 a flight, while also occasionally doing local charters, including taking the manager of the Banff Springs Hotel to the Columbia Icefield and another longer one for a group of fishermen to Marvel Lake (north of Marvel Peak). The Totem was not the first aircraft to visit Banff though, as they were preceded by a Norman Thompson N.T.2B flying boat operated by the Rocky Mountain Aviation Transport Company between 1921 and 1924. Holland was notified in August that the Totem had been sold and to make haste back to Vancouver to transfer the airplane to the new owner.
The new owner only kept it for a couple of years before selling it to Canadian Airways in May 1935. This was despite demonstrating excellent water and flight handling characteristics during official tests and in operational service. It would remain in service until January 1938, mainly carrying out fisheries patrols, until they sold it to another private operator in 1938. Its registration was cancelled in February 1942, and presumably scrapped.
The Totem served most of its career in British Columbia, however it would remain a one-off as pure-flying boats were by then being supplanted by floatplanes.
Operators
Boeing Aircraft of Canada - operated for one year until sold to private operator in August 1933.
Canadian Airways - operated from May 1935 to January 1938 for fisheries patrols, although charter flights were also made
Private operators - barnstorming and light transport from August 1933 to May 1935 by V. Spencer and January 1938 to late 1941 or early 1942 by W.J. Dyson.

Gove County (county code GO) is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,718. Its county seat is Gove City, and its most populous city is Quinter.
History
Early history
Eighty (80) million years ago, this was all part of an ancient inland sea known as the Western Interior Seaway. Many students still visit the Castle Rock Badlands today to explore fossils and find clues about the origins, and potentially future, of life on Earth.
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1868, Gove County was established and named for Granville Llewellyn Gove, member of the 11th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, and son of Moses Gove, a former mayor of Manhattan, Kansas.
21st century
In 2020, USA Today profiled Gove County during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and called it the "deadliest place in America" due to it having the highest death rate from COVID-19 compared to any other county in the nation: 1 out of every 132 people. The first deaths were reported on October 7; as of November 2020, 20 residents died from the virus, and 314 other positive cases were reported. The article attributed the high death rate to predominant public opposition towards wearing face masks, doubts over the pandemic's severity, and the county's high median age, all of which left residents highly vulnerable.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.01%) is water.

Demographics
As of the 2000 census, there were 3,068 people, 1,245 households, and 861 families residing in the county. The population density was 3 people per square mile (1/km2). There were 1,423 housing units at an average density of 1 per square mile (1/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 97.95% White, 0.10% Black or African American, 0.16% Native American, 0.10% Asian, 0.72% from other races, and 0.98% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.24% of the population.
There were 1,245 households, out of which 28.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.50% were married couples living together, 3.50% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.80% were non-families. 29.70% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.50% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 3.01.

Jimmy Williams (birth unknown – death unknown) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s. He played at club level for Featherstone Rovers (Heritage № 13), as a goal-kicking , i.e. number 6.
Background
Jimmy Williams was born in Featherstone, Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England.
Playing career
Williams made his début for Featherstone Rovers on Saturday 27 August 1921, and he played his last match for Featherstone Rovers during the 1928–29 season, he appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the 1974–75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.
Testimonial match
Williams's benefit season at Featherstone Rovers, shared with Arthur Haigh, took place during the 1928–29 season.

Shoreline Metro (formerly Sheboygan Transit) is the bus system owned and operated by the city of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Shoreline Metro services three communities with fixed route public transit system including the City of Sheboygan, Sheboygan Falls and Kohler. It operates ten fixed routes Monday through Saturday and tripper service during the school year with an additional three morning routes and four afternoon routes for school-aged children.
The system is publicly operated by the City of Sheboygan under the authority of the Sheboygan Transit Commission and managed by the Director of Transit & Parking.
History
Shoreline Metro has been in service since 1972, but traces its formation back to the Sheboygan City Railway Company in 1886. Various private companies have succeeded each other in the area, transitioning from light rail to streetcars to buses. The system changed their name in October 2010 from Sheboygan Transit to "Lakeshore Metro", but changed it further to "Shoreline Metro" February 2011 due to a trademark conflict with an already existing private paratransit company, Lakeshore Transportation.
Bus fleet
Shoreline Metro operates with 15 Gillig Low Floor Buses, seven Chance buses and four Rapid Transit Series buses.
Sheboygan Transit Center
Shoreline Metro has an air conditioned transfer center built in the late 1990s or early 2000s located in the central business district at 828 Pennsylvania Avenue, providing safe shelter for Shoreline Metro passengers. In addition to being a transfer point for all Shoreline Metro fixed routes, the transfer center is the location in the City of Sheboygan where passengers can access various intercity bus services, including Indian Trails, Jefferson Lines, Lamers Connect (on weekends), and the transportation service to and from Lakeshore Technical College's Cleveland Campus (which is operated by GO Riteway). Amenities at the transfer center include a vending machine selling Shoreline Metro fare media, Wi-Fi, a customer service office that is staffed during the daytime on weekdays, and bike racks. Transferring is made easier for passengers, as the individual routes have assigned bus stalls.
Route list
All routes depart from the "Metro Center", more known as the "Transfer Point" located directly south of Sheboygan City Hall off Center Avenue.
Blue indicates route serving north side.
Red indicates route serving south side.
Ridership
Between 2010 and 2018, Shoreline Metro's ridership grew 20.2 percent and passengers per hour increased 23.1 percent.

See Peopling of Southeast Asia for anatomically modern humans.
The region of Southeast Asia is considered a possible place for the evidence of archaic human remains that could be found due to the pathway between Australia and mainland Southeast Asia, where the migration of multiple early humans has occurred out of Africa.
One of many pieces of evidence is of the early human found in central Java of Indonesia in the late 1800s by Eugene Dubois, and later in 1937 at Sangiran site by G.H.R. van Koenigswald. These skull and fossil materials are Homo erectus, named Pithecanthropus erectus by Dubois and Meganthropus palaeojavanicus by van Koenigswald. They were dated to c. 1.88 and 1.66 Ma, as suggested by Swisher et al. by analysis of volcanic rocks.
Three possible migration routes through Southeast Asia
Most scholars who work in Southeast Asia attempt to establish the possible route through which early humans would migrate passing through the region after they migrated out of Africa. The evidence also indicates the migration route and settlement location along the routes that might have taken place during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. There are three possible routes suggested by scholars;
From the northwest of Thailand they went down to Chao Phraya river basin and the Gulf of Thailand in which this route is supported by the faunal remains found in north Asia and Indonesia. Topographically advantages like the mountainous western flank of the Chao Phraya Basin, are likely to benefit the hominin habitats. Those advantages are “environmental mosaics with varied food resources and abundant water supplies, combined with physical features offering protection from the weather and providing tactical advantages in the pursuit of prey”
From Northeastern Vietnam they went down to the Indochinese region. This route is supported by 86 anatomically modern human fossils found in mainland and island East and Southeast Asia. Although this model excluded the recent findings of the H. sapiens tooth found in Thailand and Vietnam and the remains in Laos, this new evidence seems to support this route.
From the coast of South Asia and the west part of mainland Southeast Asia, they went down to the Gulf of Thailand, in which this route is supported by the coastline that many scholars believe that this route is a possible route for the migration from Africa. This route seems to depict the major movement from Africa into this region. However, many possible sites along the coastline are difficult to locate due to the shift of the shoreline, even though the environmental setting is suitable for human habitation.
Theories of archaic human migration to Southeast Asia
There are many different theories of how Southeast Asians of today came to be. However, the two most prominent and widely accepted theories by scientists are the "Out of Africa" Model and the theory that they are direct descendants of the first Homo erectus species.
Regarding the "Out of Africa" theory, archaic humans must have had to migrate through modern day Egypt into the Middle East and from there travel through Central Asia into China to get to Southeast Asia. This migration of archaic humans must have had to take place around 50,000-70,000 years ago. Some evidence of archaic humans settling and migrating throughout Asia from Africa can be proven with the skulls found in the Upper Cave in Zhoukoudian, China. Since the Zhoukoudian skull is a Homo erectus (Homo ergaster), scientists generally agree that it had ultimately originated from Africa, since Homo erectus originated from there.
Furthermore, many scientists believe modern Southeast Asian humans descend from Homo erectus which migrated out of Africa around 1.8 million years ago which is supported by the Dali Man found by Liu Shuntang in 1978 in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, China. Although the dating of the fossil yields unclear answers as to the age of the fossil, scientists estimate it to be around 20,000-260,000 years old from uranium-series dating.
First archaic humans in Australia
It is a well-known fact that there have been aboriginal people residing in the Australian bush for thousands of years. Where they came from and when they came to the island continent, however, is less known. In 1968, Australian geologist Jim Bowler went to the dry lake-bed of Lake Mungo and discovered the remains of Mungo Lady. After studies were done on the remains of Mungo Lady, scientists have come to the conclusion that Mungo Lady is around 40,000-42,000 years old and is one of the most anatomically modern human fossils in the world. A reason for Mungo Lady's importance to the field of anthropology is because she is one of the oldest examples of cremation by humans in the world, thus signifying the inception of the earliest forms of human tradition and cultural beliefs.
For Mungo Lady's ancestors to get to the continent of Australia however, would have been very difficult. Around 50,000-70,000 years ago, in line with the "Out of Africa" theory, archaic humans must have had to migrate through the Northern Indonesian Islands, into New Guinea and then into Australia. Although this may not be possible with current day geography and sea levels, 50,000-70,000 years ago, the Earth was different. Sea levels at this time were around 25-50 meters lower than modern day sea levels exposing more land and making it possible for a migration.
Archaeological discoveries in Southeast Asia
It was not until the late 1800s that Dubois found the skull of Homo erectus in Java, Indonesia, and had plugged the Southeast Asian region into the spotlight.
In 2003 since the archaeologists found another archaic human species on the island of Flores, Indonesia, this discovery has introduced many new theoretical approaches to human evolution in the region and on the global scales.
Southeast Asia is separated into two main subregions following the previous Oriental biogeographical region; mainland Southeast Asia and island Southeast Asia. The region of mainland and island Southeast Asia has been separated into four sub-regions: The Indochinese, Sundaic, Indian, and Wallacean provinces. The Indochinese province includes northern Thailand, southern China, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. The Sundaic province includes southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These two regions are divided by the climatic, zoological, and environmental patterns in which it implicates a different set of mammals and plants.
This region is of some importance in paleoanthropology,
e.g. Homo erectus in Java, Homo floresiensis in Flores, and until the early anatomically modern human in Laos. Furthermore, the faunal remains that were found within the region indicate the possible exchange between the Indochinese and Sundaic faunal in which the assemblages from this intermediate zone might yield the hominid specimen.
Homo erectus in Southeast Asia
Since the discovery of archaic human fossils by Dubois and van Koenigswald during the late 1800s and early 1900s which identified as Homo erectus, there is a small number of later evidence of Homo erectus that found as old as those fossils. Nevertheless, in local scale, one human fossil was found in the region of northern Thailand in 1999 by one villager in which some archaeologists suggest that it might be a fragmental piece of the skull of Homo erectus (c. 500 Ka) the four pieces of the fragmented skull are believed to be the right "frontal region of a calvaria with a very thick tabula externa, a thick dipole and very thin tabula interna" (Marwick 2009:54). However, this evidence is still debated by scholars and no research has been conducted regarding the age of the piece and the fauna that comes with it.
In Java
At Trinil, Dubois found the skull (cranial part), tooth and thighbone of one individual (Java Man) and naming him as Pithecanthropus erectus. While at Sangiran, van Koenigswald discovered at least 40 fossils and named them as Meganthropus palaeojavanicus. Although the fossils that were found in Trinil and Sangiran sites are the oldest evidence found within the region, the date of these fossils—implicated by Dubois—is still ambiguous. Swisher et al. are the first scholars who attempted to analyze the age of these fossils by using the 40Ar/39Ar dating of volcanic rock from both sites. Swisher et al. suggest that the result from both sites indicates the age of the fossils is dated back to c. 1.81-1.82 Ma or Early Pleistocene. This date was older than the fossils of the Homo erectus that were found from Olduvai Gorge at Tanzania at least 0.6 Ma. Nevertheless, some scholars argue that the dating method at both Java sites is unclear, especially the collective method of the rock and the relationships between the rock and the fossils. In fact, the remains in Java were found in more than these two sites, such as Ngandong (Homo soloensis) and Kedung.
Along with these fossils, there are also tools and fauna as well as other related artifacts found within the sites and other sites nearby. These artifacts could nevertheless shed light on the unresolved age of these remains. By using the absolute (radiometric) dating method, these faunal remains implicate the age at 0.8 Ma as for Flores Island. As for Kedung site, the faunal remains indicate the 110 and 70 ka in which this record is quite well known for the turnover of the age of H. erectus. In addition, the faunal remains that Dubois and van Koenigswald used might be overlying on the deposits of Kubuh and Pucangan Formations in which it indicates slightly younger ages from the remains of both sites. Therefore, scholars still debate the age of the H. erectus fossil Java Man. Corvinus et al. suggested that the evidence found between Southeast Asia and India illustrate a different set of understanding. For instance, in Southeast Asia, the finding of the human remains is flourishing and well-studied, but the lack of stone tools and human occupation. While in Indian sites there were discoveries of a number of Acheulean stone tools, Southeast Asian sites lack those remains. For this reason, to established and reconstructed the early H. erectuss activity and environment are yet ambiguity in the region regarding the technology and development of the tools and the relation to fossils.
The tools that were found within the Java sites are quite different from the Acheulean type that are found in Africa and Europe in which this type of stone tools implicates the H. erectus or Homo ergaster culture. Thus, the tools that are found in Java might suggest a different set of the culture of H. erectus between African and Asian regions. Swisher et al. (1994) also suggest that these tools developed separately from the Acheulean types and might indicate that H. erectus might migrate out of Africa even before the Acheulean type of tools were developed. However, the stone tools found in the Java region are difficult for establishing the age that can link to the H. erectus fossils. The research and analyses (tools, deposits, and faunal analyses) above thus suggests that the Javanese fossils are to be placed in the Middle Pleistocene or approximately 1.66 – 0.7 Ma.
Persistence hunting
The technique of persistence hunting was the primary hunting tactic of Homo erectus. Since most animals were faster than Homo erectus, they had to use other skillsets that countered the speed of these animals such as persistence and stamina. These Homo erectus hunters would chase their prey until the prey ran out of stamina. However, hunting like this led to dehydration because of constant movement in hot weather causing Homo erectus hunters to lose a maximum of 10% of their body mass in water weight. Studies by scientists show that Homo erectus could persistence hunt for a maximum of 5 hours before they would become too dehydrated. Homo erectus would use their stamina and long-distance running capabilities in order to chase their prey until it died of exhaustion. Thus, it can be said that Homo erectus were hunters that had to use their stamina and determination to hunt rather than their physical prowess.
Homo floresiensis
In 2003 another human species was found at Liang Bua cave in Flores, eastern Indonesia. The fossils consist of cranial and some post-cranial remains of one individual, and a premolar from another individual in older deposits. The species was recognized as distinct from H. erectus and H sapiens on the basis of anatomical differences (including much smaller body size), and named Homo floresiensis. It has been suggested that the brain volume of these individuals was approximately around 400 cm3, similar to the African Australopithecus afarensis. However, H. floresiensis remains were dated to only 38 ka – 18 ka ago (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene), using radiocarbon, luminescence, uranium-series and electron spin resonance (ESR) methods on sediments and associated artifacts.
Hunting technique
Apart from the remains, archaeologists also found stone (bifacial small core) or fleck tools in the same section of the individuals at least 32 of them and other 5,500 flakes per cubic meter on another section nearby. In addition, there is also a formal component found only with evidence of juvenile Stegodon and Komodo dragon, including points, perforators, blades and microblade that were probably hafted as barbs in which these tools indicate a selective hunting method. Although these stone artifacts seem to suggest the possibilities that these individuals use them, archaeologists are unable to establish which human species manufactured them since similar flakes tools and the remains of juvenile Stegodon and Komodo dragon are also found at the Soa Basin sites nearby as well. Despite this fact, the cognitive ability of H. floresiensis should not be underestimated. In addition, all evidence suggests another possibility of this species that they were able to migrate across the Wallace line into the Wallacean province in which according to geographical setting it was difficult to do. Nevertheless, scholars seem to agree that this H. floresiensis represent a species different from H. erectus and H. sapiens and overlapping with the presence of both in the region, raising the possibility that these species might have lived alongside each other before modern humans fully colonized the region later on.

city in Habersham County in the northeastern part of the state. The downtown business district is located at the intersection of Georgia Street and Central Avenue (U.S. 441). The buildings in the historic district were constructed from 1890 to 1934 and consist of six commercial buildings and one church."
The oldest (1890) building is the "Brick Block" or Starkweather Building, at the intersection of Georgia and Central, a two-story brick building with a stepped parapet and corbeled cornice. In 1989 it held Steffi's Store.
The Congregational Church (1908) was designed and built by H. W. Willett.

Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 29, commonly abbreviated to Jasta 29, was a "hunting group" (i.e., fighter squadron) of the Luftstreitkräfte, the air arm of the Imperial German Army during World War I. The squadron would score 76 aerial victories during the war, at the cost of 13 of their pilots killed in action, two killed in flying accidents, 12 wounded in action, one injured in a flying accident and one taken prisoner.
History
Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 29 was formed on 28 December 1916 at the Fliegerersatz-Abteilung (Replacement Detachment) 5 training facility at Hannover in Germany. It scored its first victory on 16 March 1917, when Wilhelm Allmenröder incinerated an enemy observation balloon. The fledgling squadron would be blooded just under a month later, suffering its first casualty on 11 April 1917. Jasta 29 would serve to the war's end.

This article is about the beliefs and theology of the Nation of Islam.
Main beliefs
The main belief of The Nation of Islam and its followers is that there is only one god, whom they claim "came in the person" of Wallace Fard Muhammad, and that Elijah Muhammad is a messenger of God. The official beliefs as stated by the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization as well as speeches by Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, and other ministers. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in Message to the Blackman in America and The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad (Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah, 1992).
Many of Malcolm X's teachings of NOI theology are in his The End of White World Supremacy, while a later more critical discussion of those beliefs can be found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, co-written with Alex Haley.
It is important to note that near the end of Malcolm X's life, Malcolm, along with Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Muhammad, left the Nation of Islam. Malcolm, following Wallace's footsteps, along with many other followers entered Sunni Islam. They rejected that Wallace Fard Muhammad was God in person, and that Elijah Muhammad is a messenger sent by God. The Prophet Muhammad from 570 CE to 632 CE is the last prophet for humankind, according to Islam - Qur'an Verse 40, Surah Al-Ahzab (chapter 33).
Passed down via written lessons from 1930 to 1934 from W. Fard Muhammad to his student Elijah Muhammad, referred to and titled The Supreme Wisdom, the Nation of Islam continues to teach its followers that the present world society is segmented into three distinct categories. It teaches that from a general perspective, 85% of the world's people of all races and faiths are the deaf, dumb and blind masses of the people who "are easily led in the wrong direction and hard to lead in the right direction". This 85% of the masses are said to be manipulated by 10% of the people who are referred to as the rich slave-makers of the masses of the people. Those 10% rich slave-makers are said to manipulate the 85% masses of the people through ignorance, the skillful use of religious doctrine, and the mass media.
The third group referred to as the 5% is the poor righteous teachers of the people of the world who know the truth of the manipulation of the 85% masses of the people by the 10% and that 5%, the righteous teachers, are at constant struggle and war with 10% to reach and free the minds of the masses of the people. (Assignment of Mr. Elijah Muhammad, The Supreme Wisdom, February 20, 1934; Power at Last Forever, Minister Louis Farrakhan, Madison Square Garden, New York, October 1985)
Black experience of slavery was Bible prophecy
The NOI teaches that Black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the Atlantic slave trade they were systematically denied knowledge of their history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Central to this doctrine, NOI theology asserts that Black people's experience of slavery was the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, and therefore, black people are the seed of Abraham referred to in the Bible, in Genesis 15:13–14:
Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
And Acts 7:6:
And God spoke on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
Both of these passages refer to the period of enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt as recorded in The Bible, the book of Exodus. Not to be confused with the period of Babylonian captivity in the 5th Century B.C. which lasted only seventy years.
Teachings on race
The Nation of Islam teaches that black people are the aboriginal people and that all other people come from them. Louis Farrakhan has stated "If you look at the human family—now, I'm talking about black, brown, red, yellow and white—we all seem to be frozen on a subhuman level of existence. In Islam and, I believe, in development. But when moral consciousness comes and we have a self-accusing spirit, it is then that we become human beings. Right now, we have the potential for humanity, but we have not reached that potential because we are functioning on the animalistic plane of existence."
In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Louis Farrakhan said the following in response to host Tim Russert's question on the Nation of Islam's teachings on race:
You know, it's not unreal to believe that white people—who genetically cannot produce yellow, brown or black—had a Black origin. The scholars and scientists of this world agree that the origin of man and humankind started in Africa and that the first parent of the world was Black. The Qur'an says that God created Adam out of black mud and fashioned him into shape. So if white people came from the original people, the Black people, what is the process by which you came to life? That is not a silly question. That is a scientific question with a scientific answer. It doesn't suggest that we are superior or that you are inferior. It suggests, however, that your birth or your origin is from the black people of this earth: superiority and inferiority are determined by our righteousness and not by our color.
Pressed by Russert on whether he agreed with Elijah Muhammad's preaching that whites are "blue-eyed devils", Farrakhan responded:
Well, you have not been saints in the way you have acted toward the darker peoples of the world and toward even your own people. But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be considered a devil. In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America.
Malcolm X said:
The Mother Plane
Elijah Muhammad taught his followers that the vision of the prophet Ezekiel, which Jews call the Merkabah, was a UFO that he called the Mother Wheel or Mother Plane:
Louis Farrakhan, commenting on his teacher's description, said the following:
Under the leadership of Louis Farrakhan since 1981, the current members of the Nation of Islam hold that Elijah Muhammad did not die, but was restored to health, and is aboard "that huge wheel-like plane that is even now flying over our heads."
Allah
The nation believes that Allah came to North America in the person of Wallace Fard Muhammad to teach the Black people about their true history. This is considered blasphemous by other Islamic denominations because of the NOI's belief of God appearing in human form.
Criticisms
The NOI has been seen by some as attempting to be its own religion separate of Islam. The first book analyzing the Nation of Islam was The Black Muslims in America (1961) by C. Eric Lincoln. Lincoln describes how religious services use myths and over-generalizations to indoctrinate NOI adherents.

Konstanze von Schulthess-Rechberg (born 27 January 1945) is a German author. She is the daughter of World War II colonel and resistance leader Claus von Stauffenberg.
Family
Konstanze von Schulthess-Rechberg, born Konstanze Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg on 27 January 1945, is the youngest child of Operation Valkyrie leader Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (1907–1944), a member of the traditional German nobility, and "Nina" Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg (1913–2006). She was born in a Nazi maternity center in Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, where her mother had been transferred for childbirth from the Ravensbrück concentration camp. Her mother, who was pregnant with her fifth child at the time of the failed plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power on 20 July 1944, for which her father was summarily executed, had been arrested and imprisoned in the aftermath of the assassination attempt.
After the war, Konstanze and her four older siblings – Berthold (1934), Heimeran (1936–2020), Franz-Ludwig (1938), and Valerie (1940–1966), who had been placed in an orphanage in Bad Sachsa, Lower Saxony, under the surname of Meister, upon their mother's arrest by the Gestapo – were reunited with their mother at the Stauffenberg family seat in Lautlingen in Baden-Württemberg. Together, they returned to their mother's hometown of Bamberg, Bavaria.
Konstanze, who has lived in Switzerland since 1965, trained as a maternity nurse. She wrote a biography of her mother, Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg: ein Porträt, that was published in 2008 (in German).
Married since 1967, Konstanze and her husband Dietrich von Schulthess-Rechberg (1937) have four children. Their son, Philipp von Schulthess|de (born 1973), is an actor who played a supporting role in the 2008 film Valkyrie: a depiction of the failed plot in which Philipp's grandfather, was involved. When it was announced that the film would feature US actor Tom Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg, Konstanze's brother Berthold, the eldest of the Stauffenbergs, expressed an apprehension that the film might become "horrible kitsch".

Esparza is a canton in the Puntarenas province of Costa Rica. The head city is Esparza in Espíritu Santo district.
History
Esparza was created on 6 November 1851 by decree 39.
The territory of the canton of Esparza was first inhabited by the Chorotega and Huetar cultures. The first belonged to the province of Orotina (one of five Chorotega provinces), ruled by King Gurutiña. The Huetar belonged to the western Huetar kingdom, dominated at the time of the Spanish conquest by King Garabito, or Coyoche, one of the key leaders of the Costa Rican indigenous resistance.
In 1522, Don Gil González Dávila was the first Spanish visitor to the region, journeying from Burica to the indigenous village of Avancari (now Abangaritos , in the canton of Puntarenas).
In 1561, Don Juan de Cavallón y Arboleda, was commissioned by the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala to conquer the province of Nuevo Cartago and Costa Rica. He founded the town of Los Reyes, with the port of Landecho in Tivives Cove, within the Canton of Esparza.
In 1574, Alonso Anguciana de Gamboa, acting governor, relocated citizens of the town of Aranjuez to found the first seat of the city of Espíritu Santo (5 km from the current site of Esparza), in the valley then known as Coyoche, between the Barranca and Jesus Maria rivers, near the present village of Artieda.
There the citizens constructed a small chapel, and shortly afterwards the convent of San Lorenzo, whose first priest was Fray Diego de Guillon. In 1576 the chapel was established within a parish, dedicated to Our Lady of Candelaria. The parish is now suffragan to the diocese of Puntarenas, in the ecclesiastical province of Costa Rica. In 1577 (a year later), the governor of the province, Diego de Artieda y Chirino, established the port of Caldera, replacing Landecho.
Artieda changed the name of the town, adding "Esparza" to the name of the "Ciudad del Espíritu Santo". He did this in memory of his hometown, the village of Esparza, located in the valley of Salazar, in Navarra, Spain, 80 km from the capital of the province, Pamplona. Between 1622 and 1629 the second and final seat of the Ciudad del Espíritu Santo de Esparza was established about five kilometers northwest of its original location. In 1685 the city was sacked by pirates. The following year (1686), pirates burned most of the town, except the church and convent of San Lorenzo. The people were forced to flee inland, taking refuge in Las Cañas and Bagaces.
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the territory of the Ciudad del Espíritu Santo de Esparza extended from the Montes del Aguacate to the rivers Salto and Tempisque. The following territories were under its administrative political jurisdiction:
Orotina
San Mateo
Puntarenas
Montes de Oro
Abangares
Cañas
Bagaces
In 1821 a small, private, elementary school was established, but only for boys. In 1862 Genoveva Gutierrez opened a small private school for all ages. In 1870, during the second administration of Jesús Jiménez Zamora, the first co-educational public school was opened, and was directed by his wife, Clotilde V. Fernandez de Mora.
From 1870 to 1890 the schoolhouse occupied a building on the north side of the church. The current school was founded in April 1946 and named after Arturo Torres Martinez. In 1965, during the government of Francisco Jose Orlich Bolmarcich, the Liceo Diurno (day high school) opened in Esparza. In 1976 the Liceo Nocturno (night school) was founded. In 2001 the Liceo Emiliano Odio was established. Esparza has a wide range of educational facilities: kindergartens, public schools, and various private colleges; Sancti Spiritus, Manantial de Vida and Santa Sofía College. A campus of the University of Costa Rica (UCR) is soon to open in Nances.
On 4 November 1825, by Law 63, the city of Esparza became part of the district of Cañas in the Western Department, one of two departments into which Costa Rica was divided. On 29 November 1826 Saturnino Lizano Gutiérrez was born in Esparza. He went on to become President of Costa Rica from 5 July to 10 August 1882.
In 1848, Esparza was the second canton in the province of Alajuela. On 6 November 1851, by Executive Order No. 8, this corner of the province of Alajuela was segregated and added to the jurisdiction of the region of Puntarenas.
On 21 March 1834, by Law 59, it was decided to transfer the port of Puntarenas to Caldera. On 26 February 1840, Braulio Carrillo Colina reinstated Puntarenas by decree as a commercial trade port of Costa Rica.
In 1877 the first municipality, composed of Ignacio Pérez (in whose honor the current central city park was named), Felipe Herrera and Marcelino Zuniga, opened. Also in 1877, the first public gas lighting was introduced. In 1921, during the first term of Julio Acosta Garcia, electric bulb lighting was installed.
On 3 September 1879, during the administration of Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez, Decree 93 renamed the town as Esparta. On 6 May 1974, executive decree n.º3752-G-C, restored the name of Esparza to the second canton of Puntarenas province.
In 1912, during the first term of Ricardo Jimenez Oreamuno, piping was installed for potable water.
Geography
Esparza has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres.
The major portion of the canton lies along the coast of the Gulf of Nicoya between the mouths of Río Barranca and the Río Jesús María. An extension of the canton reaches northward from Esparza into the Cordillera de Tilarán.
Districts
The canton of Esparza is subdivided into the following districts:
Espíritu Santo
San Juan Grande
Macacona
San Rafael
San Jerónimo
Caldera
Demographics
For the 2011 census, Esparza had a population of inhabitants.

Alphonse Tierou (born 17 April 1946) is a French dancer, choreographer, and scholar of dance originally from the Ivory Coast.
Life and career
Tierou is a former student of the National Institute of Arts at Abidjan.
He theorized and codified African dance and defined an African dance vocabulary, using ten basic movements that are common to all African cultures.
In 1988, Unesco hired him as a consultant for research into dance in Africa through 1996.
From 1993 to 1996 he trained dancers and choreographs during a 3-year tour in 20 African countries.
He initiated "Premières Rencontres de la Création chorégraphique panafricaine", the First Pan-African dance contest, in Luanda, Angola in 1995, and served as its artistic director.
He is the founder and director of the Resources, Pedagogy and Research Centre for African Creation in Paris. He teaches African dance and conceives choreographic creations.
Tierou authored more than a dozen books, as well as articles and conferences on African dance and culture. His works were the first to propose a theory of African dance, with a Pan-African approach and a focus on dialogue between cultures.
He conceives and organises exhibitions on African dance, and its relationship with traditional African masks and African sculpture.

An Emotion Markup Language (EML or EmotionML) has first been defined by the W3C Emotion Incubator Group (EmoXG) as a general-purpose emotion annotation and representation language, which should be usable in a large variety of technological contexts where emotions need to be represented. Emotion-oriented computing (or "affective computing") is gaining importance as interactive technological systems become more sophisticated. Representing the emotional states of a user or the emotional states to be simulated by a user interface requires a suitable representation format; in this case a markup language is used.
EmotionML version 1.0 was published by the group in May 2014.
History
In 2006, a first W3C Incubator Group, the Emotion Incubator Group (EmoXG), was set up "to investigate a language to represent the emotional states of users and the emotional states simulated by user interfaces" with the final Report published on 10 July 2007.
In 2007, the Emotion Markup Language Incubator Group (EmotionML XG) was set up as a follow-up to the Emotion Incubator Group, "to propose a specification draft for an Emotion Markup Language, to document it in a way accessible to non-experts, and to illustrate its use in conjunction with a number of existing markups." The final report of the Emotion Markup Language Incubator Group, Elements of an EmotionML 1.0, was published on 20 November 2008.
The work then was continued in 2009 in the frame of the W3C's Multimodal Interaction Activity, with the First Public Working Draft of "Emotion Markup Language (EmotionML) 1.0" being published on 29 October 2009. The Last Call Working Draft of "Emotion Markup Language 1.0", was published on 7 April 2011. The Last Call Working Draft addressed all open issues that arose from feedback of the community on the First Call Working Draft as well as results of a workshop held in Paris in October 2010. Along with the Last Call Working Draft, a list of vocabularies for EmotionML has been published to aid developers using common vocabularies for annotating or representing emotions.
Annual draft updates were published until the 1.0 version was finished in 2014.
Reasons for defining an emotion markup language
A standard for an emotion markup language would be useful for the following purposes:
To enhance computer-mediated human-human or human-machine communication. Emotions are a basic part of human communication and should therefore be taken into account, e.g. in emotional Chat systems or emphatic voice boxes. This involves specification, analysis and display of emotion related states.
To enhance systems' processing efficiency. Emotion and intelligence are strongly interconnected. The modeling of human emotions in computer processing can help to build more efficient systems, e.g. using emotional models for time-critical decision enforcement.
To allow the analysis of non-verbal behavior, emotion, mental states that can be provided using web services to enable data collection, analysis, and reporting.
Concrete examples of existing technology that could apply EmotionML include:
Opinion mining / sentiment analysis in Web 2.0, to automatically track customer's attitude regarding a product across blogs;
Affective monitoring, such as ambient assisted living applications, fear detection for surveillance purposes, or using wearable sensors to test customer satisfaction;
Wellness technologies that provide assistance according to a person's emotional state with the goal to improve the person's well-being;
Character design and control for games and virtual worlds;
Building web services to capture, analysis, and report data of non-verbal behavior, emotion and mental states of an individual or group across the internet using standard web technologies such as HTML5 and JSON.
Social robots, such as guide robots engaging with visitors;
Expressive speech synthesis, generating synthetic speech with different emotions, such as happy or sad, friendly or apologetic; expressive synthetic speech would for example make more information available to blind and partially sighted people, and enrich their experience of the content;
Emotion recognition (e.g., for spotting angry customers in speech dialog systems, to improve computer games or e-Learning applications);
Support for people with disabilities, such as educational programs for people with autism. EmotionML can be used to make the emotional intent of content explicit. This would enable people with learning disabilities (such as Asperger syndrome) to realise the emotional context of the content;
EmotionML can be used for media transcripts and captions. Where emotions are marked up to help deaf or hearing impaired people who cannot hear the soundtrack, more information is made available to enrich their experience of the content.
The Emotion Incubator Group has listed 39 individual use cases for an Emotion markup language.
A standardised way to mark up the data needed by such "emotion-oriented systems" has the potential to boost development primarily because data that was annotated in a standardised way can be interchanged between systems more easily, thereby simplifying a market for emotional databases, and the standard can be used to ease a market of providers for sub-modules of emotion processing systems, e.g. a web service for the recognition of emotion from text, speech or multi-modal input.
The challenge of defining a generally usable emotion markup language
Any attempt to standardize the description of emotions using a finite set of fixed descriptors is doomed to failure, as there is no consensus on the number of relevant emotions, on the names that should be given to them or how else best to describe them. For example, the difference between ":)" and "(:" is small, but using a standardized markup it would make one invalid. Even more basically, the list of emotion-related states that should be distinguished varies depending on the application domain and the aspect of emotions to be focused. Basically, the vocabulary needed depends on the context of use.
On the other hand, the basic structure of concepts is less controversial: it is generally agreed that emotions involve triggers, appraisals, feelings, expressive behavior including physiological changes, and action tendencies; emotions in their entirety can be described in terms of categories or a small number of dimensions; emotions have an intensity, and so on. For details, see the Scientific Descriptions of Emotions in the Final Report of the Emotion Incubator Group.
Given this lack of agreement on descriptors in the field, the only practical way of defining an emotion markup language is the definition of possible structural elements and to allow users to "plug in" vocabularies that they consider appropriate for their work.
An additional challenge lies in the aim to provide a markup language that is generally usable. The requirements that arise from different use cases are rather different. Whereas manual annotation tends to require all the fine-grained distinctions considered in the scientific literature, automatic recognition systems can usually distinguish only a very small number of different states and affective avatars need yet another level of detail for expressing emotions in an appropriate way.
For the reasons outlined here, it is clear that there is an inevitable tension between flexibility and interoperability, which need to be weighed in the formulation of an EmotionML. The guiding principle in the following specification has been to provide a choice only where it is needed, and to propose reasonable default options for every choice.
Applications and web services benefiting from an emotion markup language
There are a range of existing projects and applications to which an emotion markup language will enable the building of webservices to measure capture data of individuals non-verbal behavior, mental states, and emotions and allowing results to be reported and rendered in a standardized format using standard web technologies such as JSON and HTML5. One such project is measuring affect data across the Internet using EyesWeb.

City-United Historical note: During the 1994 pre-season, it became clear that neither United nor Armidale City would have enough players to field four grades or be competitive. Given that quite a few of City's squad were former United players, NERU Secretary and former United President Dick Croft encouraged the two clubs to join forces, and City United was born. The new club competed strongly for the next eight years before merging with Armidale Old Boys for the 2002 season. This resulted in the new Armidale Blues Rugby Club, which combines the history and tradition of City, the professionalism and competitiveness of Old Boys, and the spirit and student depth of United.

The Tudor Vianu National High School of Computer Science (), often referred to as "CNITV" of Bucharest can trace its roots back to 1928 and enjoys nowadays a very good reputation in Romania and even in the world, due to its students who won many international competitions in physics, mathematics, computer science, and chemistry.
History
The history of the Tudor Vianu National College of Computer Science begins with its building situated at 10, Architect Ion Mincu Street in Bucharest. During World War II, the building was the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement headquarters. In 1928, the building began to be used as a high school and was first known as the "Academical High School for Girls". Due to the changes that followed after World War II, the institution decided to focus on a prospective domain: computer science. Founded in 1928, the institution received the name of "Theoretical High School for Girls".
Being placed in a high-end residential area, many nomenklatura children attended its classes, especially at the "Dr. Petru Groza", theoretical high school among others.
In September 1970, by the decision of the council of ministers, the "High School of Informatics" was established, also known as Industrial High-School for Systems of Automatic Data processing "SPAD". It started with 4 classes, 109 students, 27 per class, in parallel with the "Peter Groza High School", which continued until the termination in 1974 of the theoretical section under the name of the "High School Informatics Dr. Petru Groza ".
The computer science classes were completed after September 15, based on the transfer from other high schools in Bucharest, provided that the average admission to that high school is over 9.00. Starting from 1971 the High School organized its own admission exams, where the minimum grade was usually above 9.00, due to high demand as being among the best High schools in the Country. The first promotion from the High School of Informatics graduated in 1975, bringing to the high school the first prizes at the Physics and Mathematics Olympiads by municipality and country (Valeriu Beiu, Andrei Cioara, and Liviu Popa-Simil in Physics; Daniel Mihalcea and Constantin Manoil in Mathematics). The admission rate in higher education was over 90%, qualifying the high school as one of the first high schools in Bucharest at that time. Students' life was good, learning program was intensive but relaxed, students having enough time to do extra-curriculum activities and do good with home-works. Teachers were special, well prepared, nice with students, objective with grading. The purpose of the founding was to produce the mid-level staff specialized in informatics necessary for the development of the Bucharest Computer Factory, which produced the French IRIS-50 license, the CDC-3700 computer, and the implementation of computing techniques in the country. The first generation graduated in 1975, obtaining a Baccalaureate Diploma and a Certificate of Specialist, in Computer Main frame Operation, Programmer and aid analyst, good for hiring in the computing industry.
Period 1970–1975
The 1970 series of the high school included 4 classes of 25 students each, with a program of 4 hours a day in the morning from 8:30 to 12:30. The first 2 years included an intensive specialized program, studying the internal structure of the computer, representation, organization and management of data, algorithms and logic schemes, computers, assembly languages (Asembler; Asiris), programming in Cobol, Fortran and a laboratory of digital electronics and programming of Fc15 Accounting Billing machines, etc. Starting in 1972, elements of general culture and economic and organizational sciences were introduced.
In the basement, the computer technology laboratory was developed, including terminals, card punches, accounting billing machines, office computers, which was permanently adapted by ICI care.
Academics
The first promotion post-high school specialization range was the following: Economist 30%; Engineers (computer, Electronics, Mechanics) 30%; Engineer-Physicist 1%; Mathematics 6%; Physics 2%; Romanian Army Superior Officer 2%(Economics; Communication-Engineering); Representing 74% of graduates, with higher education, and Athletics Trainer 1%; Technicians in computer related activities 7%, Programmers 16%. This made about one quarter ( 24%) of the students fulfilled the immediate need for qualified personnel in computing activities, as initially desired by the founders, that triggered the founding for more specialization sections in many other high-schools, and continuum education after hours schools.
Period 1975–1980
In 1977, its name was changed again to "High School of Mathematics and Physics No. 1", then, in 1991 "High School of Informatics", so that in 1997 it became "Tudor Vianu National College of Informatics".
Just four years later, the institution changed its name once more and became known as the Mathematics-Physics High School no. 1 (). The development of microprocessors as Intel 8080 or Zilog Z80 made possible the appearance of micro-computers as M118, HC-85, Tim-S, Cobra etc., operating inside 64 k of memory with external cassette data support or flexible disks, that came to replace the previous multi-head cartridges as ISOT 1370, etc.
Period 1980–1990
At the end of 1989, the Romanian Revolution took place, being a time of changes in computer science too. The era of Zilog Z80 or Intel 8080 was reaching its end, and a new liberalization in the computer market was predictable.
Period 1990–2000
In 1991, just two years after the Romanian Revolution, the school was renamed High School of Computer Science. Since 1997, the institution uses the name of a famous Romanian art critic, poet, philosopher and translator: Tudor Vianu. The reasoning is still unclear, because the Vianu's domain of excellence was in a different domain than computing, but the excellence remained a common factor. The graduates of Computer Science High School aspire the same level of excellence as Vianu obtained inside National culture. By 1992 the PC286 diagrams were published by IBM and the era of personal/professional computers started.
Period 2000–2020
The evolution of Internet, parallel machines, super-computers challenged new changes in the High-School. In 2007, due to its last admission rating of 9.51, CNITV was ranked first in Bucharest. One year later, its last admission rating suffered a significant drop to 9.17, and was ranked on the 5th place. This drop was believed to have been caused by the Romanian Government's decision to change the entrance examination methodology. In 2009, the high school was ranked 2nd after Saint Sava National College, in 2010 it was ranked 4th, due to its 9.32 last admission rating, and in 2011 was also 4th, with 9.42 last admission rating. And after 9 years, in 2018, the high school was ranked once again the 2nd high school in the country, after Saint Sava National College
International contests
The Tudor Vianu National High School of Computer Science has a long list of excellent students that participated in many International Science Olympiads and other contests. In the last decade only, the students won 30 gold medals, 53 silver medals and 36 bronze medals in different kind of competitions.
Comenius projects
The Tudor Vianu National High School of Computer Science has been participating in two 2 different projects in recent years. The projects were coordinated by Iulia Manicea.
NASA Great Moonbuggy Race
CNITV also took part in other Academic Competitions. In 2009 and 2010, two teams participated in the NASA Great Moonbuggy Race, a competition held in Huntsville, Alabama since 1994. The students had to build a vehicle resembling the Lunar Rover used on the Moon during the last three missions of the American Apollo program and then race it to the finish line.
Romanian Masters of Sciences
The Romanian Master of Mathematics and Sciences (formerly known as the Romanian Masters in Mathematics), also referred to as RMMS is an annual international competition dedicated to students at preuniversitary level. It is organised by the Tudor Vianu National High School of Computer Science in collaboration with the Sector 1 town council.
The first Romanian Master of Mathematics took place in 2008. At the 2012 RMMS, there were 14 participating countries: Romania, Russia, Brazil, United Kingdom, United States, Serbia, Bulgaria, Italy, China, Kazakhstan, Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, Poland, and Hungary. There was no RMMS competition in 2014.
Publications
The official school magazine was Fișierele Tinerilor ("Youth Files"). The articles in the magazine were mainly educational, as they covered subjects as physics, mathematics, chemistry, geography, history and economics. It also enabled pupils to showcase their artistic and literary talents through various contests or activities. Sometimes, it featured articles relating school theatre plays or interviews with pupils that had performed well in various competitions. The journal was produced by an editorial committee of student volunteers, usually with the assistance of some teachers. It was partly financed by commercial advertising and was published every four or five months. The magazine was closed in July 2009.

Thein Pe Myint ( ; also Thakin Thein Pe ( ); 10 July 1914 – 15 January 1978) was a Burmese politician, writer and journalist. A writer of several politically and socially prominent books and the founder of an influential newspaper The Botataung, Thein Pe Myint was a leading Marxist intellectual and was an important player in the Burmese independence movement and postwar politics.
Brief personal history
Thein Pe Myint was born Thein Pe in Butalin, Sagaing Division in Upper Burma. He later added his mother's name, Daw Myint, to his given name when he first started writing. He earned a BA degree from Rangoon University in 1935. Thein Pe Myint married Khin Kyi Kyi in 1946 and had four children. He died in 1978 at the age of 64.
Political career
Thein Pe Myint became involved in politics as a Rangoon University student in mid-1930s. Then still known by his birth name Thein Pe, he became a secretary of Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association), an influential anti-colonial association whose members included the who's who of Burmese independence politics--Thakin Aung San, Thakin Nu, Thakin Kyaw Nyein, Thakin Mya, Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Shu Maung (later Ne Win), etc.
Already a well-known, if controversial, writer, Thakin Thein Pe quickly became one of the leading spokesmen of the Left movement in Burma. He was an important student leader in the university student-led protests against the colonial British Government in 1936 and during the "Uprising of 1300 ME" in 1938.
When the Second World War began, Thein Pe Myint was one of a few leading Burmese independence activists that refused to ally with fascist Japan. In an open break with most other prominent student leaders like Aung San, Thein Pe Myint sided with the Allied powers even if it meant working with the British. In 1942, Thein Pe Myint went underground when the Japanese empire conquered Burma.
Indeed, Thein Pe Myint would be vindicated later when Japanese rule proved disastrous. General Aung San, who hitherto had allied with the Japanese, sent Thein Pe Myint as an envoy to India to seek help from the Allies for the fight against the Japanese. He played a leading role in propaganda and liaison activities between some of the wartime Burmese leaders like General Aung San and the British Force 136, the special operations and intelligence unit.
After the war, he worked in many associations and parties including the Communist Party of Burma, Sino-Burmese Friends Associations, People Peace Association, Burmese Writers Association. In 1946, he became the first minister of Agriculture and Forestry in General Aung San's government during the war. He was jailed in 1948 but released in 1949.
After independence, Thein Pe Myint's political career turned to advocacy as a journalist.
Career as a writer and journalist
Thein Pe Myint's literary career began in 1937 when he was already a politically active Rangoon University student.
His inaugural work Tet Phonegyi (The Modern Monk; ) openly deals with scandalous sexual liaisons and corrupt affairs of some of Burmese Buddhist clergy. His fellow Dobama Asiayone member Thakin Nu wrote the introduction of the book. The provocative book shocked the highly devout Burma, and came to symbolize the open challenge by the left-leaning college-educated student activists to the old unspoken norms of Burmese society. The book was vigorously denounced by Young Monks Association. Both the writer and the publishing company received many threats. However some leading writers including Zawgyi welcomed the book. He became known as Tet Pongyi Thein Pe.
His notable works include:
Tet Pongyi (The Modern Monk; )
Tet Khit Nat Soe (Devil in Modern Era; )
Thabeik Hmauk Kyaungtha (The Boycotting Student; )
Thakin Kodaw Hmaing—Biography of Thakin Kodaw Hmaing
Ashay Ga Ne-Wun Htwet Thi Ba Ma (As the Sun Rises from the East; ) - Winner of Burmese Literary Prize
The History of Chin State - Winner of Burmese Literary Prize
He wrote several books in English including What Happened in Burma and Over the Ashes. Many of his works are still being republished to this day, and among them Wartime Traveller remains a bestseller. The book has been translated into English as by Dr. Robert H. Taylor.
He also directed a movie Yaukkya Gonyi (A Man's Honour; ). He worked in the Red Dragon Book Association and wrote several plays.
Thein Pe Myint founded The Botataung newspaper in 1958. (He was a former news correspondent of Myanma Alin in the late 1930s.) He was the chief editor of the left leaning influential paper until 1964 when his newspaper was nationalized by the socialist government led by General Ne Win as part of his Burmese Way to Socialism.

Michael George Somes CBE (28 September 191718 November 1994), was an English ballet dancer. He was a principal dancer of The Royal Ballet, London, and the frequent partner of Margot Fonteyn.
Early years
Somes was born in Horsley, Gloucestershire, England, the son of Edwin Joseph Somes (1882-1973), a professional musician, and Ethel M. M. Pridham (1889-1972), a schoolmistress. He had an elder brother, Laurence Joseph Somes (1913-1987).
Career
In 1934, he was awarded the first scholarship given to a male by the Royal Ballet (then known as the Vic-Wells Ballet). In 1938, he and Fonteyn created the principal rôles in the Frederick Ashton/Constant Lambert ballet Horoscope, after which he was described as "potentially the finest British male dancer of the half century". He originated rôles in 24 ballets choreographed for the company by Ashton, and was the lead male dancer for the company from 1951 until the arrival of Rudolf Nureyev in 1962. From then on, Somes appeared in character rôles, most notably as Lord Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. Somes was assistant director of the company under Ashton from 1963 to 1970.
Somes appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1954, and in television versions of Swan Lake (1954), The Sleeping Beauty (1955) and The Nutcracker (1958), as well as a film version of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet (1966). All three productions starred Margot Fonteyn.
In 1959, Somes was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).
Personal life
In 1954, Somes married the ballet dancer Deirdre Annette Dixon (1934 - 1959), a junior soloist for the Royal Ballet. Dixon died in a London hospital on May 28th 1959, aged 25, from a cerebral abscess and meningitis, although her obituary in The Stage states that her death was from the effects of a car accident two years previously. Somes then married fellow ballet dancer Dame Antoinette Sibley in 1964; they divorced in 1973. He later married ballet dancer Wendy Ellis. He died of a brain tumour in London in 1994.
Somes was a distant relative (1st cousin 3 times removed) of Joseph Somes, (1787-1845), British shipowner, Conservative politician and Governor of the New Zealand Company. He was also related to the latter's namesake Joseph Somes (1819-1871), Conservative M.P. for Kingston upon Hull from 1859-1865.

The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH) is an interdisciplinary project of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Within the framework of this Research Center social scientists and natural scientists study the effect that culture had on the successive expansions of humans out of Africa and across the Old World. The Research Center is located at the University of Tübingen and the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
The project was initiated in 2008 by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and is scheduled to continue for 20 years until 2027.
Research
Background
Over the course of the last 2 million years at least two species of the genus Homo (Homo erectus and Homo sapiens) have expanded out of Africa in successive waves into Asia and Europe. Modern humans (Homo sapiens) were probably the only species of hominins capable of settling new territories such as Australia, the sub-arctic region and the Americas. While Australopithecines and early species of humans were limited by their natural environments—as most species are—our ancestors were able to take advantage of their newly developed cultural capacities on their way to becoming human, as well as adapting to their environment.
These thoughts helped to establish one of the working hypotheses in the ROCEEH project: The influence of the environment on the expansions of hominin species decreased through time, while the significance of culture increased through new technologies.
Goals of the ROCEEH project are:
Reconstructing the expansion waves of diverse hominin species, as well as to understand their timing and direction.
Investigating their effects on the history of humanity.
Studying the expansion of the ecological surroundings of these hominins, as well as the expansions of cultural capacities between 3 million and 20,000 years ago.
Describing and analyzing the causes of these expansions.
The project pays special attention to the development of human capabilities that deal with problem-solving through culture.
To achieve these aims, the project selected six senior researchers with experience in the disciplines of paleoanthropology, paleoecology, paleobotany, geography and archaeology.
Methods
A central part of the project is represented by the interdisciplinary and web-based database called the ROCEEH Out-of-Africa Database (ROAD) with geographic information system functions. Geographic data about a locality is added to information about the geological layers, the divisions of archaeological layers, and cultural remains. To complete the picture, information about important human and animal fossils, vegetation and climate is gathered in order to reconstruct early habitats. Using a geographic information system, the results are compiled in a digital atlas to show the important developments in human-environment interactions.
Organization
The ROCEEH is located at the University of Tübingen and the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The leaders of the Research Center in Tübingen include Nicholas Conard and Volker Hochschild, as well as Volker Mosbrugger and Friedemann Schrenk in Frankfurt am Main. The current chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board is Hermann H. Hahn.
On occasions, the ROCEEH organizes international workshops, symposia and conferences, inviting guests to propose new methods and introduce and discuss the latest developments and research results.

Fort Washington Light is an unusual lighthouse located on the banks of the Potomac River on the grounds of its namesake fort. Although there has been a lighthouse on this location since 1857, the current light was converted from a fog bell tower in 1901.
History
Fort Washington projects into the Potomac River where the river turns north, and in 1856 Jefferson Davis, in his capacity of Secretary of War, authorized the construction of a lighthouse on the fort property, to be maintained by post personnel. Minimal funds were appropriated, and a temporary cast iron tower was constructed the following year. Almost immediately this light was found inadequate and in 1870 a replacement tower was constructed in Baltimore and erected on a site closer to the water. This tower had a sixth-order Fresnel lens.
In 1882 a wooden fog bell tower was erected, and in the following years a keeper's house and various other structures sprung up around the old tower, largely obscuring it. In 1900 a request was made to build a third, taller tower, and as a temporary expedient, a light was added to the fog bell tower, sitting on a platform attached near the top. The replacement light tower was never built, and the converted fog bell tower continues in service. Over the years the 1870 tower, the keeper's house, and the surrounding buildings were all demolished. The tower is readily visible to visitors to the park in which it stands, though it is closed to public access.

Nicholas Thomas Elko (December 14, 1909 – May 18, 1991) was the third bishop of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, the American branch of the Ruthenian Catholic Church. At the age of 46 he became the first American-born Bishop of the Greek Catholic Church. He later served as Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Early life
Born on December 14, 1909, to Rusyn immigrant parents in Donora, Pennsylvania, a steel town in the Monongahela River Valley, he attended the public schools there and in 1930 graduated from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He completed graduate theological studies at the Greek Catholic Seminary in Uzhhorod and at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. Bishop Basil Takach ordained him to the priesthood on September 30, 1934, at St. Nicholas Greek Catholic Church in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.
He next served as pastor in several parishes throughout the Exarchate and as the spiritual director of the Greek Catholic Union of the USA, the oldest continuous fraternal benefit society for Rusyn immigrants and their descendants in the U.S. Elko also served in the administration of the Exarchate as Dean of the Cleveland Deanery, Consultor, and eventually as Vicar General. Pope Pius XII in 1952 named him a domestic prelate with the title of Reverend Monsignor. He was appointed that same year as the Rector of the Exarchate's new seminary, the Byzantine Catholic Seminary of SS. Cyril and Methodius.
Bishop Daniel Ivancho appointed Elko in 1954 as the Rector of St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral. Yet just three months later, Ivancho abruptly resigned as bishop, and the Holy See directed Elko, as the Vicar General of the Exarchate, to administer it. On February 16, 1955, Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, the Vatican's delegate to the United States, announced that Elko would be elevated to the episcopacy. On March 6, 1955, he was ordained as bishop at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Italy, by Cardinal Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant, Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Secretary of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.

The former immigrant Ruthenian Church was by the 1950s now overwhelmingly American-born and modernizing rapidly in the post-World War II era. Bishop Elko sought to engage the new generation by leading change within the Exarchate. He immediately sought and was granted permission by Rome to permit English, in addition to the ancient liturgical language Old Church Slavonic, to be used in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy.
He next established in 1956 a new weekly newspaper, The Byzantine Catholic World. The term "Byzantine Catholic" was relatively new and represented something of a re-branding for the Church. The term began in usage in the 1940s in an effort to clarify the ritual identification of the Church to the majority American Latin-Rite Catholics, replacing the traditional European appellation of "Greek Catholic". The Church roots were historically "Greek" in the sense that Christianity came to the Slavs in the 9th century by the missionary brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius. But the new name aimed to evoke the even older and more glorious history of Eastern Christianity in Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire.
Elko's administration also undertook the construction of more than one hundred churches and schools. However, in the spirit of Latinism and assimilation, Elko recommended that many traditional Byzantine architectural features, such iconostasis, or as icon screens, be omitted or removed from the new or renovated churches. The Church's membership, largely in the northeastern United States, began to migrate to the West. Elko assigned priests to do organizational work there, and established new parishes in California and Alaska.
Rome upgrades the American Church's status
Since its inception in 1924 as the "Apostolic Exarchate of the United States of America, Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Ruthenian)", the organizational status of Elko's American Greek Catholic Church was merely that of a missionary territory with limited self-governing authority, the homeland being Europe—albeit under Communist persecution since 1946.
On July 6, 1963, the Vatican upgraded the status of the church from Exarchate to Eparchy, or diocese according to the Latin-Rite terminology. A decree by the newly elected Pope Paul VI divided the entire U.S. territory of the Church into two separate ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The first, centered in Passaic, New Jersey, included the Eastern states and the second jurisdiction, centered in Pittsburgh, included the rest of the nation. Both jurisdictions now held the canonical status of an eparchy or a full diocese. Elko continued as the American Church's senior hierarch, but a new bishop, Stephen Kocisko, was installed for Passaic.
The Second Vatican Council and the Eastern Catholic Churches
Elko was appointed a Consultor to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and took part in the proceedings, held in Rome from 1962 to 1965, of the Second Vatican Council. It issued a decree, promulgated by Paul VI on November 21, 1964, titled Orientalium Ecclesiarum. The new policy underscored the richness of the Eastern Rite churches and respect for them. It urged Eastern Rites to return to the roots of their distinctive rituals and to avoid Latinization of their practices.
The decree heartened anti-latinizers in the Byzantine Church, and to many seemed a repudiation of Elko's "reforms", particularly during the building boom of the previous years.
Controversy
By 1967, Elko's popularity within his own Church waned on account of the rapid change he led, the confusion among laity around many Vatican II reforms, and especially Elko's authoritarian management style. Whether priest or laity, ethnic or assimilated, many in the Church were agitated by Elko's leadership. Petitions were signed and sent off to Rome. The Vatican, fearing more dissension in the Church like that experienced during the 1930s, transferred Elko to Rome, where he was elevated to the dignity of an Archbishop and appointed as the ordaining prelate for the Byzantine Catholics in Rome and head of the Ecumenical Commission on the Liturgy. This prompted his resignation as Byzantine Catholic Bishop of Pittsburgh, and Monsignor Edward V. Rosack, the Chancellor of the Eparchy, was named as the temporary apostolic administrator.
Time Magazine reported on the unusual situation, noting that a "bishop is almost never separated from his see. For the past seven months, however, the Most Rev. Nicholas T. Elko, Ruthenian-rite bishop of Pittsburgh, has been in Rome, barred by his church superiors from returning to his diocese. The case of Bishop Elko, who describes his situation as 'exile', casts fascinating light on Catholicism's current internal stresses...". Three years later, the Vatican sent Elko back to the U.S., but not to his Byzantine Church.
Transition: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati
In 1970 Archbishop Elko started anew as Auxiliary Archbishop in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati (the first and only Eastern Rite Bishop to serve as Auxiliary of a Latin Rite Diocese in the U.S.). He served in this capacity for fourteen years, and upon reaching his seventy-fifth birthday, retired.
He wrote an historical novel at this time, which was published posthumously in 1994. White Heat Over Red Fire features Thomas Christophe, a young Eastern Rite Catholic Bishop ministering in post-war Austria. The novel makes much of the intrigues of the Cold War years, the struggles of the Church in Eastern Europe, the attempts to reconcile the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the upheaval within the Catholic Church in the wake of Vatican II.
Elko died of cancer on May 18, 1991, aged 81.
He is interred in the Priest's Circle at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Montgomery, Ohio.

I had the honor to be Archbishop Elko's assistant for 3 years. He was a true son of Mary and loved our Lord and lived the life. In the last 2 years I was with him, we created a mission project entitled: "ROSARIES AROUND THE WORLD". We shipped to over 40 countries and a total of over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Scapulars. They went from St. Mother Teresa to Fr. Malachy Brogan, OFM. He wrote me once saying: "Jim, the Rosaries you sent are now found in the hands of the praying, the dying and the dead." This was funded in total by the good Archbishop's brother and blessed by Archbishop Elko and St. Pope John Paul II.

Judson Moss Bemis House, also known as Hearthstone Inn, is a historic Queen Anne house in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Judson Moss Bemis family
Judson Moss Bemis and his wife, Alice Cogswell Bemis, moved to Colorado Springs in 1881 for her health. She may have had tuberculosis. (See Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs).
The house was built in 1885 and became the permanent home of Alice Bemis and their daughter, Alice; Judson Moss Bemis lived in the home several months a year and conducted business and lived the rest of the year in Boston. He was the founder of J. M. Bemis Company.
In Colorado Springs, Bemis founded the Business Administration and Banking School, was a trustee of Colorado College and donated monies for the Jackson and Bemis Halls. Alice Cogswell Bemis founded the Day Care Center in 1897. The couple's daughter, Alice Bemis Taylor, donated monies to Colorado College, helped fund the construction of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and the Colorado Springs Day Nursery, and provided scholarships. She was the first woman trustee of Colorado College, founded the Bemis-Taylor Child Guidance Clinic, and in 2010 was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.
The house
The Bemis House, designed by W. F. Ellis, is a blend of architectural styles, including Queen Anne, Colonial Revival and Stick architectural styles. The three story home originally had 10 rooms and a partial basement, and received additions in 1886 and 1887. In 1935, the home was converted into an apartment house with 10 apartments based upon designs by architects MacLaren and Thomas.
Hearthstone Inn
Dot Williams and Ruth Williams purchased the Bemis House and the neighboring historic home to create Hearthstone Inn. The second house was built in 1900. For a period of time it was a boarding house for individuals with tuberculosis. The buildings were restored and renovated as an inn with a restaurant and 25 rooms. The architects for the project were Al Feinstein of Colorado Springs and William Odum of Dallas. The inn and its antiques were purchased by David and Nancy Oxenhandler in 1999 for $1,925,000. In 2005 it was sold to Griffis/ Blessing Investment Services.

In geometry and topology, it is a usual axiom of a manifold to be a Hausdorff space. In general topology, this axiom is relaxed, and one studies non-Hausdorff manifolds: spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space, but not necessarily Hausdorff.
Examples
Line with two origins
The most familiar non-Hausdorff manifold is the line with two origins, or bug-eyed line.
This is the quotient space of two copies of the real line
with the equivalence relation
This space has a single point for each nonzero real number and two points and A local base of open neighborhoods of in this space can be thought to consist of sets of the form
where is any positive real number. A similar description of a local base of open neighborhoods of is possible. Thus, in this space all neighbourhoods of intersect all neighbourhoods of so it is non-Hausdorff.
Further, the line with two origins does not have the homotopy type of CW-complex, or of any Hausdorff space.
Branching line
Similar to the line with two origins is the branching line.
This is the quotient space of two copies of the real line
with the equivalence relation
This space has a single point for each negative real number and two points for every non-negative number: it has a "fork" at zero.
Etale space
The etale space of a sheaf, such as the sheaf of continuous real functions over a manifold, is a manifold that is often non-Hausdorff. (The etale space is Hausdorff if it is a sheaf of functions with some sort of analytic continuation property.)

Rear Admiral Ronald Frank Marryott (February 18, 1934 – June 4, 2005) was the Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy from 1986 to 1988. He served as president and CEO of the George C. Marshall Foundation, and president and CEO of the Naval Academy Alumni Association from 1996 to 2000. He also was President of the Naval War College from 1985 to 1986.
Early career
After graduating from the Academy in 1957 Marryott was designated a Naval Aviator. He flew patrol and surveillance operations in P-2V and P-3 aircraft over both the Atlantic and the Pacific and participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis blockade, he also served as Project Mercury recovery officer for the first three manned spaceflights. In the mid-1960s at the academy, he taught naval history and the history of U.S. foreign policy, American government and politics, and international relations. Marryott saw duty in Vietnam and flew numerous Cold War missions. He went on to command Patrol Squadron 9 from 1973 to 1974 and the Naval Air Station, Moffett Field, California. He served as a Navy aviator and commanded the Iceland Defense Force. He also served seven tours in the Pentagon and was President of the Naval War College from 1985 to 1986.
Superintendent
One of his greatest challenges as the academy's superintendent was to stanch the dropout rate for female midshipmen. He appointed a task force to examine the reasons for the high attrition rate in the 1980s, where he found that much of the problem was female recruits often lacked strong backgrounds in sciences or athletics, two staples of life at the academy. Once recruiters started looking for women who were strong in these areas, as were their male counterparts, the attrition rate dropped.

Later life
Marryott retired from active duty in 1990 and served as president and chief executive officer of the George C. Marshall Foundation before returning to Annapolis as president and chief executive officer of the academy's alumni association. He retired from the association in 2000, but remained active and served as co-chairman of the Class of '57 fundraising efforts.
He was honored in 2004 as a Naval Academy Distinguished Graduate, he was a member of the class of 1957. He died on June 4, 2005 of complications from leukemia at the age of 71. Marryott was buried with full military honors at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery.

The 1910 Tie Cup Final was the final match to decide the winner of the Tie Cup, the 11th. edition of the international competition organised by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations together. The final was contested by Argentine C.A. Estudiantes and Uruguayan CURCC. This would be the last Tie Cup played by the CURCC before the club dissolved in 1915.
In the match, played at Estadio G.E.B.A. in Belgrano, both teams tied 2–2 so a playoff needed to be played to determine a winner. Nevertheless, the rematch was never scheduled so the trophy was declared desert in 1911.
Qualified teams
Overview
Estudiantes earned its place in the final after having won the 1910 Copa de Competencia Jockey Club, where the squad beat Argentino de Rosario (1–0 in Palermo), Newell's Old Boys (3–3, 4–3 in Palermo and Rosario respectively), and Gimnasia y Esgrima in the final (3–1 at Ferro C. Oeste). The match was held in Gimnasia y Esgrima Stadium in Palermo (that had been completely refurbished for the Copa Centenario Revolución de Mayo) on 7 August 1910.
Estudiantes took advantage with only 5 seconds played, when forward Maximiliano Susán scored the first goal. The same player scorded again on 5', to put Estudiantes 2–0 over CURCC. Nevertheless, the visitor team (goal by Zibecchi) scored for the 2–1. In the second half, CURCC forced the draw on 12' after a free kick by Zibecchi.
As a strong rain fell during the match, referee Héctor Alfano agreed with both captains to suspend the game on 61 minutes. With the 2–2 result, a playoff was scheduled for August 21 to determine a champion. However, the break up between both associations, AFA and AUF, after the 1910 Copa Lipton match held on August 15 caused the playoff was not carried out. In April 1911 the Cup was officially declared desert with no champion crowned.

Plinian eruptions or Vesuvian eruptions are volcanic eruptions marked by their similarity to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which destroyed the ancient Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The eruption was described in a letter written by Pliny the Younger, after the death of his uncle Pliny the Elder.
Plinian/Vesuvian eruptions are marked by columns of volcanic debris and hot gases ejected high into the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth's atmosphere. The key characteristics are ejection of large amount of pumice and very powerful continuous gas-driven eruptions. According to the Volcanic Explosivity Index, Plinian eruptions have a VEI of 4, 5 or 6, sub-Plinian 3 or 4, and ultra-Plinian 6, 7 or 8.
Short eruptions can end in less than a day, but longer events can continue for several days or months. The longer eruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, sometimes with pyroclastic surges. The amount of magma erupted can be so large that it depletes the magma chamber below, causing the top of the volcano to collapse, resulting in a caldera. Fine ash and pulverized pumice can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions are often accompanied by loud noises, such as those generated by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. The sudden discharge of electrical charges accumulated in the air around the ascending column of volcanic ashes also often causes lightning strikes as depicted by the English geologist George Julius Poulett Scrope in his painting of 1822 or observed during 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami.
The lava is usually dacitic or rhyolitic, rich in silica. Basaltic, low-silica lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions; is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera on New Zealand's North Island.
Pliny's description
Pliny described his uncle's involvement from the first observation of the eruption:
Pliny the Elder set out to rescue the victims from their perilous position on the shore of the Bay of Naples, and launched his galleys, crossing the bay to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny the Younger provided an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano. His body was found interred under the ashes of the eruption with no apparent injuries on 26 August, after the plume had dispersed, confirming asphyxiation or poisoning.

Ultra-Plinian
According to the Volcanic Explosivity Index, a VEI of 6 to 8 is classified as "ultra-Plinian". Eruptions of this type are defined by ash plumes over high and a volume of erupted material to in size. Eruptions in the ultra-Plinian category include the Lava Creek eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera (c. 640,000 years ago, VEI 8), Lake Toba (c. 74,000 years ago, VEI 8), Tambora (1815, VEI 7), Krakatoa (1883, VEI 6), Akahoya eruption of Kikai Caldera, Japan (VEI 7) and the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines (VEI 6). The largest known VEI 8 is the Fish Canyon eruption of the La Garita Caldera in Colorado c. 27,800,000 years ago with of ejecta.

Charles Claude Jacquinot (3 August 1772 – 24 April 1848) commanded a French cavalry division at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. He joined a volunteer battalion in 1791 and transferred to a light cavalry regiment as a junior officer in 1793. He earned promotion to squadron commander and was acting commander of his regiment at Hohenlinden in 1800. After serving in a staff position at Austerlitz in 1805, he LED a light cavalry regiment at Jena in 1806. Promoted to general of brigade he led his horsemen at Abensberg, Raab and Wagram in 1809. During the French invasion of Russia he fought at Ostrovno, Smolensk and Borodino in 1812. During the 1813 German Campaign he led a cavalry brigade at Dennewitz and Leipzig. After being appointed general of division he fought at Second Bar-sur-Aube and
Saint-Dizier in 1814. During the Hundred Days he rallied to Napoleon and LED a light cavalry division in the Waterloo campaign. After 15 years of inactivity, he was restored to favor in the 1830s. Thereafter he held a number of commands and was appointed to the Chamber of Peers. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 20.
Revolution
Jacquinot was born in Melun on 3 August 1772. After attending military school at Pont-à-Mousson he joined the 1st Battalion of Meurthe Volunteers as a lieutenant in 1791. He transferred to the 1st Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment as a sous-lieutenant in 1793. Two years later he was appointed aide-de-camp to Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville as a lieutenant. During the War of the First Coalition, the 1st Chasseurs fought at the battles of Arlon in 1793, Fleurus in 1794, Altenkirchen in 1796 and Neuwied in 1797. During the War of the Second Coalition the regiment fought at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach in 1799.
During the 1800 campaign, Jacquinot received a battlefield promotion from captain to major after an action at Erbach an der Donau. He was wounded at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 while acting commander of the regiment in the absence of Colonel Louis-Pierre Montbrun. At Hohenlinden the 610-strong 1st Chasseurs served in Antoine Richepanse's division. The regiment fought at the front of Richepanse's decisive attack on the rear of the main Austrian column. Subsequently he led the 1st Chasseurs in clashes at Schwanenstadt and Vöcklabruck on 18 December. At Schwanenstadt, the French captured 700 Austrian cavalrymen and at Vöcklabruck they made prisoners of General Franz von Löpper, two cannons and most of two battalions of infantry. Subsequently, Jacquinot transferred to the 5th Chasseurs à Cheval.
Empire
1805–1809
At the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, Jacquinot served as an aide-de-camp to Géraud Duroc who led a formation of grenadiers. He became colonel on 13 January 1806, taking command of the 11th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment. He led his regiment at the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806 and was wounded by several saber cuts. At Jena, the 11th Chasseurs were in Pierre Margaron's light cavalry brigade of the IV Corps under Marshal of France Jean-de-Dieu Soult. He was raised to the dignity of Baron of the Empire on 26 October 1808.
Jacquinot received promotion to general of brigade on 10 March 1809. He received command of a brigade of cavalry in Montbrun's light cavalry division in the III Corps of Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout. On 16 April he had 1,797 troopers under his command in the 1st, 2nd and 12th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments. On 20 April, Napoleon formed for Marshal Jean Lannes a provisional corps made up of Jacquinot's detached brigade, two III Corps infantry divisions and two cuirassier divisions. In the Battle of Abensberg Lannes' corps drove the Austrian left wing back and inflicted losses of 2,700 killed and wounded and 4,000 captured on their foes. Jacquinot's brigade fought at the Battle of Raab on 14 June under Montbrun's command. On this occasion, it included the 7th Hussars in place of the 12th Chasseurs. During the battle, the divisions of Montbrun and Emmanuel Grouchy routed the Austrian left flank cavalry. Still in Montbrun's division, Jacquinot led his 1,219-strong brigade at the Battle of Wagram on 5–6 July where it formed part of the right wing cavalry under the orders of Davout. On the second day, Davout's cavalry gained the upper hand despite the intervention of the Austrian reserve cavalry personally led by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen.
1812–1814
During the 1812 French invasion of Russia Jacquinot led a brigade composed of the 7th Hussar and 9th Chevau-léger Lancer Regiments. The 3rd Light Cavalry Brigade was part of Jean Pierre Joseph Bruyère's 1st Light Cavalry Division in Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's I Cavalry Corps. During the campaign, he led his brigade at the battles of Ostrovno, Vitebsk, Smolensk and Borodino. Near Mozhaysk his brigade fought off Matvei Platov's Don Cossacks.
Jacquinot was wounded while leading a charge against a Swedish battalion at the Battle of Dennewitz on 6 September 1813. During the action, he led the 12th Light Cavalry Brigade which was made up of the 5th and 13th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments. The brigade was part of Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's 5th Light Cavalry Division in Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova's III Cavalry Corps. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16–19 October he led the same brigade, to which was added the 10th Chasseurs à Cheval. He was promoted general of division on 26 October 1813.
On the night of 31 December 1813, Russian troops under Emmanuel de Saint-Priest executed a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River and captured Koblenz at 4:00 am on 1 January 1814. The commander of the Russian 17th Infantry Division, Igor Maximovich Pillar sent 200 jägers, 25 Cossacks and one cannon to seize a convoy near Remagen on 2 January. The convoy was intercepted, but the officer directing the column continued marching toward Bonn where he bumped into a large French force under Jacquinot and Joseph Jean-Baptiste Albert. The Russians were routed, losing 120 men and the artillery piece, the first cannon lost by the Army of Silesia. At that date, Jacquinot's heavy cavalry division in the III Cavalry Corps had two weak brigades composed of single-squadron regiments. Marc François Jérôme Wolff's brigade counted 368 officers and men from five dragoon regiments. Jean Charles Quinette de Cernay's brigade numbered 467 troopers from five dragoons and one cuirassier regiments.
By mid-January, the French forces under Marshal Jacques MacDonald, which included III Cavalry Corps, were in full retreat through Namur and headed for an intended rendezvous with Napoleon at Châlons-sur-Marne. After detaching garrisons, MacDonald's command numbered no more than 11,000 men. From Châlons, MacDonald's force was chased to the west by the Army of Silesia. Around this time, Napoleon reorganized his cavalry into four corps plus an independent division and the III Cavalry Corps was suppressed. Jacquinot was placed in command of the two-brigade 4th Light Cavalry Division in the new VI Cavalry Corps under François Étienne de Kellermann. Auguste Jean Ameil's 979-strong 7th Brigade included six regiments of chasseurs à cheval while Wolff's 686-man 8th Brigade comprised three hussars, one chevau-léger lancer and two chasseurs à cheval regiments.
On 25 February 1814, Napoleon decided to leave the pursuit of the Army of Bohemia to his subordinates. The emperor assigned Jacquinot's division and Kellermann's corps to Marshal Nicolas Oudinot while distributing other cavalry units to MacDonald. Jacquinot's division fought at the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 27 February and at the Battle of Saint-Dizier on 26 March. During Napoleon's bid to cut the Allied communications in the last week of March, he sent the light cavalry of Jacquinot and Hippolyte Piré ahead of the army, provoking panic. At Saint-Dizier, Napoleon's cavalry routed Ferdinand von Wintzingerode's 10,000 cavalry, but it proved to be a hollow victory because the Allied generals ignored the threat to their supply line and marched on Paris. The Allies won the Battle of Paris on 30 March 1814 and this event ended the war. By 4 April the 4th Cavalry Division had shrunk badly. Ameil's brigade counted only 331 officers and men while Wolff's brigade numbered only 244.
Later career
During the Waterloo Campaign, Jacquinot commanded the 1st Cavalry Division which was attached to the I Corps of Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon. The 1st Brigade of Adrien François de Bruno consisted of the 3rd Chasseurs à Cheval and 7th Hussar Regiments. The 2nd Brigade of Martin Gobrecht was made up of the 3rd and 4th Chevau-léger Lancer Regiments. During the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 Jacquinot supervised his own and the light cavalry division of Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie. After the British heavy cavalry routed d'Erlon's infantry, the Royal Scots Greys charged through the French grand battery, only to be counterattacked by Jacquinot's lancers and cut to pieces. At Waterloo the Greys lost 102 killed and 97 wounded out of 396 officers and men.
After Waterloo, Jacquinot was placed on the inactive list. Years later he emerged as an inspector general of cavalry. In 1833 he was appointed to command the camp of cuirassiers at Lunéville and the following year he commanded the camp of dragoons. In 1835 he was assigned to lead the 3rd Military Division at Metz. He became a member of the Peerage of France on 3 October 1837; that year he went on the inactive list again. According to the law of 4 August 1839 he was appointed to the second section of the Army General Staff. On 14 April 1844 he received the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur. He died on 25 April 1848 at Metz. JACQUINOT appears on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe.

Eleazar ben Kalir, also known as Eleazar HaKalir, Eleazar ben Killir or Eleazar Kalir (c. 570c. 640) was a Byzantine Jew and a Hebrew poet whose classical liturgical verses, known as piyut, have continued to be sung through the centuries during significant religious services, including those on Tisha B'Av and on the sabbath after a wedding. He was one of Judaism's earliest and most prolific of the paytanim (Hebrew liturgical poets). He wrote piyutim for all the main Jewish festivals, for special Sabbaths, for weekdays of festive character, and for the fasts. Many of his hymns have found their way into festive prayers of the Ashkenazi Jews' synagogal rite.
Biography
Although his poems have had a prominent place in printed ritual and he is known to have lived somewhere in the Near East, documentation regarding details of his life has been lost to history, including the exact year and circumstances of his birth and death. He is said to have been the disciple of another 6th-century composer of piyut, Yannai who, according to a certain legend, grew jealous of Eleazar's superior knowledge and caused his death by inserting into his shoe a scorpion whose sting proved to be fatal. Samuel David Luzzatto, however, dismisses this legend in light of the fact that Yannai's piyutim are still said. Luzzatto argues that if Yannai was a murderer then there is no way Yannai's piyutim would be so popular. Additionally, argues Luzzatto, Rabbi Gershom ben Judah mentions Yannai and uses honorific terms, something Rabbi Gershom would not have done if the legend is true.
In the acrostics of his hymns he usually signs his father's name, Kalir, but three times he writes Killir. In some of them, he adds the name of his city, Kirjath-sepher. Eleazar's name, home (Kirjath-sepher), and time have been the subject of many discussions in modern Jewish literature (Italy, Babylonia, Mesopotamia and Palestine have been claimed by different scholars as his native land), and some legends concerning his career have been handed down.
The Arukh derives the name "Kalir" from the Greek κόλλυρα = "a small cake," and reports that the poet obtained his name from a cake, inscribed with Biblical verses, which was given him to eat as a talisman for wisdom when he began to go to school. His scholarship having been attributed later to that talisman, he was called "Eleazar the Cake." While such a custom is known to have existed among the Jews and the Syriac Christians, others claim that the explanation put forward by the Arukh is not acceptable, since "Kalir" is not the name of the poet, but that of his father. Another interpretation holds that the name was derived from the poet's or his father's hometown: the Italian city Cagliari, Calais, Cologne, Kallirrhoe in Transjordan, or Edessa in Syria (F. Perles). Others see in it the Latin name "Celer" (J. Derenbourg). The city Kirjath-sepher has been identified with the biblical place in the Land of Israel of the same name (W. Heidenheim), with the Babylonian Sippara (Filosseno Luzzatto), and with Cagliari (Civitas Portus), in Italy.
The theory that he lived in Italy is based upon the premise that he wrote double Kerovot for the festivals; although Tosafot and Rosh assert that he did not write any for the second days.
His time has been set at different dates, from the second century, to the tenth or eleventh century. Based on Saadiah's Sefer ha-galuy, some place him in the 6th century. Older authorities consider him to have been a teacher of the Mishnah and identify him either with Eleazar ben Arach or with Eleazar ben Simeon He has been confounded with another poet by the name of Eleazar b. Jacob; and a book by the title of Kevod Adonai was ascribed to him by Moses Botarel.
The earliest references to Kalir seem to be in a responsum of Natronai Gaon (c. 853), in the "Yetzirah" commentary of Saadia Gaon, and in his "Agron", as well as in the writings of Al-Kirkisani.
Modern research points to the probability that he and his teacher were Palestinian Jews; and since Yannai is known to have been one of the halakhic authorities of Anan ben David (the alleged founder of Karaism), and must therefore have lived a considerable time earlier than Anan, Kalir's time may be fixed with some probability as the first half of the 7th century. From a linguistic point of view, it would seem that he lived in the Land of Israel at the end of the sixth century.
Kalir's hymns became an object of study and of Kabbalistic exegesis, as his personality was a mystery. It was related that heavenly fire surrounded him when he wrote the "Ve'hachayos" in Kedushah for Rosh Hashanah; that he himself ascended to heaven and there learned from the angels the secret of writing alphabetical hymns.
A peculiar development of the Kalir legend is seen in the story that Saadia found in Kalir's tomb a recipe for making "kame'ot" in the form of cakes. On a piyut found in Mahzor Vitry and ascribed by Brody to Kalir, see Max Weisz.
Poetic style
The "Kallir style" had a profound influence on the poets who succeeded him in Eretz Yisra'el and in the Near East. He made radical innovations in diction and style, while employing the full range of post-biblical Hebrew. It may be that the stories of Yannai growing jealous of him are based in fact, for the patterns of rhyme, acrostic, repetition, and refrain in his piyut are much more complex than those of his master.
His use of neologisms and other oddities has earned him a reputation as an enigmatic writer, to the point where some have criticized him for being obscure, and having a corruptive influence on the Hebrew language. He was, however, capable of writing in simple and direct language, as poems like his Epithalamium demonstrate.
Solomon Delmedigo warns the student against Kalir's writings because "he has cut up the Hebrew language in an arbitrary way".
Kalir was the first to embellish the entire liturgy with a series of hymns whose essential element was the aggadah. He drew his material from the Talmud, and from midrashic compilations, some of which latter is now probably lost, thus preserving some otherwise forgotten aggadic traditions. Kalir used the early "Hekalot Rabbati" of the Merkabah Riders, and traces of their mystic ideas and even of their language appear in his poetry. His language, however, is not that of his sources, but Biblical Hebrew, enriched with daring innovations. His predilection for rare words, allegorical expressions, and aggadic allusions make his writings hard to understand – some describe him as a "Hebrew version of Robert Browning". His linguistic peculiarities were followed by many a succeeding paytan; and they influenced to some extent even early prose, especially among the Karaites.
With the awakening of linguistic studies among the Jews and with the growing acquaintance of the latter with Arabic, his linguistic peculiarities were severely criticized (e.g., by Abraham ibn Ezra, a criticism which centuries later influenced the maskilim in their disparagement of Kalir); but the structure of his hymns remained a model which was followed for centuries after him and which received the name "Kaliric", (or "Kalliri").
Works
While some of his hymns have been lost, more than 200 of them appear in the Mahzorim. Twenty-odd of the kinot of Tisha B'Av were composed by him too.
Although most of Kalir's work remains unpublished, Shulamit Elizur has published two volumes of his poetry for Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur respectively, and continues to work on his work.
Translations
Translations of some of his hymns into German are found in Zunz, in Sachs's edition of the prayer-book, and in Karpeles' Zionsharfe. Some have been rendered into English by Nina Davis and by Mrs. Henry Lucas. Some renderings of his poems may be found in the volumes of Davis & Adler's edition of the German Festival Prayers entitled Service of the Synagogue, as well as other holiday prayer books of the Ashkenazic rite with translations. Additionally, the works that are recited in the Italian rite were translated into Italian by Rabbi Menachem Emanuel Hartom.
Commemoration
In Tel Aviv, Elazar HaKalir street near city hall is named after him. Likewise, in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Shaarei Chesed, a street is named after him.

The 1968 New York City riot was a disturbance sparked by the assassination of Martin Luther King on April 4, 1968. Harlem, the largest African-American neighborhood in Manhattan was expected to erupt into looting and violence as it had done a year earlier, in which two dozen stores were either burglarized or burned and four people were killed. However, Mayor John Lindsay traveled into the heart of the area and stated that he regretted King's wrongful death which led to the calming of residents. Numerous businesses were still looted and set afire in Harlem and Brooklyn, although these events were not widespread and paled in comparison to the riots in Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Chicago in which federal troops were needed to quell the disorders.
Other instances of unrest
Two unrelated instances of civil unrest would happen in the city during July in the Lower East Side and Coney Island at close to the same time. It is unknown if they both had a connection.
An episode of civil unrest would occur in Coney Island starting on July 19, with African-American and Puerto Rican blocks would explode into rioting. What had caused this is unknown. The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) would be deployed on July 22 to combat the crowd which worked. Mayor Lindsay would tour the area in Coney Island where the riot happened at on July 23 and hold meetings with the locals there. In meetings held with city officials and community members, a promise would be made that the TPF would not harass those who were working as part of anti-poverty programs or "attack the 'community action centers of the people inside them.'"
The riot in the Lower East Side would begin at 9 PM on July 23 after the police attempted to break up a fight between Puerto Ricans and Eastern Europeans at 9th Street and Avenue C but the crowd retaliated and the police were attacked. During that night, four police cars would end up getting destroyed and 13 arrests were made. The next night on July 24, 400 police officers would be deployed and 600 people would show up with the crowds being angry at the conduct of the police. The police would receive gunfire and have bottles thrown at them. Police officers and firefighters would be wounded that night. It would last until July 27 when a police force was withdrawn from the area. Also during July 27, a peace march would be held.

Yablochkov is a ruined lunar impact crater that is located on the northern hemisphere of the Moon's far side. It lies almost due south of the large walled plain Schwarzschild.
Both the rim and interior of this feature have been heavily damaged by subsequent impacts, leaving a formation that is little more than a rugged depression in the surface. The most notable of the overlying impacts is Yablochkov U across the northwest rim. Smaller impacts lie across the northern and southern rim. There is a crater-like depression along the southeast inner wall and the floor is marked by several small craterlets.
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Yablochkov.
