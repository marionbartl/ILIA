Ranking
As of July 2021, Reality Kings has a traffic ranking of 19,245.
Logo
The Reality Kings logo has gone through multiple modifications over the years, and there are various versions of it. A crown features in most, although sometimes it's just the name, and sometimes the name is within the crown, while at other times, the crown is resting on the name.
Controversies
In 2010 Florida A&M University (FAMU) filed a lawsuit against Reality Kings over what is commonly known as the FAMU Sex Tape. The suit alleges that the company tarnished FAMU's reputation due to a video depicting eight performers whom DareDorm described as FAMU students performing sexual acts on each other. The university also sued the performers. Although Reality Kings announced its intention to fight the lawsuit, less than a month later it settled the case and paid FAMU $120,000. Reality Kings apparently has settled with the 26 recording company plaintiffs that sued the porn company over allegedly poaching music from some top recording artists and using it in 193 adult videos. In 2011 Reality Kings filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a woman who claims the company featured their runaway, underage daughter in a porn film. Reality Kings, in its motion to dismiss, said it was fraudulently misled because the daughter misrepresented their age not only to Reality Kings but to various state and federal agencies.

The Pittsburgh Keystones were a semi-professional ice hockey club, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was a member of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, the first league to openly hire hockey players, from 1900–1904. The team played all of its games at the Duquesne Gardens, and was involved in allowing Harry Peel become the first admitted professional hockey player in 1902.
History
The Keystones' history can be traced to the Keystone Bicycle Club, which was organized in 1879. The bicycle club attempted to branch into hockey in 1899 when it applied to be the new member of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, which was expanding from three to four teams. Although the Pittsburgh Bankers were admitted instead, the Keystone club had only to wait another year before the Western University of Pennsylvania withdrew from the league, allowing the Keystones to fill the vacancy. In forming its team the Keystones heavily recruited from Canada, a practice that was soon copied by the other teams in the WPHL.
The Keystone club made an auspicious debut by beating the two-time defending champion Pittsburgh Athletic Club in the opening game of the WPHL's 1900–01 season. Keystone continually strengthened its team during the season but finished second to the PAC, which did not lose another league game on its way to a third consecutive title. Aside from league play, the WPHL teams also played exhibition games against some of the best amateur teams from North America.
During the 1901–02 season, goaltender Riley Hern, a future member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, began their professional career with the Keystones. In their first season, Hern led the league in victories, with nine in 14 games and was named to the WPHL All-Star Team. Joining Hern on the team in 1901 was Arthur Sixsmith who moved to Pittsburgh and turned professional with the Keystones. The Keystones went on to win the 1901–02 WPHL championship title, finally ending the reign of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. However, the Keystones reversed their fortunes in the following season, with a last-place finish and with Hern this time leading the league in losses.
First admitted professional player
In the summer of 1902 Harry Peel, a Keystones player in 1901–02, admitted that they were paid $35 a week to play in the so-called amateur league and so no amateur teams would play against these teams again without being suspended by either Canadian or U.S. officials. According to Peel "[The Keystones] make no bones whatever about paying men. If they do not pay them, they give them fake positions." Peel was later suspended by the Ontario Hockey Association and their appeal was rejected on December 10, 1903 and again on November 30, 1904. However, by the 1902–03 season the WPHL was known as a fully professional league.
Decline
The next season, the Portage Lakes Hockey Club of Houghton, Michigan began a professional league which continued to play professional exhibition game against the WPHL's Pittsburgh Bankers. However the exposure given by playing Portage Lakes raised the profiles of some of the Pittsburgh players, who were lured away after the season for the promise of better pay in Michigan. The team soon raided Pittsburgh's teams for top players like Riley Hern and Bruce Stuart. This led the Keystones to withdraw from the league on January 17, 1904. Their players were then redistributed among the three other WPHL teams.

DeKalb–Peachtree Airport is a county-owned, public-use airport in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The airport is located in the city of Chamblee, just northeast of Atlanta. It is also known commonly as Peachtree–DeKalb Airport, or simply PDK. Other names (rarely used) include Peachtree Airport, DeKalb Airport, or DeKalb County Airport. ASOS weather reports are produced 24 hours per day as "Chamblee". It has airline service with Ultimate Air Shuttle to Cincinnati and Southern Airways Express to Memphis and Destin.
As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 1,784 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 393 enplanements in 2009, and 463 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a reliever airport.
History
The property was originally part of Camp Gordon, a World War I military training camp. That facility closed in 1922. (The Army re-created Camp Gordon during World War II, but built it in Augusta, 150 miles away, and it has since been renamed Fort Gordon.) In 1940, the United States government authorized construction of a military airport on the former site of the Chamblee camp. The airport began operations on March 22, 1941, a few months before the U.S. entry into World War II, as Naval Air Station Atlanta.
Barracks constructed at the facility during the war became classrooms in late 1948 for Southern Technical Institute, a new engineering technology school created by Georgia Tech for former soldiers. Leased from the county by the United States Navy, the airport was converted from military to civilian use from 1957 to 1959.
Naval Air Station Atlanta subsequently moved to Marietta on the south side of what is now called Dobbins Air Reserve Base. NAS Atlanta was ultimately closed by BRAC action in 2009. Like NAS Atlanta, the Southern Technical Institute moved from PDK in 1958, to land donated by Dobbins, and it now operates as Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology, a part of Kennesaw State University.
In 1973, PDK was the site of a Learjet crash, resulting in seven fatalities. It was determined that the crash resulted from "[t]he loss of engine thrust during takeoff due to ingestion of birds by the engines, resulting in loss of control of the airplane." The aircraft struck an apartment building and burned in a complex just south of the airport. Large flocks of birds were attracted to an adjacent DeKalb County landfill (operational in summer 1962 and finally closed in early 1975), which had become a flight safety issue long before the crash, after several minor bird strikes in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Facilities and aircraft
Dekalb–Peachtree Airport covers an area of 745 acres (301 ha) at an elevation of 1,003 feet (306 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways: 3R/21L (formerly 2R/20L) is 6,001 by 100 feet (1,829 x 30 m) with a concrete surface; 3L/21R (formerly 2L/20R) is 3,746 by 150 feet (1,142 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface; and 16/34, which is 3,967 by 150 feet (1,209 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface. It also has one helipad designated H1 with a concrete surface measuring 56 by 56 feet (17 x 17 m).
For the 12-month period ending August 31, 2010, the airport had 202,491 aircraft operations, an average of 554 per day: 99.9% general aviation and 0.1% military. At that time there were 447 aircraft based at this airport: 68% single-engine, 17% multi-engine, 11% jet, and 5% helicopter.
The airport has over 100 hangars. It is the second-busiest airport in Georgia, behind Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), in the number of flight operations per year and is the seventh-busiest general aviation (non-airline) airport in the US. PDK helps to relieve ATL of smaller-aircraft traffic. It is used by helicopters for metro Atlanta's four major network-affiliated television stations (WAGA-TV, WGCL-TV, WSB-TV, and WXIA-TV) as the base for electronic news gathering from the air. PDK is also home to The AutoPILOT Magazine, an advertorial publication covering all things aviation-related. A new control tower was built in 1988, and stands at tall. Many of the old NAS Atlanta buildings still remain. The largest houses offices for PDK administration, flight schools, and the Civil Air Patrol, as well as the Downwind restaurant, with an aviation-themed decor and an open deck overlooking the active runways. Adjacent to that building is a children's playground, Georgia's first aviation park.
In late 2018, the first EMAS installed in Georgia was added to runway 3R/21L.
Epps Aviation, the airport's full service fixed-base operator, is located on in a modern facility, elsewhere on the airport grounds.
Airlines and destinations
Economic impact
In 1997, DeKalb Peachtree Airport was one of the largest tax contributors of DeKalb County, behind The Southern Company and Bellsouth, but receives no taxpayer dollars for operations. The 1997 study funded by the airport found that in addition to 762 aviation-related jobs at the airport, there may be 3,600 non-airport jobs driven by airport activities like taxi drivers and cleaning personnel.
Accidents
On February 26, 1973, a Learjet crashed trying to return to the airport after suffering a bird strike after takeoff. See 1973 DeKalb–Peachtree Airport Learjet crash.

Dominique Alexis Brasseur-Brasseur (14 June 1833 – 17 October 1906) was a Luxembourgian politician and jurist. They served as Mayor of Luxembourg City between 1891 and 1894.
Brasseur was educated at the Athénée, graduating in 1853, before studying law at Heidelberg and Ghent. Receiving their degree on 11 October 1858, they were called to the bar on 17 October 1861. They founded, with Léon Lamort-Pescatore, the Societé des Hauts-Fourneaux de Luxembourg, of which they took full control upon Pescatore's death in 1872. Two years later, Brasseur moved into a large house on rue du St-Esprit, where they would live for the rest of their life and where they would eventually die.
Brasseur was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1866, representing the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette. They would represent Esch until 1890, whereupon they began representing Luxembourg City, which they continued to do until their retirement from politics in 1899. They immediately made an impression, joining the attack on the government of Victor de Tornaco on 13 November 1867 for the military reforms post- the Treaty of London: an attack that would lead to the conservative government's downfall.
Due in part to Brasseur's role in the downfall of Tornaco's government, the new Prime Minister, Emmanuel Servais, appointed Brasseur as a member of the nine-man committee responsible for reorganising the armed forces. They were simultaneously also a member of the committee charged with reviewing the Constitution, which led to the adoption of the current constitution in 1868. Brasseur was also committed to the issue of railways and argued, along with Norbert Metz and Charles Simonis, against the formation of a National Bank. They are, as would their entire family be, a steadfast supporter of secularism and anti-clericalism.
Brasseur entered the communal council of Luxembourg City in 1890, and was named Mayor on 27 January 1891. They held the office until their replacement by Émile Mousel on 24 February 1894.
Dominique was a member of the prominent Brasseur family. Dominique's son, Robert, would later become a deputy and found the Liberal League; another son, Alexis, became a composer. Their brother, Pierre, was a mining industrialist. Pierre's son, and Dominique's nephew, Xavier, was a Socialist deputy and member of Luxembourg City's council. Their double-barrelled surname is on account of having married their half-niece, Constance Brasseur (by their father's first marriage), whom they wed on 9 February 1860 in Liège.

The 503d Air Defense Group is an inactive United States Air Force organization. Its last assignment was with the 25th Air Division of Air Defense Command at Portland International Airport, Oregon. It was inactivated on 18 August 1955.
The group was originally activated as a support group at the end of World War II and provided logistics and administrative support for the 86th Fighter Group in Germany until 1946, when the group returned to the United States, where it supported the 56th Fighter Group. It was discontinued when the USAF reorganized its combat and support units on its bases into a single wing.
The group was activated once again in 1953, when ADC established it as the headquarters for two dispersed fighter-interceptor squadrons and the medical, maintenance, and administrative squadrons supporting them. It was replaced in 1955 when ADC transferred its mission, equipment, and personnel to the 337th Fighter Group in a project that replaced air defense groups commanding fighter squadrons with fighter groups with distinguished records during World War II.
History
World War II
The group was activated as the 503d Air Service Group toward the end of World War II, shortly after V-E Day in a reorganization of Army Air Forces (AAF) support groups in which the AAF replaced service groups that included personnel from other branches of the Army and supported two combat groups with air service groups including only Air Corps units, designed to support a single combat group. Its 921st Air Engineering Squadron provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the combat group, its 745th Air Material Squadron handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters & Base Services Squadron provided other support. it supported the 86th Fighter Group, as part of the occupation forces in Germany until 1946. The group returned to the US and supported the 56th Fighter Group at Selfridge Field, Michigan In October 1946, the group deployed a detachment to Ladd Field, Alaska for arctic training. In 1947 the group and its squadrons were inactivated and replaced by the 56th Airdrome Group, 56th Maintenance & Supply Group, and 56th Station Medical Group as the Air Force began a service test of the Wing/Base organization, which was adopted to unify control at air bases. The 503d Group was disbanded in 1948.
Cold War
During the Cold War The group was reconstituted, redesignated as the 503d Air Defense Group, and activated at Portland International Airport on 18 February 1953, with the mission to train and maintain interceptor squadrons in state of readiness in order to defend Northwest United States. The 357th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was already stationed at Portland and Flying North American F-86 Sabres was assigned as the operational component of the group. The group replaced the 89th Air Base Squadron as host organization for active duty USAF units at Portland. It was assigned three squadrons to perform its support responsibilities.
Two days later, the 497th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying Lockheed F-94 Starfire aircraft equipped with airborne intercept radar and armed with 20 mm cannons, was activated as the group's permanent operational squadron. In May 1953, the 357th Squadron was transferred to French Morocco and was reassigned. In 1954, the 497th converted to Northrop F-89 Scorpion aircraft armed with Mighty Mouse rockets. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 337th Fighter Group (Defense) in 1955 as part of ADC's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars. The group was disbanded once again in 1984, but reconstituted in 1985 as a base support organization. It has not been active since.

London United Investments PLC (LUIS) was a Lloyd's insurance underwriter based in London, United Kingdom. The company collapsed in 1990 in what was at the time the largest bankruptcy of an insurance company. London United Investments was a major player in the US casualty insurance market.
Background
At the time of its collapse, London United Investments was the biggest insurer for US liability risks. The company is thought to have faulted under pressure from mounting claims in the US market, which resulted in the then biggest insurance failure.
LUIS's main insurance subsidiary, Walbrook, was stopped from trading by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) due to lack of funding in March 1990. Coopers & Lybrand were appointed as administrators. A joint investigation by the DTI and the Serious Fraud Office focussed on commission payments between Walbrook and HS Weavers, an underwriting agency that is also part of the LUIS group.
Investigations by the DTI found that between 1970 and 1989 around GBP 40 Million were wrongfully diverted to accounts in Liechtenstein and other locations and there were indications of some benefits derived by named individuals, but the investigations were inconclusive and no charges were brought. The report, however, resulted in debates amongst LUIS reinsurers.
The failure of LUIS caused some controversy in the UK as the source of the collapse was thought to be the US business which was underwritten in London and with subsequent claims on the UK Policyholder Protection Act, which the US businesses had not funded.

Piletas is a barrio in the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico. Its population in 2010 was 5,671.
History
Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Piletas barrio was 2,455.
Places
In 2017, as Puerto Rico and Lares continued to struggle economically, community leaders decided that unused public schools, including one in Piletas Arce (on Puerto Rico Highway 129), would be used by the agricultural industry of Lares. The school became a community center for local farmers.
La Piramide de Piletas Restaurant, located in Sector Las Lajas, was featured by the Puerto Rico Department of Tourism Discover Puerto Rico campaign.
Sectors
Barrios (which are roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others.
The following sectors are in Piletas barrio:

Mario! Lanza At Their Best is a CD released by RCA Victor in 1995, and consists of two original albums recorded by tenor Mario Lanza. These are: the Neapolitan songs album Mario!, recorded in December 1958, and The Vagabond King, recorded in July 1959. The Mario! album has been singled out for special praise, with its star conductor Franco Ferrara of Rome's Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia later hailing Lanza's singing on the disc as "vocally extraordinary...a Caruso-type voice." Lanza's first studio album in stereo, the Mario! selections include the Neapolitan songs "Voce 'e Notte," "Canta Pe' Me," "'Na Sera 'e Maggio," and "Passione." The arrangements were created by Carlo Savina and Ennio Morricone.
The Vagabond King, an operetta by Rudolf Friml, was recorded three months before Mario Lanza's death in October 1959. The selections include "Love Me Tonight," "Nocturne," "Only a Rose," and the "Drinking Song." Lanza is accompanied on several songs by the soprano Judith Raskin, who recorded their contributions a year later in New York. The conductor was Constantine Callinicos.
Note: In February 2006, this album was reissued by RCA in the sonically superior SACD format. This new CD can be played on both SACD players and conventional CD players.

Billardiera fusiformis (Australian bluebell) is a species of plant in the family, Pittosporaceae, which is endemic to Western Australia.
Description
B. fusiformis is a sturdy climber, which flowers from November to February with blue, white or pink flowers. It is found in coastal areas, and disturbed areas.
It is a long-lived climbing plant which is rarely bushy in habit. New stems are greenish in colour and densely hairy, while older stems are reddish brown. The long leaves are almost stalkless, have entire margins and are softly hairy. The nodding blue flowers occur in small clusters at the branch tips. These flowers have five petals and five yellowish stamens which are pressed to each other. The cylindrical fruit are narrowed towards each end, making the shape of a spindle (fusiform), and are dark green or purplish.
B. fusiformis can be distinguished from B. heterophylla by:
its climbing or twining habit (it is rarely shrubby) and its relatively narrow adult leaves which are entire and almost stalkless. Its flower sepals are all about the same size and the anthers are noticeably longer than their filaments, and its somewhat spindle-shaped (i.e. fusiform) fruit; whereas
B. heterophylla generally has a shrubby habit with some climbing stems, and relatively broad adult leaves which are finely toothed and borne on short stalks. Its flower sepals are of different sizes and the anthers are about the same length as their filaments. and the fruit are cylindrical in shape.
Distribution and habitat
In Western Australia, it is found in the IBRA regions: Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain, Warren.
Weed status
The species has been cultivated as a garden plant, and has now become a significant weed in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and the ACT. It invades woodlands, forests, shrublands, and grasslands, smothering ground flora and small shrubs, with large numbers of seedlings emerging in already infested areas, following fires. The seed is also spread by small native mammals (potoroos, quokkas, bush rats) eating the fruits, with the seed becoming more viable after ingestion.
Taxonomy
B. fusiformis was first described by Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière in 1805. Cayzer et al. (2004), being unable to locate the type specimen, designated the lectotype as being the illustration (tab. 90) given in "Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen".
Etymology
The genus name, Billardiera, honours the French botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière who was the first to describe so many Australian plants.
The specific epithet is derived from the Latin: fusiformis, -e: shaped like a spindle, that is, swollen in the middle and tapering at each end, and refers to the shape of the fruits.

Kenneth Thomas Jones (born 16 September 1948) is an English drummer best known for their work in the groups Small Faces, Faces, and the Who. Jones was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Small Faces/Faces.
Biography
Early life
Jones was born in Whitechapel, London, England.
Small Faces to the Faces
Having previously been in a band with Ronnie Lane, Jones was one of the founding members of the English rock group Small Faces. Active from 1965 to 1969, Small Faces were part of the Mod trend of the 1960s. Their hits included "All or Nothing", "Sha-La-La-La-Lee", "Itchycoo Park" and "Tin Soldier".
In 2007, Small Faces were honoured by Westminster Council with a commemorative plaque placed at what was Don Arden's offices in Carnaby Street, the band's "spiritual home". Jones themselves unveiled the plaque. In a BBC interview, Jones said: "To honour the Small Faces after all these years is a terrific achievement. I only wish that Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and Don Arden were here to enjoy this moment with me". Since the death of Jimmy Winston in September 2020, Jones and Rick Wills are the sole surviving members of the Small Faces.
In 2004 The Observer listed the Small Faces' 1968 release Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake one of the "top British albums of all time".
After the departure of lead singer/guitarist Steve Marriott in 1969, the group recruited singer Rod Stewart and guitarist Ronnie Wood to replace Marriott. Both were formerly from the Jeff Beck Group. The band changed its name to the Faces, as the original name was associated with the small stature of its members, and Stewart and Wood did not fit the description. Jones remained with the band until its dissolution in late 1975, recording four studio albums and a live album with them.
The Who
In November 1978, Jones was invited by guitarist Pete Townshend and manager Bill Curbishley to join The Who, replacing their original drummer Keith Moon, who had died of a drug overdose in September. They were invited, in part, because the band had been friendly with them from their days with the Small Faces (he and Moon were friends and were together on the last night of Moon's life in 1978, as part of the viewing party put together by Paul McCartney for The Buddy Holly Story), and because they had played with Townshend, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle on the Tommy soundtrack. They played on the albums Face Dances and It's Hard and also played on the soundtrack for Daltrey's film McVicar, as well as on the band's tours from 1979 to 1982. Jones played with the band at Live Aid in 1985. Jones' final appearance as a regular member of the Who was when the group received a lifetime achievement award at the 1988 British Phonographic Industry awards ceremony. They were frequently at odds with Daltrey, who felt that Jones' drumming style was not right for the band (Jones's playing was usually straighter and less frenetic than Moon's), but Daltrey has denied having anything personal against Jones or their drumming. Jones was replaced by Simon Phillips for the Who's 1989 reunion tour. In an April 2011 special edition of Uncut magazine, Townshend said that Jones was a good choice for the band.
Kenney Jones reunited with The Who on 14 June 2014 at the Rock n Horsepower benefit concert held at their Hurtwood Polo Club. The band performed for an event set up by Jones to benefit Prostate Cancer UK, an organization that promotes awareness of the disease that Jones has. It was the first time that they had appeared onstage with Townshend and Daltrey since 1988. Sharing the bill were contemporaries such as Jeff Beck, Procol Harum and Mike Rutherford.
The Law
Jones formed partnerships with former Free, Bad Company, and The Firm singer Paul Rodgers in the early 1990s, forming a band called The Law.
The Jones Gang
In 2001, Jones formed a new band; over several months, the line-up solidified to include Rick Wills and Robert Hart. In 2005, The Jones Gang released their debut album, Any Day Now.
Guest appearances
Jones has been featured on recordings as a guest drummer on many recording sessions, including appearances on albums by Rod Stewart, The Rolling Stones, Ronnie Wood, Roger Daltrey, Andy Fairweather-Low, Joan Armatrading, Keith Moon, Marsha Hunt, Mike Batt, Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, David Essex, John Lodge and Wings. They were also on a Top of the Pops performance with Status Quo, performing their 1986 hit single, "Red Sky".
Outside music
Outside of music, Jones is a fan of polo. They have become an accomplished polo player and is the owner of Hurtwood Park Polo Club, in Ewhurst, Surrey.
On behalf of Small Faces and in memory of their late colleagues Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, Jones established a children's charity, the Small Faces Charitable Trust, in 1999.
Jones is a supporter of the Conservative Party, and recorded a song called "Mr Brown" written by Robert Hart, criticising the tax policies of the then Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown. They have also performed in support of the Countryside Alliance.
Jones' memoir, Let the Good Times Roll: My Life in Small Faces, Faces, and The Who, was released in September 2018 ().
Personal life
Jones has six children.  They are married to the former model Jayne Andrew, the mother of four of their children. They were previously married to former singer Jan, sister of Gary Osborne. In September 2013 they were diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which they were treated with brachytherapy.
Jones stated that they "virtually taught" Zak Starkey, son of Ringo Starr, how to play drums. Jones was close friends with Starkey's parents. After replacing Moon in The Who, Jones gave Starkey one of Moon's old drum kits. In 1996, Starkey would become The Who's touring drummer.

The Hugo Award for Best Short Story is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The short story award is available for works of fiction of fewer than 7,500 words; awards are also given out for pieces of longer lengths in the novelette, novella, and novel categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".
The Hugo Award for Best Short Story has been awarded annually since 1955, except in 1957. The award was titled "Best Short Fiction" rather than "Best Short Story" in 1960–1966. During this time no Novelette category was awarded and the Novella category had not yet been established; the award was defined only as a work "of less than novel length" that was not published as a stand-alone book. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for short stories for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.
During the 75 nomination years, 211 authors have had works nominated; 58 of these have won, including co-authors and Retro Hugos. Harlan Ellison has received the most Hugos for Best Short Story at four, Arthur C. Clarke, Larry Niven, Mike Resnick, Michael Swanwick, and Connie Willis have each won three times, and Poul Anderson, Joe Haldeman, and Ken Liu have won twice, the only other authors to win more than once. Resnick has received the most nominations at 18, while Swanwick has received 14; no other author has gotten more than 7. Michael A. Burstein, with 7, has the highest number of nominations without winning.
Selection
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The short stories on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up stories, but since 1959 all six candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and are held in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote "no award", if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that "no award" takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in the Best Short Story category in 2015.
Winners and nominees
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the short story was first published. Each year links to the corresponding "year in literature" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.

+ No winner selected
Retro Hugos
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of "Retro Hugos", in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year, if no awards were originally given that year. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

Reception
Lisa D. Horowitz, writing for Variety said, "Director-scripter Richard Friedenberg has fashioned a straightforward tale that doesn't pull any punches. He's a better writer than helmer, crafting some fine dialogue. But he's blessed with an excellent cast, led by the reliably understated Hutton". Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News wrote, "Showtime doesn't make a lot of movies worth watching, but Mr. and Mrs. Loving is an exception."
Accolades
Accuracy
According to Mildred Loving, "not much of it was very true. The only part of it right was I had three children."

"Steal My Girl" is a song written and recorded by English-Irish boy band One Direction. It is the lead single from their fourth studio album Four (2014). It was released worldwide on 29 September 2014. The single was written by band members Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne and regular collaborators Jonathan Cain, Wayne Hector, John Ryan, Ed Drewett and Julian Bunetta (the four had previously written "Best Song Ever"). It was produced by Julian Bunetta, John Ryan and Pär Westerlund. They also performed this song for the first time on their fourth concert tour, the On the Road Again Tour.
Background and release
The announcement was first made on band member Liam Payne's Twitter on 14 September. The single became available worldwide on 29 September, except in the United Kingdom. The song was made available in the United Kingdom on 12 October, with Payne's remix of the recording (dubbed as the Big Payno and Afterhrs Pool Party Remix) being the B-side. The song's co-writer Louis Tomlinson stated the song is a "feel good song and it's not too far away from the last album (Midnight Memories)." On 28 September, one day prior to the official release, the song was leaked on the internet.
Composition and lyrics
The song's piano piece of the instrumental was similar to Journey's "Faithfully". A reviewer felt the song sounded reminiscent of 1980s music, something that the band emphasized on their previous studio album. The lyrics fret over the potential for rivals to take the group's girlfriends away from them, and why they matter to them.
Critical reception
The song received acclaim from music critics. Lucas Villa of AXS praised One Direction's classic rock sound of "Steal My Girl", noting similarities to Journey's "Faithfully". They wrote that "the guys have been digging in their parents' record collections" and added "[it's] a pretty neat and new direction for the band." Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly suggests that the song is "dad-friendly", emphasizing on the classic rock sound. Billboard gave the song four and a half out of five stars, stating it "represents the group's most tremendous Van Halen impression yet." Jim Farber from the Daily News reviews the single as a throwback to the 1970s/80s due to the arena rock ballad.
Jim Farber, writing for the New York Daily News, wrote that the song "boasts a sumptuous production and a chorus guaranteed to make young girls around the world swoon" while adding that it "boasts a melody that sounds like it could have come off a '70s or '80s arena-rock ballad by Journey or Foreigner. The warmly synthesized arrangement also echos the style of that particular era of homogenized pop". Christina Lee of Idolator commented that "the song is clearly a hit" as it "morphs into a soaring stadium pop anthem with hard-hitting drum machine beats, glassy piano chords and that playground chant of a hook". Mikael Wood of The Baltimore Sun commented that "One Direction is going dad rock" and that the song is a "journey to the '80s".
Upon the release of "Steal My Girl", Hayley Williams and Chad Gilbert pointed the similarities between the song and New Found Glory's "It's Not Your Fault".
Chart performance
"Steal My Girl" ranked number three on the UK Singles Chart, the eighth song from the group to have peaked top-three in the UK Singles Chart. "Steal My Girl" reached number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
Music video
The accompanying music video was directed by Ben and Gabe Turner. The clip featured appearances from Danny DeVito, a juvenile chimpanzee, sumo wrestlers Yamamotoyama Ryūta and Ulambayaryn Byambajav, acrobats and a marching band. Also in the video appears Julie Zetlin, a retired rhythmic gymnast from the United States wearing a leotard previous worn by Belarusian rhythmic gymnast Inna Zhukova.
In the music video, DeVito meets up with the group in the middle of the desert where a video shoot is being set up. DeVito is serving as their visionary director. They dub each of the members of the group a different expression: Harry is love, Niall is light, Liam is power, Louis is danger, and Zayn is mystery. From there, the song starts with Liam smashing a row of silver balls that spell "inhibitions" and Zayn is seen with two sumo wrestlers. Niall is seen to be dancing with a Maasai tribe from Tanzania, and Liam is seen as a leader of a marching band. Harry is seen surrounded by masked female ballet dancers, and Louis is seen with the chimpanzee, as well as a lion, a flock of sheep and flamingos. DeVito appears with the group throughout the video. In the end, a rain effect is used on the lot, where the group, DeVito, and all other acts appear together in one shot resembling a mix of Cirque du Soleil and Coachella.

Twister is a game of physical skill produced by Milton Bradley Company and Winning Moves Games USA. It is played on a large plastic mat that is spread on the floor or ground. The mat has six rows of large colored circles on it with a different color in each row: red, yellow, green, and blue. A spinner tells players where they have to place their hand or foot. The game promotes itself as "the game that ties you up in knots".
Gameplay
A spinner is attached to a square board and is used to determine where the player has to put their hand or foot. The spinner is divided into four labeled sections: left foot, right foot, left hand, and right hand. Each of those four sections are divided into the four colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). After spinning, the combination is called (for example: "right hand yellow") and players must move their matching hand or foot to a circle of the correct color.
In a two-player game, no two people can have a hand or foot on the same circle; the rules are different for more players. Owing to the scarcity of colored circles, players will often be required to put themselves in unlikely or precarious positions, eventually causing someone to fall. A person is eliminated when they fall or when their elbow or knee touches the mat.
History and analysis
In 1964, Reyn Guyer Sr. owned and managed a design company which made in-store displays for Fortune 500 companies.
Charles Foley was a respected and successful toy designer for Lakeside Industries in Minneapolis and answered an ad for an experienced toy designer by Reynolds Guyer Sr. of Guyer Company. Foley interviewed with Reyn Guyer Sr. and their son, Reyn, who were interested in product development within the toy business. After interviewing Foley, Guyer and their son discussed the possibility of starting a small division of the company in product development. Their father agreed, for a short term, to support their son's idea for product development, and hired Foley, who negotiated a royalty agreement with Guyer Company for all games and toy items designed by Foley. Guyer Company agreed, and officially hired Foley. Foley hired Neil Rabens, an accomplished product design artist with an art degree from the Minneapolis School of Art and Design.
The game ideas ranged from small kids' games to word games for adults. Foley had an idea for utilizing people as game pieces as part of the game idea, "a party game". Rabens had the idea to utilize a colored mat, allowing people to interact with each other, in a game idea they had developed while a student in design school. Foley saw the idea and developed the concept for having the colored dots line up in rows, and, with a spinner, created the idea for calling out players' hands and feet to the colored dots called out from the spinner. This would create a tangled-up situation between two people, and the one that falls first would lose.
With the support of Reyn Guyer Sr., Charles Foley and Neil Rabens submitted for patents (US Pat# 3,454,279) and trademark rights for what was originally called "Pretzel". Foley, with their extensive experience in the toy industry, called on their good friend, Mel Taft, Sr. V.P. for Milton Bradley in 1966, for a product idea presentation. Milton Bradley embraced the idea for the "Pretzel" game but renamed the game "Twister".
Twister became a success when actor Eva Gabor played it with Johnny Carson on television's The Tonight Show on May 3, 1966. However, in its success, it was also controversial. The company that produced it, Milton Bradley, was accused by its competitors of selling "sex in a box". That accusation is speculated to be because it was the first popular American game to use human bodies as playing pieces.
In 1966, Twister was licensed to Nintendo for the Japanese market, where it was released as Twister Game
In 1984, Hasbro acquired the Milton Bradley Company, becoming Twister's parent company. The Reyn Guyer Creative Group continues to work closely with Hasbro to develop and market new additions to the line of Twister products.
Co-inventor Charles Foley died on July 1, 2013, at the age of 82.
Phenomenon
Twister, much like the hula hoop, was one of the many toy fad phenomena that came about in the second half of the 20th century. Microsoft Encarta labels Twister as being an "industry phenomenon" that "captures the public's imagination, and sells in the millions". Being one of the earliest toy fads and a "national craze for a short time," Twister was a game that was able to bring all age groups together, whether children or adults. Twister, being both globally spread and highly popular, is unlike other games of its stature in the sense that it is accepted by all social classes. In an article by Peterson and Simkus, they state, "While the evidence of the first half of this century suggests strong links between social status and cultural taste, there is growing evidence that there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between taste and status group membership in advanced postindustrial societies like the United States."
Records
Since its release, many active participants have tried and succeeded in setting records for the most contestants in a game, and the largest combined amount of Twister game mats. The World's Largest Twister Mat was put together on June 18, 2010, in Belchertown, MA on the Belchertown High School football field. Over 2500 students and staff at the Belchertown School District participated in the event. It consisted of 1008 Twister mats donated by Hasbro and measured 244.7 feet X 99.10 feet for . The purpose of the record breaking Twister Mat was to kick off a fundraising drive for Jessica's Boundless Playground.
The previous record, as cited by the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest game of Twister included of mats that were combined. Prior to that, the largest game was played in the Netherlands in April 2005 with of mats. The record for the largest number of contestants in a game of Twister was once bestowed in 1987 with 4,160 contestants tangling themselves at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. However, this 1987 Amherst claim was later disqualified upon evidence of officiating inconsistencies. As a result, the category of "Most Contestants" was temporarily banned from the Guinness Book.
Robert Bucci, a determined Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), successfully entreated Guinness World Records to reinstate the category in 1992 by providing a comprehensively documented event plan prior to their subsequent world record setting event during the 1992 S AA/SF National Convention at Stone Mountain, Georgia.
Accessibility
There are publicly available instructions on how to alter a Twister game to make it accessible to color-blind individuals and to completely blind individuals.
Blindfolded Twister is an accessible variant where there are four different tactile symbols on the mat, and the players are blindfolded and have to find a circle with the named symbol by feeling.

Bells Across the Meadows is a piece of light classical music by Albert Ketèlbey. It was published in 1921 for both orchestra and piano, and first recorded by the composer a year later. Ketèlbey called the piece a "characteristic intermezzo". In 2003 it was selected in the final poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes and voted the 36th most popular classical tune of all time.
History
English composer Albert Ketèlbey's instrumental piece Bells Across the Meadows was published by Keith Prowse & Co. in 1921, in versions for both orchestra and piano. The first recording, with orchestra conducted by the composer, was made in April 1922. Arrangements for varying instruments followed, and the work has been popular with brass bands. Song lyrics by the composer were added in 1927 but have rarely been recorded.
The composition was selected in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes and voted the 36th most popular classical tune of all time.
Theme and music
A synopsis by Ketèlbey mentions solo bells beginning the music, followed by a quiet melody in strings and woodwinds. When repeated, a "chimes effect" provides the illusion of being "heard from a distant belfry across the meadows". Bells accompany a middle section. In a reprise of the first part, the melody is given to the cellos, accompanied by soft chimes. A last repeat is carried by "bells ringing out joyously and then gradually dying away in the distance".
In 1993 music critic Tim McDonald described Bells Across the Meadows as "unashamedly sentimental", adding that it offers modern audiences evocations of "by-gone scenes" reminiscent of nostalgic and idealised Victorian-era illustrations of the English countryside.
The piece is in E-flat major and common time, and is marked "Moderato". The entry of the melody is marked "Melodia con espressione", and the final entry of the bells is marked "Bells (joyously)".
Recordings
Bells Across the Meadows has been recorded dozens of times. Ketèlbey's own recording with their concert orchestra was reissued in 2002 in volume 2 of the collection British Light Music, described by a reviewer as mood music "unashamedly unrestrained and sentimental and melodramatic".
The piece was included in the album The Immortal Works of Ketèlbey, part of Decca's 1969 Concert Series with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Eric Rogers; a 2014 reviewer of the series' CD reissue noted the Phase 4 Stereo recording's "ear-pricking tintinnabulations". In 1995 it was recorded by the New London Orchestra conducted by Ronald Corp; this was later anthologized in a 2006 four-CD set called British Light Music Classics. A recording is included in the BBC's 2003 six-CD collection of the final listener-poll selections for Your Hundred Best Tunes.

Charles Frank Lucas (25 November 1843 – 27 September 1919) was an English first-class cricketer. Lucas was a right-handed batsman.
Lucas made their first-class debut for Hampshire 1864 against Sussex, which was the county club's inaugural first-class match.
In 1865 during a county match against Surrey, Lucas scored their maiden first-class half century with a score of 58 in Hampshire's second innings. The following season Lucas made their debut for the Gentlemen of the South against I Zingari. The Gentlemen side that Lucas was part of featured W.G. Grace. The same season while playing for Hampshire, Lucas scored their maiden and only first-class century with a score of 135 in Hampshire's first innings. Lucas played their second match for the Gentlemen of the South, this time against the Players of the South in the 1866 season.
The following season Lucas played their final match for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South.
From 1866 to 1880 Lucas played infrequently for Hampshire, with a seven-year gap between an appearance for the county against Lancashire in 1870 and their next first-class appearance for the club in 1877 against Kent.
Lucas' final first-class match for Hampshire came in 1880 against Sussex. In their fourteen first-class matches for Hampshire, Lucas scored 502 runs at a batting average of 20.08, with one half century and one century which yielded them their highest first-class score of 135.
Lucas died at Carshalton, Surrey on 27 September 1919.
Family
Lucas' cousin Bunny Lucas represented Cambridge University, Essex, Middlesex and Surrey. In addition Bunny represented England in five Test matches.

Ardingly was a railway station which served the West Sussex village of Ardingly in England. It was opened on 3 September 1883 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) closed eighty years later and is currently used as an aggregates depot. The Bluebell Railway owns the trackbed from just east of the station to Horsted Keynes and has long-term plans to rebuild the line.
History
Opening and route
The LBSCR opened a 4½-mile link line between Horsted Keynes on its Lewes to East Grinstead Line and Haywards Heath on the Brighton Main Line. Doubled throughout, the line curved away from Horsted Keynes over Sheriff Mill Viaduct (117 yards and named after the nearby Lower Sheriff Farm), climbing on a gradient to reach Lywood Tunnel (218 yards) before continuing on the level for nearly 2 miles to reach the line's only intermediate station at Ardingly. From Ardingly, the line continued for a further mile to reach Copyhold Junction on the Brighton Line, just south of the Ouse Valley Viaduct. At first there was no signal box at the junction, with services running on an independent line parallel to the Brighton Main Line as far as the north-facing bay platform at Haywards Heath. A box was installed in 1912 which remained in use until 1932 when Haywards Heath was rebuilt with up and down loop platforms, and a new box brought into service there.
The line opened without ceremony, with the first service, a goods train, leaving Haywards Heath at 8.34am to collect freight at Ardingly and continue to Horsted Keynes. It was later to prove its worth as a useful alternative to the Brighton Main Line in both wars and for specials to Lingfield Racecourse.
Station building and facilities
Designed by Thomas Harrison Myres, the main station building was sited at road level away from the platforms. In common with other Lewes and East Grinstead line stations, it was constructed in a neo-Queen Anne style and presented as a two-storey Victorian country cottage. The upper storey is decoratively timbered with plaster patterning (flower patterns in black on a white background) and projecting slightly; unlike the other stations on the line, Ardingly was never tile-hung.
The station's two platforms had fairly basic facilities with platform awnings and an alcove-like waiting room on the down platform; a platform signal cabin was to be found at the western end of the station, overseeing a small goods yard. The yard saw considerable inward traffic in the form of timber for a local sawmill which was subsequently dispatched back out in consignments of prepared boards. The station was run by a staff of four: the stationmaster, signal porter, porter and assistant clerk; the last stationmaster left in 1926, at which point Ardingly came under the control of Horsted Keynes.
Operations
The Ardingly branch had a very infrequent service under the LBSCR and following the grouping when the Southern Railway took over the line when it was mainly serviced by push-pull trains, with some through services to and from Brighton. Following electrification in 1935, the new electric service comprised some 18 trains on an hourly service to and from Horsted Keynes daily, around half of which terminated at Haywards Heath whilst the rest ran as far as Seaford. The Ardingly branch was closed on Sundays until 1945, and the connection from the up Ardingly line to the up Horsted Keynes main platform was severed.
Camping coaches were stationed at Ardingly from Summer 1930 until the end of the war, an acknowledgment of Ardingly's popularity amongst ramblers who were ferried to and from the station in special trains. The station was also busy at the beginning and end of term at Ardingly College when up to 450 packages of luggage were sent and received for around 250 pupils.
Closure
After the closure of the Lewes to East Grinstead line in 1958 by British Railways (BR), the down line between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly was used as a siding for condemned Kent Coast steam stock and new electric stock, whilst single line working with electric train staff was introduced on the up line. The branch was itself closed on 28 October 1963. The section was however still used occasionally to transport rolling stock to the newly established Bluebell Railway, and the last movement along the line was recorded on 13 May 1964 when Terrier No 32636 passed through prior to lifting of the track. The lifting, which had commenced on 15 July, had reached Horsted Keynes by 21 September. During the summer of 1968, Sheriff Mill Viaduct was demolished as the Mid Sussex District Council wished to straighten the bend on New Lane as it curved under the viaduct; BR was only too happy to relieve itself of the maintenance costs of the structure. The Bluebell Railway had been invited to purchase the line in 1962, but could not afford BR's asking price of between £25,000-£30,000 together with the £10,000 needed to maintain the viaduct.
Present day
An Amey Roadstone plant (now Hanson Aggregates) was established in the Ardingly goods yard shortly after closure of the line, and was served by a daily freight working from Haywards Heath using the former down local line. Access to the up main and up local lines at Copyhold Junction has been severed. The new occupant demolished the station platforms (except for a short length of the former up platform near the road bridge). The track in the station was removed and a loop installed at the southern end of the former goods yard area. The station buildings remain, used as offices by Hanson Aggregates. A pair of ornamental cast iron station canopy brackets and the ticket office window were sold as lots 302 and 303 by auctioneers T. Bannister & co. at their July 1983 auction at the Ardingly historic vehicle spectacular show at the South of England Showground.
Preservation future
In 1997 the Heritage Bluebell Railway acquired the trackbed, only as far as the Aggregate Depot boundary at Ardingly, and holds long-term aspirations to restore and reopen the branch. To help bridge the gap created by the missing (Sheriff Mill) viaduct, spoil from the excavation of Imberhorne cutting (part of the works necessary for the Bluebell's extension to East Grinstead) was used to extend existing embankments, towards Ardingly. Re-signalling work had also taken place at Horsted Keynes, with signals being installed in preparation for the eventual re-laying of the track. Mid Sussex District Council has accordingly safeguarded the route of the line from re-development that would be prejudicial to its reinstatement.

Fergus William McMahon (1898 – 28 August 1941) was an Australian professional golfer. They won the 1935 Australian Open at Royal Adelaide, having been the runner-up there in 1932. They also won the 1932 Australian Professional Championship at Royal Adelaide. They died in 1941, aged 42.
Professional career
McMahon was an amateur at Kooyonga Golf Club in Adelaide until early 1926, giving up a position as a government surveyor to become a professional golfer. They became the professional at the newly formed Marino Golf Club in Marino, a suburb of Adelaide, later becoming an instructor at the Myer Emporium in the city.
The Australian Open in 1926 was played at Royal Adelaide and McMahon finished in fifth place. A professional event was organised immediately after the Open but McMahon failed to finish in the top 4 in the qualifying stage. Soon afterwards they played in the South Australian qualifying for the Sun-Herald Tournament. They led after the first round but dropped to fourth, failing to qualify.
The South Australian Professional Championship was first played in 1927 and McMahon finished second behind Rufus Stewart. However they won the championship in 1928, 1929 and 1930, gaining permanent possession of the trophy by winning three times in succession. They would eventually win the event five times, with further victories in 1934 and 1937. They were also runner-up five times, the last time in 1940.
The Australian Open was played at Royal Adelaide again in 1929 and McMahon improved on their previous best, finishing fourth. When it returned to Royal Adelaide in 1932 they improved again, finishing runner-up and leading professional, a stroke behind Mick Ryan. They then won the Australian Professional Championship which followed the Open, beating George Naismith 7&6 in the final. In 1935 they won the Australian Open, again when it was Royal Adelaide, beating Jim Ferrier by a stroke.
McMahon won the South Australian Close Championship four times, in 1933, 1936, 1937 and 1938 and the South Australian Dunlop Cup in 1935, 1936 and 1937.
Later life
McMahon died in Royal Adelaide Hospital on 28 August 1941, aged 42, following an operation. A testimonial was organised for their family.

Olive Pond Amies (c. 1844–1917) was an American educator, lecturer, and editor from the U.S. state of New York. They founded the training school for teachers in Lewiston, Maine; served as editor of a Universalist Church publication; and was the first president of the Woman's Health Protective Association of the United States. Amies favored the temperance movement and women's suffrage.
Biography
Olive Ponds was born ca. 1844, in Jordan, New York. They were two weeks old when their father died, and the mother and child went to the home of the grandparents in New Britain, Connecticut. There the mother worked untiringly with their needle for the support of themselves and their two children. The older child, a boy, was placed in the care of an uncle, and to Olive the mother took the place of father, mother, brother and sister. When Olive was four years old, the mother and child left the home of the grandmother and went to the village to board, that Olive might be sent to school. Soon after this the mother married Cyrus Judd, a man of influence in the town of New Britain. Olive continued in school for many years. They passed through the course of the New Britain high school, was graduated from the State Normal School (now Central Connecticut State University), and later, after several years of teaching, was graduated from the Normal and Training School (now State University of New York at Oswego) in Oswego, New York.
Amies was a leader in school and became eminent as a teacher. For many years, they gave model lessons at conventions and institutes. For five years, in the State of New York and two in the State of Maine, they were in demand in the county teachers' institutes. They founded the training school for teachers in Lewiston, Maine, and graduated its first classes. In 1877, they began to edit the primary department of The Sunday School Helper, published in Boston, the exponent for the Universalist Church. They held State positions in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the National Woman Suffrage Association, and delivered lectures on the different themes connected with those two organizations. They also spoke on kindergarten and object-teaching. Them "Conversations on Juvenile Reforms" were exceedingly popular wherever given. Amies served as president of the Women's Health Protective Association of the United States.
In 1871, they married the Rev. Joseph Hay Amies, pastor of the Universalist Church, Lewiston. They had a family of six children, three girls and three boys, of whom one son and one daughter died while young. Amies made their home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They were brought up a Methodist but in later years, became an Episcopalian. Amies died at their home in Secane, Delaware County, Pennsylvania on March 3, 1917 from heart disease. They were buried in the West Laurel Hill Cemetery on March 8, 1917.

The state of Georgia offers many specialty or optional license plates, most at an extra cost to motorists. Plates are also issued for non-passenger vehicles, such as trucks, school buses, and governmental vehicles.
"...on my mind" base
A number of types were issued on the 1998-dated "...on my mind" base, using the same general design as the standard passenger plates of the era.
Unique designs
During this time period, a number of types were also issued using unique designs:
Non-passenger and specialty plates, 1990 to 1996
A number of types were issued on the 1990-dated base, using the same general design as the standard passenger plates of the era.
During this time period, a number of plates were issued using unique designs.
1983 to 1989
A number of types were issued on the 1983-dated base, using the same general design as the standard passenger plates of the era.
During this time period, a number of plates were issued using unique designs.
December 2003 to present
The state streamlined the ever-growing number of limited-issuance plates by instituting two-letter prefixes for almost all types other than standard passenger plates.
For most types, the serial format progresses after the two-letter prefixes in the following sequence: 0, 00, 000, 0000, 000A, 00A0, 0A00, 00AA, 0AAA, and 0AA0.
Many of these plate types first appeared on the www.GEORGIA.gov base in December 2003 or later, but beginning in the first quarter of 2007, some types began transitioning to the GEORGIA.gov base, with nearly all types having made the transition by the first quarter of 2008. On the new base, the county sticker box and remaining (right) year sticker box were removed.

Ernest Clifford Miller (born January 14, 1964) is an American actor and former professional wrestler who worked for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) better known by their ring name, Ernest "The Cat" Miller. As an actor, they are perhaps best known for their role in the 2008 drama The Wrestler.
Career
Early career
Miller graduated from Gordon High School in Decatur, Georgia, playing on the football team as a linebacker. They then went to Savannah State University in Savannah, Georgia studying electrical engineering and playing football as an All-American linebacker. They started a career as a karate tournament competitor, winning the world championship three times, and once the ISKA kickboxing championship. They were brought to professional wrestling after being asked by WCW executive Eric Bischoff. Miller was by then a karate instructor and was teaching Bischoff's son Garett, when Bischoff asked them to become a professional wrestler.
World Championship Wrestling
Early years (1997–1999)
Miller made their World Championship Wrestling (WCW) debut when they saved Glacier from a two-on-one attack by Wrath and Mortis at the 1997 Slamboree pay-per-view. Initially thought as just a fan who had jumped the railing, the WCW commentators then realized that this was no ordinary man and they were in fact the three-time karate champion Ernest Miller. Glacier and Ernest Miller quickly became tag team partners in their feud with Mortis and Wrath. After Glacier turned on Miller, Ernest left them and became a villain with Sonny Onoo as their manager. It was during this time that Miller's popularity heightened.
As a villain, Miller adopted an arrogant, Muhammad Ali-like trash-talking personality, calling themselves "The Greatest" and gloating that they could beat anybody within two minutes, which they often did use their signature kicks. It was also around this time that Ernest began wearing ruby slippers in the ring and dancing in a James Brown-esque fashion to celebrate their victories. They would claim on Nitro that they knew the actual James Brown, leading to a pay-per-view "dance-off" between Miller and Brown, who had been brought in specially. Miller even went as far promoting their own instructional, karate home video with a pseudo infomercial. This served as a comedic parody to Billy Blanks' Tae Bo exercise videos which were quite popular at the time. Miller and Onoo also did comedy duo routines similar to Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan's characters from the film Rush Hour.
Miller then began a minor feud with Kaz Hayashi, as Onoo has been previously Hayashi's manager and had left them to manage Miller. Ernest won several matches over Hayashi with Onoo's help, and also enlisted Perry Saturn as their ally. However, Saturn suffered many losses against inferior opponents due to Miller's botched interference, so the two faced off at Starrcade, where Saturn won. Miller continued coming out and challenging the fans, the wrestlers, and anyone else to try and take them out, feuding with Scott Norton. For a time, they started coming out with the snow machine and music of Glacier, which Onoo had "purchased", but it was short-lived, and they soon returned to their James Brown music. In March 1999, Miller and Onoo attacked fellow martial artist Jerry Flynn, with Ernest cutting off Flynn's ponytail as a sign of disrespect. They all faced off in Uncensored in a handicap match, but Flyinn defeated them both. Miller bounced back after some time, getting a win over Scott Norton after hitting them with a crowbar. They and Norton were scheduled to wrestle in The Great American Bash, but Norton was pulled out for health problems and replaced with Horace Hogan, who Miller defeated after kicking them with a steel-tipped red dancing shoe.
In June 1999, Miller had a dancing contest with Disco Inferno, who they attacked in jealously over the fans's attention. They fought in Bash at the Beach in a "dance match" with the stipulation that the loser could not dance any more (though this stipulation was removed at Bash at the Beach), with Miller winning thanks to Onoo. The Cat's next opponent would be Buff Bagwell, who became famous by doing an impersonation of Miller with a bald cap and black face paint. The two met at Road Wild, but this time Onoo's help backfired when they accidentally hit the wrong man with a briefcase, making Miller lose the match. After that, the two broke up and Onoo left WCW.
Commissioner (2000–2001)
Miller became a jobber for a long time, until they were chosen as Eric Bischoff's assistant. Their role initially was composed of following Bischoff wherever they went and repeating whatever Bischoff said for comedic effect, but they were eventually appointed WCW Commissioner in 2000. As a commissioner, their motivations were the ratings and impressing the people in charge, and they often booked super matches for the main events. During this time, they got in a storyline where the Jung Dragons stalked them and tried to attack him, but Miller usually fended them off. In July 2000, Miller outlawed WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner's finisher, the Steiner Recliner, with the pretext of being too dangerous. Miller continued interfering in Steiner's reign, helping Mike Awesome during their fight in Bash at the Beach by disqualifying Steiner and stripping them of the title. Miller then feuded with yet another Japanese wrestler, The Great Muta, leading to a match at New Blood Rising. Although Muta used their Asian mist to blind Miller at one point, Ernest's ally Tygress interfered to hit Muta with a chair, which allowed Miller to land their finishing move for the victory.
After this match, they started to slowly turn into a fan favorite due to the high fan reaction they were getting whenever they entered an arena, coming to a rivalry with Mike Sanders from the Natural Born Thrillers stable, who sought to be the new commissioner. Miller offered Sanders a kickboxing match for the role, something which naturally had Mike afraid, but they agreed. During the match, Miller dominated three rounds, but at the last one they were attacked by Sanders's partner Shane Douglas, who pulled them out of the ring and made them being counted out. Angry at losing the commissionership, Miller kept chasing Douglas for the next months, enlisting Miss Jones as their valet to counter Douglas' Torrie Wilson. Ernest and Douglas fought at Mayhem, where Miller won after Jones overpowered Wilson and gave Miller their old loaded red shoe, which they used to knock Shane out.
Miller then became an enemy of Lance Storm, the leader of Team Canada, wrestling at Starrcade. The former karate champion had to endure many interferences from Major Gunns and Elix Skipper, but although they and Miss Jones kept them at bay, they accidentally knocked the referee out with a misguided kick, which allowed a reluctant Hacksaw Jim Duggan to attack Miller, making them lose. Right after, Team Canada turned on Duggan and beat them down, until Miller saved him. Ernest turned again to get the commissioner's spot and challenged Sanders for it, but Mike wanted none of it, bringing KroniK as mercenaries to take them down and putting the role on the line only if Miller accepted to give them Miss Jones's services. Miller and Sanders fought at Sin, where Sanders tried to hit The Cat with a chair, but Miss Jones impeded it. KroniK and Natural Born Thrillers came to finally put Ernest away, but then it was revealed that KroniK had been secretly hired by Miller, which turned them against Sanders and made Miller win the match, regaining their place as the WCW commissioner.
Miller's victory was short-lived, as Lance Storm came to reclaim the commissioner role with Ric Flair and their Magnificent Seven's help. Storm managed to defeat Ernest for the job and used the commissionership to aid their Team Canada, but Miller chased them and got a match for the role at SuperBrawl Revenge, where they won with Miss Jones's aid, gaining it back. The karate champion then started a feud with Chris Kanyon, who attacked Miss Jonnes to the point to put them in the hospital. Miller even gave up their role as commissioner in order to get a shot at Kanyon, chasing them for months and even having a street fight in Jones's hospital room. Kanyon then attacked Miller's limo driver, M.I. Smooth. At Greed, Miller and Kanyon faced, with The Cat having to protect Miss Jones during the match, but they were victorious with Jones and Smooth's help. Miller and their drive feuded with Kanyon and their ally, Road Warrior Animal, but the feud never had a conclusion due to the purchase of WCW by Vince McMahon in March 2001.
Miller had two years on their WCW contract; as a result, they decided to stay at home for the two years to take care of their children. Miller also appeared at some World Wrestling All-Stars shows before going to the WWE where they would have a somewhat brief career.
World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2004)
Under their Ernest "The Cat" Miller ring name and gimmick, they made their dark match debut for World Wrestling Entertainment on October 28, 2002. They then served as an announcer for Velocity from December 2002 until August 2003. After their run on Velocity, they became an active wrestler on the main roster, competing for the SmackDown brand.
Miller appeared in the 2004 Royal Rumble match, making their entrance (along with manager Lamont) while the other two people in the ring, Chris Benoit and Randy Orton, were knocked down. Miller and Lamont proceeded to dance to their theme music, not bothering to capitalize on the advantage he'd been given. When Benoit and Orton got back up, both men quickly tossed them from the ring. During their time, their catchphrase, "somebody calls my momma" (which was also used in WCW), started to be used in WWE. This phrase also appeared in the lyrics to their theme song, which they would dance to. Miller then competed in a 15-man Royal Rumble on SmackDown! to earn a shot at the WWE Championship against then Champion Brock Lesnar at No Way Out, but was once again thrown out during their theme song, this time by Kurt Angle. Following this, they started a short-lived feud with Tajiri after Tajiri attacked Lamont with their trademark Buzzsaw Kick. After the feud ended, Miller was released from WWE on February 10, 2004.
In 2012 their old theme song was then recycled for the entrance of Brodus Clay's new "Funkasaurus" gimmick. Brodus Clay also started to use their phrase, 'Somebody better call my momma'. Miller had this to say about the WWE and Brodus Clay recycling their music and phrase to Inside the Ropes Radio “I haven't watched it. I've nothing against him, he's working for a company. I feel like someone told them to do it. He's trying to make it work. Many fans have said he's not as good as me and it made me popular without being on the TV show. It's a little more than dancing. I was an athlete, I could wrestle. WWE had so many people afraid of their jobs, they never let me develop into what it could be. People like this guy out there dancing and saying call my momma, but he's not the original. I could've made it work so in other words, I'm a little pissed off about it.”
Outside professional wrestling
Miller had a significant role in the Academy Award-nominated film The Wrestler as The Ayatollah, in-ring nemesis of Randy "The Ram" Robinson (Mickey Rourke). They played Earnie Shavers opposite Michael Jai White in the 2008 Chinese television series The Legend of Bruce Lee and appeared in the 2009 film Blood and Bone. In a January 2009 interview, Miller announced they were cast as George Foreman in an HBO biopic that has yet to be produced.

Barack the Barbarian is a comic book series published by Devil's Due Publishing beginning in June 2009. It was written by Larry Hama, with art by Christopher Schons.
Barack the Barbarian originally appeared in a four-issue mini-series. The story features the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama as a Conan the Barbarian-style figure. It also features other politicians like Sarah Palin, George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney in fictional roles.
The series was followed by a one-shot, The Fall of Red Sarah.
Publication history
In November 2008, one of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of The Daily Telegraph titled, "Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know". In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects Conan the Barbarian.
The idea for the series originated with Devil's Due publisher Josh Blaylock who explained that "We didn't want to be completely slapsticky. It is definitely partly a gimmick, but we wanted to do something clever with [the Obama comics trend]." They contacted Larry Hama with their idea for a series called Obama the Barbarian, and Hama described how the idea developed during the course of the phonecall:
The writer has said it is more than just a political satire: "I just think of it as sword and sorcery, only the characters look really familiar."
Collected editions
The comic books are being collected into a trade paperback:
Barack the Barbarian Volume 1: Quest for the Treasure of Stimuli (144 pages, December 2009, )

Paris Dupree (also stylized as Paris Duprée or Paris DuPree; 1950 – August 2011) was an American drag performer and documentary participant featured in Jennie Livingston's 1990 documentary, Paris is Burning, which was named after Dupree's annual ball.
Career
Dupree was the founding member and mother of the House of Dupree, which mobilized young, urban gays to express themselves in ways that mainstream America could not quite understand in the 1970s. In 1990 Dupree was featured in Jennie Livingston's documentary film, Paris is Burning. Dupree inspired the film's title.  They are remembered for their line "That's right! I said it! Butch queen! Boy in the day, girl at night".
Legacy
In one of the legends surrounding the origin of vogue, Dupree is credited as the originator or one of the pioneers of the dance form, and it was because of them that the art form is called vogue. Vogueing is the imitation of models in magazines and runways.
It is reported when they attended an after hours nightclub called Footsteps on 2nd Avenue and 14th Street, some gay Black men were throwing shade at each other. Dupree had a copy of Vogue magazine in their bag and started dancing then suddenly stopped, posing to the beat of the music imitating the models' poses. That provocation was returned in kind by the other Black gay men in the club. What followed next was a dancing and posing competition to the beat of the music. According to Kevin UltraOmni (founder of the Legendary House of Omni):
It was also during the House of Dupree's first ball in 1981 that "the categories were really there (sic)," thereby establishing Paris in some quarters as the inventor of the competition categories. This legacy is still continued to this day (with additions) as a result of the first Dupree ball in 1981. Today, gay clubs have voguing competitions, inspired by Paris.
Them 1988 ball was held at Club Zanzibar.
Paris Is Burning (film)
Paris Dupree featured in the 1990 documentary film Paris Is Burning. The film was first shown at the NewFest New York's LGBT Film Festival on June 9, 1990. Paris Is Burning follows Dupree and other drag queens participating in balls. It features The House of Dupree, founded by Dupree and talks about the origin of voguing, a dance Dupree pioneered.
Death
Paris Dupree died in August 2011 in New York City. They were sixty-one years old.

Chiricahua (also known as Chiricahua Apache) is a Southern Athabaskan language spoken by the Chiricahua people in Oklahoma and New Mexico. It is related to Navajo and Western Apache and has been described in great detail by the anthropological linguist Harry Hoijer (1904–1976), especially in Hoijer & Opler (1938) and Hoijer (1946). Hoijer & Opler's Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache Texts, including a grammatical sketch and traditional religious and secular stories, has been converted into an online "book" available from the University of Virginia.
Virginia Klinekole, the first female president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, was known for their efforts to preserve the language.
There is at least one language-immersion school for children in Mescalero.

Rising Sun Inn is a heritage-listed former post office, inn, general store and residence and now museum, craft shop and art gallery at 95-97 Wollombi Road, Millfield, City of Cessnock, New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1832 to 1838. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
History
On 24 May 1826, about 300 convicts in groups of 50 to 60 were used to construct the Great North Road from Castle Hill via Wiseman's Ferry to Maitland. During this time many Inns were established along the route. Pat Dowlan's Inn was recorded as early as 1832 in the postal directory. Of about 12 inns between Wollombi and Millfield, at least 5 were within 1.3 miles of Millfield.
Millfield began as a cluster of buildings on the Great North Road and was named for the large flour mill of which only a few posts remain, but it is better known today for its sawmills.
The Rising Sun Inn was built on land granted to William Smith in 1828. The earliest licence No. 214 was given to John McDougall on 27 June 1838. John McDougall was famed for their floggings of convicts whilst overseer of the Great Northern Road.
It is believed several convicts sought revenge on the former overseer by staging bushranger-style attacks on the Inn. The second publican was Thomas Pendergast, another colourful character. In December 1840 McDougall was visiting Pendergast at the inn, where they were held up by Edward (Jew Boy) Davis and their gang of bushrangers. Pendergast was robbed of 13 pounds and McDougall given a dozen strokes with a bullock whip in revenge for their treatment of convicts as overseer.
The Maitland Mercury (28 April 1857 and 30 April 1857) claimed the inn was destroyed by fire. Others claim the report is incorrect, that it was the house next door, owned by another publican, which was destroyed. If the inn was destroyed it was quickly rebuilt, since again the Maitland Mercury referred to a theft from The Rising Sun Inn on 11 June 1857.
The building remained an Inn until about 1866, when Charles Beany bought it and used it as a general store. In March of the same year the postal service was transferred to the inn. From about 1895 to 1980 it was a residence owned by some of the early pioneering families in the district.
The building was rundown and due to be demolished prior to its restoration which began in 1980. It was necessary to replace all windows and doors, water and power and to level the floor, which in part had sunk 18 inches. The western wall was at some stage covered with weatherboards which have recently been removed. Internal walls in this section have been removed and the ceiling posts repositioned. Some floor boards in the original section have been replaced using boards from elsewhere in the building.
The Rising Sun Inn is now used as a museum, gallery and craft shop.
Description
The Rising Sun Inn is a simple vernacular cottage, constructed of vertical ironbark slab walls and doubled gabled roof. A verandah to front and sides on timber posts. A two room eastern addition has been extended to two rooms plus passage. The kitchen, with large brick double fireplace once a sperare building, is now joined to the main building.
The original hardwood slab building is said to date from 1832 and the late 19th century weatherboard additions to the rear and eastern side.
The building as had various alterations and extensions during its history. The original portion in the north west corner has original vertical slab walls and an original half round log bearer. The western wall was at some stage covered with weatherboards which have recently been removed. Internal walls in this section have been removed and the ceiling posts repositioned. Some floor boards in the original section have been replaced using boards from elsewhere in the building. The two room eastern addition was later extended to become two rooms plus passage between. The kitchen was a separate building, now joined to the main building. It has a large brick double fireplace, originally rendered.
A laundry and bathroom of vertical slab construction was added 1980s by the present owner. High pitched iron roof. Original shingles and battens, if any, no longer exist.
The building was being restored at the time of its heritage listing.

Ross Martin (born Martin Rosenblatt, March 22, 1920 – July 3, 1981) was an American radio, voice, stage, film and television actor. Martin was best known for portraying Artemus Gordon on the CBS Western series The Wild Wild West, which aired from 1965 to 1969. They were the voice of Doctor Paul Williams in 1972's Sealab 2020, additional characters in 1973's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, and additional character voices in 1978's Jana of the Jungle.
Early life
Martin was born to a Polish Jewish family in Gródek, Poland (now Horodok, Ukraine). They and their parents emigrated to New York City when they were an infant. Recorded as Izak and Sara Rosenblat and infant son Marcus, they boarded the steamship New Rochelle at Danzig, which was then a Free City under the League of Nations; the ship sailed on 29 August 1920 and arrived at the Port of New York on 18 September. As they were steerage passengers, they were obliged to go to Ellis Island to undergo U.S. Immigrant Inspection. They settled in The Bronx. Martin spoke Polish, Yiddish and some Russian before learning English and later added French, Spanish and Italian to their repertoire.
Martin attended City College of New York, where they graduated magna cum laude, then earned a law degree from the National University School of Law (later part of the George Washington University).
Career
Despite academic training in business, instruction, and law, Martin chose a career in acting. They were partners in a comedy team with Bernie West for several years, then appeared on many radio and live TV broadcasts, including playing Wyatt Earp in the January 20, 1952 episode of The Gabby Hayes Show. They made their Broadway debut in Hazel Flagg in 1953.
Martin's first film was the George Pal 1955 production Conquest of Space, followed by a brief but memorable appearance in The Colossus of New York (1958), as the scientist father of Charles Herbert. In 1959, Martin appeared in the episode "Echo" on Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond. They appeared in two 1959 episodes of David Janssen's crime drama series, Richard Diamond, Private Detective. Soon after, they caught the eye of Blake Edwards, who cast them in a number of widely varied roles; as Sal in the 1959 Peter Gunn episode "The Fuse", their breakout role as the comic sidekick Andamo in the 1959 CBS drama series Mr. Lucky, the asthmatic kidnapper Red Lynch in the 1962 thriller Experiment in Terror, culminating with a role in The Great Race, as the smoothly villainous Baron Rolfe Von Stuppe. They were also a regular on Stump the Stars from 1962-1963.
The Wild Wild West
After their performance in The Great Race, CBS cast Martin in what was to become their most famous role, Secret Service agent Artemus Gordon in The Wild Wild West, opposite Robert Conrad. The Artemus Gordon character was a master gadgeteer and disguise artist, and these attributes fitted Martin perfectly. Martin themselves created most of their disguises for the show, and most of the cast had no idea what they would look like until seeing them during the shooting of the episode. The recent DVD release of the first season of the series includes a recently discovered pre-production sketch Martin had made of their very first make-up design for the pilot episode. Another episode revealed another of Martin's talents: they were a concert-trained violinist.
In 1968, Martin broke their leg and then suffered a near-fatal heart attack, forcing The Wild Wild West to replace them with other actors, including Charles Aidman, William Schallert and Alan Hale Jr for nine episodes. They were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, for the fourth and final season of The Wild Wild West. The series was cancelled in 1969 in the midst of a national controversy over violence on television.
Later career
After The Wild, Wild West ended, Martin continued their career in various guest roles on television and in roles in television films. In 1970, Martin portrayed Alexander Hamilton in the NBC television special Swing Out, Sweet Land, hosted by John Wayne. They also appeared in a 1970 episode of The Immortal ("White Elephants Don't Grow on Trees"). The following year, Martin tried their hand at directing. They guest starred in the 1971 episode of Columbo entitled "Suitable For Framing", as Dale Kingston, a murderous art critic and also a 1971 episode of Love, American Style, which they also directed. Martin directed another episode of the series in 1973. Later that same year, they appeared as the famed Asian detective Charlie Chan in The Return of Charlie Chan. They made a guest appearance on Barnaby Jones in 1974, and also lent their voice to an episode of Wait Till Your Father Gets Home later that year.
In 1976, Martin returned to the stage as John Adams in a touring production of the musical 1776. In 1978, they did more voice work for the animated series Jana of the Jungle. They reprised the role of Artemus Gordon in two Wild, Wild West television movies: The Wild Wild West Revisited in 1979 and More Wild Wild West in 1980. They had a four-episode recurring role as kumu mobster Tony Alika on Hawaii Five-O from 1978–79. In 1980, Martin appeared in the third episode of The Love Boat as Tom Thorton. Martin's final role was in the 1983 television movie I Married Wyatt Earp in which they played the role of Jacob Speigler. The film aired two years after their death.
Personal life and death
Martin married their first wife, Muriel Weiss, in 1941. They had one child together, a daughter, Phyllis Rosenblatt (a New York artist). Weiss died from cancer in 1965. (Martin and Weiss were separated at the time of their death.)
In 1967, Martin married Olavee Lucile Parsons (a successful model and documentary director) and adopted their two children, Rebecca (Martin) Schacht and George Martin. Martin and Parsons remained married until Martin's death in 1981. They died in 2002.
On July 3, 1981, Martin suffered a fatal heart attack after a game of tennis at San Vincente Tennis Ranch, San Diego County Club of Ramona, California. They were rushed to the Pomerado Hospital in Poway, California, but was pronounced dead on arrival.
 They are interred in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Bruce Gentry was an aviation adventure comic strip by , distributed by the Post-Hall Syndicate. It debuted March 25, 1945, and by July the strip had expanded to 35 newspapers.
Characters and story
Comic strip historian Coulton Waugh called Bailey's Bruce Gentry a "job of very high technical skill." They further credited the artist with mastery of "exact perspective, high flexibility of expression and a feeling for drama." Despite such high praise near the time of its inception, the Bruce Gentry series was not a long-term success. It ended January 6, 1951 with Gentry marrying their sweetheart Cleo Patric.
Comics historian Don Markstein took note of the Milton Caniff influence:
Comic book
In 1948-49, Four Star Publications and Superior Publishers, Ltd. teamed to publish eight issues of a Bruce Gentry reprint comic book. After the first issue (January 1948) from Four Star, the numbering was continued by Superior when it published issue #2 (November 1948). The earliest issues carried the subtitle, "America's Famous Newspaper Comic Strip". Superior maintained the run until issue #8 (July 1949). The subtitle on the final issue was "Romantic Adventures for Teen-agers!!"
Film
Bailey's strip was adapted into the 1949 Bruce Gentry movie serial with Tom Neal in the title role.

The Kenai Spur Highway is a highway on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. The road begins at a junction with the Sterling Highway in Soldotna and provides access to the towns of Kenai and Nikiski, dead-ending at the entrance to the Captain Cook State Recreation Area. Visitors traveling between the Homer area and these areas can bypass Soldotna and access the Spur Highway via Kalifornsky Beach Road. The highway is a four-lane undivided road inside of the cities of Soldotna and Kenai, and a two-lane road elsewhere. The northern section of the road is also known as the North Kenai Road. In 2018 the Federal Highway Administration approved a plan to extend the road by eight miles to improve access to remote homes in the area.

Conrad Patrick Olson (September 4, 1882 – March 1, 1952) was an American politician and judge in Oregon. They were the 48th Associate Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. Additionally, the Wisconsin native served in both chambers of the Oregon Legislature during the early 1900s.
Early life
Conrad Olson was born in the town of Clay Banks in Door County, Wisconsin on September 4, 1882. In Wisconsin they were educated first at the Stevens Point Normal School, and later at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. After receiving their education they became a civil service examiner and a school teacher before moving to Oregon in 1908. In Oregon they settled in Portland where in 1910 they married Nellie C. Frost, and they had two children together.

Albert Spaulding Cook (born October 28, 1925, Exeter, New Hampshire; died July 7, 1998; Providence, Rhode Island) was a noted American literary critic, poet, classical scholar, teacher and translator. They taught Classics, English and Comparative Literature at the University of California (Berkeley), Western Reserve, the University at Buffalo and Brown University, as well as at various universities abroad.
Early life
They spent much of their early childhood in Ohio and in Massachusetts. In the late 1930s, their family moved to Albany and in 1940 settled in Utica, New York. Their parents separated when they were fourteen, their mother at first remaining in Utica and later moving to New York City, and their father moving to Boston. A brother, two years their junior, pursued a career in radio.
Education
While in high school, Albert Cook ran the school's literary magazine, won an Atlantic Monthly student essay prize, and edited an anthology of Utica area poets. Some of their schoolmates, among them Aaron Rosen and Edwin Dolin, remained lifelong friends and collaborators; another, Carol Rubin, eventually became their wife. A gifted linguist from their earliest years, they learned Latin and taught themselves Greek in high school; by the time they reached college, they were proficient also in French and German; they later added Hebrew and Russian. At the peak of their career, they spoke four languages and could read ten.
In 1943 they enrolled in Harvard College, where John Hawkes and Robert Creeley were among their classmates. Their formal studies were chiefly in classics, with Arthur Darby Nock, Werner Jaeger and (above all) John Finley among their teachers. (Finley eventually recommended them for admission to the Harvard Society of Fellows.) They interrupted their undergraduate career in 1943-1944 with a brief stint in the armed services, but was discharged for health reasons after six months. In their senior year, they were awarded the Garrison Prize (Harvard's highest award for a poem by an undergraduate), as well as the Bowdoin Prize in Classical Greek and Latin and the John Osborne Sargent Prize for Latin Translation. They also published various poems under the pen-name of "Charles Hamilton Sorley". At their Harvard graduation in 1946, they delivered the Latin commencement oration.
Rather than proceeding immediately to graduate school, they lived for some months in poverty in the village of Sainte-Rose near Montreal, where they perfected their French and began drafting a series of works, including their first book, The Dark Voyage and the Golden Mean, which was to launch their career. They at this time also experienced a religious awakening which led to their conversion from liberal agnosticism to Anglican Christianity.
They returned to Harvard to complete their master's degree, chiefly under the mentorship of the renowned classicist Eric Havelock, and continued as a Harvard Junior Fellow, envisioning an eventual career outside academe as a lone wolf writer of poetry, drama and fiction. A prominent member of a group of young Harvard writers that included L.E. Sissman, Norman Wexler and Richard Wilbur, they founded the little magazine Halcyon (1947-1948), publishing work by themselves and their friends alongside contributions from Wallace Stevens, James Merrill, Allen Ginsberg and e.e. cummings. They also began working with Boston's Tributary Theater, which staged their translation of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. In a revised form, this version of the play was several times republished in later years. Elected to the Harvard Society of Fellows, Cook continued to work on a variety of projects, and began publishing work in The Partisan Review.
They married Carol S. Rubin on June 19, 1948 and in the following spring took up residence on a Junior Fellow Study Grant in the Saint-Germain neighborhood of Paris. While in France, Cook attended lectures by Merleau-Ponty, Claude Lévi-Strauss and Jacques Lacan.
Their three sons were born in the years following their return and in 1951 the family moved to New York City. Still determined to become an independent writer and reluctant to commit to an academic career, Cook supported themselves and their family by various odd jobs, from encyclopedia salesperson to museum accountant, until fiscal rescue arrived once more in the form of a Fulbright grant to France.
Career
Financial necessity finally persuaded them to accept the offer of a teaching position in the University of California at Berkeley. Told early on that their contract would not be renewed, they spent the remaining time of their teaching stint in learning Hebrew, before securing another Fulbright Fellowship, this time to Munich.
When the Fulbright grant ended a year later, they accepted the offer of an appointment at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. By this time, their works of criticism had gained a substantial reputation; also, their first volume of verse was published by the University of Arizona Press, and several of their plays were performed by experimental theaters in Cleveland and elsewhere. Two years later they were appointed Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science at Stanford.
Meanwhile, in 1963, they assumed the chairpersonship of the English Department in the University at Buffalo, a formerly private university which had just then become a flagship research institution of the State University of New York. Their mandate was to substantially expand the Buffalo English department (it increased from fifty to almost eighty members in the first five years of their tenure) and to turn it into a cutting-edge, world-class literary institution. They were given free hand to hire and fire, and to bend or break conventional academic rules at their discretion. They used this freedom not only to hire a hugely distinguished faculty (Lionel Abel, C.L. Barber, John Barth, Robert Creeley, Carl Dennis, Irving Feldman, Leslie Fiedler, René Girard, Mac Hammond, Norman Holland, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Bruce Jackson, John Logan, Ann London Scott, Charles Olson, Bill Sylvester and Dorothy Van Ghent all joined the faculty during their watch), but also to democratize the department by encouraging the breach of conventional barriers among period specialties, or between creative and scholarly, young and old, tenured and untenured, and even teachers and students. Their presence was especially strong during the two sensational Buffalo Festivals of the Arts in 1965 and 1967, transpiring during a politically and ideologically explosive decade. They also instituted a vigorous program of illustrious visitorships, usually during the summer sessions, which in the fifteen years of their tenure featured John Berryman, Jorge Luis Borges, Basil Bunting, Anthony Burgess, Kenneth Burke, Noam Chomsky, Leonard Cohen, Robert Duncan, Richard Ellman, William Empson, Henri Foucault, Robert Graves, John Hawkes, Roman Jakobson, Randall Jarrell, Hugh Kenner, Frank Kermode, Doris Lessing, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Mailer, Howard Nemerov, Frank O'Hara, John Crowe Ransom, Adrienne Rich, Louis Simpson, Tzvetan Todorov, John Updike, Richard Wilbur, Evgeny Yevtushenko and many others. When a more conservative University administration took over (and the budget began to be squeezed) they continued to give generous support to academically adventurous initiatives that benefited a younger generation of faculty and graduate students destined for distinguished later careers (Robert Hass, John Coetzee, Charles Baxter, Marc Schell, Carol Jacobs, Gerald O'Grady). Their reformation of the Buffalo English Department was viewed by many as the single greatest achievement of their career.
However, by the late 1970s, increasingly sidelined by an unsympathetic new University administration and hampered by tightening fiscal restraints, they accepted the offer of a distinguished professorship at Brown University, where they taught until their retirement in 1988. As an Emeritus, they kept energetically publishing and guest-lecturing until their sudden death of a heart attack a decade later. The Albert Spaulding Cook Prize at Brown University was established in their honor.

The reservation was officially created on September 15, 1903 by executive order, on a small parcel carved from the ancestral lands of the Yavapai people, encompassing . The acreage had been part of the Fort McDowell Military Reserve, which had been an important outpost during the Apache Wars. The original inhabitants of the reservation were members of the kwevikopaya, or Southeastern Yavapai, who lived in the nearby Mazatzal-Four Peak and Superstition Mountains area. In the 1970s, there was a proposal to build a dam at the confluence of the Verde and Salt Rivers. Due to the negative effects such a dam would have had on the reservation, the community voted not to sell the land for the dam to the federal government. What would have been called the "Orme Dam" was never built. The reservation celebrates this victory with a rodeo and pow wow each November.
After the passage of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, a casino was built on the reservation. In 1992, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to seize the gaming devices of the casino. This raid took place in conjunction with raids at four other Indian reservations throughout the country. While the raids at the other four reservations went unopposed, members of the Yavapai tribe organized a protest. Using cars, trucks, and large mobile earth moving equipment, they blocked the egress from the property, preventing the trucks from carting off the machines. An agreement was reached between the tribe and Governor Fife Symington allowing the casino to remain in operation.
In 2018, the Tribe began construction on the new 166,341-square-foot casino which opened in 2020.
The outside communities of Fountain Hills and Rio Verde lie adjacent to the reservation. In addition to Rio Verde and Fountain Hills, the reservation's economy is also closely tied to the nearby cities of Mesa, Scottsdale and Phoenix. Also in the area is the Salt River Indian Reservation of the Pima and Maricopa peoples. The tribe operates its own gas station, a large sand and gravel operation, a farm, and the Fort McDowell Casino. Other operations on the reservation include the Wekopa Resort and Conference Center, the Poco Diablo hotel, the Wekopa Golf Course, and Fort McDowell Adventures.
The area now occupied by the reservation was the birthplace of the Native American activist, Carlos Montezuma, who founded the Society of American Indians.
Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery
The Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery is also referred to as the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Tribal Cemetery. It was where the soldiers who were stationed in Fort McDowell and who perished were buried. The remains of the "Anglos" who were buried there were later transferred to El Presidio Cemetery in San Francisco after the land was ceded to the Yavapai Nation.

Early life
When they were young, they met a mystic named Chirk. This association brought about a significant transformation in their life. As a result, they decided to seek a higher moral and spiritual life.
Harooni later met Shareef Zandani, a mystic and saint of the Chishti order, and requested to enroll as their spiritual disciple. Zandani accepted their request by placing a four-edged cap upon their head.
Zandani told them that the four-edged cap implied the following four things:
First is the renunciation of this world
Second is the renunciation of the world hereafter
Third is the renunciation of the desires of the self
Fourth is the renunciation of everything other than God
Mystic
Harooni spent over thirty years in the company of their spiritual guide. During this period, they engaged in ascetic practices and prayers. As time passed, they gained many spiritual accomplishments. Zandani asked them guide to move on and spread the gospel of truth.

Death
Usman E Harooni Rahimullah died on 5 Shawwal, 617 AH (1220 AD) at Makkah . Their Urs take place every year in Belchi, Bihar Sharif Nalanda, Bihar, on 15 & 16 of Shawwal. Their blessings are invoked by people belonging to every stratum of society and every school of thought. Their actual tomb was in Makkah, until it was destroyed in the early years of the 21st century. The shrine in Belchi is Usmani Chillah (a chillah is a non-burial memorial shrine). This shrine is regarded as a symbol of Usman's spiritual strength and of the source of their blessings.
Chillah
As known, a muridah waliyah of Usman Harooni took promise from them that after their death their tomb will be beneath in their feet, but eventually Usman Harooni died in Mecca, Arabia. To fulfill their promise, Usman Harooni once again existed in Belchi and ordered the muridah to build their shrine and after their death, she'll be buried beneath the shrine of Usman Harooni in Belchi. Beside their Chillah was built the tomb of the Waliya. For the past 650 years, an annual Urs has taken place every year.
The first Urs ceremony was commemorated (originated) by Makhdoom Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh (First Sajjada Nasheen). Their shrine is in Chandpura, Bihar Sharif. They were the son of Ibrahim (Nephew of Nizamuddin Auliya) & Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh founded the Chishti Nizami order in Bihar, they were the nephew & disciple of Noor Qutbe Alam Pandavi. They were the disciple of Alaul Haq Pandavi (also the Peer of Makhdoom Ashraf Jahangir Simnani). They were the disciple of Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind & they were the disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya (Mehboob E Illahi).
The esteemed details of the chillah & life of Usman Harooni are noted in the book "Moin ul Qul" by the late 19th century Sufi leader Gudri Shah Baba, of Ajmer.
Message and teachings
According to Usman Harooni, a great man is one who is endowed with virtues such as contentment, sincerity, self-abnegation, self-sacrifice and above all, spirit of renunciation. They said that the ego was an enemy, as it did not allow rational thought, wise actions and a happy life. They emphasized that unless a man loves human beings, it is impossible for them to love God.

Viscount was a Bakumatsu period Japanese samurai, and the 11th (and final) daimyō of Nihonmatsu Domain in the Tōhoku region of Japan. They were the 12th hereditary chieftain of the Niwa clan.
Nagahiro was the 9th son of Uesugi Narinori of Yonezawa Domain; their mother was a daughter of Matsudaira Yorihiro of Takamatsu Domain. They were married to the eldest daughter of Niwa Nagakuni. Following the defeat of Nihonmatsu Domain during the Boshin War in 1868, Nagakuni was placed under house arrest in Tokyo by the new Meiji government, which also ordered them to retire. Nagakuni formally adopted their son-in-law, Nagahiro who then became daimyō, with Nihonmatsu reduced to 50,000 koku in its kokudaka (half of what it had previously held). When the post of daimyō was abolished, Nagahiro remained as Imperial governor of Nihonmatsu until the abolition of the han system.
In 1884, with the creation of the kazoku peerage system, they received the peerage title of shishaku (viscount). They died in 1886 and their birth brother Nagayasu (Uesugi Narinori's 11th son) became the 13th chieftain of the Niwa clan.

Vittorio Camardese (Potenza, 6 July 1929 – 2 July 2010) was an Italian guitarist and physician, most famous among musicians and general audiences for their 'tapping' style of guitar playing.
Biography
After attending high school in Potenza, Camardese moved to Rome to undertake higher studies. They graduated in medicine, specializing in radiology, then began professional medical practice at the Ospedale S. Filippo Neri in Rome, later working at the Policlinico Umberto I, also in Rome.
They evolved their musical style through teaching himself, and in amateur performances. But in 1956, they played on the RAI Italian television talent show Primo applauso, their first television appearance, in which they won first prize. The television programme Chitarra, amore mio featured them in 1965, and they were seen again in 1973 in the music-based talk show Speciale per voi.
They regularly visited two of Rome's most important jazz venues, the Music Inn and Folkstudio. Here, they joined several famous musicians in performances, including Chet Baker, Tony Scott, Joe Venuti, Lelio Luttazzi, Romano Mussolini and Irio de Paula.
In 1978 they met their partner with whom they remained for 18 years. At the time, they had a three-year-old son, Roberto Angelini, who went on to become a singer and songwriter. The same year also saw Camardese's final television appearance. Their shy and modest nature, together with the pressure of performing on live television, caused them to turn down further requests for such shows.
Camardese died on July 2, 2010, four days before turning 81.
Media
Camardese's performances are poorly documented. The only widely-available film of their playing is their performance Chitarra, amore mio, rebroadcast in later years by the Italian state broadcaster RAI. In this recording, Camardese's distinctive tapping style is clearly evident, where the fingers of the right hand strike the strings on the guitar neck, creating the musical notes and other sounds.
Film
A project to document Camardese's life and work is (as of May 2016) seeking funding. Its publicity is presented by Roberto Angelini, the son of Camardese's partner.

In certain languages, the final form is a special character used to represent a letter only when it occurs at the end of a word.
Some languages that use final form characters are: Arabic, Hebrew, Manchu and one letter in Greek ().
The lowercase Latin letter "s" had separate medial (ſ) and final (s) in the orthographies of many European languages from the medieval period to the early 19th century; it survived in the German Fraktur script until the 1940s.
Hebrew
In the Hebrew alphabet the final form is called sofit (, meaning "final" or "ending").
This set of letters is known acronymically as (מ,נ,צ,פ,ך letters).
The now final forms predate their non-final counterparts; They were the default forms used in any position within a word. Their descender eventually bent forwards when preceding another letter to facilitate writing. A final form of these letters is also called pshuta (, meaning extended or plain).
The letter Mem also had a descender , however, its current final form was a variant of used interchangeably in all positions. The standardization is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Megillah 2b-3a and Shabbas 104a). One instance of a medial is preserved in Isaiah 9:6 of the Hebrew Bible, while Nehemiah 2:13 and arguably Genesis 49:19-20 have a final .
Modern Hebrew uses the forms finally, when transcribing a plosive pronunciation, for example (microscope), (Mubarak, ).

Von Delany Mizell (1910–1973) was the second black physician in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and since at that time Fort Lauderdale's hospitals would not accept "colored" patients, they helped establish Provident Hospital for black residents. They staged sit-ins and protests, boycotted Fort Lauderdale's "Colored School", and successfully sued the Broward County Medical Association for admittance. They started the first NAACP chapter in South Florida. They were also involved in efforts to provide a beach for black residents to use and to desegregate Broward County's other beaches.
Legacy
The site of Provident Hospital, which has been torn down, is occupied by a community center, the Von D. Mizell Community Center, owned by the city of Fort Lauderdale.
On July 1, 2016, John U. Lloyd Beach State Park was renamed the Dr. Von D. Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park in honor of civil rights efforts undertaken by Mizell and Johnson during segregation.

Garimot Arnis (or Garimot Arnis de Mano) is a Filipino martial art developed by Gat Puno (Chieftain) Abon "Garimot" Baet.  They are the 5th generation inheritor of their family art. Garimot Arnis is a system composed of three basic parts: arnis de mano (weapons), buno (wrestling), and hilot (healing). The defining characteristic of the system is in keeping yourself safe. This is done by meticulously studying the footwork, angles, and distancing of largo mano (long hand) to keep yourself out of your opponent's range while keeping them in your range. In corto (close) range, the opponent's ability to attack must be shut down as quickly as possible, through a disarm, lock, or manipulation of the opponent's body, which sets up the finish. Above all, knowledge of hilot allows you to keep yourself healthy by helping to fight illness and injuries, especially injuries caused during arnis and buno training.
"Garimot" (from Paeteno slang "garaymot," meaning "absorber") was the fighting nickname of Gat Puno's father Felipe. Gat Puno took the name in their father's honor, and used it to name their family's system. Garimot Arnis consists of many styles, including:
Cinco Teros – a style popular in Luzon, characterized by its use of five angles. Garimot Cinco Teros introduces the student to the basic theories of largo mano and corto, and was added to Garimot Arnis by Grandmaster Jose "Uti" Baet (3rd generation).
Tres Puntos – a knife-fighting style from Batangas, the home of the balisong, characterized by its emphasis on thrusting and its use of three points. Garimot Tres Puntos uses the balisong and sling blade (developed by Grandmaster Felipe "Garimot" Baet), as well as common daggers and knives. It has been in the Garimot system since Grandmaster Lino "Bisaya" Baet (2nd generation).
Siete Colores – a popular style in Laguna, characterized by its use of seven angles. Garimot Siete Colores is introduced after a student has become an expert in Cinco Teros, and teaches new theories of largo mano and corto, and includes the Laban Tulisan (Bandit Fighting) used by guerrilla warriors in Laguna. Though Laban Tulisan was introduced by Grandmaster Jose "Uti" Baet, Siete Colores has always been a part of the Baet family style.
Doce Pares – this style is from Laguna, and not to be confused with the Doce Pares of Cebu. It is introduced after proficiency in Siete Colores, and provides further training in the classical arnis of Laguna. Doce Pares has been in the Garimot system since Grandmaster Elias "Tata" Baet (1st generation).
Larong Moro-Moro – a play which dramatizes the triumph of the Spanish Christians over the Muslim Moors, used by the Filipinos to preserve their fighting arts. Garimot Arnis preserves the 30 traditional sequences of the battle-dances in the moro-moro, and all students are required to learn them and the hidden application, with a variety of weapons and shields. Every member of the Garimot lineage has been a moro-moro player.
Doble Teros – this is a style of double stick/sword fighting from Pampanga which includes the abaniko and sinawali methods. It is introduced early in Garimot Arnis Training.
Sikadtukan – Filipino kickboxing, that nevertheless includes a few throws and locks.
Buno – a composite of native wrestling styles of the Philippines. It contains standing (clinch) work and groundfighting, including throws, locks, and chokes. Animal characteristics are emulated, but the two primary animals are the tiger and monkey, which represent the dichotomies of aggressive/passive, direct/evasive, hard/soft, etc. Grandmaster Jose "Uti" Baet was an accomplished wrestler, studied with Aetas, and taught Grandmaster Felipe "Garimot" Baet (4th generation), who in turn studied with the Mangyans.
Lubid – part of the weaponry of Garimot Buno is the lubid (rope), though the principles apply to any flexible item, such as a belt, sarong, scarf or bandana. Garimot lubid training involves study of ways of holding, drawing, and striking with the weapon, as well as disarming, locking, choking, and tying the opponent.
Hilot – native healing techniques of the Philippines, which include massage, herbs (internal and external use), oils, vinegar, water, and 'cupping.' Every member of the Garimot lineage has been a skilled hilot.

Shortwave bands are frequency allocations for use within the shortwave radio spectrum (the upper medium frequency [MF] band and all of the high frequency [HF] band). Radio waves in these frequency ranges can be used for very long distance (transcontinental) communication because they can reflect off layers of charged particles in the ionosphere and return to Earth beyond the horizon, a mechanism called skywave or “skip” propagation. They are allocated by the ITU for radio services such as maritime communications, international shortwave broadcasting and worldwide amateur radio. The bands are conventionally named by their wavelength in metres, for example the ‘20 meter band'. Radio propagation and possible communication distances vary depending on the time of day, the season and the level of solar activity.
International broadcast bands
These bands are used by powerful long range AM radio stations, many operated by governments, which broadcast to multiple countries. Most international broadcasters use amplitude modulation with 5 kHz steps between channels; a few use single sideband or reduced carrier single sideband modulation. The World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organized under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union, allocates bands for various services in periodic conferences. The most recent WRC took place in 2012. At WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for international broadcasting:
Particularly in the United States and at frequencies under 10 MHz, shortwave broadcasters may operate in between those bands. WTWW (whose main programming is on 5.085), WBCQ (5.130) and WRMI (9.335) all operate at least some of their frequencies outside the designated shortwave bands.
Amateur HF bands
Amateur radio operators in many countries are allocated several shortwave bands for private, non-commercial use. Amateur radio is a communications service, educational tool and hobby. It is particularly useful in providing emergency communication where standard telecommunications infrastructure is compromised or nonexistent, such as a disaster area or remote region of the globe.
Marine, air, land mobile and fixed allocations
Designated bands in the shortwave spectrum are used for ships, aircraft, and land vehicles. Shortwave (HF radio) is used by transoceanic aircraft for communications with air-traffic control centers out of VHF radio range. Most countries with HF citizens'-band allocations use 40 or 80 channels between approximately 26.5 MHz and 27.9 MHz, in 10 kHz steps.
Due to antenna-length requirements and the band's long-distance propagation characteristics (undesirable in these cases), much land-mobile radio activity has moved to VHF or UHF and most cordless-phone use is at UHF or higher. Some segments of the HF spectrum are allocated for fixed services, providing point-to-point communication between sites with no access to wired communications.
Illegal "freeband" CB activity can be heard from 25 to 28 MHz, steps with operators generally using AM below 26.965 (US and European CB channel 1) and SSB above 27.405 (US and European CB channel 40). CB radio in the UK can be heard from 27.60125 to 27.99125 MHz in 10 kHz steps as well as the lower 26.965 to 27.405 MHz allocation.
The UK and Ireland both operate Community Audio Distribution (CADS) in the UK or Wireless Public Address System (WPAS) in Ireland services in the 27.600 to 27.995 MHz portion, AM and FM mode, with two overlapping sets of 40 channels (27.60125 to 27.99125 MHz in 10 kHz steps, and 27.605 to 27.995 MHz in 10 kHz steps). These transmissions are usually rebroadcasts of church services and can sometimes be heard hundreds or even thousands of km (miles). Part of the 11 m/27 MHz band was also allocated in many countries for early-model cordless phones.
Military HF use
In the US and Canada, as well as the Americas (ITU Region 2) as a whole, there are no pre-designated HF allocations for military use.
Similar rules exist in Europe, where it has become necessary for European amateurs to police the bands due to overcrowding. Most military HF band incursions into the HF ham bands occur in Europe or Africa. Since the end of the Cold War specific military HF allocations have gradually disappeared from the HF bands, except for Africa and some parts of Asia. In Australia, the military shares the HF bands with civilian users; this is mainly due to low population density and relative under-use of the HF bands. The military in the Americas and Australia has tended to use the civilian fixed, maritime mobile and aeronautical mobile allocations on an ad hoc (non-interference) basis.
Industrial/Scientific/Medical (ISM) and other HF allocations
Above 10 MHz there are numerous frequencies set aside for radio astronomy, space research (FCC terminology) and standard- frequency-and-time services. RF diathermy equipment uses 27.12 MHz to heat bulk materials or adhesives for the purpose of drying or improving curing. The industrial use of the frequency suggested the use of the 11 m band for CB radio. About a dozen narrow ("sliver") allocations for ISM exist throughout the radio spectrum. These allocations are among the smallest in the HF band, with respect to national HF allocations.

Erich Wilhelm Ludwig von Tschischwitz was a German General of the Infantry who participated in World War I. They were part of the Imperial German General Staff during the German spring offensive as well as commanding the Reichswehr after the war concluded.
Early career
After completing their cadet training, Tschischwitz joined the of the Imperial German Army on March 22, 1889, as a second lieutenant. Tschischwitz was stationed at the cadet house at Bensberg from 1882 to 1885 before being transferred to the main institution at Lichterfelde. They were promoted to first lieutenant on September 1, 1896, and on March 22, 1902, promoted to captain. On October 9, 1902, they married Margarete von Steinbach and on October 1, 1904, they commanded the XV Corps at Strasbourg.

Clear Creek County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,397. The county seat is Georgetown.
Clear Creek County is part of the Denver metropolitan area.
History
Clear Creek County was one of the original 17 counties created by the Colorado legislature on 1 November 1861, and is one of only two counties (along with Gilpin) to have persisted with its original boundaries unchanged. It was named after Clear Creek, which runs down from the continental divide through the county.

Ranald MacDonald (February 3, 1824 – August 24, 1894) was the first native English-speaker to teach the English language in Japan, including educating Einosuke Moriyama, one of the chief interpreters to handle the negotiations between Commodore Perry and the Tokugawa Shogunate.
Early life
MacDonald was born at Fort Astoria, in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The area was then known as the Columbia District or Oregon Country, disputed territory dominated by the British Hudson's Bay Company and the American Pacific Fur Company. MacDonald's father was Archibald McDonald, a Scottish Hudson's Bay Company fur trader, and their mother was Koale'xoa (also known as Raven or Princess Sunday), a Chinook, daughter of Comcomly, a leader of the "Lower Chinook" Chinookan people that lived near the present-day city of Ilwaco, Washington. She, however, died shortly after giving birth and MacDonald was briefly cared for by their mother's family. Around 1825, Archibald McDonald married Jane Klyne, a Métis woman from Canada, and brought Ranald to Fort Vancouver, the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company. It is unclear when MacDonald became aware of the details of their birth or of their Chinook ancestry. MacDonald was a member of the larger Métis community.
Based on the popular historical fiction of Eva Emery Dye, it has been repeated that "as a child of eight in 1832 at Fort Vancouver, they met three shipwrecked Japanese sailors, including Otokichi". In reality the three shipwrecked Japanese sailors were brought to Fort Vancouver in July 1834 [not 1832], arriving there about four months after 10-yr-old Ranald MacDonald had departed for the Red River Colony – so there never was the fabled "meeting of East and West". MacDonald's First Nations relatives might have had legends that their ancestors had come from across the Pacific, but saying that MacDonald "developed a fascination with Japan" and "theorized that it might be the home of their distant relatives" may or may not be accurate. In their autobiography MacDonald explained it in their own words: "My plan was to present myself as a castaway ... and to rely on their humanity. My purpose was to learn of them; and, if occasion should offer, to instruct them of us."
MacDonald was educated at the Red River Academy in the newly established Red River Colony, a part of British North America that later became Manitoba, Canada. Later, following the wishes of their father, they secured a job as a bank clerk.
Japan
A restless man, they soon quit their bank job and decided that they would visit Japan. Despite knowing the strict isolationist Japanese policy of the time, which meant death or imprisonment for foreigners who set foot on Japanese soil, they signed on as a sailor on the whaling ship Plymouth in 1845. In 1848, they convinced the captain of the Plymouth to set them to sea on a small boat off the coast of Hokkaidō. On July 1, they came ashore on Rishiri Island where they pretended they had been shipwrecked. They were caught by Ainu people, who remitted them to the daimyō of Matsumae clan. They were then sent to Nagasaki, the only port allowed to conduct limited trade with the Dutch.
Since more and more American and British ships had been approaching Japanese waters, and no man in Japan spoke English with any sort of fluency, fourteen men were sent to study English under MacDonald. These men were samurai, who had previously learned Dutch and had been attempting to learn English for some time from secondhand sources, such as Dutch merchants who spoke a little of the language. The brightest of these men, a sort of "language genius", was Moriyama Einosuke.
MacDonald stayed in confinement, at , a branch temple of the in Nagasaki, for 10 months, during which they also studied Japanese before being taken aboard a passing American warship. In April 1849, in Nagasaki, MacDonald was remitted together with fifteen shipwreck survivors to captain James Glynn on the American warship USS Preble which had been sent to rescue stranded sailors. Glynn later urged that a treaty should be signed with Japan, "if not peaceably, then by force".
Upon their return to North America, MacDonald made a written declaration to the US Congress, explaining that the Japanese society was well policed, and the Japanese people were well behaved to the highest standard. They continued their career as a sailor.
After travelling widely, MacDonald returned to Canada East (now Quebec) and, in 1858, went to the new colony of British Columbia where they set up a packing business in the Fraser River gold fields and later in the Cariboo, in 1864. They also participated in the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition.
Although their students had been instrumental in the negotiations to open Japan with Commodore Perry and Lord Elgin, they found no real recognition of their achievements. Their notes of the Japanese adventure were not published until 1923, 29 years after their death. They died a poor man in Washington state in 1894, while visiting their niece. Their last words were reportedly "Sayonara, my dear, sayonara..."
Memorials and burial place
MacDonald is buried in the Ranald MacDonald Cemetery, Ferry County, Washington. The grave is northwest of Curlew Lake State Park on Mid Way Road. The grave itself is a state park, the smallest in Washington State. The grave marker has the inscription:
There are memorials to Ranald MacDonald in Rishiri Island and in Nagasaki, as well as in their birthplace, where Fort Astoria used to stand in Astoria, Oregon.
Award
Since 2016, the foundation Friends of MacDonald - The Dutch Connection in The Netherlands gives out the Ranald MacDonald Award to writers/artists who shed a new light on the relations between Asia, Europe and North America with their work. Some of the people who won this award are: Frederik L. Schodt (2016), Zia Haider Rahman (2016), Hajime Narukawa (2017), Bruno Maçães (2018) and the FENIX Landverhuizersmuseum in Rotterdam (2019).

George Collier Remey (August 10, 1841 – February 10, 1928) was a rear admiral of the United States Navy, serving in the Civil War and the Spanish–American War.
Early life
George Collier Remey was born at Burlington, Iowa on August 10, 1841, to Eliza Smith (née Howland) and William Butler Remey. Their father was captain of a steamboat in Burlington. They graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1859.
Career
Initially assigned to the sloop on the Asiatic Station, they returned to the United States with the outbreak of the Civil War and served in the gunboat during the Peninsular Campaign, March–July 1862; and, afterward, in the blockade of Charleston. In April 1863, they assumed duties as Executive Officer in the screw sloop and during attacks on Fort Wagner briefly commanded Marblehead. From August 23 to September 7, they commanded a battery of naval guns on Morris Island, and on the night of September 7–8, led the second division of a boat attack on Fort Sumter. The division made shore, but was smashed by gunfire. Remey and the surviving members of their party were forced to surrender. Following 13 months of imprisonment at Columbia, S.C., Remey was exchanged and returned to duty, serving in the sidewheel steamship until the end of the war.
In 1866, they saw service off the west coast of South America. In 1870–71, they participated in the Tehuantepec Survey Expedition. After commanding the screw sloop and service in the Mediterranean, they were appointed captain in 1885. Four years later they assumed command of the protected cruiser , flagship of the Pacific Squadron.
Commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard at the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, they were ordered to take charge of the Naval Base Key West, whence they directed the supply and repair of all naval forces in Cuban waters and organized supply lines to Army forces in Cuba. After peace returned, Rear Admiral Remey resumed duties at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. In April 1900, they assumed command of the Asiatic Station and for the next two years guided the ships of that station through the diplomatic and military chaos that was China.
Remey then returned to the United States and served for a year as Chairman of the Lighthouse Board before retiring on August 10, 1903.
Personal life
Remey married Mary Josephine Mason, daughter of Iowa Chief Justice Charles Mason, on July 8, 1873. Their son was Mason Remey. They had two brothers, William Butler Remey, who served as Judge Advocate General of the Navy and Edward Wallace Remey, who also served in the navy.
Rear Admiral Remey died at Washington, D.C., on February 10, 1928.

The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (; ) is a U.S. law to provide health monitoring and aid to the first responders, volunteers, and survivors of the September 11 attacks. It is named after James Zadroga, a New York Police Department officer whose death was linked to exposures from the World Trade Center disaster. The law funds and establishes a health program to provide medical treatment for responders and survivors who experienced or may experience health complications related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Senator Bob Menendez and Representative Carolyn Maloney initially co-sponsored the bill, which failed to pass in 2006. A different version of the bill passed both chambers in 2010 and was signed by President Barack Obama in the beginning of 2011. The bill was subsequently reauthorized in 2015, with coverage extended to 2090. The current bill was sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Carolyn Maloney and signed into law by President Donald Trump.
History
In the state of New York, Governor David Paterson signed a bill to expand benefits for 9/11 first responders.
In the United States Congress, various bills had been introduced to provide forms of health care to responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks. On February 2, 2005, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney introduced to Remember 9/11 Health Act, which died in committee. On September 13, 2006, Senator Hillary Clinton brought an amendment to a piece of ports security legislation, aiming to create a five-year, $1.9 billion treatment program for sufferers of Ground Zero dust and fumes after-effects.
In February 2009, Congresswoman Maloney introduced the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which eventually passed following a protracted political battle in 2010. The U.S. House passed a new version of the act in September 2010. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked the Senate to do the same. In a Senate vote held on December 9, 2010, Democrats were unable to break a Republican filibuster against the bill. Opposed Republicans expressed concerns over the $7.4 billion cost of the bill. According to Republicans, the provisions to cover the cost of the healthcare program via an excise tax increase on foreign-made goods would violate international tax treaties. They also raised concerns about creating an expansive new healthcare entitlement program and re-opening the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. Many Republicans refused to end the filibuster until the Bush tax cuts were extended. Forty-two Senate Republicans had signed a pledge to filibuster all bills until the Bush tax cuts were renewed and the government was appropriately funded for the next several months. With only 57 votes to end the Senate filibuster and an incoming influx of Republicans in the wake of the 2010 Congressional Elections, the bill's future looked increasingly doubtful towards the end of 2010.
On December 16, 2010, comedian Jon Stewart dedicated an entire episode of The Daily Show to the political battle over the Zadroga Act. Guests included four 9/11 first responders suffering from severe diseases and injuries related to their work near the WTC site. Stewart also interviewed Republican Mike Huckabee, who urged that "Every Republican should vote for this bill". Stewart also lambasted the lack of media coverage over the bill's political struggle in Congress. Stewart's coverage of the Republican filibuster raised media awareness of and public support for the bill, drawing praise from politicians and media outlets. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs acknowledged Jon Stewart's role in revitalizing support for the Zadroga Act, and The New York Times compared Jon Stewart to Edward R. Murrow, describing their coverage of the Zadroga debate as "advocacy journalism." New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg described Stewart's coverage as "one of the biggest factors that led to the final agreement".
On December 19, 2010, New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand introduced a $6.2 billion version of the bill paid for in part by closing a corporate tax loophole and in part by a 2% excise tax on foreign goods that did not include countries with international procurement agreements with the U.S. On December 22, 2010, Congress approved the final bill, which allocated $4.2 billion towards the program, and President Barack Obama signed the Zadroga Act into law on January 2, 2011. This act created the World Trade Center Health Program, which replaced earlier programs (Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the WTC Environmental Health Center program). The World Trade Center Health Program provides treatment services and medical benefits for people who worked in response and recovery operations as well as for survivors of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
On October 1, 2015, the Zadroga Act expired. Jon Stewart went to Congress with first responders and campaigned for the act's re-authorization. It was reauthorized in December 2015 and its coverage was extended to 75 years.
In February 2019, the Special Master administering the fund "determined that there is not sufficient funding to pay all pending and projected claims," and cut pending claims by 50% and new claims by 70%. On June 11, 2019, Jon Stewart testified before the House Judiciary Committee, demanding additional funding.
The next day the Committee unanimously passed a bill which would permanently reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.
Impact
In 2008, the National Response Team began a multi-agency effort to draft guidelines for protecting the health of emergency responders in the event of future disasters. The product of this effort, the Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance framework, was published in 2012.
The act allocated $4.2 billion to create the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides testing and treatment for people suffering from long-term health problems related to the 9/11 attacks. The WTC Health Program replaced preexisting 9/11-related health programs such as the Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the WTC Environmental Health Center program. The Zadroga Act required the WTC Health Program to begin administering medical benefits on July 1, 2011.
Reauthorization
On December 18, 2015, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which extended medical benefits to affected individuals until 2090.
Missing funds
Beginning in 2016, the Treasury Department withheld payments to the FDNY World Trade Center Health Program established by the Zadroga Act. New York City was using the funds to pay the Department of Health and Human Services, which was not the intended purpose for these funds. By the time this was revealed in 2020, around $3.7 million had been withheld from the FDNY program.

Franz P. Freudenthal is a Bolivian physician who is known for several medical inventions, including a device that can cure heart ailments in children.
Career
Franz P. Freudenthal was born in La Paz, Bolivia to German immigrant parents.
They were inspired to enter medicine by their grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer of Wreszinski, who was born in Königsberg in 1910 daughter Walter Wreszinski and died in La Paz in 1995. They used to go with them as a child on their medical visits in remote rural areas of Bolivia.
They were a pioneer in family planning and in outpatient treatment of tuberculosis, and shared their philosophy of life with Freudenthal.
They attended the Higher University of San Andrés in La Paz for their undergraduate studies, then did their internship at Children's Hospital of La Paz. They decided to specialize in pediatric cardiology.
Their wife, Alexandra Heath, is also a doctor. The couple received scholarships to take specialized training in Germany.
They performed their first operation on a child in Germany in the 1990s.
Freudenthal became interested in medical devices.
They were part of a team that in March 1998 reported encouraging results of tests on neonatal lambs for occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus with a double-helix device at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The devices used memory-shaped double-cone stainless steel coils mounted on a titanium/nickel core wire.
Freudenthal said that by the age of 25 they had treated more than 20 sheep with devices, and at the age of 29 had treated their first patient, a child that could not be cured in any other way.
After returning to Bolivia in 2003 the Freudenthals founded Kardiozentrum, a center for diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. They also created PFM Bolivia, to develop and market medical devices. In 2014 Freudenthal was heading a team of 80 young innovators on a new project to develop a treatment for strokes.
Freudenthal has taken out a number of patents including a left atrial appendage occlusion device, embolization device, tissue clip, tissue tack, snare mechanism for surgical retrieval and deployment device for cardiac surgery.
Nit Occlud device
Freudenthal is known for their Nit Occlud device for treatment of an infant heart problem.
The prototypes were first tested on sheep, and since then have been used successfully by Freudenthal on hundreds of children, and have been exported around the world.
The device treats a congenital disorder in the heart known as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
This occurs when the ductus arteriosus blood vessel, which bypasses the lungs before a baby is born, fails to close up soon after birth.
The affected infant suffers from labored breathing, failure to gain weight and other problems.
The condition is much more common in Bolivia, where the country around La Paz is at an elevation of , than in other places.
The device is made from a single wire of nitinol, a flexible alloy of nickel and titanium.
Nitinol was originally developed by the US military.
The tiny Nit Occlud devices are small and intricate, and difficult to mass-produce. Instead they are woven by Aymara women in a "clean room".
It takes about two hours to make each device.
The device can be placed without an invasive operation, using cardiac catheterization.
Nitinol is able to memorize its shape. The device is folded up and inserted into a catheter which is inserted into the groin and then run through blood vessels to the position in the heart where it is to be placed. The device is released and returns to its original shape, blocking the hole that caused the heart problem.
By using a minimally invasive approach the technique addresses the concerns of some indigenous people of Bolivia that to manipulate the heart is to desecrate the soul.
It takes about 30 minutes to place the device.
Technically, the Nit-Occlud ASD-R, is a double-umbrella, self-expanding, self-centering and premounted device knitted from a single nitinol wire without any soldering or protruding clamps or screws. The Nit-Occlud is similar to other self-expandable devices, which have provided excellent long-term clinical outcomes.
The device has a unique shape that offers various advantages and a special snare-like release mechanism.
It ranges in size from in stent diameter.
The first human implantation was done at the La Paz Kardiocentrum by Alexandra Heath and coworkers. 53 implantations were made by this group from May 2007 to February 2011. Four attempts failed. Of the 53 implantations, complete closure occurred immediately in 71% of patients, and 100% after six months.
Findings are generally very positive, although the erosion rate is not yet known.
In August 2014 it was announced that Freudenthal had won the "Innovators of America" award in the Science and Technology category for their occlusion device to cure congenital heart disease in children. The award is given by Innovative America, is sponsored by the CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Spanish CAF Ezentis group, and was to be presented in Medellín, Colombia on 21 August 2014.
As of 2014 the device had cured at least 50,000 children worldwide, and about 500 in Bolivia.

O'Brien, retired president of PNC), in cafes and supper clubs in the Pittsburgh area. They studied singing in Los with retired lyric soprano Alexis Bassian in San Francisco and with Lotte Lehmann in Los Angeles. By the age of twenty they were singing on Hollywood film soundtracks and it was there that they were spotted by Laurence Olivier. They picked Merriman to accompany them and their wife, actor Vivien Leigh, on a tour of Romeo and Juliet, where they performed songs during the set changes.
Them voice was used in two Jeanette MacDonald movies, first in a chorus in Maytime (1937), then in a brief solo early in Smilin' Through (1941).
Merriman sang many roles both live and on radio under the baton of Arturo Toscanini between 1944 and 1953, while they were conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Among the roles they sang with him, were Maddalena in Act IV of Verdi's Rigoletto, Emilia in Verdi's Otello, Mistress Page in Verdi's Falstaff, and the trousers role of Orfeo in Act II of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice and also sang in their first and only studio recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, in 1952. They were also featured as Dorabella in a 1956 La Scala performance of Mozart's Così fan tutte, which was conducted by Toscanini's short-lived protégé, Guido Cantelli. They sang Mozart's Dorabella at San Francisco Opera in 1957.
Merriman recorded Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde three times, twice with the tenor Ernst Haefliger and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. The 1957 recording was conducted by Eduard van Beinum for the Philips label, while the 1963 recording was conducted by Eugen Jochum for Deutsche Grammophon (see discography in the external links). The latter recording was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque of the Académie Charles Cros. A third recording, with tenor Fritz Wunderlich and the NDR Symphony Orchestra under conductor Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, was recorded live in Hamburg in April 1965, and released under different labels.
Merriman was particularly well received in the Netherlands, where they met and married Dutch tenor Tom Brand, a widower with several children. They retired from performing to care for the family in 1965. Brand died in 1970. After the children were grown, they maintained residences in Hawaii and California. They died at their home in Los Angeles on July 22, 2012 from natural causes, aged 92.

Reissner's fiber (named after Ernst Reissner) is a fibrous aggregation of secreted molecules extending from the subcommissural organ (SCO) through the ventricular system and central canal to the terminal ventricle, a small ventricle-like structure near the end of the spinal cord. In vertebrates, Reissner's fiber is formed by secretions of SCO-spondin from the subcommissural organ into the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. Reissner's fiber is highly conserved, and present in the central canal of all chordates. In cephalochordates, Reissner's fiber is produced by the ventral infundibular organ, as opposed to the dorsal SCO.
Structure
Reissner's fiber (RF) is a complex and dynamic structure present in the third and fourth ventricles and in the central canal of the spinal cord, observed in almost all vertebrates.
It is formed by the assembly of complex and variable high-weight molecular glycoproteins secreted by the SCO that are released to the cerebrospinal fluid. At least five different proteins were found, of 630 kDa, 480 kDa, 390 kDa, 320 kDa, and the major constituent, 200kDa, that is present in both RF and cerebrospinal fluid, CSF. One of the most important RF-glycoproteins secreted by the SCO has been named SCO-spondin and is of major importance, especially during embryonic life.
Reissner's fiber grows caudally by the addition of those glycoproteins at its cephalic end and extends along the brain aqueduct (Aqueduct of Sylvius), and the entire length of the central canal of the spinal cord, growing continuously in the caudal direction. It is just a small part of the secretions made by SCO and remains a matter of speculation, probably involved in many physiological functions, such as clearance of monoamines, detoxification of the CSF, neuronal surviving or the control of water balance.
The glycoproteins forming RF can be found in three conformations: the first is when the material aggregates over the SCO cilia, the so-called pre-RF; the second and most studied form is known as the proper RF, which is a cylindrical regular structure; and finally, a third and final form — massa caudalis — is known as the final distribution and the final assembly of the proteins.
Development
This fiber is essentially made by glycoproteins of high molecular mass, secreted by the subcommissural organ, which are released into the cerebrospinal fluid. Here, they aggregate on the top of the cilia, forming a thin film that becomes further packed in a highly ordered fashion to form a threadlike supramolecular structure.
The pre-RF material appears in the form of loosely arranged bundles of thin filaments. As a result, it is plausible that some biochemical modifications may occur to the pre-RF material in order for it to condensate and form the exact structure of Reissner's fiber, such as disassembly and passage into neighboring vessels. Some of these changes may decrease the reactivity of the molecules, and this should be considered as a transitory stage, from pre- to the proper RF, in which the accessibility of the antibodies to the epitopes is decreased. This lack of immunoreactivity could be due to the spatial distribution of negatively charged sialic acid residues within the fiber, or might be the result of bound compounds interfering with the accessibility of the antibodies to RF- glycoproteins.
The massa caudalis is the final form of this assembly of proteins, and is mostly related to the distal side of accumulation of the fiber, and this final form has more filaments and is less compact than the middle form of the fiber.
The secretory material is first synthesised at embryonic day 3 (E3) by morphological undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells. At E7, post coitum, the SCO-spondin is released to embryonic CSF (ECSF); however, RF does not form until E11, and only at E12, the RF becomes present in the lumbar spinal cord. The mechanisms that trigger RF formation remain unknown, but probable factors other that ventricular release must be required for the formation of the fiber, such as the hydrodynamics of the CSF.
Function
SCO-RF complex
This complex may participate in the maintenance of water and electrolyte homeostasis (osmoregulation), during ontogeny and in the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid.
The SCO-RF has been linked to various aspects of water and electrolyte metabolism, and it has been proven that water deprivation enhances the secretory activity of the SCO. This helps to support the correlation between this complex and the adrenal cortex, while the presence of receptors or binding sites for peptides involved in hydromineral balance — such as angiotensin II — has been reported in the SCO-RF. This complex is involved in many physiological functions, such as development of the spinal cord, the pathophysiology of lordosis and neuronal survival in a more developmental pathway.
RF and the cerebrospinal fluid
Due to the presence of sialic acid residues with negative charge, Reissner's fiber might participate in the cleaning of the CSF. The glycoproteins bind biogenic amines present in the CSF such as dopamine, serotonin or noradrenaline, thereby controlling the concentration of these monoamines by ionic change. There are, however, differences in the binding characteristics of each of these amines; the binding of serotonin is more unstable, and it occurs only when its CSF concentration is high, while noradrenaline binds strongly to the RF and remains bound as it moves along the central canal in the same binding site as adrenaline.
The concentration of these monoamines in the CSF in Reissner's fiber-deprived animals was investigated, concluding that this fiber possibly may be involved in the cleaning of the liquid — based upon elevated levels of CSF concentration of several amines displayed in the tested animals, with L-DOPA demonstrating the largest increase. All findings obtained indicate that RF binds monoamines present in the ventricular CSF and then transports them along the central canal. In the absence of RF, the CSF concentration of monoamines increased sharply.

Mundo da Lua (World of the Moon) is a Brazilian children's fantasy television series that aired on TV Cultura from 6 October 1991 to 27 September 1992, totalling 52 episodes. It was created by Flávio de Souza and starred Luciano Amaral. It is currently shown on TV Rá-Tim-Bum.
Plot
The series features Lucas Silva e Silva (Luciano Amaral), a ten-year-old boy who lives with their grandparents, parents, sister and maid in a townhouse in São Paulo. Their father, Rogério (Antônio Fagundes), is a teacher who works hard, and their mother, Carolina (Mira Haar), works at a boutique. Their older sister is called Juliana (Mayana Blum), and the maid is called Rosa (Ana D'Lira). Lucas is given a tape recorder by their grandfather, Orlando (Gianfrancesco Guarnieri), for their birthday. Lucas uses the tape recorder to record their childhood fantasies, which feature prominently in each episode.
Spin-off
In 1993, following on from Mundo da Lua and featuring its main character Lucas, TV Cultura broadcast a five-episode educational series titled Lucas e Juquinha em Perigo! Perigo! Perigo! (Lucas and Juquinha in Danger! Danger! Danger!). The series showed Lucas helping their younger cousin, Juquinha, navigate common household hazards such as medicine, fire and electricity.
2020 revival
In April 2020, Luciano Amaral created a stand-alone, 'lockdown' episode of Mundo da Lua, with the title "Bem-vindos de Volta ao Mundo da Lua" ("Welcome back to Mundo da Lua"). The episode was released on social media to encourage people to stay at home.
In September 2020, a new episode of Mundo da Lua was created using artificial intelligence.
Awards
In 1992, Mundo da Lua won the APCA award for Best Children's Program.

An ethnic stereotype, racial stereotype or cultural stereotype involves part of a system of beliefs about typical characteristics of members of a given ethnic group, their status, societal and cultural norms. A national stereotype, or national character, does the same for a given nationality. The stereotyping may be used for humor in jokes, and/or may be associated with racism.
National stereotypes may relate either to one's own ethnicity/nationality or to a foreign/differing one. Stereotypes about one's own nation may aid in maintaining a national identity due to a collective relatability to a trait or characteristic.
Examples
According to an article by The Guardian titled "European Stereotypes: What Do We Think of Each Other and Are We Right?", the Europe stereotype towards Britain is as "drunken, semi-clad hooligans or else snobbish, stiff free marketers", their view towards France is "cowardly, arrogant, chauvinistic, erotomaniacs", and they see Germany as "uber-efficient, diligent [and] disciplined". To Europe, Italy is "tax-dodging, Berlusconi-style Latin lovers and mama's boys, incapable of bravery", Poland is "heavy-drinking ultracatholics with a whiff of antisemitism", and Spain is "macho men and fiery women prone to regular siestas and fiestas". While some countries such as Germany proudly own their stereotype, others like Spain argue that theirs is a warped view based on experiences while on holiday instead of having actually lived there.
A Pew Global survey of the European countries United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Czechia found that European stereotypes found Germany to be both the most hardworking and least corrupt, Greece to be the least hardworking, and Italy to be the most corrupt. Five out of the eight countries thought their own country was the most corrupt.
Yanko Tsvetkov has designed many maps which serve as pictorial representations of such stereotypes, giving an impression of how certain regions of the world may view others. They have named such as "The Arab Winter" and "Crystal Ball View Of Europe In 2022".
Validity of stereotypes
It is sometimes held that such stereotypes often contain a grain of truth. However an extensive study by personality psychologist Robert R. McCrae of the National Institute on Aging and colleagues found that in general they are not trustworthy.
Various anti-national phobias and prejudices operate with ethnic stereotypes.
Ethnic stereotypes are commonly portrayed in ethnic jokes, some of which some consider to be offensive to varying degrees. Richard M. Steers and Luciara Nardon in their book about global economy use a variant of the "You have two cows" joke to illustrate the concept of cultural differences:
Russian company: You have two cows. You drink some vodka and count them again. You have five cows. The Russian Mafia shows up and takes however many cows you have.
Californian company: You have a million cows. Most of them are illegals.
They write that jokes of this kind are considered funny because they are realistic caricatures of various cultures, and the pervasiveness of such jokes stems from the significant cultural differences. Steers and Nardon also state that others believe that cultural stereotypes in jokes of this kind must be viewed with caution.

The Janusz Kusociński Memorial (Polish: Memoriał Janusza Kusocińskiego) is an annual track and field meeting at different venues in Poland, in recent times at the Silesian Stadium in Chorzów, Poland.
The meeting was first held in 1954 in memory of the Polish runner Janusz Kusociński, the 1932 Olympic champion over 10,000 metres, who was killed on 21 June 1940 during the German AB-Aktion Operation. The event was located at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium in Warsaw for much of its early history. Later on, the meet venue changed to a rotational basis and the memorial was held in cities such as Lublin, Bydgoszcz, Poznań, Szczecin and most recently Chorzów. In 2022 the meeting was part of the 2022 World Athletics Continental Tour on gold level.
From its inception to the present day, the Janusz Kusociński Memorial has attracted world record holders and Olympic medallists. Initially attracting top Eastern European athletes (including Soviet Olympic champion Vladimir Kuts at the first competition), Frenchman Michel Jazy, American Bill Nieder, and China's Ni Zhiqin were among the participants in its first decade. The 1970s saw runners Ron Clarke and Filbert Bayi compete, while the 1980s featured performers including Wolfgang Schmidt and Sergey Bubka. Among the world record breakers to appear at the memorial in the 1990s were Svetlana Masterkova, Wilson Kipketer and Jan Železný. Numerous Olympic, World and European Championship level athletes continue to take part on an annual basis.
Each edition features a long-distance memorial race. This event has been dominated by East African athletes in the last decade. In addition to the memorial race, the meeting typically has high calibre performances in the throwing events.
The meeting, which holds European Athletics Outdoor Meetings status, is among the foremost Polish track and field competitions, alongside the annual Pedro's Cup events.

Piculus is a genus of birds in the woodpecker family Picidae that are found in Central and South America.
Taxonomy
The genus was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix in 1824. The type species was subsequently designated as the golden-green woodpecker (Piculus chrysochloros) by the American ornithologist Harry C. Oberholser in 1923. The generic name is a diminutive of the Latin word Picus meaning "woodpecker".
The genus forms part of the woodpecker subfamily Picinae and has a sister relationship to the genus Dryocopus whose species are found in Eurasia and the Americas. The genus Piculus is a member of the tribe Picini and belongs to a clade that contains five genera: Colaptes, Piculus, Mulleripicus, Dryocopus and Celeus.
The genus contains seven species:
Five other species, formerly placed here, are now in Colaptes.

"Stauning or Chaos" (Danish Stauning eller Kaos) is a famous Danish election slogan from the parliamentary election of 1935, in which Social Democrat Thorvald Stauning campaigned for re-election. The Social Democrats won the election winning 68 out of 149 seats, and Stauning continued on to be the second-longest serving Prime Minister in Danish history.
The campaign with its warning against "chaos", interpreted as the threat of fascism, is an example of the emotional and activist campaign style used by the major political parties in Denmark in the 1920s and 1930s, often capitalizing on the public fear of the perceived threats of radical ideologies such as fascism and communism.

Meconopsis manasluensis is a red-flowered Himalayan poppy belonging to Meconopsis subg. Discogyne, which forms a natural grouping of 6 or 7 species within the genus all characterised by a stylar disc surmounting the ovary (lacking in other Meconopsis). As reflected by the species etymology, M. manasluensis is endemic to the vicinity of the Manaslu Himal of Gorkha district, central Nepal, where it grows at high elevation (ca. 4000 m) and so far remains known only from its type collection locality.
Meconopsis manasluensis is easily distinguished within subgenus Discogyne through its multiple flowering stems, unlike the single prominent fleshy stem in all other species. The closely related M. pinnatifolia is known from the same general locality in the wild, however possible mechanisms preventing cross-fertilisation between M. manasluensis and this species remain unclear.
Specimens of M. manasluensis were first collected on the joint Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh/University of Tokyo Manaslu '08 expedition to the Manaslu Eco-Tourism Area in 2008. It was not until later herbarium research undertaken for preparation of the Flora of Nepal that the specimens were discovered to constitute a new species, subsequently described in 2011 alongside Meconopsis autumnalis.
Ecology
Meconopsis manasluensis is found growing in alpine scrub (Betula utilis, Berberis, Lonicera, Salix, etc.) and herb-rich alpine grasslands at elevations in and around 4000 m in moist, humus-rich soils. The plant is locally abundant, but a small or possibly severely restricted specific distribution may give cause for conservational concern. Flowering is July–August.

The Battle of New Market was fought on May 15, 1864, in Virginia during the Valley Campaigns of 1864 in the American Civil War. A makeshift Confederate army of 4,100 men defeated the larger Army of the Shenandoah under Major General Franz Sigel, delaying the capture of Staunton by several weeks.
The battle is primarily remembered today for being the only time in American history a school's student body was used as an organized combat unit. During the battle Confederate general John C. Breckinridge ordered cadets from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), some of them child soldiers no older than 15, to join an attack on the Union lines. The event has gone on to become central to many of the Institute's myths and traditions.
Background
In the spring of 1864, Union commander-in-chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant set in motion a grand strategy designed to press the Confederacy into submission. Control of the strategically important and agriculturally rich Shenandoah Valley was a key element in Grant's plans. While they confronted General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in the eastern part of the state, Grant ordered Major General Franz Sigel's army of 10,000 to secure the Valley and threaten Lee's flank, starting the Valley Campaigns of 1864.
Sigel was to advance on Staunton, Virginia in order to link up with another Union column commanded by George Crook, which would advance from West Virginia and destroy the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad and other Confederate industries in the area. Sigel's force totaled about 9,000 men and 28 cannons, divided into an infantry division commanded by Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan and a cavalry division commanded by Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel (detachments made during the campaign reduced the Union force to about 6,300 by the time of the battle).
Receiving word that the Union Army had entered the Valley, Major General John C. Breckinridge pulled together all available forces to repulse the latest threat. Their command consisted of two infantry brigades under John C. Echols and General Gabriel C. Wharton, a cavalry brigade commanded by General John D. Imboden, and other independent commands. This included the cadet corps of VMI, which had an infantry battalion of 247 cadets commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Scott Shipp and a two-gun artillery section. Breckinridge concentrated their infantry at Staunton, while Imboden slowed Sigel's movement southward along the Valley.
On the morning of May 13, Breckinridge decided to move north to attack Sigel instead of waiting for Sigel to reach Staunton. By the evening of May 14, Sigel's advance forces had reached a position north of the village of New Market, while Breckinridge was at Lacey Spring eight miles south of New Market. The Confederates started toward the Union positions at 1 a.m. on May 15, hoping to trap and crush the Union army.

Battle
On May 14 a delaying action was fought at Rude's Hill, just outside of Mt. Jackson, by elements of the Confederate 18th Virginia Cavalry, under the overall command of Col. John Imboden. The Confederate cavalry slowed the Union advance, enabling Gen. John Breckinridge to gather the main body of their Confederate forces at New Market, about 4 miles away.
The two forces made contact south of New Market about mid-morning, with the main Union line west of the town near the North Fork of the Shenandoah River; Colonel Augustus Moor initially commanded the Union forces present on the battlefield at this time, which consisted of their infantry brigade and part of John E. Wynkoop's cavalry brigade. Additional Union regiments arrived throughout the morning and deployed between the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and the Valley Turnpike, with the main line centered on Manor's Hill. Breckinridge deployed Wharton's brigade on the Confederate left west of the Valley Turnpike and Echols's brigade on the right along the Pike; Echols was ill that morning, so their brigade was commanded by Colonel George S. Patton, Sr. The VMI cadets battalion was kept in reserve, while Imboden's cavalry was east of the turnpike.
Breckinridge attempted to lure the Federals into attacking them using cavalry and artillery, but Moor refused to move from their position. About 11 a.m., Breckinridge decided to launch an attack on Moor using their infantry, while Imboden's brigade crossed Smith's Creek east of New Market, rode north, and recrossed the stream behind the Union lines. Union cavalry General Stahel arrived at New Market at this time with additional troops, followed shortly afterwards by Union General Sigel.
Breckinridge launched their infantry attack near noon, slowly pushing Moor's infantry brigade off Manor's Hill and northward toward the rest of Sigel's army, which was deploying on a hill north of Jacob Bushong's farm, known as Bushong's Hill. Once past the town of New Market, the Confederates halted to dress ranks, shift units along the line, and reposition their artillery units. Breckinridge resumed their attack about 2 p.m. As the Confederate line formed near the Bushong farm, massed Union rifle and artillery fire disorganized the Confederate units in the center, forcing the right wing of the 51st Virginia Infantry and the 30th Virginia Infantry Battalion to retreat in confusion, while the rest of the Confederate line stalled.
Breckinridge reluctantly ordered the VMI cadet battalion to fill the gap; while the battalion was moving forward to the Bushong orchard, Shipp was wounded and was replaced by Captain Henry A. Wise. At this time, Sigel launched two counterattacks. On the Union left, Stahel launched a mounted charge with the cavalry but was routed by heavy fire from Confederate artillery, while three infantry regiments attacked on the Union right and were repulsed as well. The main cause of the failure of the infantry attacks was confusion within the ranks of the Union commanders; Sigel was noted to be shouting orders in their native language of German.
After the repulses of the Union attacks, Breckinridge started their advance again shortly after 3 p.m. with their infantry force; while crossing a field near Bushong's orchard, several VMI cadets lost their shoes in the mud, which led to the field being called the "Field of Lost Shoes". As the Confederate line got closer to the Union artillery, Sigel's batteries were forced to retreat as the infantry started breaking towards the rear. Five cannons were abandoned to the Confederates, one of which was captured by the VMI cadet battalion. Battery B of the 5th U.S. Artillery, which had just arrived on the field, and two infantry regiments slowed the Confederate pursuit. At this time, Breckinridge halted their forces until the supply trains arrived to resupply the troops. While the infantry was being resupplied, Confederate cavalry General Imboden arrived with their brigade with the news that the creek was too swollen to be crossed. Union General Sullivan arrived during this time with the 28th and 116th Ohio Infantry; Sigel managed to organize a rearguard on Rude's Hill, with Sullivan's infantry east of the turnpike, some of Stahel's cavalry west of the road, and the artillery behind the line. Due to the exhaustion of the men and low ammunition, Sigel decided to retreat across the Shenandoah River to Mount Jackson. Breckinridge advanced their artillery to the crest of Rude's Hill where they shelled Sigel's retreating Federals. The Union army managed to cross Mill Creek at Mt. Jackson and burned the bridge before the Confederates could catch up.
Aftermath
Union casualties totaled 841 for the battle: 96 killed, 520 wounded, and 225 captured or missing, a casualty rate of 13.4%. The Confederates lost 43 killed, including 10 cadets; 474 wounded, and 3 missing, 13% of the army. The wounded from the battle were cared for in Bushong's barn and in the town at the Smith Creek Baptist church and a warehouse, while the dead were buried in the graveyard of St. Matthew's Lutheran Church.
Sigel staged a rapid retreat northward to Strasburg, leaving the field and the Valley to Breckinridge's army. After learning of the Union defeat, Grant became furious and replaced Sigel with General David Hunter; Sigel was assigned to command the department's reserve division based in Harpers Ferry.
Sergeant James Burns of the 1st West Virginia Infantry received the Medal of Honor in 1896 for saving the regimental flag in the battle.
The Confederate victory allowed the local crops to be harvested for Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and protected Lee's lines of communications to western Virginia. The Virginia newspapers and the Confederate soldiers in the battle compared Breckinridge to Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson. Following Sigel's retreat, Lee suggested that Breckinridge follow the Union army and invade Maryland; however, the flooded rivers in the northern Shenandoah Valley and the length of their supply line prevented Breckinridge from making a pursuit. Breckinridge's forces were transferred to eastern Virginia, where they reinforced Lee's army at the Battle of Cold Harbor.
The victory failed to stop the Union offensive however. After assuming command of the Army of the Shenandoah, Hunter resumed the march southwest and defeated a Confederate force under Brig. Gen. William E. "Grumble" Jones at the Battle of Piedmont on June 5, occupying Staunton the following day.
VMI casualties
Forty-seven VMI cadets were wounded in the battle (around 23%). The following ten cadets were killed outright or mortally wounded:
The New Market Day ceremony is an annual observance held at VMI in front of the monument Virginia Mourning Them Dead, a memorial to the New Market Corps. It was sculpted by Cavaliere Moses Ritter von Ezekiel, VMI Class of 1866, who was a veteran of the battle. The names of all of the cadets in the Corps of 1864 are inscribed on the monument, and six of the ten cadets who died in the battle are buried at this site.
The ceremony features the roll call of the names of the cadets who lost their lives at New Market, a custom that began in 1887. As the name of each cadet who died is called, a representative from the same company in the modern Corps answers, "Died on the Field of Honor, Sir." A 3-volley salute is conducted by a cadet honor guard, followed by "Taps" played over the parade ground. To culminate this ceremony, the entire Corps passes Virginia Mourning Them Dead in review.
Battlefield preservation
The battlefield is primarily preserved in the 300-acre New Market Battlefield State Historical Park. In addition, the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.
In popular culture
In fall 1923, under the direction of Marine Corps Brigadier General Smedley Butler and employing the Quantico marines, the battle was reenacted on its historical grounds. The number of spectators was estimated at over 150,000.
Sean McNamara's 2014 film, Field of Lost Shoes, is a fictionalized account of the actions performed by VMI cadets during the battle. The movie follows a group of seven VMI cadets, based on real characters.
John Ford's 1959 film The Horse Soldiers includes a scene which is loosely based on the event.
A principal character in Elaine Marie Alphin's 1991 novel Ghost Cadet is the ghost of VMI cadet William Hugh McDowell, who was killed in the battle.

The Kunsthalle Königsberg was an art museum (Kunsthalle) in Königsberg, Germany.
Eduard Anderson, head of Königsberg's art association (Kunstverein), led the efforts to establish an exhibition hall in the city. A total of 80,000 Mark was collected, with 5,000 Mark raised by councilor Minkowski, commerce councilor F. Heumann, and court photographer Gottheil, and the remainder contributed by the city. The museum was designed by Friedrich Lahrs, who also planned the Kunstakademie.
The neoclassical Kunsthalle was located on Wallring between Tragheim and Tragheimsdorf and built from 1912 to 1913 near dismantled city walls. Nearby was the Wrangel Tower (Wrangelturm, named after Friedrich Graf von Wrangel), the Oberteich, and the Ostmesse. Because of its proximity to the Wrangel Tower, the art museum was also known as the Kunsthalle am Wrangelturm. Its opening exhibition in 1913 was organized by Adalbert Bezzenberger and dedicated to the Kingdom of Prussia's liberation in 1813 during the War of the Sixth Coalition.
The Kunsthalle was used by the German Army's postal service during World War I; exhibitions were held instead at the Königsberg Stock Exchange. In 1924 the museum was transferred from the art association to the city.
The building was damaged by Bombing of Königsberg in World War II, but survived the war. However, it fell into disuse following the change of German Königsberg to Russian Kaliningrad. It was used for storage in 1951 and as a school by 1985. In the 21st century it has been used as a market.

Knox–Henderson Station was a proposed subway station along the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Light Rail in the Knox-Henderson neighborhood of Dallas, Texas. It would serve the Red, Blue, and Orange Lines located beneath the North Central Expressway (U.S. 75) at Willis Avenue.
DART's original system plan featured a tunnel underneath North Central Expressway, connecting Pearl Station and SMU/Mockingbird Station, with underground stations serving the Knox-Henderson and Cityplace neighborhoods. During construction of the tunnel in the 1990s, the station area for Knox–Henderson Station was excavated at an additional cost of $1 million and left as a shell for future development. The excavated area was located below grade with a platform length of . Because of initial Vickery Place neighborhood objections, DART did not complete Knox–Henderson Station as part of its initial phase as planned. The station's shell, considered a ghost station, serves as an emergency exit from the tunnel. The nearby underground Cityplace Station, of similar design, was finished as planned and opened in December 2000.
By the mid-1990s, attitudes towards the station began to shift with the neighborhood actively petitioning DART to construct the station. However, funding problems related to the deferred construction doomed the station. By 2006, DART announced it would cost an estimated $100 million to complete and open Knox–Henderson Station. The large price tag was attributed to the high labor and infrastructure costs associated with working underground near actively used tracks. In order to avoid interfering with existing rail service, tunneling and station construction work could only be carried out for four hours per day, between midnight and 4 a.m., when trains are not running. Due to the high costs involved, DART stated that it was deferring construction of the station indefinitely.
In January 2007, DART published the final version of its comprehensive 2030 Transit System Plan. The plan contained no provisions for finishing or opening the station by 2030, and responded to public comments requesting completion of the station by declaring, "There are no plans for a station in the Knox-Henderson area."
On July 27, 2018, The Dallas Morning News published an article featuring photos and video views inside and details of the unfinished station.
In January 2022, DART approved the 2045 Transit System Plan removing all mentions of the station entirely.
As of 2022, DART does not list Knox–Henderson Station in its future expansion plans.

Richard Lawrence Dalby (15 April 1949 – 4 May 2017) was an editor and literary researcher noted for their anthologies of ghost stories.
Early life
Richard Dalby was born in London on 15 April 1949 to Tom, a publishing editor, and Nancy, an amateur artist. They were educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School from the age of 7 when they also began to take an interest in supernatural fiction. They were diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 16. They did not attend university.
Career
Dalby's early career was spent as a bookseller in bookshops, including Foyles in London, and they later sold books by mail order, issuing catalogues from their home in Scarborough, Yorkshire.
In the 1970s they began to produce anthologies of ghost stories and supernatural tales, compiling The Sorceress in Stained Glass and Other Ghost Stories in 1971 and over 50 other anthologies and collections. They unearthed rare and forgotten works and promoted the work of authors they loved, whether antiquarian or contemporary, such as H. Russell Wakefield and L. A. Lewis (1899–1961). In 1993 they founded the Ghost Story Press with David Tibet, which published 14 volumes.
Dalby was described by The Times as the "unofficial deputy editor" for the journal Book and Magazine Collector, writing over 200 articles for the magazine.
They owned a set of H. Rider Haggard first editions and a copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula with the author's annotations. Their book collection was so extensive that they rented a storage unit to help house it.
Death
Dalby died of diabetic ketoacidosis on 4 May 2017. They lived with their parents until their deaths and never married.

Dargart mac Finguine (died 685) was a member of the Cenél Comgaill kindred, after which Cowal in Scotland is named. The only event directly connected with them in the Irish annals, based on a chronicle then being kept on Iona, is their death.
Dargart is believed to have been the father of two kings of the Picts, Bridei mac Der-Ilei and Nechtan mac Der-Ilei.
Background
Dargart is a very uncommon name, and it is presumed that the few references to someone of that name in the record all refer to the same person. That a member of the Cenél Comgaill should be noticed at all by the Iona chronicle, which focussed its attention on the Cenél nGabráin of Kintyre, is most unusual. Excepting those descendants of Comgall mac Domangairt who are included in traditional lists of Kings of Dál Riata, only Dargart, and their father Finguine Fota are mentioned by the chroniclers, in both cases on the occasion of their deaths.
Dargart's father's ancestry is recorded in one surviving genealogy, the Genelaig Albanensium, appended to a version of the Senchus fer n-Alban. This makes them a great-grandson of Comgall, although a generation may have been omitted, and records another son of his, Ferchar by name.
The report of Dargart's death—by violence, the Latin word iugulatio is used—appears in the Annals of Tigernach and the Annals of Ulster in the year of the battle of Nechtansmere, that is 685, and has later been duplicated by the Annals of Ulster under the year 692.
Descendants
Dargart appears to have married a woman named Der-Ilei, perhaps a daughter, or less probably a sister, of King Bridei son of Beli. They had at least two sons, the Pictish kings Bridei, who died c. 706, and Nechtan, who died in 732. Congal mac Dargarto, who died in 712, was very likely this Dargart's son, although whether with Der-Ilei is less certain. It is also uncertain whether Ciniod, or Cináed, mac Der-Ilei, killed in 713 was Dargart's son.

Wells' 2013 season began with a loss to Utah, followed by consecutive victories. After a close loss to USC, USU posted a 2–2 record on the season. The Aggies won the next game, but dropped the next two to bring the team to a 3–4 record on the season. Their preseason Heisman hopeful quarterback, Chuckie Keeton, was injured in game six against BYU, and was lost for the season. After a loss to Boise State, the squad rebounded and won the final five regular season games. These victories gave them the Mountain West Mountain Division Title, and a berth in the inaugural Mountain West Football Title Game. Due to the team's performance, Wells earned the 2013 MW Coach of the Year. After losing a close contest at Fresno State, USU earned an invitation to the Poinsettia Bowl against #23 Northern Illinois. They defeated the Huskies for the school's 3rd bowl win on December 26, 2013 with an impressive defensive performance that held Heisman Trophy finalist Jordan Lynch and the Huskies to 315 total yards and 14 points. USU finished the season ranked #12 in total defense and #7 in scoring defense.
2014 season
The season again began with a 38–7 loss against the Tennessee Volunteers, but the Aggies rebounded with home wins against Idaho State and Wake Forest. Quarterback Chuckie Keeton was lost during the Wake Forest game after reinjuring their knee, but was replaced by second-string QB Darell Garretson, who had been the replacement starter the previous season. After dropping an overtime decision to Arkansas State, the Aggies came back to resoundingly defeat #18 BYU in Provo for the first time since 1978, by a score of 35–20. After opening conference play with a win against Air Force, Garretson was lost to a broken wrist in a loss to Colorado State, and replaced by third-string quarterback Craig Harrison, who was injured in the next game. Under the leadership of former scout team quarterback Kent Myers, the team went on to win the next four games, before losing to Boise State to claim a tie for second place in the Mountain Division. Utah State went on to play in the New Mexico Bowl, defeating UTEP 21–6. The Aggies again finished the season with impressive defensive statistics, ranked 12th in scoring defense and 30th in total defense, as well as achieving the second-best record in school history at 10–4.
2015 season
In 2015, Wells led Utah State to six wins and its fifth-straight bowl game as the Aggies had 12 players earn various all-Mountain West honors, which were the third-most in the conference. Furthermore, senior linebacker Kyler Fackrell was named a fourth-team AllAmerican by Phil Steele's Magazine.
Utah State also had five players invited to postseason All-Star games/camps, while three Aggies participated in the NFL Combine in Fackrell, Hunter Sharp and Nick Vigil. Furthermore, USU had two players selected in the 2016 NFL Draft in Vigil and Fackrell, both in the third round, while six other Aggies signed free agent contracts and two more were invited to rookie mini-camps.
2016 season
During the 2016 season, Utah State had six players earn various all-Mountain West honors as it lost five conference games by a combined 29 points (5.8 ppg). USU also had two players invited to postseason AllStar games, while one player was selected in the 2017 NFL Draft in Devante Mays. Furthermore, USU had eight other Aggies who signed free agent contracts.
2017 season
In 2017, Wells led Utah State to six wins and its sixth bowl game in the past seven seasons as the Aggies had six players earn various all-Mountain West honors. Additionally, senior cornerback Jalen Davis became just the ninth first-team All-America in school history and was named an All-American by four different publications, including the Walter Camp Football Foundation, who voted them to their first team. Furthermore, sophomore placekicker Dominik Eberle was named a third-team All-American by Phil Steele's Magazine and was a finalist for the Lou Groza Award, which honors the top placekicker in college football. USU also had two players sign NFL free agent contracts following the season in Davis and Dallin Leavitt, while Braelon Roberts was invited to a rookie mini-camp.
2018 season
In 2018, Utah State recorded one of its best seasons in school history in Wells' final year as the Aggies closed the 2018 campaign ranked 21st in the final Amway Coaches' poll and 22nd in the Associated Press poll. It marked only the fourth time in school history the Aggies, who climbed as high as No. 13 during the regular season, have ended a year among the top-25 schools in the AP poll. The No. 13 ranking was Utah State's highest at any point in a season since the 1961 campaign.
Wells was named the 2018 Mountain West Coach of the Year for the second time during their time in Logan, making them just the fifth Mountain West coach to receive the honor twice in a career, joining the likes of Sonny Lubick, Rocky Long, Urban Meyer and Gary Patterson. Utah State boasted one of the most dynamic offenses in the country in 2018, averaging 47.5 points per game, which only trailed Oklahoma among schools nationally. The Aggies, who also ranked among the national leaders for fewest sacks allowed (4th), total offense (11th), passing efficiency (14th) and passing offense (17th), lighted up scoreboards to the tune of 618 points on the season, snapping the Mountain West and Utah State single-season records in the process.
Overall, the Aggies snapped 34 school records and tied six others during the 2018 season alone, breaking the previous marks for touchdowns (79), points scored (618), points per game (47.5), total offense per game (497.4), yards of total offense (6,466), total passing yards (3,825), completions (303), extra points (75) and yards per kick return (30.3). Utah State also had 29 scoring drives under one minute, nearly double its previous school record.
It wasn't only the offense that pushed the Aggies as Utah State led or shared the national lead in turnovers gained (32), passes intercepted (22), kickoff return average (30.3) and three-and-outs forced (5.7 per game). Utah State finished plus-14 in the turnover margin, ranking third in the FBS for the category.

January 8
Having completed their stay in Egypt, the king and queen arrive in Rome. Two state banquets are here given in the king's honour, and they also have an interview with the pope. While in Italy they visit Milan and a number of other cities, paying special attention to engineering and motor works. From Italy they go through the Riviera to Paris, where they are officially received by the president of the republic. Here, as elsewhere, the official visit is succeeded by a much longer unofficial stay. In the course of February visits are paid to Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany, and on March 13 the royal party crosses over to London, where the crowd gives them an enthusiastic welcome. State banquets are given in the king's honour at Buckingham Palace, the Guildhall, and the Foreign Office, and no effort is spared by the authorities to impress them with the value and sincerity of British friendship. On March 23 they go with Queen Souriyah to Oxford, where a brother of the queen is an undergraduate, and receives there the degree of Doctor of Civil Law.
February 17
On February 17, 11 people were shot dead by unknown assailants in Abu Shakir, a village in Kabul. (Now Wazir Akbar Khan) police speculated that the attackers were Arab militants belonging to Jund Al Farooq, the armed wing of the Ansar Al Farooq anti-Shia group. The motive of the attack is probably because the siege of Jund Al Farooq controlled village of Bani Khalid, (Now Sheerpur) near Abu Shakir, by the Afghani Army.
February 18
On February 18, 23 police officers were shot dead by Jund Al Farooq.
In the evening, 14 Pashtuns were killed by Jund Al Farooq. This angered many Afghans and led to the killing of 43 Arabs. It was also reported that Pashtun militants entered the Jund Al Farooq stronghold of Bani Khalid and massacred 56 Arab residents of the village.
By the end of the day, 61 Arabs and 17 Pashtuns were killed. Jund Al Farooq's leader Mohammad Ahmad was also killed.
February 19
On February 19, Mohammad Ahmad's brother Khalid took control over Jund Al Farooq. By this time, Pashtun militias controlled 2/3 of Bani Khalid.
Khalid's son Omar was killed as Pashtun militias backed by the Afghani Army sieged Jund Al Farooq controlled areas in the village.
By noon, Jund Al Farooq withdrew from the village, however, clashes still occurred between local Arabs and Pashtuns.
By the end of the day, 3 Arabs and 16 Pashtuns were killed.
April 5
The king leaves England for the East of Europe. On their way they find it necessary to stay in Berlin to undergo an operation for tonsillitis. While in Germany they are presented by the German government with a specially upholstered Junkers aeroplane, and discusses with Professor Junkers the subject of an airline between Afghanistan and Persia. From Berlin the king and queen proceed to Warsaw (April 29), and thence two days later to Moscow, where they receive a royal welcome in spite of the anti-royalist professions of their hosts. While in Russia they pay a visit to Leningrad, where they witness the Baltic Fleet manoeuvres at Kronstadt. The next country to be visited is Turkey, which King Amanullah regards with peculiar affection. At a banquet given in their honour at Angora on May 20, President Mustafa Kemal Pasha lays stress on the close ties between the Afghan and Turkish peoples, and King Amanullah replies with a speech expressing admiration of the work accomplished by the president. From Angora the royal party proceeds to Constantinople, and after spending a few days there sail in a Turkish steamer to Batum, with an escort of Turkish and Russian warships. On June 9 they arrive at Tehran, where they are greeted by the shah and their son the valiahd in the presence of large crowds. On June 16 they leave Tehran for Meshed by motor car, and thence journey via Herat, Farah, Kandahar, Mukur, and Ghazni partly by car and partly by aeroplane to Kabul, where they arrive on July 1, after an absence of nearly seven months. A huge crowd has gathered from all parts of the country to welcome them, and their return is made the occasion for great festivities.
April
An agreement is concluded between Afghanistan and Russia for an air service between Kabul and Tashkent.
May 25
A close treaty of friendship and security, to be valid in the first instance for ten years, is concluded between Afghanistan and Turkey.
June
A pretender to the throne, who claims that they are a grandson of the amir Mohammad Yakub, appears in Kabul, but they are soon discovered to be an impostor and secures no following. Other than this, the country has remained perfectly peaceful during the absence of the king.
July
Shortly after the king's return, complaints reach their ear that they have spent on their tour money which could ill be spared from the public treasury. They silence such murmurings by pointing out that they have brought back presents far outweighing in value the expense of the tour. They can also boast truly that they have made Afghanistan known to the world as a country with great potentialities, and one whose friendship is worth cultivating. Among the definite results of their trip they are able to announce the impending conclusion of treaties with thirteen states, agreements with French and German companies to undertake a survey preparatory to the construction of a railroad linking Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, and Kushk, and the acquisition of over 50,000 rifles, over 100 cannon, six model machine guns, six tanks, and five armoured cars. The bulk of this armament, however, does not reach Afghanistan within the year. King Amanullah's tour has impressed on them more strongly than ever the advantages of European civilization. Contact with the great personages of the West has put a keen edge upon their reforming zeal, and they are determined to follow as closely as possible in the footsteps of their distinguished co-religionist, Mustafa Kemal of Turkey. Dazzled by the latter's success, they overlook the fact that there is a fundamental difference between Turkey and Afghanistan: the Turks are a fairly homogeneous people with a long tradition of obedience to a central authority, whereas the Afghans are a conglomeration of diverse tribes accustomed to a certain measure of autonomy and attached to their local customs.  They are advised by the foreigners at their court and the most prudent of their counsellors to proceed slowly with their reforms, but in their eagerness to Westernize the country they resolve to make the pace even more rapidly than their Turkish confrère. The first fruits of the tour are made apparent to their subjects a few days after their return when the queen sits through a state banquet without the purdah or religious veil. The mullahs are greatly scandalized and remonstrate with the king. They point out to them that the working women in the villages do not wear the purdah, and bids them see to their own flocks. They are nonplussed for the moment, but are nevertheless reconciled to the king's innovations.
August
A loya jirga (assembly of the people) is held at Paghman, and discusses a number of the reforms proposed by the king. It is decided among other things to replace the Council of State with a National Assembly of 150 members selected from the Grand Assembly for three years, and to which government servants shall be ineligible; that the period of compulsory military service shall be extended from two to three years and all exemptions abolished; that preaching certificates shall be introduced for Afghan mullahs and that mullahs from neighbouring countries shall be excluded; and that persons entering the government service in future shall not have more than one wife. It is also resolved that Afghanistan shall adopt a tricoloured flag in place of the present black flag, which is said to be an emblem of mourning, not fitting for Afghanistan since they achieved their independence. The king also desires to prohibit the marriage of youths before 22 and girls before 18, but they cannot persuade the assembly to agree to this. Hardly is the jirga over when a number of mullahs begin to preach sedition among the people. The king promptly arrests the ringleaders, and on October 30 the chief kadi of Kabul and three other mullahs are executed. The king meanwhile proceeds with their scheme of reforms. They have already decreed that education up to a certain point shall be compulsory for all and free for the poor. By the end of October several roads and bridges are being constructed, telegraphs and telephones are working between Kabul and the chief towns, and college buildings are being erected in Kabul and Kandahar. For the improvement of the Army, 65 officers have gone to Russia, France, and Italy, and 20 more are to go to England, while a Staff College is to be opened at Khurd Zabitan. For the furtherance of the king's various schemes numerous foreigners are invited to the country. The king is desirous to introduce the system of cabinet government, but Shir Ahmad Khan, to whom they entrusted the task, is unable to form a cabinet, and they have, as they say, to be their own prime minister.
End of November
The reforming activities of the king are brought to a sudden stop by the revolt of the Shinwaris, a powerful tribe in eastern Afghanistan, much under the influence of the mullah of Chaknaur. They assemble in force in the neighbourhood of Jalalabad, and besiege that city. The king finds that in the hour of need they cannot rely upon their army, which is disaffected because its pay is in arrears. They therefore, after some indecisive fighting, begins to parley with the rebels in order to induce them to lay down their arms. A truce of ten days is declared early in December, during which the tribesmen consider the king's proposals. As they do not consent to abandon their reforms, they again take up arms at the end of the truce. At the same time (December 17) other tribesmen, acting apparently without any concert with the Shinwaris, gather in force near Kabul. They are led by a Tajik brigand named Habibullah, but familiarly known as Bacha-i-Saqao or "son of the water-carrier," and are joined by numbers of disaffected persons, both soldiers and others, from Kabul itself. Kabul is reduced to a state of siege, and the king and queen judge it prudent to retire within the Arg, the fortified part of the palace. Although the rebels disclaim any hostility to the members of the British legation, the legation buildings, which are situated outside of the town in the zone of fighting, suffer damage from stray shots. The position being regarded as dangerous, five British aeroplanes on December 23 fly across from Peshawar and take off all the women and children to the number of about a dozen. Between that date and the end of the year the women and children from the other legations are rescued in a similar manner. The gallantry of the British airmen makes a great impression throughout Europe. The Russian women and children are conveyed northwards by Russian aeroplanes.
December 25
Bacha-i-Saqao suddenly retires with their troops to the mountains, and the king considers themselves out of danger; the queen has already made their escape to Kandahar. Their last act in the year is to reward their troops at Kabul with two months' pay and to increase the pay of their bodyguard from 14 to 20 rupees a month. When the new year opens, the king is still retaining a precarious hold upon the throne at Kabul. On the east the Shinwari and other tribes are at Jalalabad debating whether to advance on Kabul or not. For the moment they are parleying with the king's brother-in-law and minister, Ali Ahmad Jan, whose forces, however, are quite insufficient to keep them in check. From the north, Kabul is threatened by Bacha-i-Saqao and their army; though they were beaten off they are still encamped in force about twenty miles (30 km) away.
1928
The first women's organisation in Afghanistan, the Anjuman-i Himayat-i-Niswan, is founded the Queen Soraya Tarzi.

Partition chromatography theory and practice was introduced through the work and publications of Archer Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s. They would later receive the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for their invention of partition chromatography".
Synopsis
The process of separating mixtures of chemical compounds by passing them through a column that contains a solid stationary phase that was eluted with a mobile phase (column chromatography) was well known at that time. Chromatographic separation was considered to occur by an adsorption process whereby compounds adhered to a solid media and were washed off the column with a solvent, mixture of solvents, or solvent gradient. In contrast, Martin and Synge developed and described a chromatographic separation process whereby compounds were partitioned between two liquid phases similar to the separatory funnel liquid-liquid separation dynamic. This was an important departure, both in theory and in practice, from adsorption chromatography.
In liquid-liquid separation, a compound is distributed between two immiscible liquid phases under equilibrium conditions. Martin and Synge initially attempted to devise a method of performing a sequential liquid-liquid extraction with serially connected glass vessels that functioned as separatory funnels. The seminal article presenting their early studies described a rather complicated instrument that allowed partitioning of amino acids between water and chloroform phases. The process was termed "counter-current liquid-liquid extraction." Martin and Synge described the theory of this technique in reference to continuous fractional distillation described by Randall and Longtin. This approach was deemed too cumbersome, so they developed a method of absorbing water onto silica gel as the stationary phase and using a solvent, such as chloroform, as the mobile phase. This work was published in 1941 as "a new form of chromatogram employing two liquid phases." The article describes both the theory in terms of the partition coefficient of a compound, and the application of the process to the separation of amino acids on a water-impregnated silica column eluted with a water:chloroform:n-butanol solvent mixture.
The impact on separation methodology
The previously described work of Martin and Synge impacted the development of the previously known column chromatography and inspired new forms of chromatography such as countercurrent distribution, paper chromatography, and gas-liquid chromatography which is more commonly known as gas chromatography. The modification of silica gel stationary phase led to many creative ways of modifying stationary phases in order to influence the separation characteristics. The most notable modification was the chemical bonding of alkane functional groups to silica gel to produce reversed-phase media. The original problem that Martin and Synge encountered with devising an instrument that would employ two free-flowing liquid phases was solved by Lyman C. Craig in 1944, and commercial counter-current distribution instruments were used for many important discoveries. The introduction of paper chromatography was an important analytical technique which gave rise to thin-layer chromatography. Finally, gas-liquid chromatography, a fundamental technique in modern analytical chemistry, was described by Martin with coauthors A. T. James and G. Howard Smith in 1952.

Trachselwald Castle (German: Schloss Trachselwald) is a castle in the municipality of Trachselwald in the canton of Bern, Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
The name of the rulers of the castle was first mentioned in 1131. The castle itself may date back to the 10th century but the 11th or 12th century is more likely. At first it belonged to the barons of Trachselwald, then to the barons of Rüti bei Lyssach, and then those of Sumiswald. The barons of Sumiswald sold the castle and surrounding lands to the city of Bern. Bern turned the castle into a sheriffhood.
The castle was rebuilt or expanded several times. Its oldest parts are the keep, which was built out of tuff, and one half of the main building. These parts of the castle were built in the second half of the 12th century. The stair tower was probably built by a master craftsman from Prismell in 1641.
During the Swiss peasant war of 1653, the peasant leader Niklaus Leuenberger, who was arrested on June 19, 1653 was held in Castle Trachselwald until being taken to Bern, where they were executed on August 27.
The castle was sacked during the 1798 French invasion, but was not burned. It became the center of administration of the district of Trachselwald.
Trachselwald Castle became a prison where Mennonites were held, some of whom were then executed for their beliefs which differed from the ruling Reformed Protestants. In 2021 an exhibit opened in the castle's prison documenting the oppression of Mennonites in the region.
Castle site
The first castle consisted of a square keep that was about on each side. The walls were up to thick. The keep and outer walls are made of tuff stone cut into roughly squared blocks which indicates construction before 1200. Dating of the beams by dendrochronology indicates that they came from 1251 to 1253. Along with the keep, part of the main building was added during this first construction period. The original keep was probably surrounded by an elliptical ring wall.
In the 14th century the original two-story keep doubled in height. In the 16th or 17th century a palas, dungeon and other buildings were added to the castle. The new additions were built in a Romanesque style, which included larger windows and thinner walls. A stair tower was added in 1641 and a granary was built in 1683. The palas was renovated during the 17th and 18th century into its current appearance. In 1751 a new, more decorative gate house was built along with a french garden.

Eric Peter Gilbert (born 31 July 1983), known as Peter Gilbert, is a Welsh former footballer and current coach.
A defender, Gilbert played in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle, Leicester City, Sheffield Wednesday, Doncaster Rovers, Oldham Athletic, Northampton Town and Southend United, also appearing in the Conference for Lincoln City and briefly in the Northern Premier League for Goole. They represented Wales at under-21 level.
Gilbert is currently coaching Aston Villa Under-21s.
Career
Gilbert began their career at Birmingham City as a trainee but failed to make a first team appearance. They did captain the academy side during their time with the Blues and made many appearances for the reserves. Their progress was hampered by a serious knee injury. Once they recovered the decision was made to make a fresh start at another club. They joined Plymouth Argyle at the beginning of the 2003–04 season on loan, where their performances earned them a permanent move. Once they signed, Gilbert soon proved themselves to be a reliable and steady player and was a mainstay of Argyle's Second Division championship-winning side, playing 40 league games and scoring one goal against Tranmere Rovers. Their only other goal for Plymouth came three days after their goal against Tranmere in a Football League Trophy tie against Bristol City.
This run of form led them to be called up to the Welsh under-21 squad and receiving their first cap. They went on to make 10 appearances in the 2006 UEFA Under-21 Championship qualifying campaign. During this campaign they impressed head coach John Toshack enough to consider them for the senior squad, and was a member of Toshack's senior squad for a six-day training camp in Spain at the end of the 2004–05 season.
They made 38 appearances for Argyle in the Championship during 2004–05. This led to interest from Leicester City manager Craig Levein who signed Gilbert for the start of the 2005–06 season, for a fee in the region of £200,000.
However, Gilbert made just six appearances for Leicester before being loaned to fellow Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in November 2005. They joined Wednesday on a permanent basis in 2006 and, following three years at the club, their contract was terminated by mutual consent on 6 April 2009.
After trials with Huddersfield Town, Southend United and Coventry City, Gilbert joined Oldham Athletic on a short-term contract. However, because the player wanted more stability than was afforded by the week-to-week deal with Oldham, they left before the 1 September transfer deadline to allow them the chance to find a permanent club.
In September 2009, Gilbert had a trial with Conference National side Mansfield Town. After a two-week trial spell in which they played the whole of a reserve game, they signed for League Two club Northampton Town in November until the end of the 2009–10 season.
On 8 July 2010 Gilbert signed a pre contract agreement with Southend United due to the club being under a transfer embargo, on 6 August 2010 Southend's embargo was lifted allowing Gilbert to be registered with the Roots Hall club. Gilbert had previously played under Southend boss Paul Sturrock at Sheffield Wednesday and Plymouth Argyle.
Gilbert picked up an ankle injury in a pre season game against Derby County which forced them to miss the start of the league season. They finally made their debut for the club on 24 August 2010 against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the League Cup. Gilbert made their league debut in Southend's 2–0 win against Bradford City on 27 August 2010. After a 2011–12 season which ended in playoff defeat, the club did not offer Gilbert a new contract.
Gilbert joined Conference National club Lincoln City on non-contract terms in October 2012. They went on to sign a short-term contract which was later extended to the end of the season. At the end of March, they joined Dagenham & Redbridge on loan until the end of the season. In January 2014, they signed for Northern Premier League First Division South club Goole, managed by their former teammate Curtis Woodhouse. Later that year, they travelled to California where they played in two friendly matches for USL Pro club Sacramento Republic.
Coaching career
After the end of their playing career, Gilbert joined West Bromwich Albion Academy as a coach. Working with various age groups over an eight-year spell – ultimately acting as U18s manager from 2019 to 2022.
In August 2022, Gilbert joined Aston Villa Academy as a Under-21s coach.

SaneBox is an email management software as a service that integrates with IMAP and Exchange Web Services (EWS) email accounts. Its primary function is to filter email messages that it deems unimportant into a folder for later processing.
History
SaneBox is a self-funded company with locations in Boston, Massachusetts, and Venice, California. It was founded by Stuart Roseman in 2010 in response to articles written by Bijan Sabet, Fred Wilson (financier) and Michael Arrington. As an entrepreneur, Roseman previously founded and sold other companies, including Gamesville and Gamelogic. In 2012, SaneBox announced SaneBox for Business in a shift toward becoming more business-to-business focused.
Operation
SaneBox integrates with a user's email server and analyzes past email usage in order to infer what emails are important. Messages deemed important remain in the inbox, while those deemed unimportant are filtered into a different folder for later reference. The algorithms and filtering are primarily based on the email sender, the subject line and the timestamp. A second type of filtering deletes incoming emails from designated senders, a feature that is intended to serve a similar purpose to unsubscribing from email lists. Other functions of the service including "snoozing," or deferring, emails, and a Dropbox integration that moves email attachments of a certain size into Dropbox and replaces them with the Dropbox link. Similar attachment support is available for Box, EverNote, Google Drive and IBM SmartCloud.

Bug Off! is a single screen fixed shooter for the Atari 8-bit family written by Sparky Starks and published by Adventure International in 1982. QuelleSoft released the game in Germany as Kampf dem Ungeziefer ("Fight the Bugs") in 1984.
Gameplay
The object of Bug Off! is to control a variety of bugs that swarm out of a Florida sinkhole and endanger the player's garden.
The player controls a chemical sprayer, which can be moved on all four outer edges of the gameplay window. The sprayer will always point towards the center of the screen, where the garden resides. Only the wasps and spiders are dangerous to the player. They eat all the player's DDT supplies and thus end the game. The player tries to hold out until nightfall, when the butterflies appear, which reward the player bonus points for every corner that has remained free and also the army will drop in a new supply of the DDT.
When the player is hit, they will lose their current can of DDT from their sprayer, and a second can will be thrown to the center of the garden, destroying all bugs on the map. When all lives are lost, it's game over.
Reception
The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 concluded: "The sound and graphics are poor in Bug Off!; then again, it isn't the type of game that needed better graphics. Game play is instinctively reflex rather than strategy oriented. It is a lightening fast repetitive game, but that doesn't mean it leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment". Overall Bug Off! received a D+ review.

Arun Kumar Pati is an Indian physicist notable for their research in quantum information and computation, the theory of geometric phases and its applications, as well as Foundations of quantum mechanics. They have made pioneering contributions in the area of quantum information.
Education
Arun K Pati completed their schooling from the Hari-Hara High School Aska, Ganjam, Odisha in 1981. They studied their bachelor's degree from Aska Science College, Aska during 1981–1985. They completed their master's degree in physics from Berhampur University, Odisha, in 1987. Subsequently, in 1988, they joined the Training School Program at BARC, Mumbai, India.
Career
Originally from the state of Odisha in India, Pati obtained their PhD from the University of Bombay, Mumbai. In 1989, they took up a position as a theoretical physicist in the Theoretical Physics Division, BARC, Mumbai, India. Since 1989, they have been working on quantum theory, quantum computing and quantum information. From 1998 to 2000, they were a visiting scientist and an EPSRC fellow at the University of Wales, Bangor, UK. They were a visiting scientist at the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, India from 2001 to 2010. Currently, they are a professor of quantum information at the Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad, India since 2011.  They are honored with K. P. Chair Professorship at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China during the period 2013–2015.  They are an adjunct professor at IISER, Mohali.
Work
Along with Samuel L. Braunstein, they proved the quantum no-deleting theorem. Similar to the no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem is a fundamental consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics. This proves that given two copies of an unknown quantum state we cannot delete one copy. The no-cloning and the no-deleting theorems suggest that we can neither create nor
destroy quantum information. Their other important collaborative work with Braunstein includes the quantum no-hiding theorem. This states that if quantum information is lost from one subsystem then it remains in the rest of the universe and cannot be hidden in the quantum correlation between the original system and the environment. This has applications that include quantum teleportation, quantum state randomization, thermalization and the black hole information loss paradox. The no-hiding theorem has been experimentally tested and this is a clear demonstration of the conservation of quantum information.
Pati also discovered the remote state preparation (RSP) protocol in quantum information theory. This is an important quantum communication scheme similar to quantum teleportation. In RSP protocol, Alice can prepare a known qubit chosen from special ensemble at Bob's location
using a maximally entangled state and one bit of classical communication. This has been experimentally tested by several groups.
Pati along with Artur Ekert, Vlatko Vedral and other scientists have introduced the concept of geometric phase for mixed states. This has been experimentally measured by several groups around the world. In another fundamental work, Pati along with L. Maccone have discovered stronger uncertainty relations that go beyond the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. These new relations capture the notion of incompatible observables and show that quantum world is more uncertain than what Heisenberg-Robertson's uncertainty relation has explicated us.
Honors
Pati is the recipient of the India Physics Association Award for Young Physicist of the Year (2000) and the Indian Physical Society Awards for Young Scientists (1996).  They are also recipient of Samanta Chandra Sekhar Award for the year 2009 from Orissa Bigyan Academy, Bhubaneswar, Odisha.  They are an elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Science, Bangalore. They also have been elected as the Fellow of The National Academy of Sciences, India in 2013.

Kalekovets () is a village in Maritsa Municipality, Plovdiv Province, Bulgaria. As of 2006 it has 2,613 inhabitants.
Geography
The village is 14 km northeast of Plovdiv. Nearer to Plovdiv is the village Voivodinovo, and after Kalekovets the village Stryama. The town Rakovski is also located in the vicinity. The village itself is 180 meters above sea level and is almost in the center of the Upper Thracian Plane. Its area is 17,000 ha. Near the village, at about 1 km northeast, the river Stryama can be found.
History
The village was created at around 1711 by a Turkish feudal lord, who hired 17 workers to work on their land. Later, they gave them land and they settled there and began 17 families.
During the ages, the land was covered in trees: oaks, elms, and other evergreens, which helped the villagers to make charcoal and were sold outside the village as well.
Culture
There is a community center in which citizens can learn traditional dances and singing. The library is also located in the building. Around 380 children attend the village's school.
Celebrations
On 24 May, a traditional festival is held in Kalekovets.
Notable people
Maria Atanasova is the first woman commander of a heavy-type airplane in the world and the first commander of a nuclear-powered passenger airplane in Bulgaria.

Rusty Rivets is a Canadian 3D CGI animated television series, and is produced by Arc Productions and Spin Master Entertainment. Rusty Rivets aired for three seasons, simultaneously on Treehouse TV in Canada and on Nickelodeon in the U.S., from November 8, 2016, to May 8, 2020. Inspired by elements of the maker culture, it follows the adventures of a young inventor named Rusty and their team of customized robots.
The first season was the last animated project of Arc Productions before it was absorbed into Jam Filled Toronto in August 2016.
Plot
A young boy named Rusty Rivets uses their knowledge of engineering to repurpose machine parts and create gadgets. They live in the city of Sparkton Hills along with their friend Ruby Ramirez, a robotic tyrannosaurid named Botasaur, and a group of smaller robots known as the Bits. The show highlights a variety of concepts related to basic science and technology.
Rusty uses the recurring catch phrase "modify, customize, Rustify" when personalizing inventions. Ruby changes the last word to "Rubify" when they do the alterations (only once), and Liam changes the last word to "Liamify" when they do it (also only once).

The Spiez–Zweisimmen railway is a single-track standard-gauge line in Switzerland that is currently operated by BLS AG. It was formerly owned by the Spiez-Erlenbach-Zweisimmen-Bahn (SEZ), also called the Simmentalbahn (Simme Valley Railway). The line runs from through the Simmental to Zweisimmen. It is marketed as part of the GoldenPass Line between and , which also includes the metre-gauge Brünig Railway and Montreux–Lenk im Simmental railway and part of the standard-gauge Lake Thun Railway.
The SEZ was formed on 1 January 1942 from the merger of the Spiez-Erlenbach-Bahn (SEB), which opened the line from Spiez to Erlenbach on 16 August 1897, and the Erlenbach-Zweisimmen-Bahn (EZB), which opened the line from Erlenbach to Zweisimmen on 31 October 1902.
In June 1997, the SEZ merged with the Gürbetal-Bern-Schwarzenburg-Bahn (GBS), the Bern-Neuenburg-Bahn (BN) and the Berner Alpenbahn-Gesellschaft Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon (BLS) to form the BLS Lötschbergbahn, which itself merged with the Regionalverkehr Mittelland to form the BLS AG in 2006.
In Zweisimmen there is a connection to the narrow-gauge Montreux–Lenk im Simmental railway of the Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway (MOB), which runs from Lake Geneva to Lenk im Simmental. Local services operate hourly over the line. Regional Express services operate every two hours.

Universal Shopping Center, formerly Universal Mall and Universal City, is a redeveloped open-air power center located in Warren, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first phase opened in mid-2009 with Target, Burlington Coat Factory, Marshalls, and Petco.
History
Development was announced in 1962 for a site formerly occupied by a farm. Montgomery Ward was confirmed as the first anchor tenant at this point. The original mall opened in 1965 as Universal City with Montgomery Ward, Woolworth, and Federal's as its anchor stores. In 1980, Federal's went out of business and was replaced that same year by Crowley's. The opening of Crowley's coincided with a mall-wide renovation that included installation of new floors, ceilings, and seating areas throughout the concourses. A western wing with Mervyns was added to the mall in 1988, and shortly afterward, the eastern wing was renovated to include a movie theater and food court.
In 1997, the F. W. Woolworth chain closed the last of its stores, leaving a large vacancy in the northern wing. Three years later, Montgomery Ward closed the last of its stores as well. Also in 1999, Value City acquired the Crowley's location at Universal Mall and two other Detroit-area malls and renamed them Crowley's Value City before dropping the Crowley's name entirely. Many of Universal Mall's major chain tenants either moved to other malls, or closed up entirely. By the end of the 1990s, Universal Mall's occupancy was below 35%, and it became a dead mall.
Universal Mall Properties acquired the mall in 1999, and mall renovations began soon afterward. Burlington Coat Factory opened that year, displacing the former Woolworth and most of the other stores in the northern wing; A.J. Wright opened a year later in a space formerly occupied by Ben Franklin in 1997. Plans were also made to divide the former Montgomery Ward space into smaller shops. Eventually, occupancy at Universal Mall rebounded to 75%, although by 2007 it had declined to 48% (in part due to the closure of Mervyns' Michigan operations in 2006).
The mall was closed in June 2008 and demolition began on the 23rd of that month, leaving only the Burlington Coat Factory, AJ Wright, theater and former Value City. The rest has been replaced by a strip containing 35 tenants, including Petco and Target. The last remaining tenant held over from when the mall was enclosed was Cinemark, which operated the movie theater since it opened in 1991 until it closed in mid-2016. It reopened as a location of MJR Theatres in late 2016. AJ Wright has since re-branded as Marshalls.

Two human polls comprised the 1970 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.

Rebecca Alban Hoffberger (born September 25, 1952, Baltimore, Maryland) is the founder and director of the American Visionary Art Museum, America's official national museum for outsider art, located in Baltimore, Maryland. A colorful public figure, they have been called “the P. T. Barnum of the outsider art world“.
Biography
Rebecca Alban Hoffberger was born in a “leafy middle-class suburb” of Baltimore, Maryland to Allen, a mechanical engineer, and Peggy Alban, a homemaker. As a child, they suffered a bout with rheumatic fever which left them with painful episodes in their legs and periodic paralysis. "During these periods of illness, Hoffberger found Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses particularly comforting and therapeutic. They also enjoyed more macabre literature, however, and was drawn to fellow-Baltimorean Edgar Allan Poe at an early age." At age 16, they were accepted to college but turned down the offer to study with the celebrated French mime Marcel Marceau in Paris, becoming the first American ever to do so. In a 2013 Baltimore Magazine article, Hoffberger said, “My parents wanted me to stay in Baltimore and learn to be a secretary or have a practical fallback, but they were very accepting.” While living in Paris, they met and married a ballet dancer who would become their first husband, and after moving back to the United States, gave birth to a daughter, Belina. Hoffberger worked as a development consultant to both a literary society and a ballet company, as well as holding a position at the Boulder Free School in Colorado before eventually moving to Mexico with their daughter. While in Mexico, they met and married their second husband, Andrija Puharich, a notable physician and parapsychologist who was studying traditional healing practices. (Puharich is perhaps best known for bringing Israeli psychic Uri Geller to the United States.) Hoffberger spent three years with Puharich helping to deliver babies in remote mountain areas in the state of Morelos, and although this marriage also ended, it produced Hoffberger's second daughter, Athena.
After making their way back to Baltimore, Hoffberger began work as the development director for Sinai Hospital's "People Encouraging People," a program which provided support to institutionalized psychiatric patients in facilitating their return to the community. They then married their third husband, LeRoy E. Hoffberger — a wealthy attorney and heir of a philanthropic Baltimore family that formerly owned a brewery and a stake in the Baltimore Orioles — who was 27 years their senior. Hoffberger spoke fondly of the psychiatric patients in a 1995 interview with American Style, "I was so impressed with their imagination. I looked at their strengths, not their illness." It was while working with this program that Hoffberger began to develop the idea for a “visionary” museum, the idea which eventually blossomed into the American Visionary Art Museum, or “AVAM.”
Development of the museum
After working with patients at Sinai Hospital's “People Encouraging People” program, Hoffberger became focused on developing their idea of a "visionary museum”—a facility that would specialize in showcasing the work of self-taught, "visionary" artists, and serve as an education center that emphasized intuitive, creative invention. While developing the idea for the museum, Hoffberger visited Jean Dubuffet's Collection de l'Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland, accompanied by their husband, who eventually became the museum co-founder. During this visit, Rebecca was greatly impressed by Dubuffet's use of "non art-speak," along with personal artist bios that emphasized the simple facts of the artists' lives, their creative visions, and the use of the artist's own words. Upon returning to Baltimore, Hoffberger collaborated with the George Ciscle Gallery in Baltimore to mount two successful shows, the first of which featured matchstick artist Gerald Hawkes.
In February 1989, the American Visionary Art Museum (AVAM) was incorporated as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The City of Baltimore offered the organization exclusive development rights on the property located at 800 Key Highway—formerly the 1913 offices to the Baltimore Copper Paint Company and an adjacent historic whiskey warehouse—contingent on design, neighborhood approval and obtaining full project funding. Hoffberger began fundraising efforts and received an initial $250,000 planning grant from USF&G, soon followed by a cumulative $2.4 million challenge grant from the Zanvyl & Isabelle Krieger Foundation, matched by many generous private and public grants, along with $1.3 million in bonds issued by The State of Maryland to finance the construction. Otto Billig, M.D. and Edward Adamson (the first proponent of art therapy in Britain) each gifted their important research archives and library collections to AVAM (Billig gifted the museum 400 pieces of art created by mental patients). This same year, Rebecca and LeRoy Hoffberger were married. In 1992, additional contributions for the museum came from The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick and Gordon Roddick. In 1995, LeRoy sold their collection of German Expressionist art via Christie's to top off final monies needed for the museum, a gift that would ensure that the museum could open debt-free.
On November 24, 1995, the American Visionary Art Museum opened to the public. In their inaugural address, Hoffberger stated that “...the American Visionary Art Museum opens its doors of perception not in an effort to make war on academic or institutionalized learning, but to create a place where the best of self-taught, intuitive contributions of all kinds will be duly recognized, explored, and then championed in a clear strong voice." This statement is echoed in the museum's Seven Education Goals, penned by Hoffberger, which serve as part of the museum's mission to function as an education center for “visionary art.” These goals were also adopted by The Lower East Side Girls Club when it was founded in 1996.
AVAM's Seven Educational Goals:
Expand the definition of a worthwhile life.
Engender respect for and delight in the gift of others.
Increases awareness of the wide variety of choices available in life for all, particularly students.
Encourage each individual to build upon their or their own special knowledge and inner strengths.
Promote the use of innate intelligence, intuition, self-exploration and creative self-reliance.
Confirm the great hunger for finding out just what each of us can do best, in our voice, at any age.
Empower the individual to choose to do that something really, really well
Today, the museum is known internationally and welcomes over 100,000 visitors annually. In a 2012 article for Maryland Life Magazine, Donya Curie wrote “...in a world where the average earned income—money taken in directly through admission prices and rental fees for weddings, etc.—for an art museum is 29 percent, AVAM reached an all-time record of 72 percent in 2011. “It's just about unheard of,” Hoffberger says proudly." In the same article, Hoffberger also said, “I think a good museum does more than just have objects that stand there on pedestals. The great ones are all muse-based, connecting viewers to the heart of inspiration." In a 2013 NEA Arts Magazine interview, they remarked, "Visionaries perceive potential and creative relationships where most of us don't. Without visionaries' willingness to be called fools, to make mistakes, to be wrong, few new 'right' things would ever be birthed.”
Awards and accolades
In 1998, Hoffberger was elected and served as a member of the Baltimore City Chamber of Commerce. The previous year, they won The Urban Land Institute's coveted National Award for Excellence, and in 1996, they received the prestigious Gold Meir Award from Israel Bonds. In addition to Honorary Doctorates from McDaniel College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Stevenson University, and Maryland Institute College of Art, Hoffberger was awarded the title of “Dame” for their work on behalf of establishing medical field hospitals in Nigeria. They have been the recipient of numerous mental health advocacy and equal opportunity awards and has served as a Director of Jewish Education and on the Board of The Elisabeth Kubler-Ross Center, and has also been a featured speaker at many events, including 2009‘s TEDxMidAtlantic.

Criticism
At the time of the museum's 1995 opening, it was reported that Hoffberger's rejection of academic scholarship and their refusal to follow tradition had upset prominent members of the art world. Hoffberger is known as a renegade in the art world, assuming a posture of self-conscious eccentricity. But they have been criticized for their lack of interest in conventional art history and conventional museum practices. (For example, they refuse to hire a professional art curator.) A 2000 article in The New York Times quoted an art authority who referred to them as “a self-aggrandizing dilettante rather than a serious champion of the works their museum exhibits”.
Despite all this, the museum has won the support of collectors, critics, and the public through its exhibitions that examine the relationship of art to the human condition rather than to the canon of art history. Since its inception, Hoffberger has shied away from certain conventional museum practices, something which is a point of pride for the museum. Instead of hiring a professional art curator, they prefer to use guest curators for each of the museum's exhibitions, which instead of focusing on the work of just one artist, are thematic in nature.

William St Clair (died circa 1379) was a Scottish noble and by tradition the 8th Baron of Roslin.
Early life
William St Clair was the son of Sir William St Clair and the grandson of Henry St Clair who was traditionally the 7th Baron of Roslin. Their father was one of the knights chosen to join James Douglas, Lord of Douglas in their expedition to Palestine with the heart of Robert the Bruce where in an encounter with the Saracens, in the Emirate of Granada, Douglas was killed, along with St Clair. The younger William St Clair therefore succeeded their grandfather.
Baron of Roslin
They were in minority at the time of the death of their father and grandfather and they were recorded in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland dated August 8, 1348. An annuity of 40 merks that had been granted to their grandfather Henry was confirmed to William St Clair by David II of Scotland at Perth on September 17, 1358. They also received a charter from King David that was dated February 11, 1358 and confirmed in 1363 for the lands of Merton and Merchamyston. In 1388, William St Clair proceeded to Continental Europe to join the crusade against the Prussians. It is recorded by historian Patrick Fraser Tytler that William St Clair along with Sir William Keith the Earl Marischal, Sir Alexander Lindsay, Sir Robert Gifford, and Sir Alexander Montgomery marched through England each with a train of 60 horse and a strong body of foot soldiers heading for the Continent eager for distinction in foreign wars that did not concern them when their own country needed them most. 19th century historian Roland Saint-Clair quotes several charters as evidence to show that William St Clair returned safely from the Continent.

William St. Clair married Isabella, second daughter and eventually the sole heiress of Malise V, Earl of Strathearn, Earl of Orkney and Earl of Caithness. They had a son, Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, who was in minority when their father died.

The Ewald sphere is a geometric construction used in electron, neutron, and X-ray crystallography which demonstrates the relationship between:
the wavevector of the incident and diffracted x-ray beams,
the diffraction angle for a given reflection,
the reciprocal lattice of the crystal
It was conceived by Paul Peter Ewald, a German physicist and crystallographer. Ewald themselves spoke of the sphere of reflection.
Ewald's sphere can be used to find the maximum resolution available for a given x-ray wavelength and the unit cell dimensions. It is often simplified to the two-dimensional "Ewald's circle" model or may be referred to as the Ewald sphere.
Ewald construction
A crystal can be described as a lattice of points of equal symmetry. The requirement for constructive interference in a diffraction experiment means that in momentum or reciprocal space the values of momentum transfer where constructive interference occurs also form a lattice (the reciprocal lattice). For example, the reciprocal lattice of a simple cubic real-space lattice is also a simple cubic structure. Another example, the reciprocal lattice of an FCC crystal real-space lattice is a BCC structure, and vice versa. The aim of the Ewald sphere is to determine which lattice planes (represented by the grid points on the reciprocal lattice) will result in a diffracted signal for a given wavelength, , of incident radiation.
The incident plane wave falling on the crystal has a wave vector whose length is . The diffracted plane wave has a wave vector . If no energy is gained or lost in the diffraction process (it is elastic) then has the same length as . The difference between the wave-vectors of diffracted and incident wave is defined as scattering vector . Since and have the same length the scattering vector must lie on the surface of a sphere of radius . This sphere is called the Ewald sphere.
The reciprocal lattice points are the values of momentum transfer where the Bragg diffraction condition is satisfied and for diffraction to occur the scattering vector must be equal to a reciprocal lattice vector. Geometrically this means that if the origin of reciprocal space is placed at the tip of then diffraction will occur only for reciprocal lattice points that lie on the surface of the Ewald sphere.
Applications
Small scattering-angle limit
When the wavelength of the radiation to be scattered is much smaller than the spacing between atoms, the Ewald sphere radius becomes large compared to the spatial frequency of atomic planes. This is common, for example, in transmission electron microscopy. In this approximation, diffraction patterns in effect illuminate planar slices through the origin of a crystal's reciprocal lattice. However, it is important to note that while the Ewald sphere may be quite flat, a diffraction pattern taken perfectly aligned down a zone axis (high-symmetry direction) contains precisely zero spots that exactly satisfy the Bragg condition. As one tilts a single crystal with respect to the incident beam, diffraction spots wink on and off as the Ewald sphere cuts through one zero order Laue zone (ZOLZ) after another.

Arthur C. Nelson is an American urban planner, researcher and academic.  They are Professor of Urban Planning and Real Estate Development at the University of Arizona.
Nelson's research has been focused on metropolitan development policy and planning, applied demographic and economic analysis, fiscal impact assessment, public facility planning and finance, growth management/smart growth, urban development/redevelopment analysis and policy, real estate development policy, suburban and exurban development patterns, and economic development.
Nelson is a fellow of the American Institute of Certified Planners, a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences and a fellow of the Growth and Infrastructure Consortium. They have also served as editor of Housing Policy Debate and associate editor of Journal of the American Planning Association and the Journal of Urban Affairs.
Education
Nelson received their B.Sc. in Political Science from Portland State University in 1972. While a consultant in planning and development along the West Coast, they continued their education at Portland State University, completing the Master of Urban Studies in Public Administration in 1976 and the Ph.D. in Urban Studies with concentrations in regional planning and regional science in 1984.
Career
After completing their Ph.D. in 1984, became Visiting Assistant Professor of Regional and Community Planning at Kansas State University. In 1985, they joined the University of New Orleans as assistant professor of urban and public affairs where, in 1986, they founded the Division of Urban Research and Policy Studies Research and was founding director of the university's undergraduate minor in urban studies and served as adjunct professor of social work at Southern University at New Orleans. In 1987, Nelson joined the Georgia Institute of Technology as Associate Professor of City Planning and in 1988 became jointly appointed as Associate Professor of Public Policy. In 1989, they founded the Graduate Certificate in Land Development. In 1991, Nelson founded the College of Architecture graduate co-op program. In 1992, they were promoted to Full Professor in the College of Architecture and the Ivan College of Liberal Arts at Georgia Tech. In 2002, as adjunct professor of law at Georgia State University, Nelson co-founded a dual degree program between the Master of City and Regional Planning degree at Georgia Tech and the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at Georgia State University.
In 2002, Nelson left Georgia Tech to join the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University as a Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning. There they founded the Urban Affairs and Planning Program at the Alexandria Center and served as its director until 2006 when they became the Co-Director of Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. In 2005, they created the university's first graduate dual degree, called 'sequential degree', programs. They also served as the Founding Director of Planning Academy at Virginia Tech.
Nelson left Virginia Tech in 2008 to join the University of Utah as Presidential Professor of City and Metropolitan Planning. There they founded the Master of Real Estate Development program, the doctoral program in Metropolitan Planning, Policy and Design, and the Metropolitan Research Center. They also served as adjunct professor of finance in the David Eccles School of Business. In 2014, they became Presidential Professor Emeritus at the University of Utah and was appointed Professor of Urban Planning and Real Estate Development at the University of Arizona. From 2014 to 2016, they were the Associate Dean of Research and Discovery for the College of Architecture, Planning and Landscape Architecture at Arizona. In 2016 they were extended an additional appointment as Professor of Geography, Development and Environment in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences.
There are numerous endowed positions and scholarships in Nelson's name including the Arthur C. Nelson Fellowship supporting women, people of color and indigenous descent, veterans, disabled persons, and members of the LGBTQ community studying planning awarded by the American Planning Association, the Arthur C. Nelson and Clark Ivory Doctoral Fellowship in metropolitan planning, policy and design students at the University of Utah, and the Arthur C. Nelson Fellowship in Urban Planning and Real Estate Development at the University of Arizona.
Research and work
Nelson is widely known for their work in several fields such as growth management/smart growth, suburban/exurban analysis, applied demographic and economic analysis to understand the future of metropolitan development patterns, and the theory and practice of development mitigation. With James B. Duncan, Nelson co-wrote Growth Management Principles and Practices. It explains growth management at the local, county, regional, and state levels, including an overall theory of growth management to mitigate externalities associated with underpriced infrastructure, conflicting land uses, and tax policies that subsidize urban sprawl.
With Thomas W. Sanchez, Nelson identified many of the causes and consequences of exurbanization. While some have argued that exurbia exists because exurbanites have different housing and location preferences than suburbanites, Nelson's research has shown that exurbia is nothing more than the suburbanization of the suburbs.
With James C. Nicholas and Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer, Nelson has advanced the application of proportionate share impact fees to mitigate the adverse effects of development on public facilities.
Nelson is also known for applying demographic and economic trends to understand how America's metropolitan areas are changing. One of their key findings is that by the middle 2000s there were already more homes on large suburban lots than the market may need by the middle 2020s. Kaid Benfield wrote that Nelson predicted the 2007 collapse of the housing market because of oversupply of key housing types. According to Ellen Dunham-Jones, Nelson shows that for most metropolitan areas, perhaps all new development needs can be met on existing parking lots and existing low density/intensity developed sites.
Nelson's recent work explores the interaction between public transit, land use patterns, economic development, and demographic settlement patterns.
In 2019, Nelson's h-index was 51.

A tactile pad is an area of skin that is particularly sensitive to pressure, temperature, or pain. Tactile pads are characterized by high concentrations of free nerve endings. In primates, the last phalanges in the fingers and toes have tactile pads, allowing very accurate manipulation of objects. This precision grip was an important evolutionary advance in primates.

The Fortsas hoax refers to an incident in Binche, Belgium, in 1840. That year, booksellers, intellectuals, librarians, and collectors of rare books throughout Europe received a catalogue describing a collection of rare books to be auctioned.
According to the message, "Jean Nepomucene Auguste Pichauld, Comte de Fortsas", had been a collector of unique books — books of which only one copy was known to exist. When they had died, on September 1, 1839, they had possessed 52 such books. Their heirs, not interested in collecting books, had decided to auction the collection. The auction was to be held on August 10, 1840.
On the appointed date, numerous collectors and intellectuals gathered in Binche, hoping to bid on the books. They learned, however, that the offices of the notary where the auction was to take place did not exist — nor did the street upon which the offices were supposedly located. Notices which had been posted around Binche claimed that there would be no auction after all, because the town's public library had acquired the books; however, those attempting to visit the library to view the collection discovered that Binche possessed no public library. Later it was discovered that there had never been a Comte de Fortsas.
It was eventually revealed that the hoax had been planned and carried out by antiquarian and retired military officer Renier Hubert Ghislain Chalon, who enjoyed playing elaborate pranks on intellectuals.
Ironically, the original catalogue of fictitious unique books Chalon had sent to their victims has itself become a sought-after collectors' item. It has since been reprinted several times.

The International Directory of Philosophy is an online database containing information on university philosophy departments, research centers, professional societies, journals, and philosophy publishers in approximately 130 countries. It was established by the Philosophy Documentation Center in 2010 through the consolidation of the Directory of American Philosophers and International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers. This database is notable as an extensive collection of edited information about continuing philosophical activity world wide. It contains over 37,000 listings.
History
The Directory of American Philosophers was established in 1963 by Prof. Archie Bahm at the University of New Mexico as a guide to on-going philosophical activity in the US and Canada. It contains edited listings for university and college philosophy programs, research centers, professional societies, philosophical journals, and publishers. It has been published by the Philosophy Documentation Center since 1972 and is now in its 29th edition (2018-2019).
The International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers was established in 1965 under the auspices of the International Institute of Philosophy with the aid of UNESCO. The founding editors were Gilbert Varet (Centre de Documentation Philosophique - Université de Besançon), and Paul Kurtz (State University of New York at Buffalo). The first edition was also known as the Repertoire international de la philosophie et des philosophes. It has been published by the Philosophy Documentation Center since 1972 and is now in its 21st edition (2019-2020).
The data collection and editorial procedures established for publication of these print directories were adapted by Philosophy Documentation Center to support the production of the online International Directory of Philosophy.

Robert Gruntal Nathan (January 2, 1894 – May 25, 1985) was an American novelist and poet.
Biography
Nathan was born into a prominent New York Sephardic family. They were educated in the United States and Switzerland and attended Harvard University for several years beginning in 1912. It was there that they began writing short fiction and poetry. However, they never graduated, choosing instead to drop out and take a job at an advertising firm to support their family (he married while a junior at Harvard). It was while working in 1919 that they wrote their first novel—the semi-autobiographical work Peter Kindred—which was a critical failure. But their luck soon changed during the 1920s, when they wrote seven more novels, including The Bishop's Wife, which was later made into a successful film starring Cary Grant, David Niven, and Loretta Young in 1947.
During the 1930s, their success continued with more works, including fictional pieces and poetry. Their 1933 novel One More Spring was filmed in 1935. In 1940, they wrote their most successful book, Portrait of Jennie, about a Depression-era artist and the woman they are painting, who is slipping through time. Portrait of Jennie is considered a modern masterpiece of fantasy fiction and was made into a film, starring Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten.
In 1942 Nathan wrote a poem "Dunkirk: A Ballad", then became a screenwriter for MGM, where they added additional poetry to update Alice Duer Miller's poem for the film The White Cliffs of Dover (1944). They then wrote the screenplay of The Clock (1945), in which they had a cameo role. Their screenplay for 3 Godfathers (1948) was rejected, but they made contributions to the screenplay of Pagan Love Song (1950).
In January 1956 the author wrote, as well as narrated, an episode of the CBS Radio Workshop, called "A Pride of Carrots, or Venus Well-Served".
Nathan's seventh wife was the British actor Anna Lee, to whom they were married from 1970 until their death. They came from a talented family—the activist Maud Nathan and author Annie Nathan Meyer were their aunts, and the poet Emma Lazarus and Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo their cousins.

Antonio Santiago Rodríguez (born March 9, 1950) — better known as Tony the Marine or as Tony Santiago — is a United States Marine veteran, writer, and military historian from New York City, New York, focused mostly on the military history of Puerto Rico and its service members.
Santiago was recognized by the 23rd Senate of Puerto Rico for being "one of the main contributors of content related to Puerto Rico in the open online encyclopedia known as Wikipedia". The Senate also recognized them as one of the main writers on subjects which relate to Puerto Rico, and an important historian of the Puerto Rican military experience. According to Phoebe Ayers, member of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, this may be the first time that the English Wikipedia has been mentioned in a parliamentary or congressional resolution or a formal governmental award.
Early years
Santiago was born in New York City, to Joaquín Santiago and Hilda Rodríguez-Mattei, both of Puerto Rican origin. Santiago graduated from high school in New York City and after being accepted to Columbia University, Santiago chose to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps instead.
Military service
Santiago served with the 2nd Battalion 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division in the Vietnam War in the 81 MM Mortar, and later in the Military Police as well.
While in the Marines, Santiago perceived significant ethnic, racial, and national origin discrimination. In response to this, they formed an organization composed of American soldiers of Latino descent. The organization, named Latin Power in Unity, included soldiers of Puerto Rican, Mexican, Central American and other Latino backgrounds.
Santiago also developed a close friendship with Leroy Reese who had formed a similar organization named "Black Power" for Black soldiers. Both men worked closely for the equal treatment of minorities and to improve relations between their members and the members of other ethnic groups in their company. An interview about Santiago's experience in the military, collectively made by author Greg Boudonek and Santiago himself, was published in the book Puertorriquenos Who Served With Guts, Glory, and Honor: Fighting to Defend a Nation Not Completely Their Own.
Upon finishing their tour with the U.S. Marine Corps in 1975, Santiago enrolled at the Interamerican University in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. They graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Business Administration in 1979. In Puerto Rico, they met Milagros and married them in 1971 and had three children together.
Military historian
In 1990, Santiago moved to Phoenix, Arizona, with their wife and children. At this point they reflected, "the only role models and heroes for Latino children were El Zorro, the Cisco Kid and Speedy Gonzales and," they said, "school textbooks failed to mention the many contributions that Latinos had made to the formation of our country [the United States]."
In response, Santiago began publishing a series of short articles about the contributions that Puerto Ricans had made to the American society.  They are the editor of the Puerto Rican Military History Channel of the monthly internet magazine El Boricua, a staff writer in the internet magazine Somos Primos and the official historian of the Association of Naval Services Officers (ANSO).
Their early published work focused on military history, but later they expanded their research and documentation to include many other facets of the Puerto Rican life experience.
In April 2010, Santiago discovered and wrote about Lt. Augusto Rodriguez a Puerto Rican who served in the American Civil War. It was the first time that a link in the American Civil War was made between Puerto Rico and the United States. Rodriguez was thus the first known Puerto Rican veteran of the United States Armed Forces. The significance of this discovery is that, until then, it was believed that Puerto Ricans had not served in the United States military prior to World War I. Puerto Rico's Secretary of State, Kenneth D. McClintock, named Santiago "Puerto Rico's foremost military historian."
Santiago is among the people who were interviewed and who are featured in the documentary On Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam; directed and produced by Los Angeles-based filmmaker Mylene Moreno. The documentary, which aired on PBS on September 22, 2015, examines the Latino experience during the Vietnam War. They were interviewed, together with fellow veteran Oscar Urrea, by PBS Horizante host Jose Cardenas and Univision newscaster Jorge Valenzuela, where they expressed their personal experiences, prior to the showing of the documentary.
Other works
In addition to their military history research and writing, Santiago is also a free lance photojournalist for The Arizona Republic.  They are also a member of the national steering committee of "Borinqueneers Congressional Gold Medal Alliance," which sought the Congressional Gold Medal for Puerto Rico's 65th Infantry Regiment, and serves in the "Latino Alliance Advisory Board."
In page 263 of the acknowledgments section of the book War Against All Puerto Ricans, Revolution and Terror in America's Colony author and former representative to the New York State Assembly Nelson Antonio Denis wrote the following:
Honors and awards
Accolades
On 20 November 2007, the Senate of Puerto Rico issued Resolution No. 3603 applauding Santiago's military legacy. The Resolution called Santiago "an important historian of Puerto Rican military contribution, [who] over the years has documented the history of Puerto Rican sacrifice and heroism in the battlefields using the internet, the Puerto Rican Military History Channel, the cultural magazine El Boricua and Somos Primos." According to Phoebe Ayers, member of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, this may be the first time that Wikipedia has been mentioned in a parliamentary or congressional resolution of this type.
On Memorial Day of 2008, Congressman Luis Fortuño read a statement about Tony the Marine into the U.S. Congressional Record.
On 10 August 2010, Puerto Rico's Secretary of State, Kenneth D. McClintock, named Santiago "Puerto Rico's foremost military historian."
On 28 August 2012, the Latino Alliance named Santiago a "Champion of Character."
On 11 November 2013 (Veteran's Day), Kenneth McClintock Hernández, the former Secretary of State and former president of the Senate of Puerto Rico, again gave special recognition to Santiago. McClintock honored them for documenting the sacrifice, and preserving the legacy, of Puerto Rican veterans throughout world history.
In January 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation included Santiago's photo on the cover of their 2012-2013 Annual Report.
In September 2015, Santiago (pictured in the middle) along with two other Marines, was featured on the cover of KQED Celebrates Latino Heritage Month magazine.
In 2016, The Wikimedia Foundation revealed the most detailed featured articles in its site. According to the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia's parent company, the article "The Military history of Puerto Rico" created by Santiago, is ranked #4 among the featured articles in depth and high quality. Santiago is credited by the foundation as being the person who mostly has maintained the articles' length and quality.

Harry Thomas Payne (10 December 1907 – 22 December 2000) was a Welsh international rugby union prop who played club rugby for Swansea and was capped for Wales on one occasion. A hard forward player Payne was described as 'tough-as-teak' and was still playing for veteran teams at the age of 84.
Rugby career
Payne was born in Llangyfelach and at the age of 14 had left school to join their father in the coal industry, tending the pit ponies. Payne initially had a trial for local soccer team Swansea A.F.C. but switched sports to rugby union playing for both Mynyddbach and Morriston before joining first class side Swansea in 1931. On 28 September 1935, Payne was chosen to play for the Swansea team to face the touring New Zealand team. When Swansea beat the All Blacks, they became the first club team to do so and also the first team to beat all three major Southern Hemisphere teams.
Later in 1935, Payne was selected to face the same touring New Zealand team for Wales along with teammates Don Tarr, Haydn Tanner and Claude Davey. This was Payne's one and only cap for their country, but it was a memorable game for Wales as they won 13–12, with fourteen men for the last ten minutes after Tarr was stretchered off with a broken neck. Although being selected as a reserve player on several occasions, Payne never played for Wales again.
During the 1938/39 season Payne was chosen to captain Swansea, but with the outbreak of war, Payne joined the Royal Marines. While in the marines they played rugby for both the marines and the Royal Navy and played in two wartime international for Wales against England. They saw action as a soldier in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, and was awarded six battle medals. On returning to Wales during peacetime they returned to working in the mines.
Their later career included playing for veteran teams; and in 1989 at the age of 82, they turned out for a match against Bordeaux. Their rugby career was finally halted after they broke their ankle while playing for Swansea Veterans RFC, in a match in the Netherlands in 1992.

El Paso County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. The 2020 Census recorded its population as 730,395. The Census Bureau's 2020 result indicates it is the most populous county in Colorado, surpassing the City and County of Denver. The county seat is Colorado Springs, the second most populous city in Colorado. El Paso County is included in the Colorado Springs, Colorado, Metropolitan Statistical Area and is located in Colorado's 5th congressional district.
History
In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. The following month, the Jefferson Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties for the new territory including El Paso County. El Paso County was named for the Spanish language name for Ute Pass north of Pikes Peak. Colorado City served as the county seat of El Paso County.
The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. El Paso County was one of the original 17 counties created by the Colorado legislature on November 1, 1861. Part of its western territory was broken off to create Teller County in 1899. Originally based in Old Colorado City (now part of Colorado Springs, not today's Colorado City between Pueblo and Walsenburg), El Paso County's county seat was moved to Colorado Springs in 1873.

Demographics
As of the census of 2000, 516,929 people, 192,409 households, and 133,916 families resided in the county. The population density was 243 people per square mile (94/km2). The 202,428 housing units at averaged 95 per square mile (37/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 81.19% White, 6.51% Black or African American, 0.91% Native American, 2.53% Asian, 0.24% Pacific Islander, 4.70% from other races, and 3.91% from two or more races. About 11.30% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.
Of the 192,409 households, 36.70% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.60% were married couples living together, 10.20% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.40% were not families. Around 23.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.10% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.11.
In El Paso county, the population pyramid was distributed as there being a slight surplus of males ages 0 to 45 and thereafter a slight surplus of females which is typical of most US populations. The greater than normal surplus of males between 18 and 35 are mainly due to the presence of five military installations located within the county.

Government
El Paso County is governed by a board of county commissioners. Its current members are Holly Williams in district 1, Carrie Geitner in district 2, Stan VanderWerf in district 3, Longinos Gonzales Jr in district 4, and Cami Bremer in district 5.
In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority (PPRTA) and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for COSMIX (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area. In 2012, the county voted to legalize marijuana. On March 12, 2019, the county commissioners unanimously passed a resolution to become a Second Amendment sanctuary.
The Colorado Department of Corrections has its headquarters in an unincorporated area in the county.
Elected Officials
Top employers
According to the city's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:
Libraries
The Pikes Peak Library District provides library services through its 15 branches and bookmobiles to the residents of El Paso County, with the exception of Widefield School District 3. The mission of the District is "Providing resources and opportunities that impact individual lives and build community. Seek. Engage. Transform."
Politics
El Paso is somewhat conservative for a large urban county. Since its creation in 1871, El Paso County has typically voted for the Republican presidential candidate in presidential elections; the last Democratic nominee to win the county was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. It has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1920, except for the Democratic landslides of 1936 and 1964.
Dick Lamm in 1982 remains the last Democrat to win the county in a gubernatorial election. Eight years later, the county was one of only four in the state to back governor Roy Romer's opponent John Andrews.
The last Democrat to win the county in a Senate election was Gary Hart in 1974.
Military installations
El Paso County is home to Army, Air Force and Space Force bases. These military installations border Colorado Springs to the north, south, and east, aside from Schriever Space Force Base, which is located about 10 miles east of Peterson Space Force Base.
Fort Carson
Fort Carson, "The Mountain Post", is located just south of Colorado Springs at the base of the Rocky Mountains. It was established in 1942, following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The city of Colorado Springs purchased land south of the city and donated it to the War Department. Construction began immediately and the first building, the camp headquarters, was completed January 31, 1942. Camp Carson was named in honor of the legendary Army scout, Gen. Christopher "Kit" Carson, who explored much of the West in the 1800s. Camp Carson became Fort Carson in 1954. An additional training area was purchased in September 1983 and is called Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS).
Currently, Fort Carson is the home of 4th Infantry Division and several other units, including 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), the Colorado National Guard Regional Training Institute and PCMS, which is a maneuver training site for Fort Carson located near Trinidad, Colorado. The installation totals about 137,000 acres and PCMS is roughly 236,000 acres. Fort Carson has around 3,000 family housing units and 66 soldier barracks with 8,132 rooms. Services on the installation include four elementary schools, one middle school, a commissary, an exchange, and Evans Army Community Hospital, as well as Army Community Service facilities to include child development centers and youth centers and family morale, welfare, and recreation facilities to include a bowling alley, golf course, and numerous parks.
Fort Carson's economic impact on Colorado Springs and the surrounding communities was approximately $2.3 billion during fiscal year 2014. Fort Carson has about 24,300 soldiers on the installation, with 44,700 family members. The installation also has around 8,000 veterans and 3,300 civilians.
Peterson Space Force Base
The Space Force has critical aspects of their service based at Colorado Springs, which carry on missile defense operations and development. The Space Force bases a large section of its national missile defense operations here, with Peterson Space Force Base set to operate large sections of the program. The base is also home to Space Force's Space Operations Command, and to NORAD headquarters. Peterson SFB is currently the headquarters of the operations-half of Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Command.
Peterson is also headquartering for the United States Northern Command, one of the Unified Combatant Commands, which directs all branches of the U.S. military operations in their area of responsibility, which includes the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, and Mexico. In the event of national emergencies, the President or Secretary of Defense can call upon the command for any required military assistance. Service members from every branch of the US military are stationed at the command.
Peterson SFB is the current, possibly temporary home for US Space Command, another Unified Combatant Command, whose area of operations is global operations occurring 50 miles or greater above the Earth.
Schriever Space Force Base (formerly Schriever AFB and Falcon AFB)
Schriever Space Force Base is home to several Space Force mission Deltas, responsible for the operation and support of 175 Department of Defense satellites and installation support to 16 major tenant units, with a workforce of more than 7,700 personnel. It is the location of the Global Positioning System (GPS) master control station and GPS Operations Center and the US Naval Observatory Alternate Master Clock, used to synchronize GPS satellite time. Schriever is also developing parts of national missile defense and runs parts of the annual wargames used by the nation's military. The base indirectly contributes an estimated $1 billion to the local Colorado Springs, CO area annually.
United States Air Force Academy
Bordering the northwestern side of the city are the grounds of the United States Air Force Academy, where cadets train to become officers in the Air Force and Space Force. The campus is famous for its unique chapel, and draws visitors year round. Most of the Air Force Academy's sports programs participate in the Mountain West Conference.
Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station (formerly Air Force Station)
The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), headquartered on Peterson SFB, has a presence in Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station. When it was built at the height of the Cold War, NORAD caused some anxiety for the residents in and around Colorado Springs, who believed the installation would be a primary target during a nuclear attack. Although NORAD still operates today, it is primarily given the task of the tracking of ICBMs, and the military has recently decided to place Cheyenne Mountain's NORAD/NORTHCOM operations on warm standby and move operations to nearby Peterson Air Force Base.

Gero (died 21 October 1023) was the Archbishop of Magdeburg from 1012 until their death. They were a son of Dedo Wodenswege and Eilika (Eilica) and possibly a relative of the family of Gero the Great.
Gero was the candidate of King Henry II following the death of the Archbishop Walthard on 12 August 1012. They were appointed over the candidate, Otto, of the cathedral canons. Between 1016 and 1017, the ambitious Gero and Bernard, Margrave of the Nordmark, feuded over territory. Bernard's men attacked Magdeburg, but in 1017 they agreed to compensate Gero with 500 pounds of silver.

History
The club was set up in 1973 by Maciej Behnke and Henryk Pauliński, members of the Polish YMCA. The female section of the club was founded by sisters Bożena and Grażyna Zajączkowska in 1980. Both sections, male and female, compete in the highest level of the English National Volleyball League, the National Super League.
In 2013, IBB Polonia London established a partnership with one of the most successful clubs in Poland, PGE Skra Bełchatów, with the aim of popularising volleyball in the UK, promoting both clubs and exchanging experience in the field of training.
In March 2017, ex–Polish national team player, libero - Krzysztof Ignaczak, came out of retirement to join the club for the remainder of the 2016–17 season. As a then current World Champion, their presence at the club helped raise the profile of volleyball in Great Britain and in the world.

gretl is an open-source statistical package, mainly for econometrics. The name is an acronym for Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library.
It has both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface. It is written in C, uses GTK+ as widget toolkit for creating its GUI, and calls gnuplot for generating graphs. The native scripting language of gretl is known as hansl (see below); it can also be used together with TRAMO/SEATS, R, Stata, Python, Octave, Ox and Julia.
It includes natively all the basic statistical techniques employed in contemporary Econometrics and Time-Series Analysis. Additional estimators and tests are available via user-contributed function packages, which are written in hansl.
gretl can output models as LaTeX files.
Besides English, gretl is also available in Albanian, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (both varieties), Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Ukrainian.
Gretl has been reviewed several times in the Journal of Applied Econometrics and, more recently, in the Australian Economic Review.
A review also appeared in the Journal of Statistical Software in 2008. Since then, the journal has featured several articles in which gretl is used to implement various statistical techniques.
Supported data formats
gretl offers its own fully documented, XML-based data format.
It can also import ASCII, CSV, databank, EViews, Excel, Gnumeric, GNU Octave, JMulTi, OpenDocument spreadsheets, PcGive, RATS 4, SAS xport, SPSS, and Stata files. Since version 2020c, the GeoJSON and Shapefile formats are also supported, for thematic map creation.
It can export to Stata, GNU Octave, R, CSV, JMulTi, and PcGive file formats.
hansl
Gretl has its own scripting language, called hansl (which is a recursive acronym for Hansl's A Neat Scripting Language).
Hansl is a Turing-complete, interpreted programming language, featuring loops, conditionals, user-defined functions and complex data structures. It can be considered a domain-specific language for econometrics. Like other scientifically oriented programming languages, such as MATLAB and Julia, matrices are supported natively as a primitive variable type.
A simple example of hansl:
Running the above code produces
A (2 x 2)
1 2
3 4
B (2 x 2)
-2 1
1.5 -0.5
C (2 x 2)
1.0000 0.0000
8.8818e-16 1.0000
Phi(-3) = 0.001
Phi(-2) = 0.023
Phi(-1) = 0.159
Phi( 0) = 0.500
Phi( 1) = 0.841
Phi( 2) = 0.977
Phi( 3) = 0.999
Random Number Generation
Random Number Generation (RNG) in gretl has been examined and tested in Yalta & Schreiber (2012). The authors conclude "Our results show that the RNG related procedures in gretl are implemented soundly and perform well in the three crush test suites of the TestU01".
Gretl as a teaching tool
Due to its libre nature and the breadth of econometric techniques it contains, gretl is widely used for teaching econometrics, from the undergraduate level onwards. Datasets in gretl format are available for several popular textbooks.
The following is a list of textbooks that use gretl as their software of choice:
Dougherty, Christopher Introduction to Econometrics (Oxford University Press)
Kufel, Tadeusz Ekonometria (Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN); in Polish (Russian version also available)
In addition, a free supplement to Hill, Griffiths and Lim Principles of Econometrics (Wiley) is available.

Airbus Corporate Jets, a business unit of Airbus SAS and part of Airbus, markets and completes corporate jet variants from the parent's airliner range. Types include the A318 Elite to the double/triple-decked Airbus A380 Prestige. Following the entry of the 737 based Boeing Business Jet, Airbus joined the business jet market with the A319 Corporate Jet in 1997. Although the term Airbus Corporate jet was initially used only for the A319CJ, it is now often used for all models, including the VIP widebodies. As of June 2019, 213 corporate and private jets are operating; 222 aircraft have been ordered, including A320 family jets.
An Airbus Corporate Jet Centre is based at Toulouse, France, and specialises in single-aisle aircraft.

Certificated both European JAA and American FAA, the A319LR and ACJ are the only business jets approved for public transport on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 2018, its unit cost was $105M.
The aircraft seats between 19 and 50 passengers but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. DC Aviation, UB Group, and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with the Boeing BBJ1, Gulfstream G550, and Bombardier Global Express. Because of its wider fuselage diameter, it offers a roomier interior than its competitors. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320, either the CFM International CFM56-5 or the V2527.
The A319CJ was used by the Escadron de transport, d'entrainement et de calibration which is in charge of transportation for France's officials, and was also ordered by the Flugbereitschaft of the Luftwaffe for transportation of Germany's officials. Since 2003, an ACJ is a presidential aircraft of Armenia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Italy, Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela.

William Henry Armstrong (1840s – April 14, 1916) was an American lawyer, farmer and politician from Darlington, Wisconsin.
Background
Armstrong was born in Carrollton, Illinois in 1840 or 1841 (sources differ), son of Joshua W. and Elizabeth Vanarsdoll Armstrong. They attended public schools until they left to enter military service. They joined the United States Army in September 1861 after the outbreak of the American Civil War, enlisting in the 61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. They progressed from second lieutenant through captain and was brevetted as a major. They came to Wisconsin in 1865 and settled at Darlington, becoming by occupation a lawyer and farmer.
Public office
They were elected as Clerk of the Circuit Court for Lafayette County, Wisconsin in 1868 and re-elected in 1870.
In 1872 they were elected for a one-year term as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1873 as a Republican, with 2,078 votes to 1,972 for Democrat Amos W. Hovey, succeeding fellow Republican Thomas Bainbridge. They were assigned to the standing committee on mining and smelting.
Armstrong was not a candidate for re-election in 1873, and was succeeded by John F. Beard of the Reform Party.
Family and later life
Armstrong married first Georgia Wright, who died in 1869. Their child, William Wright Armstrong, would serve as a member of the Utah State Senate. They later married Harriet M. Gray, with whom they had three further children between 1874 and 1884. At some point after leaving the Assembly, the family moved to Kansas, living first in Irving and later in Marysville.

The Mairtine (Martini, Marthene, Muirtine, Maidirdine, Mhairtine) were an important people of late prehistoric Munster, Ireland who by early historical times appear to have completely vanished from the Irish political landscape. They are notable for their former capital, Medón Mairtine, becoming the chief church of the later Eóganachta, namely Emly.
Mairtine mac Sithcheann
Geoffrey Keating's History of Ireland includes the following section, which may refer to the eponymous ancestor:
"Eochaidh Apthach (Eochu Apthach) son of Fionn, son of Oilill, son of Flann Ruadh, son of Rothlan, son of Mairtine, son of Sithcheann, son of Riaghlan, son of Eoinbhric son of Lughaidh, son of Ioth, son of Breoghan (Breogán), held the sovereignty of Ireland one year; and they were called Eochaidh Apthach because of the number who died in Ireland in their time; for the plague or other disease seized upon the men of Ireland each month, from which many of them died; hence the name Eochaidh Apthach clung to him; for apthach means 'fatal'; and they themselves fell by Fionn son of Bratha."
This would make Mairtine mac Sithcheann a gr-gr-gr-gr-grandson of Breogán mac Brath, mythical king of Galicia. Breogan's grandson, Míl Espáine, was the father and uncle of the first Goidelic people to settle in Ireland.
Eochu Apthach, Mairtine's gr-gr-gr-grandson, is given as a member of the Corcu Loígde. Their reign is variously given as the 6th/5th, 7th, or 8th, century BC.
However, it is nowhere explicitly stated that Mairtine mac Sithcheann was the eponym of the Mairtine people. Plus, the Mairtine people are accorded status of Fir Bolg, who were predecessors of the Gaels.
Medón Mairtine
This term has been translated as middle of the Mairtine [nation], indicating that modern-day Emly, County Tipperary, was the central capital of the tribe. It is due west of Tipperary town, which is due west of Cashel, seat of the historic kings of Munster. It is therefore at what can be roughly regarded as the geographic centre (or middle, medón) of Munster.
In an essay of 2000, Nollaig Ó Muraíle notes the remote possibility that some of the Mairtine Mór "might just" have been located in Connacht, though they do not specify where.
Ethnicity
Dáibhí Ó Cróinín notes that in one tradition, preserved in the Book of Lecan's still unpublished genealogies, the Mairtine are said to have been expelled from the north of Ireland, or Leth Cuinn, and to have settled in the territory later known as In Déis Tuaisceirt, which would become Dál gCais. More specifically, following a battle or series of battles, there was a reshuffling of geographic locations within Ireland, possibly helping form an Eóghanacht confederation that is spoken of in the Book of Munster and other sources. In Irish myth, there was a battle in 123AD between Eoghan Mor and Conn of the Hundred Battles, and it divided Ireland into two equal parts, by the boundary of Esker Riada - a long ridge of hills from Dublin to Galway.
The traditional story is that the Mairtine are typically associated with Erainn, Benntraige, Ulaidhe, and the Eóghanachta. They are noted in the Book of Munster and by other scholars,. In a late poem they are given as one of the tribes of the Domnainn, and are elsewhere, in popular tradition, said to have belonged to the mythological Fir Bolg. I
References in Leabhar na nGenealach
Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh records them in association with the Éarainn and Fir Bolg, listing them as the latter people in their Leabhar na nGenealach. They first mention them in the statement that "Conmhal mac Ebhir, ri Ereann, do bhris cath Locha Lén for Eurna, Mairtine, agus for Moghruith mac Mofebhis d'Fearuibh Bolg"/"Conmhal (Conmáel) s. Éibhear, king of Ireland, won the battle of Loch Léin (Lakes of Killarney) over the Éarainn, the Mairtine, and over Mogh Ruith (Mug Ruith?) s. Mo-Feibheas of Fir Bholg." (46.5, p. 210-11, LNG).
At 47.2 they wrote that Siorna mac Dian (Sírna Sáeglach), king of Ireland, won the battle of Móin Fhoichnigh among Uí Fhailghe (Kingdom of Uí Failghe) over the Mairtine and Éarainn. They state the among the tribes who pay "servile rent" were "Tuath Fhochmhuinn ... of Ui Fhailghe and over Fotharta (Fortúatha?) of Dairbhre (Kildorrery?) and Almhain (Bog of Allen/Hill of Allen) and Mairtine or Maidirdine." (50.7, pp. 217–17). At 51.8 they give their territories as "Tuath Mhairtine in Múscraighe Miontaine (Múscraige) and in Oirthear Feimhin [=eastern Feimhean (see Slievenamon)] and Liag Tuaill and Liag Tí re and Aodha and Breóghain and in Ui Chairbre (see Uí Fidgenti)."
In the poem Sloindfead athachtuatha Ereann, which lists the vassal-tribes (see Déisi, or Attacotti?) of Ireland, MacFhirbhisigh relates that "the Mairtine over the middle of Munster/what of it is not remembered by all." (55.6, pp. 224–25). They likewise list them among the Fir Bolg in the poem Gá lí on i bhFó dla Fir Bholg? (56.3, pp. 226–37)
The Annals of the Four Masters
The Annals of the Four Masters date Conmael's reign of thirty years ending in Anno Mundi 3579.
These annals further state that Angus Olmucahda (Óengus Olmucaid), who died in Anno Mundi 3790, had defeated them in "the battle of Cuirce, the battle of Sliabh Cailge, against the Martini, in the territory of Corca Bhaiscinn." The territory of Corcu Baiscind lies within what is now County Clare.
Kings
Luath, Indell and Eoghan are listed as three sons of the king of the Mairtine of Munster in Acallamh na Senórach ("Luath & Indell & Eogan tri meic rig Mairtine Muman aníar.").
Dáire Cerbba, a well known Munster dynast, ancestor of the Uí Fidgenti and Uí Liatháin, stated in the strange epic Forbhais Droma Dámhgháire to have been king of Medón Mairtine
Metrical Dindshenchas
The Metrical Dindshenchas includes a passage which mentions "The three active Red Wolves of the Martine quenched the sturdy strength of the famous man: they took their head from him, whatever came of it." This may be a reference to Luath, Indell and Eoghan in Acallamh na Senórach .

Passage Home is a 1955 British drama film directed by Roy Ward Baker.
Plot
Captain "Lucky" Ryland (Peter Finch) is about to retire. They have a flashback of several years to a voyage on a merchant ship which they were captaining from South America.  They are forced to give passage to a British governess, Ruth Elton (Diane Cilento), who is returning to England.
Both Ryland and their second mate, Vosper (Anthony Steel), fall for Ruth. Ryland proposes to Ruth and when they turn down their offer they try to rape them in their cabin but they are rescued by Vosper. The ship survives a very severe storm in which Vosper saves Ruth's life outside on deck after which Ruth and Vosper realize that they are in love with each other.
There is a subplot about the dissatisfaction of the ship's crew with being fed rotten potatoes, which Ryland has bought cheaply simply to save money. Ryland says a good cook would still be able to use them productively. The potatoes are dumped overboard and Ryland is determined to find out who is responsible by offering the crew £5 for any information as to who did it. Vosper accuses Shorty (Bryan Forbes), who is acting oddly, and they fight. Ike (Geoffrey Keen) intervenes and fights Vosper. Shorty then confesses to Ike but Ike takes the blame. Probably due to the fight, Ike, who is already known to be ill, takes to their bed and dies.  They are buried at sea in a makeshift coffin.
At the allotted time of the funeral Ryland is drunk, drowning their sorrow in whisky due to being rejected by Ruth (whom they had seriously assaulted, ripping them dress). The red ensign is flown at half mast. Ryland struggles to find the right pages in the Book of Common Prayer and loses their place. When the body is slid overboard they recite the Lord's Prayer.
That night Ryland is even more drunk. The flight attendant brings their dinner and they rudely demand that they "do their job" and tidy their room. A violent storm is throwing things around. The ship is in trouble but Ryland musters themselves and manages to give logical instructions to get them through the storm. Down below the engineer struggles to keep up the power. In the hold things start sliding and Shorty is crushed by a crate holding a bull while pushing Burns to safety. They head for "The Lizard". Ruth goes on deck and is in danger of being swept away when part of the safety railing is destroyed. Vosper saves them and carries them to their cabin where they kiss.
Coming out of flashback, Ruth and Vosper are now married and are attending Ryland's retirement function. Ryland shakes their hand and calls them "Mrs Vosper". The film ends with Ruth looking at Ryland in tears because they still have feelings for Ryland after all of the years.

Production
The film was based on a novel by Richard Armstrong that was published in 1953.
It was Roy Ward Baker's first film after working several years in Hollywood. Baker's biographer would later write "although they [Baker] was disappointed in the eventual result Passage Home was the quintessential 1940s and 1950s Baker film - classical in style and melodramatic/generic in its basic structure... it conveys a quiet, pervasive sense of despair in its storyline, involving melancholy and sexual repression."
The script was by William Fairchild who had written Morning Departure, alo directed by Baker. The director called it "a bomb in the bomb locker story... all pretty formula stuff. It's not very good... The whole film should have been set in 1885 on a sailing ship. It was sort of a Victorian film. It just didn't work as a modern day film."
Baker felt the "only interesting thing about" the film was it used a new form of back projection.
Diane Cilento's casting was announced in September 1954. They were cast after producer Julian Wintle had seen 60 people. Cilento had only recently appeared on stage in The Big Knife and signed a five year contract with Alex Korda.
Them co star was Peter Finch, a fellow Australian.
The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in November 1954. It was the first film Finch made under a new five year contract with the Rank Organisation.
It was also the first film Michael Craig made under contract to Rank. They said filming went for over three months and was impressed by the set, saying "the art department, if no one else, had one use proud."
Reception
Filmink argued the film would have been more successful if a war film.

Anoplius infuscatus is a species of spider wasp found mainly in Eurasia.
Distribution
A. infuscatus occurs in Europe (including southern Britain) and North Africa, east to the Pacific.
Identification
A. infuscatus is about 10 mm in length and resemble the Arachnospila wasps with which they are often found in appearance and behaviour. The colouring of A. infuscatus is less red than orange and its wing venation also differs from all members of Arachnospila.
Habitat
This species prefers moist sandy areas, especially near the coast.
Biology
Xerolycosa nemoralis, Alopecosa trabalis, Trochosa ruricola and Pardosa monticola spiders are recorded as prey but A. infuscatus is also suspected to feed on other members of the families Lycosidae, Agelenidae and Thomisidae. Adults nectar on Heracleum sphondylium and other members of the Apiaceae. Prey is captured following an active hunt and paralysed within the spider's own burrow or other hiding place, e.g. under a stone while the nest burrow is constructed. The spider is then dragged to the wasp's nest burrow and the wasp begins to construct a cell in which to place the spider. Commencement of cell construction is indicated by the wasp entering and leaving the nesting burrow head first, meaning it can turn around in the burrow. Sometimes the wasp amputates some of the spider's legs before placing into the burrow. The wasp lays its egg on the gaster of the spider.
Kleptoparasitic behaviour has been recorded, both intraspecific and from Anoplius concinnus. In the latter case, the A. infuscatus female entered the nest of its congener, destroyed the egg already on the spider and placed one of its own. Interaction with ants can disturb the wasp while it is transporting the prey and this can cause it to hide the prey by placing it higher up in grass. There is also a case of parasitism by the fly of the family Sarcophagidae, probably Sarcophaga socrus, while the spider-wasps Ceropales maculata, Ceropales cribrata and Evagetes argenteodecoratus have been recorded as interspecific kleptoparasites.
The flight period in Britain is from June to September and it does not overwinter as an adult.

The Rockingham County Courthouse is a historic courthouse located at Wentworth, Rockingham County, North Carolina. It was designed by Frank P. Milburn and built in 1907. It is a Classical Revival style red brick building that consists of a three-story hipped roofed main block flanked by later added (at two separate times) two-story flat roofed wings. It features a low and broad polygonal cupola atop the Spanish red tile roof. The 1907 courthouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, now houses the Museum and Archives of Rockingham County.
History
Background
Originally, the first session of the Rockingham County Court met at Eagle Falls on the Dan River in 1786. In 1787 a courthouse was established near the center of the county and the settlement was known as Rockingham Courthouse. However, in 1798, the General Assembly of North Carolina passed an act which established the county seat to be known as Wentworth at the site of the 1787 Courthouse. This courthouse was replaced by a brick courthouse in 1824 and this building was considerably remodeled (plans by non-professional architect Lyndon Swaim of Greensboro, NC) in a more Victorian style in the early 1880s.
On the night of October 2, 1906, a mercantile building in the courthouse village square caught fire. The fire spread to the courthouse and destroyed it. All of its records were recovered except for a few old documents displayed in the gallery—likely tax lists. The destruction of the courthouse occurred during a years-long dispute between the citizens of Reidsville, who wanted to move the county seat to their city, and residents from other areas of the county, who were opposed to its relocation. The debate continued for several months until the county commission voted to rebuild the courthouse in Wentworth.
Construction and additions
In early 1907 Rockingham County hired Frank Pierce Milburn to design the new courthouse. Their plans included a new water and sewage system which was also implemented in the nearby jail. The courthouse's foundation was laid by June. By September the main structure was complete, and by February 1908 the interior was finished. In 1937 additions were added to either side of the building using the same architectural style. In 1970 a large brick annex was erected on the rear of the building to house an additional courtroom and offices for the clerk of superior court and register of deeds. Shortly thereafter a "Law and Order Building" was appended onto the courthouse to host the offices of the Rockingham County Sheriff's Department and a new jail.
Replacement
In May 2011, a new 184,516 square foot Rockingham County courthouse, also known as the "Rockingham County Justice Center," opened its doors at a location one mile east of the historic village area where the courthouses had been since 1787. Construction of the new building cost $39,059,000, after an originally projected cost of $37,757,000. The three-story Justice Center houses county law enforcement services as well as the county courthouse.

Kuldip Singh Kular (born December 12, 1948) is an Indian-born Canadian politician and former Member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario, Canada. They were a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2011 representing the riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton.
Background
Kular was born and raised in a Sikh family in Ludhiana, Punjab, India and received a medical degree from Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar, Punjab, India. They moved to Canada in 1974, and completed two years of residency training in paediatrics at the IWK Health Centre at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. They then worked for two years at the Canadian Armed Forces Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia before starting a family practice in Campbellton, New Brunswick in 1978.
In 1986, Kular founded a family and sports medicine clinic in Brampton, Ontario, a city which has a large number of recent Indian immigrants. They were also a founding member of the Northern Indian Medical and Dental Association of Canada.
Politics
In the 2003 election, Kular ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale. During the campaign, it came to light that Kular had previously been disciplined by the Physician's Board. Despite the news, they defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Raminder Singh Gill by 3,765 votes. In June 2005, they were a member of the Speaker of the Ontario Legislature's multi-party delegation in to the 43rd Canadian Regional Conference for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in St. John's, Newfoundland.
In the 2007 election, Kular was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton, defeating the closest candidate, Progressive Conservative Pam Hundal, by about 6,000 votes.
In January, 2009, Kular was a member of the Premier's delegation of government and business leaders who went on a trade mission to India to develop stronger ties with this emerging market.
In October 2009, Kular was involved in an incident where they allegedly hit a pedestrian while driving in Brampton. They were charged with leaving the scene of the accident. A month later Kular resigned as parliamentary assistant to the minister of Health and Long-Term Care. In June 2010, Kular was acquitted due to contradictory evidence from witnesses. Kular was subsequently reappointed to their old post as parliamentary assistant.
In the 2011 election, they were defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Jagmeet Singh by 2,120 votes. They ran again in the 2014 election, again losing to Singh.
During their tenure, they served as parliamentary assistant to several ministers including Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Minister Responsible for Democratic Renewal, and to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

The RAF College of Air Warfare is a former Royal Air Force flying training unit operational between 1962 and 1974. The unit traces its history back to 1942 as the Empire Central Flying School.
History
The College started off life as the Empire Central Flying School at RAF Hullavington whose main aim was to teach flying instructors and to maintain the standards of teaching and course content in the flying training system at British Empire flying schools, such as those of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, located worldwide. The school had Instructional, Research and Examining flights from the Central Flying School along with a Handling Squadron RAF. These flight used various aircraft including Miles Magisters, de Havilland Tiger Moths, Gloster Gladiators, Avro Ansons and Airspeed Oxfords along with various other training, fighter and bomber aircraft.
The Handling Squadron was operational as part of Empire Central Flying School from 28 February 1942 and as part of the future units until 12 April 1954 when as No. 3 (Handling) Squadron the control of the squadron was transferred to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment.
The unit was renamed the Empire Flying School on 7 May 1946. In 1949 the examining wing was transferred to the Central Flying School at RAF Brize Norton, and other roles of the school were transferred to the RAF Flying College at RAF Manby. The unit was formally disbanded on 31 July 1949.
No. 1 Air Armament School was operational between 1 November 1937 and 28 October 1944 at Manby and was absorbed by the Empire Air Armament School which in turn was absorbed by the Royal Air Force Flying College on 31 July 1949 while at Manby.
The Royal Air Force Flying College was formed at RAF Manby on 1 June 1949 and operated various aircraft including Percival Prentices, Percival Provosts, Gloster Meteors, Handley Page Hastings, and Hawker Hunters amongst others. The unit was disbanded on 1 July 1962 and became the Royal Air Force College of Air Warfare which operated Vickers Valettas, Vickers Varsitys, English Electric Canberras, BAC Jet Provosts and Hawker Siddeley Dominies amongst others.
Air Display Team
The College formed a display team in 1965, called "The Magistrates" with the name originating from the initials "JP", the common nickname for the Jet Provost. In late 1967, the team name was changed to the "Macaws". This name was constructed from the first letters of the Unit, MAnby College of Air Warfare. The team wore the standard silver and dayglo training colours, but in 1968, the display aircraft were re-sprayed into a unique colour scheme of light grey and red. From 1969 the Jet Provosts adopted the now-standard red/white/grey scheme but had special team markings applied. The "Macaws" flew six basic formations, their display culminating in a "Petal Break". During the 1971 and 1972 display seasons the team was led by Flt Lt Brian Hoskins, and they later went on to lead the Red Arrows.
The team's final season occurred in 1973, in common with several other RAF displays teams, due the effects of the 1973 oil crisis.

Westminster-Chilliwack was a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of British Columbia from 1894 to 1898. It and its sister ridings Westminster-Delta, Westminster-Dewdney and Westminster-Richmond were successors to the old four-member Westminster riding, which appeared in 1890 only and was a subdivision of the older New Westminster (provincial electoral district) riding. Westminster-Chilliwack was succeeded by the Chilliwhack riding in the election of 1903.

The University of Pennsylvania Law Review is a law review published by an organization of second and third year J.D. students at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. It is the oldest law journal in the United States, having been published continuously since 1852. Currently, seven issues are published each year with the last issue traditionally featuring papers from symposia held by the review each year. It is one of the four law reviews responsible for publication of the Bluebook. It is one of seven official scholarly journals at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and was the third most cited law journal in the world in 2006.
In addition to the print edition, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review also publishes the University of Pennsylvania Law Review Online, formerly named PENNumbra, an online supplement, which publishes debates, essays, case notes, and responses to articles that appeared in the print edition.
History
The journal was founded as the American Law Register, and was originally written, edited, and published by practitioners, but soon expanded its pool of editors and contributors to also include judges and law professors. In 1892, under the leadership of William Draper Lewis and George Wharton Pepper, it changed its name to the American Law Register and Review. In 1895, Lewis became the first full-time dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and had the Law School take over the journal. The 1896 volume was the first volume to be edited by law students. The journal changed its name in 1908 to the University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register, and adopted its current name in 1945.
In addition to publishing numerous influential works of scholarship, the law review has famously published a series of humorous "asides." The most well known is The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule, 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1474 (1975).
Membership selection
Positions on the University of Pennsylvania Law Review are filled based in part on students' grades during first year of law school and in part on students' performance during a writing competition conducted at the end of each school year. The writing competition has two major parts: an editing portion and a writing portion. During the 16-hour editing portion, contestants are required to correct a sample portion of a fake law review article prepared by the current board. Contestants have at their disposal a copy of the Bluebook and a packet of source materials provided by the review. During the writing portion, contestants are required to create a cohesive, thesis-driven essay using only the set of sources provided. The sources cover a variety of topics, and the essay does not need to be law-related. Additionally, contestants are asked to submit a short personal statement. Each year the review takes approximately 55 new members from the rising second-year class, including transfer students. The University of Pennsylvania Law Review is managed by a board of 20 members chosen from the rising 3L class in February of each year.

Signals is the ninth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on September 9, 1982 by Anthem Records. After the release of their previous album, Moving Pictures, the band started to prepare material for a follow-up during soundchecks on their 1981 concert tour and during the mixing of their subsequent live album Exit...Stage Left. Signal demonstrates the group's continuing use of synthesizers, sequencers, and other electronic instrumentation. It is the last album produced by their longtime associate Terry Brown, who had worked with them since 1974.
The album peaked at No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In November 1982, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the United States. Rush released three singles from the album: "New World Man", which became the band's highest charting single in the United States and a number-one hit in Canada, as well as "Subdivisions", and "Countdown". The group supported Signals with a concert tour from April 1982 to May 1983. Signal has been reissued several times, including a remaster with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix in 2011.
Background and recording
In July 1981, Rush ended their tour in support of their previous album Moving Pictures. The album became their most commercially successful of their history, granting them their first No. 1 album in Canada and selling over one million copies in the United States at the tour's conclusion. Rush then took a three-month break, during which they oversaw the production and mixing of their second live release, Exit...Stage Left, at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec. In one of drummer and lyricist Neil Peart's diary entries written during this time, they had been cleaning a Hayman drum kit that was housed in the studio and, in September 1981, began working out a song with two members of the band's road crew, the unreleased "Tough Break". Peart was also working on lyrics, in particular a set which included "Subdivisions", a track the group would later record for Signals.
Having arranged some material for their next studio album, Rush toured North America and Europe from October to December 1981 with a setlist that contained "Subdivisions". The group had their sound man capture their soundchecks on tape which provided a method of developing new songs, which was particularly the case for "Chemistry". The majority of Signals was written and rehearsed in early 1982. Geddy Lee has said that the group were aware of how easy it would have been to "[play] it is safe" and produce another Moving Pictures, a mindset the band was entirely against. The album displays the band continuing to incorporate the synthesizer into their songs with less emphasis on guitar-oriented riffs which had been the focus of their sound in the 1970s. Lee considered Signals as the beginning of a new era for the band. In hindsight, they said it was considerably difficult to make because it took longer than usual for the band to achieve the right feel for each song. Some ideas that Alex Lifeson and Lee had initially saved for potential solo albums were used on Signals. Writer and journalist Greg Quill noticed a "cyclical framework" in Signals, specifically the album opening in suburbia followed by contemplating escape in "The Analog Kid". Then, "universal human imponderables" are explored through humanity, sex, religion, and ageing, which ends in an actual escape in "Countdown". Quill spoke to Peart about this theory, to which the drummer replied: "You noticed that. We were hoping no one would. It's so unfashionable these days to construct grand concepts. We're being closed mouthed about it".
Recording began at Le Studio in April 1982, and ended on July 15. It is Rush's last album co-produced by their longtime associate Terry Brown, who had worked with them since 1974. They were joined by engineer Paul Northfield with assistance from Robbie Whelan. Rush intended to finish the album in June, but had to spend additional time in the studio which led to a month's reduction in their planned vacation time. Upon completion, the album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering Studios.
Songs
Side one
"Subdivisions" was one of the first songs Rush had arranged for Signals. After Peart devised a set of lyrics, Lifeson and Lee wrote a collection of musical ideas to fit Peart's words. Peart recalled that their bandmates interrupted them as they were cleaning their car and set up a portable cassette player on the driveway outside the studio, and played them what they had come up with. Peart added: "I listened closely, picking up the variations on 7/8 and 3/4, the way the guitar adopts the role of rhythm section while the keyboards take the melody, returning to bass with guitar leading in the chorus, then the Mini-moog taking over again for the instrumental bridge", and told Lifeson and Lee that they liked it.
"The Analog Kid" originated during the group's stay at Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands in January 1982, travelling on a yacht named Orianda. Peart had written the words to the song initially as a companion piece to "Digital Man", which Rush had started working on in late 1981, and presented it to Lee. The two discussed what could be done with the lyrics in a musical sense, deciding on the opposite on what the words may suggest, with Peart describing the track as "a very up-tempo rocker, with some kind of dynamic contrast for the choruses".
"Chemistry" was developed during soundchecks on the Moving Pictures tour in 1981. It was during one particular session during the United States leg whereby, after each member checking each of their instruments separately, "a little spontaneous creation" came about which produced a song without the group realising it. Each member played a different part; Lee played what became the keyboard section for the bridge, Lifeson the guitar riffs heard in the verses, and Peart the drum pattern for the chorus. Upon listening to the soundcheck tapes, Lifeson and Lee took each section and arranged it into a complete track before they produced a demo which almost matched the version recorded for the album. "Chemistry" marked the first time that each member collaborated on the lyrics to a song, with Lifeson and Lee devising its title, concept, and several phrases that they wished for it to include. Peart then took their ideas and developed a set of complete lyrics. They named "Chemistry" as the easiest song to write for Signals.
"Digital Man" was one of the songs worked on during the late 1981 writing sessions at Le Studio, during which the music and lyrics for its verses, plus the ska-influenced bridge, was worked out. The song was also heavily influenced by funk, with Lee's bass line described as "so funky and fluid its almost laughable". Its instrumental break has been compared with "Walking on the Moon" by The Police. The song developed further in March 1982 during the band's one month stay at The Grange in Muskoka Lakes, Ontario. Peart wrote the remaining lyrics by an open fire in their chalet while Lifeson and Lee worked on the music in the adjacent barn. After numerous attempts they devised a combination of suitable words and music for the chorus, and Peart wrote: "We were all very pleased with the dynamic and unusual nature of the part, it was so different for us". However, Brown expressed a lack of enthusiasm to record the song and remained so until the group had continually talked about why it worked "until they got tired of hearing about it". "The Analog Kid" and "Digital Man" served as the inspiration for comic book writer Troy Hickman to create heroes of the same names in their 2004 comic Common Grounds.
Side two
"The Weapon" is the second part of Rush's "Fear" song series. During a writing session at a northern Ontario manor home in 1981, Lee and their friend Oscar devised what Peart described as the foundation of "a highly mysterious and bizarre drum pattern" with their drum machine. At a subsequent rehearsal, Peart learned to play the part on their own drum kit which required them to alter their usual technique, but took the experience as an enjoyable challenge.
"New World Man" was put together in May 1982 when the backing tracks for the album's other seven tracks were completed, and there was enough space on the vinyl for a song under four minutes. Had the track become too long, the band would have put it down and used it for a subsequent release. "New World Man" began with Peart writing lyrics that tied in themes from other songs on the album, "and came up with a straightforward, concise set of lyrics consisting of the two verses and the two choruses". The group adopted a "fast and loose" approach for its corresponding music and worked swiftly, with the song fully arranged in one day and recorded in the course of the next.
"Losing It" originated from a theme Lifeson had come up with which was used in subsequent rehearsal sessions to produce a demo with keyboards and drums. In June 1982, when the band revisited the song in the studio, they discussed the possibility of Ben Mink of the band FM playing the electric violin somewhere on Signals, and decided that "Losing It" was the best track for their contribution. To cater for the part, Rush put down the basic track for a jazz-oriented solo section and invited Mink to the studio which included them multi-tracking various notes to resemble a complete string section. The lyrics include references to the latter years of writer Ernest Hemingway–"For you the blind who once could see, the bell tolls for thee". It was not played live until 2015 when Rush performed it at five concerts on their R40 Live Tour.
"Countdown" was inspired by the band attending the launch of the STS-1 Columbia space shuttle in April 1981, the first of NASA's Space Shuttle program. They had been invited to the launch and observed it from a VIP area at an air base in Cape Kennedy, Florida. The song features samples of radio communications recorded before and during the flight.
Artwork
The sleeve was designed by Hugh Syme, who is credited with its concept, direction, and graphics, with photography from Deborah Samuel. Syme based their design upon receiving merely the album's title, and recalled a "great deal of trouble" in a cover that they and the group were satisfied with. "I decided that, with such a phenomenally important word with the kind of potency it potentially had, to go with something really dumb, really inane". They noted, however, that the cover still tied into the meaning of some of the songs on the album, in particular "Chemistry". The final concept came out from the result of several failed ideas, including one that Syme devised which would have involved Rush hooked up to electroencephalography machines as they played in the studio and a snapshot of their heartbeats and brain waves taken during a performance.
The front photograph depicts a Dalmatian dog sniffing a red fire hydrant on a green lawn. Samuel shot the image on the rooftop of their studio. The lawn is a piece of AstroTurf, and the hydrant was rented from Toronto and repainted the desired colour for the cover. They recalled a search to find a Dalmatian who could sniff on command, and placed dog biscuits underneath the hydrant multiple times to get the final shot. The back cover is a pretend blueprint of a neighbourhood with what Lee described as "make believe subdivisions", detailing Warren Cromartie Secondary School, a fictional school named after Canadian baseball player Warren Cromartie. They and the Montreal Expos are thanked in the album's liner notes. Syme considered the back cover "a little subtle, perhaps over-indulgent".
Release
The album was released in September 1982. The album peaked at No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In November 1982, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the United States.
Rush released five singles from Signals. "New World Man" reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for three weeks in October and November 1982. It is the band's highest charting single in the US, and the only one to have reached the top 40.
Reception

}}
At the time of release, Rolling Stone criticised the band's choice of "emphasizing synthesizers at the expense of Alex Lifeson's guitar," calling the album "mostly a wasted effort."Louder called Signals the 29th best album of the 80s.
AllMusic retrospectively praised the album, complimenting the band for not simply making Moving Pictures, Pt. II, continuing their exploration of the synthesizer and introducing more contemporary themes into the lyrics.
Ultimate Classic Rock placed Signals seventh in their list of "Top 10 Rush Albums," while Stereogum placed the album third (behind Moving Pictures and 2112) in their list of "Rush Albums From Worst to Best," labelling it "the most audacious album of the band's career."
In the 2010 documentary film Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, Trent Reznor cited Signals as an influence for incorporating keyboards into hard rock. Canadian music journalist Martin Popoff stated that Signals'' was their favorite Rush album because of the "creamy production."

Chester K. Stranczek (November 19, 1929 – September 5, 2015) was an American business person, politician, and former Minor League Baseball player who was the mayor of Crestwood, Illinois, for 39 years, from 1969 to 2007. They drew national attention during their tenure for cutting expenses in part by privatizing city services, and for refunding residents' property taxes for more than a decade. They were also known as a colorful character with outspoken views on political and social issues, sometimes using a personal billboard posted near the town entrance to express their political and religious beliefs.
Stranczek was born in Cook County, Illinois, on November 19, 1929. They were the first of eight children born to Polish immigrants Josephine & Kanty Stranczek. Only Polish was spoken at home, and Stranczek began to speak English in first grade. They died in 2015.
Baseball career
Stranczek worked on their family's farm until graduation from high school in 1949, when they joined the Salina Blue Jays as a pitcher in the Kansas Oklahoma Missouri League. In 1951, they were drafted into the Army. During the Korean War, Stranczek spent 17 months on the Army's baseball team, which was headquartered in Tokyo and toured the Far East. They returned to minor league baseball in , playing with the Burlington Bees before joining the Baton Rouge Red Sticks. In 1955, Stranczek tore the ligament in their right knee, which ended their baseball career.
Business and political career
After their injury, Stranczek returned to Illinois, and worked for a trucking company before starting their own business, Crest Fuel & Materials, in May 1959. They married Diane Buksa in 1961 and they had two sons, Michael (born 1961) and Robert (born 1964).
In 1969, Stranczek ran as a Republican for mayor of the village of Crestwood. It was a post they would hold for nearly forty years until their retirement in 2007. They declared their intention to run the town like a business, and through a series of privatizations raised enough business revenue for residential property tax rebates. Those began in 1993 with a total $1 million rebate and increased annually until 2009, when city officials were sued for providing drinking water from a contaminated well. It was found that since the early 1980s the mayor and other officials had opted to tap water from a contaminated source rather than fix a leaky water main.
Stranczek retired mid-term in 2007, at age 78. They were succeeded as mayor by their son, Robert Stranczek.
Later life and death
After stepping down as mayor, Chester Stranczek retired to Boca Raton, Florida. They developed Parkinson's disease and died September 5, 2015, at the age of 85.  They are buried at the St. Benedict Catholic Cemetery in Crestwood.
Water contamination scandal
In April 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that for 40 years the city had been drawing drinking water from a well contaminated with toxic chemicals. By secretly drawing water from their contaminated well, Crestwood officials saved $380,000 a year that otherwise would have been spent maintaining the water system, and avoided routine testing that would have alerted authorities to toxic chemicals in the village's drinking water.
In April 2013, Crestwood police chief Theresa Neubauer, who was also the city's water commissioner, and certified water operator Frank Scaccia were both found guilty of lying to environmental regulators about water quality. They were sentenced to two years' probation each. Chester Stranczek had by then been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and was found not competent to face charges or testify in the case.</ref>

is a hot spring located in the city of Semboku, Akita in northern Japan.
Water profile
The spring has a flow of 9000 liters/minute and feeds a 3-meter wide stream with a temperature of 98 °C. The water from Tamagawa Hot Spring is extremely acidic, with a pH of about 1.2, making it one of the most acidic hot springs in Japan.
Spring overview
The spring contains hydrochloric acid as a main component, along with carbon dioxide, iron, and aluminum-chloride. Due to deposits of radioactive hokutolite near the spring, the water is also slightly radioactive, with a level of 15-20 mSv / year. Hokutolite is composed of a type of barite (barium sulfate), including lead and traces of strontium and calcium, and is about ten times as radioactive as the standard background radiation. Radium also exists in the hot springs water.
History
The springs were discovered by a local matagi hunter in 1680, but the area was used primarily as a sulfur mine and it was not until 1885 that the first lodging was erected.
Initially called the Kanoyu Onsen, it was renamed to Tamagawa Onsen by an Asahi Shimbun reporter, who praised its effectiveness against many diseases. Due to the isolation of the site, it could only be reached on horseback with some difficulty until after World War II.
It was designated a National Health Resort in 1959. The waters from the spring have traditionally been touted as a cure for hypertension, arteriosclerosis, gynecological diseases, neuralgia, skin diseases, asthma, and especially for malignant tumors (cancer).
There are two lodging facilities available in the area, Tamagawa Onsen, an inn located near the spring (opens from mid April to December, and closed for winter since 2012 due to the avalanche on February 1, 2012, which killed 3 people), and Shin-Tamagawa Onsen, a hotel about a kilometer down from the spring which opens year-round, run by the same owner of Tamagawa Onsen inn. Tamagawa Onsen inn and the spring area are only accessible by a snowcat in December after the road is closed for the traffic by the end of November due to the heavy snowfall in the area.

Ezhome Rice varieties Ezhome-1 and Ezhome–2 are the first high yielding, non-lodging organic red rice varieties. They are designed for the saline-prone Kaipad rice fields of Kerala. They yield awn-less, non-shattering grains, and favourable cooking qualities, better than local cultivars. The average yields of ‘Ezhome-1' and ‘Ezhome-2' are 3.5 tonnes/ha and 3.2 tonnes/ha respectively under close-planted and no-management conditions of Kaipad. This yield is 70% and 60% more than that of local cultivars. These varieties differ in duration, have distinct morphological and qualitative traits, and have different salinity tolerance mechanisms, imparting varietal diversity to the unique ecosystem of Kaipad.
These new seed varieties have been developed by the Kerala Agricultural University with the participation of farmers of Ezhome panchayat. This is the first venture of Kerala Agricultural University in development of a variety i) adopting the combined strategy of Global Breeding (traditional), and participatory plant breeding, and ii) carrying out all stages of variety development directly in the problem area of farmers.

Duke of Fronsac (French: duc de Fronsac) was a title of French nobility, first created by promoting the seigneurie of Fronsac to a duchy in 1608, but the title became extinct a few decades later. This title was revived in 1634 for Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu, better known as Cardinal Richelieu, and it survived until the 19th century.
First creation
The title of duc de Fronsac was first created in 1608 for the House of Longueville, a bastard-cadet branch of the House of Valois. The mother of the first duke, Anne de Caumont (1574–1642), held the lesser title of marquis de Fronsac when their son Léonor II d'Orléans was created a duke. The title became extinct after the first duke died without an heir and the title passed to their father, who had no other issue.
In 1608, Léonor II d'Orléans (1605–1622) was created 1st Duke of Fronsac and held the title until their death in January 1622. Having no heir, the title was passed to their father.
Beginning in 1622, the title was in the possession of the first duke's father, François III d'Orléans (1570–1631), 2nd Duke of Fronsac, Duke of Château-Thierry and Count of Saint-Pol. Having no other heirs after their only son preceded them in death, the title became extinct when François III died in 1631.
Second creation
In 1634, the title of duc de Fronsac was revived for Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu, who already held the title of Duke of Richelieu. The title of Duke of Fronsac was often used by subsequent Dukes of Richelieu as a titre d'attente, or courtesy title, for the heir to the Dukedom of Richelieu.
From 1634 to 1642, the title was held by Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu (1585–1642), 1st Duke of Richelieu.
From 1642 to 1646, the title was held by the cardinal-duc's nephew, Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé (1613–1646), Marquis de Brézé.
The title was held from 1646 to 1674 by the former's sister, Claire Clémence de Maillé (1628–1694), Princess of Condé, who ceded the title in 1674 to their cousin (see below).
From 1674 to 1715, the title was held by Armand Jean de Vignerot du Plessis (1629–1715), 2nd Duke of Richelieu.
From 1715 to 1788, the title was held by Louis François Armand de Vignerot du Plessis (1696–1788), 3rd Duke of Richelieu. They were known from birth as the duc de Fronsac as a courtesy title.
From 1788 to 1791, the title was held by Louis Antoine Sophie de Vignerot du Plessis (1736–1791), 4th Duke of Richelieu. They were known as the duc de Fronsac when their father held the more senior title of duc de Richelieu.
From 1791 to 1822, the title was held by Armand Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis (1766–1822), 5th Duke of Richelieu and Prime Minister of France from 1815 to 1818 and 1820 to 1821. They were known from birth by the courtesy title of comte de Chinon, since the title of duc de Fronsac was being used as a courtesy title by their father until the death of the 3rd Duke of Richelieu in 1788. At that point, their father inherited the more senior title of duc de Richelieu, and Armand Emmanuel in turn used the courtesy title of duc de Fronsac. The title became extinct upon their death in 1822.

Emanuel Grim (1 January 1883 – 18 October 1950) was a Polish Catholic priest, writer and journalist from the region of Cieszyn Silesia. They were one of the most important figures of the Polish-Catholic political camp in Cieszyn Silesia in the interwar period.
They were born in the coal mining town of Karviná to a coal miner's family. Grim graduated in 1904 from Polish gymnasium in Cieszyn and later studied theological studies in Vidnava and Wrocław and on 23 August 1908 was ordained as a Catholic priest.

José María Naveiras Escanlar, commonly known as Pepe el Ferreiro (31 March 1942 – 13 June 2020), was a Spanish archaeologist. They were born in Grandas de Salime, Asturias. They worked as blacksmith in the forge of their father and in other activities related to metallurgy.
Together with two friends they discovered the first dwelling of the Castro (village), called Chao Samartín, in 1977. Because of the friendship they had with the owner of the estate, Don Manuel Barcia Monteserín, they were allowed to excavate this buried building, a work they accomplished together with José Manuel Villamea, and together they managed to bring to light an important collection of ceramic fragments. They took the archaeologist D. Miguel Ángel de Blas Cortina of the University of Oviedo to see the Castro, who subsequently studied the excavation site.
Works and accomplishments
In the year 1983, José Naveiras Escanlar founded the Ethnographic Museum of Grandas de Salime. They investigated anthropological subjects to develop the museum project in the best possible way.
In October 1984, at the antique ruins of Melgar de Tera that were turned into an improvised mausoleum, they excavated a glass made of fine materials, dated to the first half of the first Century, 10–20 B.C.
In April 1986, on their own initiative they presented some samples coming from Chao Samartín to Mr. Fernán Alonso, Q.E.D. of the Carbon-14 Department of the Institute for Physics and Chemistry of Rocasolano (The High Council for Scientific Investigations) in Madrid. They did an analysis and dated the castro at the second half of the first century A.D. This has been the first proof.
When the official excavations at Chao Samartín began, under the direction of Dn. Elías Carrocera and later Ángel Villa Valdés, they modestly cooperated with the team of archaeologists in everything they asked of him.
After the discovery and in relation to the said above, which is highly important, they published work in the media of communication that are related to these findings, that for obvious reasons as set out here, have no scientific basis; but what they did was give insight into the facts and a widespread knowledge of the actual state of affairs at the excavations of the Castro of Chao Samartín.

John Purvis (December 11, 1906 – March 30, 1962) was an American jazz musician.
Purvis was best known as a trumpet player and the composer of Dismal Dan and Down Georgia Way. They were one of the earliest trumpeters to incorporate the innovations pioneered by Louis Armstrong in the late 1920s. They also played trombone and on occasion a number of other instruments professionally (including harp).
Early years
John "Jack" Purvis was born in Kokomo, Indiana on December 11, 1906 to Sanford B. Purvis, a real estate agent and their wife Nettie (Jackson) Purvis. Jack's behavior became uncontrollable after their mother's death in 1912, and, as a result of many acts of petty larceny, they were sent to a reform school. While there, they discovered that they had an uncanny musical ability, and soon became proficient enough to play both the trombone and trumpet professionally. This also enabled them to leave the reformatory and continue their high school education, while they were playing paying gigs on the side. One of the earliest jobs they had as a musician was with a band led by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Not long afterward, they worked with the dance band of Hal Denman.
After high school they worked in their home state for a time then went to Lexington, Kentucky where they played with the Original Kentucky Night Hawks. Around this time they learned to fly planes. In 1926 they were with Bud Rice and toured New England. They then worked the remainder of 1926 and the beginning of 1927 with Whitey Kaufman's Original Pennsylvanians. Purvis married in Pittsburgh, in 1927, and soon became a father. Their daughter, Betty Lou, was, for a time, a disc jockey in Pittsburgh in the late 1940s, and a correspondent for Down Beat magazine. This was Purvis' only verified marriage, and rumors persist that they committed bigamy on several occasions. For a short time they played trumpet with Arnold Johnson's orchestra, and by July 1928 they traveled to France with George Carhart's band. It is reported that they had an early brush with the law when they cheated a tourist out of their traveler's checks and was forced to leave the band and flee France. Ship's passenger list information reports "Jacques F. Purvis" returning to New York, from Le Havre, France, on November 19. 1928.
In 1929 they joined Hal Kemp's band. From 1929 to 1930 Purvis recorded with Kemp, Smith Ballew, Ted Wallace (a pseudonym for agent Ed Kirkeby), Rube Bloom, the California Ramblers, and Roy Wilson's Georgia Crackers. On December 17, 1929 Purvis led their own recording groups using Hal Kemp's rhythm section to produce Copyin' Louis, and Mental Strain at Dawn.
The 1930s
In 1930, Purvis led a couple of racially mixed recording sessions including the likes of J.C. Higginbotham, and Adrian Rollini. One of these sessions was organized by Adrian Rollini and OKeh A & R man, Bob Stephens.
After leaving Hal Kemp in 1930, allegedly because legal issues precluded theirs going with the band to Florida, Purvis found work with the California Ramblers. They also worked with the Dorsey Brothers and played fourth trumpet with Fletcher Henderson, although only in a rehearsal capacity.
Purvis' mental stability was always in question, and they attempted suicide on several occasions. Although they were a brilliant musician, capable of either a hot jazz solo or a difficult passage through the hardest of arrangements, they could not be counted on to arrive anywhere on time. This lack of accountability plagued them throughout their life, and can be traced to their earliest years. In many instances, once Jack Purvis showed up to play an extended engagement, not so coincidentally, there was a spike in petty thefts and burglaries for the vicinity of that gig.
From 1931 to 1932 they played with a few radio orchestras and worked with Fred Waring. In 1933 they toured the South with Charlie Barnet. They even talked their way into a job with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra playing The Carnival of Venice. During this time they also worked in Texas as a pilot perhaps smuggling illegal goods out of Mexico.
They moved to California and was successful with radio broadcasting work. In Los Angeles, Purvis worked for the George Stoll Orchestra as a writer and even worked for Warner Bros. Studios arranging. They composed Legends of Haiti for a one hundred and ten-piece orchestras. Afterwards they found work in San Francisco as a chef.
At the end of 1935 they joined Frank Froeba's Swing Band in New York. These 1935 recordings with Froeba were the end of Purvis' recording career. They played a couple of weeks with Joe Haymes' orchestra and then disappeared for a couple of years. There was a confirmed sighting of them working in a diner in the midwest around this time. It is also speculated that they worked as a ship's cook on a freighter at the time.
They were arrested in Texas in June 1937, while working as a cook, for their involvement in a robbery in El Paso, Texas. They were tried and convicted and sentenced to jail time in Huntsville Prison. While in prison they directed the Rhythmic Swingsters, the prison band and also played piano with them. The band regularly broadcast on radio station WBAP in 1938.
Later life
In August 1940, Purvis was conditionally pardoned from prison, but they quickly broke their parole and was sent back to prison for six more years. Some sources claim they did this deliberately because they missed the prison band.
On September 30, 1946 Purvis was released from prison one last time. They had a wild reputation and is said to have set hotel rooms on fire. They seldom stuck with one band for very long and was known to hit the streets as a busker. From this time onward they worked at non-musical careers which included working as a chef, an aviator in Florida, a carpenter, a radio repairman in San Francisco. At sometime in their checkered life they were also a mercenary in South America.
According to researcher Paul Larsen, Purvis gassed themselves to death in San Francisco on March 30, 1962. Yet Purvis' death certificate indicates the cause of death to be "fatty degeneration of the liver" rather than death by gas poisoning.
Cornetist Jim Goodwin claimed that a man who looked like (and introduced themselves as) Jack Purvis showed up at a band date a couple of times in about 1968 and that they had a long talk about their life.

Once a Thief is a 1965 crime film directed by Ralph Nelson and starring Alain Delon, Ann-Margret, Van Heflin and Jack Palance. It was written by Zekial Marko, based on their 1961 novel Scratch a Thief. The movie was known in France as Les tueurs de San Francisco.
Nelson won the OCIC award at the 1965 San Sebastián International Film Festival for the film.
Plot
Ex-convict Eddie Pedak (Delon) tries to lead a normal life in San Francisco with a loving wife Kristine (Ann-Margret), a daughter, and a steady job. Much to their chagrin, they also have a vengeful police detective (Heflin) and estranged brother (Palance) complicating their life.
The detective, Mike Vido, remains bitter over being shot six years ago during an unsolved robbery. Despite only having seen the shooter's eyes, they are sure that it was Eddie. Since Eddie's release from prison, Vido has harassed them and gotten them fired from numerous jobs. When a shopkeeper is killed in a robbery, they are convinced it is again Eddie, but the witness insists otherwise. Eddie nonetheless loses their job because of the arrest.
Meanwhile, Eddie's brother Walter, head of a criminal gang, attempts to recruit them for a final heist, offering them $50,000 for one night's work. Eddie refuses, but they are unable to secure another job or collect unemployment, prompting Kristine to begin working as a waiter. Walter drops by and informs them that Kristine's job is really at a sleazy nightclub, where Eddie finds her, to their fury. Eddie then agrees to participate in the heist, and it is revealed why Walter has been so persistent about Eddie's participation: they plan to rob their former employer, and their inside knowledge of the company is vital to the robbery. It becomes evident that Sargatanas and Shoenstein, other members of Walter's gang, framed Eddie for the shopkeeper's murder, and mistrust grows. After doing their own investigating, Vido approaches Eddie and tells them they know that they were framed for the murder. They give Eddie the chance to come clean before the heist, but Eddie turns them down.
The thieves get away with $1 million in platinum. After Sargatanas kills another member of the gang, Eddie and Walter take off with the loot and hide in a truck. Sargatanas and Shoenstein find and kill Walter, and abduct Eddie's daughter in order to trade them for the platinum.
Eddie finds Vido, and tells them about the kidnapping. Vido agrees to help them in exchange for their confession and the return of the stolen platinum. After Eddie finally admits that they did in fact shoot Vido years ago, Vido is surprised to find that they no longer feels vindictive. Eddie and Vido make their way to the arranged meetup, where the remaining thieves and the loot are, as well as their daughter. After their daughter is released, Eddie brings them to the truck containing the platinum. Sargatanas suddenly kills Shoenstein, initiating a shootout that results in the wounding of Eddie and Vido. After a struggle with Eddie over the gun, Sargatanas dies. With the gun in their grasp, Eddie staggers triumphantly toward Vido. Vido's partner arrives on the scene. They quickly and incorrectly assesses the situation and kills Eddie, to Vido's dismay.

Critical reception
A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that the film was not as good as similar genre pictures, but praised the accuracy of its gangster dialogue:
The film was not a success at the box office.

Release
Following a preview screening on February 2, 2017 at Malco Cinema in Columbus, Mississippi, the film premiered at the Oxford Film Festival on February 18, 2017. It screened at the Magnolia Independent Film Festival on March 4, 2017, where it won the Best Homegrown award. It screened and won the Best Feature award at the Azalea Film Festival on April 1, 2017. The film was picked up for distribution by Gravitas Ventures on May 11, 2017. It was released on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on September 5, 2017.
Critical reception
The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, with critics praising the performances, cinematography, directing and originality. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 67%, with an average rating of 6.90/10, based on 6 reviews. Patrick King, in their review for Cultured Ventures, said "The Atoning almost becomes arthouse horror, but there's enough B-movie sensibilities about the piece for it to appeal to horror fans of all sorts. The movie is ultimately about the secrets we keep buried, those things we don't want to face, but we must face, if we want to make spiritual progress. Clearly a passion project, The Atoning is a very good indie horror flick that's definitely worth checking out.
Jennie Kermode of Eye For Film gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and praised Cannon Bosarge's performance, writing "Having less information to work with than their parents, Sam might be expected to be the least interesting character, but Bosarge does a lot with the role and their naturalness helps to give the film an edge that no amount of over-familiar moody lighting can achieve. When their ghostly visions reveal something sinister, it's much easier to feel fear and concern than it is to connect with the consciously remote adults."
Frank Ochieng of Critical Movie Critics commended Michael Williams' use of creativity to bring something new to the horror genre, by saying "Thoroughly engaging, contemplative and percolating with loads of mystique, Williams brings some much-needed punch and polish to their low-key goosebumps thriller that legitimately keeps the viewer guessing on their toes. Refreshingly startling in its quieted chaos of eeriness and somber moodiness, The Atoning is surprisingly strategic in its creepy presentation (despite its familiarity in theme), while never falling victim to the overwrought “gotcha moments” seen countless times before in other exaggerated, bloated fright-fests."
Jacqui Blue of Film Inquiry was critical of the film, saying "There's a leak in the kitchen and a painting that Vera keeps putting away in the attic, which keeps reappearing on the wall. Nothing gets resolved, it just keeps repeating, slowly but surely. It's always the same day all over again with repetitive actions, with the same mishaps and struggles of not being able to fix what's broken, things that don't stay where they're put, and doors which don't open."

The India Chess Federation (AICF) is central administrative body for the game of chess in India. Founded in 1951, the federation is affiliated to Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), the world body for chess. The AICF has produced Viswanathan Anand, Nihal Sarin, Pentala Harikrishna, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Santosh Gujrathi and many other grandmasters. The organisation is also in charge of managing women's chess in India. AICF's current headquarters is in New Delhi.
In August 2022, AICF hosted the 44th Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India, which was the first Chess Olympiad ever to take place in the country. The event was organised by AICF in association with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and the Tamil Nadu Government led by Chief Minister M. K. Stalin. The current AICF President, Sanjay Kapoor was the President of the Organising Committee for the 44th Chess Olympiad, and AICF Secretary, Bharat Singh Chauhan was the Tournament Director.
History
The India Chess Federation was registered in 12 December 1958 and was registered as a Society under the Societies Registration act of 1860.
Charges of bureaucratic interference
AICF has been repeatedly accused of bureaucratic interference. In October 2009, chess Grandmaster Humpy Koneru (then female world No. 2) accused the AICF secretary DV Sundar of preventing them from participating in the 37th Chess Olympiad in Turin. The same year the AICF was accused of arbitrarily banning grandmaster G N Gopal for not playing in a match (the ban was subsequently revoked).
In 2012 the AICF president N Srinivasan was criticised for not supporting Viswanathan Anand in World Chess Championship 2010, by not trying to host the match in India.
However, things appear to be changing for better since the present management took over on January 04, 2021. The new AICF President, Sanjay Kapoor, and Secretary, Bharat Singh Chauhan have taken a slew of measures to ensure that the Federation actively focuses on promoting Chess sport in the country and works towards empowering the players.
Affiliates
Till date the federation has more than 30 affiliated state associations, 16 special members and 23 recognised academies as its constituents. Here is a list of them:
Affiliated state bodies

is the organization within the Japan Karate Federation (JKF) which practices the Wadō-ryū style of karate. Wado kai has numerous associated organizations and member clubs on different continents of the world.
History
In 1938 Hironori Ohtsuka registered their mixed style of karate-jujutsu with the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, originally under the name of Shinshu Wadoryu Karate-Jujutsu, soon shortened to Wado-ryu (和道流).
A Wadoryu Honbu (headquarters) was established in the Meiji University dojo in Tokyo, Japan in 1952.
The Shintani Wado Kai Karate Federation of North America officially joined Otsuka's federation in 1958.
In 1964 the Japan Karatedo Federation (JKF) was established as a general organization for all karate styles. Wado joined this organization as a major group. The Wado organization changed the name to Wadokai on 5 June 1967.
On 15 November 1979 Hironori Otsuka promoted Masaru Shintani to 8th dan, and presented them with a 9th dan certificate at the same time and appointed Shintani Sensei the Supreme Instructor of Wado Karate in North America.
Wadokai remained relatively intact as an organisation until around 1980, when a split occurred. The split occurred because the Wadokai board of directors and Hironori Ohtsuka had a difference in opinion about monetary expenditures and accessibility to the funds of the organization. Ohtsuka felt it was within their rights to have full use of the Federation funds and one day made a withdrawal that drew the ire of the board of directors. This matter was settled out of court and the terms of the settlement allowed them to keep the money but they had to resign from Wadokai and they also lost all rights to the name and logo of the organization. Eiichi Eriguchi succeeded them within Wadokai at that time and again became chairperson during the 1990s. Hironori Ohtsuka then founded Wadoryu Karatedo Renmei (Renmei means 'group' or 'federation') on 1 April 1981. After only a few months Hironori Ohtsuka retired as head of this organization and their son Jiro Ohtsuka took their place. Hironori Ohtsuka died 29 January 1982 at the age of 89. In 1983 Jiro Ohtsuka became Grandmaster of Wado Ryu and changed their name to Hironori Ohtsuka, in honor of their father.  They are now often referred to as Hironori Ohtsuka II.
Tatsuo Suzuki founded their own organization in 1991, the third major Wado organization: Wado Kokusai. Kokusai means 'international.'
Organization's name
According to Ishizuka Akira, a veteran figure in the Japanese karate world, the term Wado Kai was in general use as early as the 1940s, but it was only in 1967 that the name was adopted formally. Prior to this the group was known as the Zen Nihon Karate-do Renmei. With the formation of the Federation of All Japan Karatedo Organization (FAJKO, later changed to JKF) in the mid 60's, it was no longer correct to use this name so Wadokai came into formal use.
The term Wadokai can be broken into three parts: Wa, do and kai. Wa can be read to mean 'harmony' but also as "original Japan", allowing a pun in the name. Do is a Japanese term for 'way' (as in karate-do). So Wado means 'the way of (Japanese) harmony'. Kai simply means 'association'.
Different Wado names
The full name of the Japanese Wadokai federation in English is Japan Karatedo Federation Wadokai. In Japanese it is Zen Nihon Karatedo Renmei Wadokai.
Nowadays the full name of Wadoryu is Wadoryu Karatedo Renmei.
The full name of Wado Kokusai is Wado Kokusai Karatedo Renmei, also known as Wado International Karatedo Federation abbreviated as WIKF.
Strictly speaking Hironori Ohtsuka founded and developed Wado Ryu. The people who trained with them became the Wado group or Wadokai. So today, the style that is trained within Wadokai is Wado Ryu. The Wadoryu Renmei people (Jiro Ohtsuka's group) sometimes referred their style as Wadoryu Jujutsu Kenpo to assert their emphasis in the Jujutsu roots of Wado.
Currently Wadokai and Wadoryu have spread to several other countries under the governing bodies in Japan. Several dojos have transitioned between the two associations with slight variations in the styles.

The green manakin (Cryptopipo holochlora) is a species of bird in the family Pipridae. It occurs in humid forest in lowlands and foothills. The distribution is disjunct, with one population in the western Amazon Basin and adjacent east Andean foothills in southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru, and another population in the humid Chocó in eastern Panama, western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. It has been suggested that the latter population may be a separate species, the Lita manakin (Cryptopipo litae). As suggested by its common name both the male and the female of the green manakin are overall green. It remains fairly common locally (but is easily overlooked), and is consequently considered to be of the least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.

Cecil Dale Andrus (August 25, 1931 – August 24, 2017) was an American politician who served 26th and 28th governor of Idaho, for total of fourteen years. A Democrat, they also served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1977 to 1981 during the Carter Administration. Andrus lost their first gubernatorial election in 1966, but won four (in 1970, 1974, 1986, and 1990) and their 14 years as governor is the most in state history.  They are the most recent Democrat to have held the office.
In public life, Andrus was noted for their strong conservationist and environmental views and accomplishments, and an Idaho wildlife preserve established in 1993 in Washington County is named the Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area in their honor. In 2018, the Cecil D. Andrus–White Clouds Wilderness was renamed after him. A political liberal, they protected the environment by minimizing the control of business interests held over the public domain and by concentrating decision-making in the hands of experts in the Interior Department. They argued that environmentalism can and must coexist with positive economic development.
Early life
Born in Hood River, Oregon on August 25, 1931, Andrus was the middle of three children of Hal Stephen and Dorothy May (Johnson) Andrus, with older brother Steve and younger sister Margaret. They later lived near Junction City, on a farm without electricity. During World War II, the family moved to Eugene in early 1942, when "Cece" was 11, where Hal (1906–2004) and their brother Bud opened a machine shop to refurbish sawmill equipment. Andrus graduated from Eugene High School in 1948 at age 16 and attended Oregon State College in Corvallis, where they majored in engineering in their first-year student year.
At age 17, they got a good summer job with the local utility in 1949, and late in August, they eloped to Reno with Carol Mae May (born December 26, 1932), their high school sweetheart. Andrus had just turned 18, and they were 16 months younger. The Andruses enjoyed a happy, affectionate marriage, and they always referred to them as "his first wife" or "his bride". They decided to keep working and not return to college. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, they enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserves in February 1951, and served as an electronics technician aboard patrol aircraft until 1955. After their discharge from the Navy, Andrus moved to Orofino, where they worked in the timber industry in a variety of jobs at a sawmill their father co-owned. After the sawmill closed, Andrus switched to the insurance industry in 1963, and moved their family down the Clearwater River to Lewiston in 1966.
Political career
State Senate
In 1960, at age 28, and concerned over the local Republican state senator's stance against needed education improvements in Idaho schools, particularly in rural areas of the state, Andrus filed as a Democrat to run against them and won, and was re-elected in 1962 and 1964 from Orofino (and Clearwater County).
Gubernatorial candidate
Andrus first ran for governor in 1966, but was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary by Charles Herndon, an attorney from Salmon.
Seven weeks before the November election, however, Herndon and two others died in a twin-engine private plane crash in the mountains northwest of Stanley, while en route from Twin Falls to Coeur d'Alene in mid-September. Andrus was appointed the nominee to take Herndon's place on the ballot. They lost the general election to Republican Don Samuelson of Sandpoint by more than 11,000 votes, earning Andrus the unlikely distinction of losing both the primary and general election races for the same office in the same year. They returned to the state senate two years later, easily unseating the Republican incumbent in the end represented Herndon's widow, Lucille, was elected to several local political offices after
Governor of Idaho (1971–77)
Undaunted by their earlier setback, Andrus defeated Samuelson by over 10,000 votes in a gubernatorial election rematch in 1970. This was attributed in large part to Andrus's public opposition to proposals for development of molybdenum mining in central Idaho's White Cloud Mountains, which Samuelson supported.
During their first term as governor, Andrus played a key role in winning support by the U.S. Congress for federal designation of the Sawtooth Wilderness Area in the State of Idaho. Andrus was easily re-elected in 1974 with over 70% of the vote, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Jack M. Murphy of Shoshone by a record margin.
In 1974, Time magazine named Governor Andrus one of the "200 Faces for the Future".
Secretary of the Interior (1977–81)
In January 1977, Andrus left their post as governor to serve as Secretary of the Interior for newly inaugurated President Jimmy Carter, whom they had known since both were first-year student governors in 1971. Andrus became the first Idahoan to serve in a Presidential Cabinet. They were succeeded in Idaho by Lieutenant Governor John V. Evans, a Democrat who served nearly a decade, winning re-election in 1978 and in 1982.
Andrus also took a leadership role in securing Congressional passage of the Redwood National Park Expansion Act in 1978. which added to Redwood National Park in California, in a major expansion to preserve remnants of the giant redwood forests there.
In 1979, when President Carter asked for the resignations of their entire Cabinet during an administration retreat at Camp David, the resignation of Andrus was not accepted. Andrus stayed on as Secretary of the Interior for the remainder of Carter's presidency, and returned to Idaho after Carter's term ended in January 1981.
Andrus wrote in their memoir about such a need for compromise relative to their successful, last-ditch efforts in securing passage of the Alaska Lands Act during the last month of the Carter Administration in December 1980, following Ronald Reagan's election in November: "The environmental groups were initially hostile. I actually had to listen to the idiotic argument (from the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club's paid Washington lobbyists) that they could get a better Alaska package out of Reagan and Watt."
"Cooler heads quickly prevailed", Andrus continues, "It proved the old adage that there's nothing like a hanging in the morning to focus the mind. Even though we were creating tomorrow's controversies, a 103-million acre [preservation] plan ... was a lot better than nothing."
Governor of Idaho again (1987–95)
After several years in private life following their return to Idaho in 1981, Andrus surprised many by seeking and recapturing the Idaho governorship in 1986, when they defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor David Leroy in a close open seat election. The incumbent since succeeding Andrus in 1977, Evans had chosen to run for the U.S. Senate, but lost.
During this second stint as governor, Andrus vigorously opposed federal efforts to store nuclear waste in Idaho. They also brokered a path-breaking agreement among land use and conservation interests to control water pollution from nonpoint sources to protect riparian and fish habitat in Idaho's rivers and streams.
In September 1989, Andrus closed off the Idaho border to nuclear waste shipments from the federal government's Rocky Flats site near Denver. They initially agreed to open a temporary dump near Idaho Falls to store waste until the federal government agreed to open a site near Carlsbad, New Mexico. When the federal government failed to open the Carlsbad site, Andrus refused to accept shipments of plutonium from Rocky Flats. Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins did not challenge Andrus's authority to close the border.
In 1990, Andrus drew attention when they vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, which "would have made abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim was under 18, severe fetal deformity or where the pregnancy posed a threat to the mother's life." Andrus was easily re-elected later that year against conservative Republican state senator Roger Fairchild of Fruitland, and won every county except Lemhi and Jefferson.
In their fourth and final term as governor, Andrus was again in the national spotlight due to the Endangered Species Act listing of several Snake River salmon species. These anadromous fish species spawn in their natal streams in Idaho and migrate seaward at a young age. Governor Andrus called attention to the downstream federal dams operated by the Army Corps of Engineers as the major culprit. Their successful lawsuit against the federal government led to incremental changes in operations of the dams, and to continuing efforts for major conservationist modifications to the dams that are ongoing today.
On April 3, 1990, they signed House Bill 817 into law, creating two new types of felony crimes, defined new criminal investigation areas, provided the basis for opening ritual child abuse cases based upon probable cause, and provided a framework for extensive ritual child abuse investigation training throughout Idaho.
Despite remaining personally popular, Andrus did not seek a fifth term in 1994. At their death in 2017, they were the eleventh longest-serving governor in Andrus was succeeded by Phil Batt of Wilder, the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in Idaho since 1966; they served a single term and did not seek a second in 1998. Andrus's re-election in 1990 was the sixth straight gubernatorial win by Democrats in Idaho (Evans in 1978, 1982), but is the most recent; Republicans have since won seven consecutive,
Election results
Elder statesman
A wildlife preservation area in Idaho established in 1993, from Cambridge in Washington County, is named the Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area in their honor.
In 1995, Andrus founded the Andrus Center for Public Policy at Boise State University, and in 1998, published their memoir, Politics Western Style.
An elementary school opened in 1997 in west Boise by the West Ada School District was named the Cecil D. Andrus Elementary School in their honor.
Andrus remained active in the Idaho Democratic Party in the early 21st Century, and continued to campaign on behalf of other Democrats. In 2006, Andrus served as campaign treasurer for Idaho Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brady. In February 2008, Andrus endorsed and campaigned actively on behalf of Illinois Senator Barack Obama in Boise.
At what was described as the "second biggest political rally in Idaho history", by The New York Times, Andrus introduced Obama and recalled hearing John F. Kennedy speak years earlier: "I'm older now, some would suggest in the twilight of a mediocre political career", Andrus said, "[but] I, like you, can still be inspired. I can still hope."
In the closing page of their memoir, Andrus quotes the poet Robert Frost: "We should not have to care so much, you and I." "But we do care", Andrus continues, "and we should. We care about the future ... I remain hopeful that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren all the pleasures of life in an unspoiled West. Perhaps hope should be replaced by a stronger word. It is a matter of obligation."
A 2011 book on Andrus and their career in public service described them as "Idaho's greatest governor".
Death
Andrus died on August 24, 2017, in Boise, just one day before their 86th birthday, of complications from lung cancer.

History
The town and partido were established by provincial law on 21 December 1961. It was named after Domingo Fidel Sarmiento, adopted son of former President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.
The town became widely known in 1995, when a province-wide vote to select a new flag for Buenos Aires Province elected a design made by schoolboys from two schools in Capitán Sarmiento. Governor Eduardo Duhalde later issued a decree declaring the town "Cradle of the flag of Buenos Aires", and in 2011 a monument was erected in the town to commemorate its status as such.

Mobile phone content advertising is the promotion of ring tones, games and other mobile phone services. Such services are usually subscription-based and use the short message service (SMS) system to join up to them. Another method is broadcasting messages to the mobile phone's idle-screen, enabling the mobile operators or advertisers to reach millions in real-time. The advertising and sale of ring tones in particular has seen a massive growth in recent years, with some commercial breaks, particularly on music television channels and in motor racing (especially NASCAR, with Sprint Nextel as the series sponsor), being dominated by such adverts. Advertising in newspapers and magazines has also become popular.
History
The first easily customisable aspect of the mobile phone were the operator logos – small, monochrome images that show the logo of the mobile network operator (such as Vodafone) by default. These were often replaced by a person's name or a small symbol.
As handset manufacturers introduced better ring tones and audio capabilities. The ring tones became the most common method of customising the phone. Web sites containing ring tones of popular songs and tunes started appearing, with many of them providing the service free of charge and with little or no advertising at all – their popularity grew mainly through word of mouth. However, these sites soon started charging a small fee for the privilege. The next step was to advertise these services. However, since the introduction of interchangeable faceplates on mobile phones in 1998, the mobile market has shifted its advertising strategies.
Some companies started large mass media campaigns to advertise the fact that they had the latest tunes and largest collections of ring tones. One of the biggest advertisers is the German company Jamba! (known as Jamster! in some countries), known for the Sweety the Chick and Crazy Frog ringtone characters. After months of public complaints, the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled on 21 September 2005 that many of the advertisements must be shown only after 9 p.m. The primary intention of this was to prevent the company from targeting young people in its campaigns.
Trends
A new trend in mobile phone content advertising is the "ad-supported" mobile phone service model. MVNO's such as Virgin Mobile USA, Xero Mobile, and Blyk offer, or plan to offer, free or subsidized mobile phone service in exchange for subscribers viewing a number of targeted advertisements that are relevant to the subscriber. These MVNO's use a "one person per presentation" model. The relevancy of any given advertisement is based on user demographics, questionnaires, and the like. Leap Wireless International Inc. holds a patent (Owensby 6,647,257)that allows a subscriber to subsidize his/her calls by viewing advertising, and uses a number of subscriber centric factors.
While advertising via a mobile phone is still relatively new, inventors have developed ways to use a mobile phone to present advertising to persons standing near a mobile phone user while the user speaks in a non-handsfree mode. Bayne's invention (Bayne, U.S. Pat. Application Nos. 20050239448 & 20050239495)teaches providing a mobile phone user with incentives (e.g. discounted talk time, free content, etc.) for allowing the phone to be used as a mini-billboard by manipulating the main screen to face outward to present advertising (in an alternate embodiment the invention uses the rear-facing screen). This invention differs from the conventional approach of "one person per presentation", and is based on the observation that "birds of a feather flock together" to give the advertiser multiple views per presentation and a demographic that is the same, or similar to, the subscriber. Inventor Okawa (U.S. Pat. Application 20040259599) teaches a similar invention for presenting advertising to unspecified persons near a mobile phone user, using the rear screen, while the user speaks on a mobile phone. Presentation to persons other than the user will likely be used to increase market share in low-income/high-population areas, as well as provide a line extension for ad-supported MVNO's.
A new approach to mobile content advertising is the use of viral marketing. Through specially designed programmes users can send recommendations for mobile content they like to their contact lists. Passa Parola, the Italian version of Meyou, has reached a total of 800,000 registered users, by the use of viral marketing alone. From: "MoConDi has the viral say".
Motorsports
On 19 June 2003 NASCAR prohibited advertising by any new mobile phone companies who were not in the sport at the time; mobile phone companies who were involved could stay with their current teams, but once they break from their current teams, they could not advertise in NASCAR's premier series. This prohibition was a byproduct of the new ten-year contract with Nextel Communications.
Motorsport advertising has been prevalent, especially to replace tobacco; in 2000, Alltel sponsored a car in the NASCAR Busch Series for Herzog Motorsports, and rookie driver Jimmie Johnson. That partnership lasted only one year, as a result of Greg Penske joining the Board of Directors for Alltel. The firm then moved its sponsorship to Penske Racing with driver Ryan Newman. BellSouth in 1997 began advertising with Team Sabco (later Chip Ganassi Racing) before merging its mobile phone business with Southwestern Bell to form Cingular Wireless in 2001; Cingular then joined Richard Childress Racing in 2002. Both firms are grandfathered under NASCAR's deal with Nextel.
In Formula One, McLaren has signed a deal with Vodafone to sponsor their F1 team effective 2007. Ferrari is reportedly signed with Telecom Italia's Alice brand of services in 2007 where the Alice brand will appear as the "primary" sponsor of the red cars where Marlboro is prohibited.

Robinson Ridge () is a rocky coastal peninsula between Sparkes Bay and Penney Bay, at the east side of the Windmill Islands. It was first mapped from air photos taken by the U.S. Navy Operation Highjump in February 1947. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Lieutenant Commander Frederick G. Robinson, U.S. Navy, aerological officer with U.S. Navy Operation Windmill which established astronomical control stations in the area in January 1948.

Space-filling trees are geometric constructions that are analogous to space-filling curves, but have a branching, tree-like structure and are rooted. A space-filling tree is defined by an incremental process that results in a tree for which every point in the space has a finite-length path that converges to it. In contrast to space-filling curves, individual paths in the tree are short, allowing any part of the space to be quickly reached from the root.
The simplest examples of space-filling trees have a regular, self-similar, fractal structure, but can be generalized to non-regular and even randomized/Monte-Carlo variants (see Rapidly exploring random tree). Space-filling trees have interesting parallels in nature, including fluid distribution systems, vascular networks, and fractal plant growth, and many interesting connections to L-systems in computer science.
Definition
A space-filling tree is defined by an iterative process whereby a single point in a continuous space is connected via a continuous path to every other point in the space by a path of finite length, and for every point in the space, there is at least one path that converges to it.
The concept of a "space-filling tree" in this sense was described in Chapter 15 of Mandelbrot's influential book The Fractal Geometry of Nature (1982). The concept was made more rigorous and given the name "space-filling tree" in a 2009 tech report that defines "space-filling" and "tree" differently than their traditional definitions in mathematics. As explained in the space-filling curve article, in 1890, Peano found the first space-filling curve, and by Jordan's 1887 definition, which is now standard, a curve is a single function, not a sequence of functions. The curve is "space filling" because it is "a curve whose range contains the entire 2-dimensional unit square" (as explained in the first sentence of space-filling curve).
In contrast, a space-filling tree, as defined in the tech report, is not a single tree. It is only a sequence of trees. The paper says "A space-filling tree is actually defined as an infinite sequence of trees". It defines as a "sequence of trees", then states " is a space-filling tree". It is not space-filling in the standard sense of including the entire 2-dimensional unit square. Instead, the paper defines it as having trees in the sequence coming arbitrarily close to every point. It states "A tree sequence T is called 'space filling' in a SpaceX if for every x ∈ X, there exists a path in the tree that starts at the root and converges to x.". The standard term for this concept is that it includes a set of points that is dense everywhere in the unit square.
Examples
The simplest example of a space-filling tree is one that fills a square planar region. The images illustrate the construction for the planar region . At each iteration, additional branches are added to the existing trees.
Space-filling trees can also be defined for a variety of other shapes and volumes.
Below is the subdivision scheme used to define a space-filling for a triangular region.
At each iteration, additional branches are added to the existing trees connecting the center of each triangle to the centers of the four subtriangles.
The first six iterations of the triangle space-filling tree are illustrated below:
Space-filling trees can also be constructed in higher dimensions. The simplest examples are cubes in and hypercubes in .
A similar sequence of iterations used for the square space-filling tree can be used for hypercubes. The third iteration of such a space-filling tree in is illustrated below:

Vanguard SLV-6, also called Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle-Six, hoped to be the third successful flight of the American Vanguard rocket following the successful Vanguard 2 satellite on rocket Vanguard SLV-4. Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle-6 (SLV-6) was designed to carry a small spherical satellite into Earth orbit to study solar heating of Earth and the heat balance. A faulty second stage pressure valve caused a mission failure.
Launch vehicle
Vanguard was the designation used for both the launch vehicle and the satellite. The first stage of the three-stage Vanguard Test Vehicle was powered by a General Electric X-405 thrust liquid rocket engine, propelled by kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen, with helium pressurant. It was finless, tall, in diameter, and had a launch mass of approximately .
The second stage was a high, of diameter Aerojet General AJ-10 liquid engine burning Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and White Inhibited Fuming Nitric Acid (WIFNA) with a helium pressurant tank. It produced a thrust of and had a launch mass of approximately . This stage contained the complete guidance and control system.
A solid-propellant rocket with of thrust (for 30 seconds burn time) was developed by the Grand Central Rocket Company to satisfy third-stage requirements. The stage was high, in diameter, and had a launch mass of . The thin steel casing for the third stage had a hemispherical forward dome with a shaft at the center to support the satellite and an aft dome fairing into a steel exit nozzle.
The total height of the vehicle with the satellite fairing was about . The payload capacity was to a Earth orbit. A nominal launch would have the first stage bringing the rocket to an altitude of , followed by the second stage to , whereupon the third stage would bring the satellite to orbit. This was the same launch vehicle configuration, with minor modifications, as used for Vanguard TV-3 and all succeeding Vanguard flights up to this one.
Spacecraft
The SLV-6 satellite was a , of diameter sphere. The shell was composed of magnesium alloy and the interior was pressurized. The payload instrumentation package was mounted in the center of the sphere. The package was arranged in a cylindrical stack with mercury batteries at the bottom, followed by the Minitrack tracking system electronics, the environment electronics, the telemetering instrumentation, and the experiment electronics. Below the package at the bottom of the sphere was the separation device, a spring loaded tube with a timer designed to push the satellite away from the third stage after orbit was reached. At the top of the interior of the sphere was a pressure gauge. Four spring-loaded metal rods were folded along the equator of the sphere and would protrude radially outward when deployed, acting as a turnstile antenna. Mounted at the end of each antenna rod was a thermistor to measure solar heating processes. Two transmitters were used, one of 10 mW broadcasting at 108.00 MHz and one of 100 mW at 108.03 MHz.
Launch
Vanguard SLV-6 launched on 22 June 1959 at 20:16:09 GMT. It was launched from Launch Complex 18A (LC-18A) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). The second stage helium control bottle valve failed to open properly at engine start. Tank and chamber pressures rapidly decayed during second stage burn, and 40 seconds after engine start, the helium bottle ruptured due to pressure buildup. The third stage then separated and ignited, driving itself and the satellite into the Atlantic Ocean downrange.

Weingeister (English: Wine Spirits) is the eighth and final release of Einstürzende Neubauten's Musterhaus project, a series of highly experimental CD releases that were only available via an annual subscription through their website or from shows during their 25th Anniversary Tour. This project was separate from their Neubauten.org Supporter Project, which it ran concurrent to.
The central theme of this last Musterhaus release is recordings of the band members drinking and enjoying different kinds of wine. As quoted from the back of the album:
"It started out as just an idea, perhaps out of a simple wish to drink some wine with friends as a performance, not talking, just ritualised behavior (symposium in the original sense?), concentrating on just the wine and on the sound. Everything was miked, the table, the glasses, the throats - and we really didn't know where this was taking us. Yes, the wines were good."

Luwu Regency (Kabupaten Luwu in Indonesian) is a regency of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The administrative capital now lies at Belopa, since the former capital (Palopo) became an independent municipality (city) in 2006, at which date the then existing Luwu Regency was split into four entities - Palopo city, North Luwu Regency, East Luwu Regency, and the residual Luwu Regency. The regency now covers 2,909.08 km2 and had a population of 287,472 at the 2010 census and 365,608 at the 2020 census. The official estimate as at mid 2021 was 367,454.
The first regent of the reduced Luwu Regency was H. M. Basmin Mattayang from 2004 to 2009, then Ir. H. Andi Mudzakkar replaced them as regent from 2009 to 2014 following the first direct election in Luwu. Luwu is well known for its natural resources, such as rice, cocoa, coconut, banana, sagu (sago), rambutan, langsat, and others.
History
Luwu is named after the Luwu Kingdom, one of the three biggest kingdoms (and the oldest one) in South Sulawesi; the other two kingdoms were Gowa-Tallo (which became Gowa Regency and Makassar) and Bone (which became Bone Regency). The name "Luwu" had been known from the 13th century when the first king of the Lontara period of Luwu was throned. In Luwu history, there are two periods; the Galigo period and the Lontara period.
The Galigo period is matched from La Galigo or I La Galigo (an ancient literature, the longest epic in the world) which founded by B.F. Matthes in 1888. By R.A. Kern, a Dutch historian, the Galigo period is described as pre-historic time. The other historians said Galigo as pseudo-history. In I La Galigo, there are three places that said; Wara, Luwu, and Wewangriu that always said as Tompotikka.
Sanusi Daeng Mattata, author of Luwu dalam Revolusi, said that Luwu word is taken from riulo which means divine extended from above. This name is related to oral tradition that sacred in Luwu. In that oral tradition said that this world is divinely extended from sky, paved, then blessed by abundant natural resources.
The origin of Luwu name is taken from other words too; malucca (Bugis Ware' Language) and malutu (Palili' Language) which both mean turbid or dark. Turbid means always full with contents like river color when flooded. Dark interpreted as forest and sago near to the beach. Then malucca and malutu become malu and then becomes luwu.
C. Salombe in their book said that word 'Lu' in Luwu is taken from 'lau' word means sea or East. Salombe said Toraja is the way of Luwu people call the people who live in mountain or West. To Raja or To Riaja means people on the highland or people in the West. Luwu or Lu is the way of Toraja people call the people who live in beach or East or lowland.
Geographic condition
Geographically, Luwu is located on 2°3'45” to 3°37'30” South Latitude and 119°15” to 121°43'11” West Longitude.
Administrative borders are:
Luwu is split into two separate areas by the city of Palopo in the middle. The northern area comprises the six districts of Walenrang, Walenrang Timur (East Walenrang), Lamasi, Walenrang Utara (North Walenrang), Walenrang Barat (West Walenrang) and Lamasi Timur (East Lamasi) districts - or Walenrang and Lamasi (abbreviated as "Walmas"). The southern area comprises the remaining sixteen districts tabulated below.
Climate
Luwu regency has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round. The following climate data is for the town of Belopa, the seat of the regency.
Administration
Luwu Regency in 2010 comprised 21 administrative districts (Kecamatan), but an additional district (Bassesangtempe Utara) was subsequently created from part of Bassesangtempe District. The 22 districts are tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2021. The table also includes the number of villages (desa and kelurahan) in each district, and its post code.
Note: (a) the 2010 population of the new Bassesangtempe Utara District was included in the 2010 total of Bassesangtempe District.
Some 1,000 protesters recently expressed their anger that the House of Representatives did not include the requested Central Luwu Regency, which they wanted to be separated from Luwu Regency, in the planned creation of 65 new regencies and autonomous cities, on 24 October 2014. These local residents believed Central Luwu was ready to become a separate regency. There are six districts in the planned regency: Walenrang, East Walenrang, West Walenrang, North Walenrang, Lamasi and East Lamasi with a combined area of 714.29 km2 and a total population of 91,885 in 2010 and 97,643 in mid 2021.
Natural resources and culinary
The most known culinary in Luwu is kepurung (kapurung, pugalu, bugalu, kapeda) which is made from sago plant (Metroxylon sagu). There is dange which is made from sago too. The other culinary is pacco and bagea.
Luwu is known as a fruit producer, such as durian, langsat (Lansium parasiticum), rambutan, and many others.
Culture
Luwu is the origin of the longest epic in the world, La Galigo that created before Mahabharata. Some manuscript of I La Galigo is saved in European Museums, like in Leiden University Library. I La Galigo manuscript is the story about Sawerigading and known well in Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and through Malaysia.
On May 25, 2011, La Galigo manuscript in Leiden University Library was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register affirming its world significance and outstanding universal value.

The Mahat chapel of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II is an ancient Egyptian funerary chapel (Egyptian: mahat) built by king Mentuhotep II (reigned c. 2046 BC – 1995 BC) at Abydos. The remains of the well preserved chapel were found in 2014.
The chapel was discovered on 23 April 2014, after noting a ground subsidence in front of a house in Abydos, because of illegal excavations. The Tourism and Antiquities Police was able to find the illegal diggers and the Ministry of Antiquities was sending several archeologists for investigating the remains.
The remains of the chapel are very close to the enclosure of the temple of Seti I. About 20 meter north of the funerary chapel there are the remains of a similar one, belonging to the New Kingdom king Ramesses I. The excavations have so far unearthed a chamber 2.6 m wide and about 4.2 m below modern floor level. The walls are built of fine limestone and decorated with reliefs. They show different deities and king Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II. A longer inscription states that the chapel was erected for Osiris, Khentiamentiu, Wepwawet and all gods who are in Abydos. The inscription calls the chapel mahat and reports that a canal was dug for the chapel.
At Abydos there are several royal chapels. This one is so far the oldest.

Reeves Glacier () is a broad glacier originating on the interior upland and descending between Eisenhower Range and Mount Larsen to merge with the Nansen Ice Sheet along the coast of Victoria Land. Discovered and named by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09, under Shackleton. The New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) reported that the glacier is probably named for William Pember Reeves, former New Zealand Cabinet Minister, and the Agent-General for New Zealand in London, 1896–1909.

Rev. Archibald "Archie" Eneas Robertson (1870–1958), was a Church of Scotland minister.  They are generally regarded as being the first mountaineer to climb all 282 Munros, the peaks of Scotland over in height, first listed by Sir Hugh Munro.
Life
They were born in Helensburgh on 3 July 1870, the son of a prosperous merchant then educated at Glasgow Academy. They then studied divinity at Glasgow University, graduating from MA in 1892 and BD in 1896.
From 1897 to 1906 they assisted in churches in Edinburgh and Musselburgh.
In 1907 Robertson became minister of Braes of Rannoch (near the Bridge of Gaur, on the River Gaur) where they made an effort to learn Scottish Gaelic, to deliver their sermons in Gaelic and try to keep the language alive.
In 1918 they moved to Edinburgh as chaplain of Astley Ainslie Hospital. In 1946 they were elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Their proposers were John (Ian) Bartholomew, Murray Macgregor, James Ernest Richey, Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross, Douglas Guthrie and James Ritchie.
They were president of the Scottish Mountaineering Club 1930–32. In 1946 they became the first president of the Scottish Rights of Way Society.
They died at home in Edinburgh on 22 June 1958.
Climbing reputation
They climbed their first Munro in 1889. They joined the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1893.
Doubts have been expressed about whether they climbed Ben Wyvis, and they did not climb the Inaccessible Pinnacle. They admitted turning back on Ben Wyvis because of adverse weather, and it is not known whether they climbed it again. The Inaccessible Pinnacle was not classified as a Munro in 1901, only its parent peak Sgurr Dearg, which is slightly lower.
Robertson's final Munro was Meall Dearg on Aonach Eagach in Glen Coe. On reaching the summit, they famously kissed the cairn and then their wife.
Family
They married twice: first to Katherine Clayson McFarlane, then, following their death in 1935, they married Winifred Dorothy Hutchison.

The Easter Group is the central of three groups of islands that make up the Houtman Abrolhos island chain. The group measures about 20 kilometres by 12 kilometres, and consists of a number of islands including
Rat Island
Wooded Island
Morley Island
Suomi Island
Alexander Island. Unlike the other groups the Easter Group has few shipwrecks. The group is part of the Houtman Abrolhos Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for supporting large numbers of breeding seabirds.
The group was discovered and named in April 1840 by the crew of HMS Beagle, under the command of John Clements Wickham. Stoke's journal, published as Discoveries in Australia in 1846, records the following for April 11:

Yeoman Credit Racing was a name used by two different Formula One motor racing teams in the early-1960s: the British Racing Partnership (1960); and Reg Parnell Racing (1961–62). The name was derived from commercial sponsorship arrangements, the first time that a Formula One racing team had changed their name in deference to sponsorship.
Brief history
The first team to benefit from this commercial relationship was the British Racing Partnership, run by Ken Gregory and Alfred Moss, who were sponsored by Yeoman Credit Ltd. from August 1959. Yeoman Credit was a finance company founded by Joseph Samengo-Turner in the mid-1950s. By 1959/60 the company was being run by Joseph's sons Paul, William and Fabian. With an expanding business in financing retail motor sales, the Samengo-Turner brothers were looking at new ways of advertising Yeoman Credit. This led to a meeting with Ken Gregory of the British Racing Partnership, which resulted in the formation of the first fully sponsored Formula One Grand Prix Team – giving Yeoman Credit the opportunity to secure profile advertising in the press and on television.
Initially the team entered Formula Two, with only occasional Formula One races, but in they made the step to concentrate on a three-car Formula One team running 1959 Cooper T51s, with mixed success. Unfortunately, during this time two of the team's drivers (Harry Schell and Chris Bristow) were killed while racing their cars.
In September 1960 the Yeoman Credit Racing identity and sponsorship funds were moved by the Samengo-Turner brothers to the newly formed Reg Parnell Racing team, as relations between BRP and Yeoman Credit had broken down. BRP had to find a new sponsor and sourced new funding from the United Dominions Trust, a competitor of Yeoman Credit in the financing of retail motor sales. The Yeoman Credit team continued, now in its new dark-blue-and-red liveried Cooper T53s, during . Despite a good start to the season with John Surtees winning the Glover Trophy at Goodwood (the first 1.5 litre non-championship Formula One race), results did not come as expected.
Bowmaker Racing
For the Yeoman Credit's parent company, Bowmaker Limited, decided that the team's name should be changed to Bowmaker Racing. The team decided to invest in a new car which was commissioned from Eric Broadley's Lola Cars company and was the first Formula One design to emerge from the Lola stable. However, Broadley's Lola Mk4 cars did not prove as competitive as had been hoped. Despite full works support from the Lola factory and pole position for their first race, the Dutch Grand Prix, Bowmaker withdrew their financial support before the start of the 1963 Formula One season. Reg Parnell Racing survived the loss of funds, and the death of owner Reg Parnell themselves in 1964, and eventually merged with the British Racing Motors works team in the late 1960s.

Hunt Club Park () is a residential neighbourhood in Gloucester-Southgate Ward in the south end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The Ottawa Neighbourhood Study defines the boundaries of the neighbourhood as being Johnston Road-Blohm Drive and Hunterswood Crescent on the north, Hunt Club Road on the south, Hawthorne Road on the east and Conroy Road on the west. The neighbourhood generally corresponds to Census Tracts 5050001.08 and 5050001.07 which had a combined population of 8,825 as of the Canada 2016 Census. The Census also showed 5 people living east of Hawthorne Road, an area generally not considered part of the neighbourhood, but part of the former census tract.
History
Originally part of Gloucester Township, what is now Hunt Club Park was annexed by the city of Ottawa in 1950, though at the time it was just farm land. The neighbourhood began to be developed in the 1980s by Richcraft Homes, beginning in the west. The eastern part of the neighbourhood was re-zoned in 1987 from industrial to residential, and was completed within the decade. A further development was built near Southwood Park, north of Johnston Road in the early 2000s.
The name "Hunt Club Park" was first applied to the neighbouring Greenboro (also built by Richcraft) when it was being built in the 1980s. By the 1990s, Hunt Club Park was described as starting at Lorry Greenberg Dr, with Greenboro being north and west. The area south of Lorry Greenberg is now considered part of Greenboro.
Demographics
Hunt Club Park has one of the largest Arabic speaking populations in the city, with 16% having Arabic as their mother tongue. English is still the largest language group (51%). French is the third largest language group (12%).
Amenities
The main park in the neighbourhood is Elizabeth Manley Park, which includes a sports field, outdoor rink, a wading pool, ball diamond, pickleball courts, tennis courts, and a playground. Other parks in the neighbourhood include Southwood Park, Topley Park, Controy Park, Dossetter Park, Karsh Park, Calzavara Family Park, Ghosh Park and Forestglade Park. The Calzavara Family Park also includes an outdoor rink, ball diamond and a playground. Schools in the neighbourhood include Robert Bateman Public School and St. Thomas More School. The neighbourhood includes a number of Ottawa Community Housing properties, including Blohm Court, Cameron Court Esson Place, Hunt Club Place and Karsh Court.

Capes & Cowls: Adventures in Wyrd City (usually referred to as Capes & Cowls or merely C&C) is an expandable "book-in-a-box" superhero board game based on Capes & Cowls: The Wyrd City Chronicles by Robin Spriggs. Prior to its commercial release by Wyrd House Press in 2006, the game had been in private circulation, according to publisher Jazz Lieberman, “for well over a decade.”
Gameplay
Capes & Cowls is a superhero skirmish game in which two to four players each recruit a team of super-powered characters from the Wyrd City dramatis personæ and send them into battle against opposing teams. The game is played on a specialized “Battleboard” whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though the outcome of some actions is occasionally determined by the roll of a “Battle Die,” luck plays only a small role in the mechanics of the game.
Capes & Cowls features three primary modes of play and several variants. The three primary modes, intended exclusively for head-to-head competition, are as follows:
BasicIn the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of two or three Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and battles with their opponent's team for a predetermined number of rounds. The player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game wins.
Standard The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of four or five Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. As in the Basic Game, the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game wins.
Adventure The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.
Setting
Though Capes & Cowls emulates the visual aesthetics and fanciful exploits of golden-age and silver-age superhero comic books, its action takes place in a markedly dystopian alternate universe wherein the entire known world falls under the tyrannical jurisdiction of the Wyrd City Powers That Be (WCPTB) and its street-level enforcers, the Wyrd City Freedom Patrol.
Indignant at the appropriation of their sacred name by a government so oppressive, the celestial Sisters Wyrd unleashes upon the world the long-buried forces of mystery, wonder, and magic. This act of cosmic intervention, over time, brings into being a pantheon of super-powered heroes and villains (aside from their telltale biographies and certain scenarios in the game's Adventure Book, no overt distinctions are made between the two) who find themselves at constant odds with not only the Wyrd City Freedom Patrol, but often with each other as well.
Characters
The characters included in the Capes & Cowls master set (all of them principals and supporting cast from the Wyrd City universe) are divided into two types—Heroes and Crews. Both are represented by stand-up figures and character cards. Heroes are depicted on large, blue character cards and defined by name, portrait, stats, and three unique powers, while Crews are depicted on small, gray character cards and defined by name, portrait, stats, and one unique power. The Heroes, Crews, and character-specific powers are as follows:

David Aleksandrovich Dushman (; 1 April 19234 June 2021) was a Soviet Red Army soldier and a fencing trainer of the Soviet Olympic team. Dushman assisted in the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in occupied Poland, and also fought in the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kursk during World War II.
Second World War
Dushman became a volunteer in the Red Army as a tank driver, and participated in the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kursk during the Second World War. They received more than forty decorations and distinctions, including the Order of the Patriotic War.
In the early afternoon of 27 January 1945, Dushman drove their T-34 tank over the electric fence of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in occupied Poland, thereby initiating the liberation of the camp by allowing Red Army ground troops in the 322nd Rifle Division to enter the camp. In the camp, they witnessed starving people, piles of dead bodies, and later said "we threw them all our canned food and immediately went on to hunt down the fascists", but was not aware at the time of the real purpose of the camp or the scale of the atrocities.
They suffered severe injuries three times as a result of the war.
Fencing career
After the war, Dushman became a professional fencer. They were the trainer of the national women's fencing team of the Soviet Union from 1952 to 1988. In their capacity as fencing trainer at the 1972 Summer Olympics, they witnessed the Munich massacre. They were housed right across from the Israeli athletes and described that they were "horrified" by the events, themselves being very conscious of their Jewish background at that time.
Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and former Olympic fencing champion representing West Germany, recalled that when they met Dushman in 1970, Dushman "immediately offered me friendship and counsel, despite [his] personal experience with World War II and Auschwitz, and they being a man of Jewish origin". Bach added that the act was "such a deep human gesture that I will never ever forget it".
Dushman continued to visit their local fencing club to give lessons nearly every day until they were 94, according to the IOC.
Personal life
Dushman was born in Danzig on . Their father was a general, sports physician, and military doctor in the Red Army, while their mother was a pediatrician. Dushman spent part of their childhood in Minsk before the family moved to Moscow, where their father had been hired to lead the medical center at the state institute for sport. Their father was later deported to a Gulag north of the Arctic Circle in 1938 during the Great Purge of Joseph Stalin, where they died ten years later.
Dushman lived in Austria for a few years during the 1990s before moving to Munich. From 1996 until their death on 4 June 2021, they lived in Munich-Neuperlach, along with their wife Zoja until their death several years prior.
At the time of their death they were incorrectly labelled by many media organizations as the last surviving liberator of the Auschwitz concentration camp, however, there were still other liberators of the camp who were alive, including Ivan Martynushkin who lives in Moscow.

James Johnston Mason Brown OBE, FRCSEd (28 February 1908 – 9 June 1964) was a Scottish paediatric surgeon. During World War II they served as a surgical specialist with the 8th Army in North Africa and Italy and was awarded the OBE for this service. As surgeon-in-chief at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, they edited the major textbook The Surgery of Childhood. They were the joint founder of the Scottish Surgical Paediatric Society and a founder member of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (BAPS), of which they became president. They were elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) in 1962 but died in office aged 56 years.
Early life
Mason Brown was born in St Andrews in 1908, the son of David Harley Brown and their wife Catherine (née Mason). They grew up in Edinburgh. and was educated at the Edinburgh Academy. While a schoolboy they developed appendicitis and became seriously ill with peritonitis. They were successfully operated on by Sir John Fraser and this early contact with surgery was a decisive influence on their choice of career. They entered the medical faculty of the University of Edinburgh in 1926 and five years later graduated from MB ChB with honours and the award of the Pattison Prize in Clinical Surgery.
Their earliest postgraduate appointments were resident house officer posts, first in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) with Professor Sir John Fraser, who had saved their lives some years earlier and, secondly with Norman Dott at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC). They then became clinical tutor in the Surgical Outpatient Department of the RIE where they started their research on the ischaemic bone condition osteochondritis dissecans, which earned for them the Syme Surgical Fellowship. They obtained the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd) in 1934, but even before this, Sir John Fraser had invited them to be their private assistant. They went on to become clinical tutor and then University lecturer in surgery under Sir John in the RIE.
Early surgical career
In 1936 Mason Brown was appointed Assistant Surgeon to the RHSC, where their senior colleague was the first woman paediatric surgeon in Scotland, Gertrude Herzfeld, but at this stage they were not yet totally committed to paediatric surgery. In 1937 they were awarded a Crichton Scholarship for research on peripheral vascular disease.
Before World War II they had become a Territorial Officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and on the outbreak of war in September 1939 they were called up for military service. Initially they served as regimental Medical Officer to the 7th/9th Battalion of the Royal Scots (the "Dandy Ninth"). Later they went overseas as a surgical specialist with the 31st General Hospital. With other colleagues including James Ross they published a paper giving an account of the work of a casualty clearing station. Thereafter, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, they commanded the surgical division of the 70th General Hospital in North Africa and Italy. Their surgical division was selected to form the Vascular Injuries Centre for the British Forces in the Mediterranean theatre and they later published an account of this experience. For their contributions in this specialised field of military surgery, they were mentioned in dispatches and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
Post-war career
When the war ended in 1945, Mason Brown returned to the RHSC in Edinburgh where, after Ian Aird had moved to the Chair of Surgery at the Postgraduate Medical School in London and Miss Herzfeld had retired, they became surgeon-In-chief. They were also paediatric surgeon to the Western General Hospital and the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion.
They were well suited for this post as they had a natural rapport with children. Their operative expertise covered the entire field of surgical paediatrics but their special interest was neonatal surgery.
Mason Brown was regarded as an excellent clinical teacher and lecturer. They earned a reputation for the precision and clarity of their writing and they made many contributions to paediatric surgical literature.
Their greatest educational achievement was the publication, in 1962, of The Surgery of Childhood, of which they were editor-in-chief. In this capacity they led a team of 27 distinguished authors in the production of what was the first major British textbook of paediatric surgery since the publication 18 years earlier of Sir John Fraser's single-handed magnum opus bearing the same title.
In 1948, together with Matthew White, a Glasgow paediatric surgeon, Mason Brown founded the Scottish Surgical Paediatric Society and in 1953 they were one of those responsible for the foundation of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (BAPS). At the first meeting they were made a member of the founding executive together with Denis Browne (the first president), David Waterston, Peter Paul Rickham, and Harold Nixon.
They were chosen as the first "James IV surgical traveller" by the James IV Association of Surgeons in 1961 and in this capacity toured surgical centres in North America.
Mason Brown was appointed Secretary and Treasurer of the RCSEd in 1949 and continued as Secretary until 1962, which gave them an in-depth knowledge of the College's history and laws and administrative procedures. They were elected President in 1962, the first specialist paediatric surgeon to hold this office. Soon after becoming President of the RCSEd they were elected President of BAPS.
Family
They married Louie Johnston in 1939 and they had two children.
Death and legacy
Mason Brown died in office in 1964 aged 56. They were succeeded as president of the RCSEd by the Vice-President Professor George Scott.  They are commemorated by the Mason Brown Memorial Lectureship which every two years is awarded jointly by the RCSEd and the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons.

Wolfgang Musculus, born "Müslin" or "Mauslein", (10 September 1497 – 30 August 1563) was a Reformed theologian of the Reformation.
Life
Born in the village of Duss (Moselle), in a German-speaking area (French-speaking, from the Thirty Years War), Musculus was a lover of song and of knowledge, of languages, Humanism and religion. The oral tradition of their songs is still found in the churches of the Reformation.
In 1527, they left the Benedictine monastery at Lixheim (now in the area of Moselle), to serve as deacon of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Strasbourg () and preaching assistant to Matthäus Zell while studying under Bucer and Capito. They left for Augsburg in 1531, and after 17 years of service, they left the town after the introduction of the Augsburg Interim, and came to Switzerland, where they were the primary professor of theology at Bern from 1549. At Bern, they wrote several biblical commentaries and Loci communes sacrae theologiae (Common Places of the Christian Religion), a major systematic theology.
J. S. Bach used Musculus' 1530 hymn, a paraphrase of Psalm 23, as the text for their chorale cantata Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt, BWV 112, which they first performed in Leipzig in 1731.

Will the Circle be Unbroken is the seventh album by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, with collaboration from many famous bluegrass and country-western players, including Roy Acuff, "Mother" Maybelle Carter, Doc Watson, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs, Merle Travis, Pete "Oswald" Kirby, Norman Blake, Jimmy Martin, and others. It also introduced fiddler Vassar Clements to a wider audience.
History
The album's title comes from a song by Ada R. Habershon (re-arranged by A. P. Carter) and reflects how the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was trying to tie together two generations of musicians. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was a young country-rock band with a hippie look. Acuff described them as "a bunch of long-haired West Coast boys." The other players were much older and more famous from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, primarily as old-time country and bluegrass players. Many had become known to their generation through the Grand Ole Opry. However, with the rise of rock-and-roll, the emergence of the commercial country's slick 'Nashville Sound,' and changing tastes in music, their popularity had waned somewhat from their glory years. Acuff was initially contemptuous of the project, but later relented and participated.
The album cover features an image of Union Admiral David Dixon Porter. Every track on the album was recorded on the first or second take straight to two-track masters, so the takes are raw and unprocessed. Additionally, another tape ran continuously throughout the entire week-long recording session and captured the dialog between the players. On the final album, many of the tracks—including the first track—begin with the musicians discussing how to perform the song or who should come in where in any given portion of a song.
The record includes the first meeting of Doc Watson and Merle Travis, after whom Watson's son, Merle, was named. Bill Monroe, sixty years old at the time, refused to participate in the recordings.
Originally appearing in 1972 as a three LP album and three-cassette tape offering, Will the Circle Be Unbroken was remastered and re-released in 2002 as a two compact disc set. The original album was certified platinum by the RIAA on November 6, 1997, indicating shipments of 500,000 copies. It has sold 301,600 copies as of October 2019.
Much later, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded two subsequent albums, Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two and Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III, in an attempt to repeat the process with other historically significant musicians. Volume Two won the Country Music Association's 1989 Album of the Year as well as three Grammys. In 1990, the album was celebrated on the PBS music television program Austin City Limits, which featured a performance by the full ensemble of guests on the Carter Family song, Will The Circle Be Unbroken, from the original 1972 album.

Sweet Oblivion is the sixth studio album by Screaming Trees, released on September 8, 1992. It quickly became the band's best-selling record, and was the closest they ever came to achieving mainstream success. Sweet Oblivion sold in excess of 300,000 copies on the strength of “Nearly Lost You”. The band's biggest hit, “Nearly Lost You” benefited from an appearance on Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, a Top Ten, platinum-selling hit album which featured many other popular Seattle-based music acts from the period.
Around the time of the recording of the album, the band's original drummer Mark Pickerel left to pursue other musical interests, and was replaced with Barrett Martin.
Nearly four years passed in between Sweet Oblivion and the band's follow-up album, Dust, a move that hurt much of the band's commercial momentum.

Salakhain () is a Pakistani Lollywood film which was released in 2004. Stars included Ahmed Butt, Zara Sheikh and Meera. The music was composed by M Arshad. Sajid Hassan and Saud were cast as villains with Shafi Muhammad as their boss.
Synopsis
Salakhain is an Urdu feature film set in the backdrop of Gawalmandi, Lahore. It is the story of a young man who is passionate about life and dreams of a bright and prosperous future. Little do they know what life has in store for him?  They are destined for a future engulfed with hatred, anger and revenge.
Introducing Ahmed Butt, Pakistan's most-sought-after male model and winner of LUX Style Awards for 2003 for Best Model, in the lead role, Salakhain is devoid of compassion and sympathy, but full of action.
Film's Plot
Salakhain tells the story of an innocent, hardworking student called Faizan (Ahmed Butt) who comes from a lower-middle-class family and who is in love with an equally innocent and earnest looking young girl. Faizan is 'the good son' and wants to live up to their father's dream which is to run a business and improve the lifestyle of their family. Unfortunately the dreams are shattered while they were taking their exams as they are implicated in a crime- a dispute with the 'booti mafia' (people facilitating cheating during exams), this results in their father's death and mother's mental health suffers due to shock of the tragic events, one following the other in quick succession.
In jail, they meet a man called Zaigham (Saud) and becomes friends with them who knows their enemies well and has their own issues to settle with them. Zaigham gets Faizan out of jail. Faizan now wants revenge for their parents. The rest is as predictable as any action movie made anywhere in the world - a journey towards retribution, passing through the maze called politics and crime.
Zara Sheikh, the girl Faizan loves, marries (Sami Khan) a police officer who is looking for Faizan since they are a criminal and Zara hides their picture when they see it in Sami's wanted list so they won't know what they look like. Meera and Faizan team up to kill Sajid Hassan who is the gang leader. Meera wants to kill them because they killed their sister by throwing acid on their face. Faizan finds their mother and, at the end, in a shootout Faizan finds out that Zara is married and Meera and Faizan are killed in a shootout.
Film's Reception
It was a super-hit film of 2004 in Pakistan.

Edward R. Murrow High School is located in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, New York City, New York and is part of the New York City Department of Education. The school is known for its theater program. Its success in the arts was recognized by Mel Brooks, who granted the school to be the first-ever to gain rights to the musical The Producers in spring 2008. It is a school of the arts where students are either music, dance, communication arts, theater, or art majors. The school was created under the supervision and leadership of Saul Bruckner, who was also the first principal of the school.
Murrow H.S. opened in 1974 with Saul Bruckner as principal. The school was named for the pioneering broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow. Murrow H.S. was founded according to the pedagogical theories of John Dewey and the learning and teaching methods of John Dewey High School. Bruckner retired in 2004 and died on May 1, 2010, in Brooklyn, New York. Anthony Lodico became Murrow's second principal. In March 2012, Lodico announced their resignation from Murrow in order to accept a High School Superintendent position. On April 2, 2012, Allen Barge assumed the role of principal of the school.
Academics
Murrow's academic year is divided into two semesters. Students receive new class schedules and teachers at the end of January. The daily schedule shifts depending on the day of the week, with class lengths varying from 45 minutes to an hour, and each class meets only four times a week. Rather than having a lunch period or study halls, Murrow students have free periods called "OPTA's" (Optional Time Activities), used for studying, eating, or relaxing.
Murrow has a number of unique features including:
NYC High School adjusted its grade policies in 2013 so that a "U" is used instead of an "N". The letter grading system, with each letter corresponding to a numerical measurement, e.g. E = 90-100, G = 80–89, S = 79–65, U = 65 - 55, NS = below 55 (No Show = student who never reported to class), and MI for Mastery in Independent Study.
In calculating the average, E is treated as a 95, G = 85, S = 75, and U = 55. This means that for getting the highest grade in all classes, a student will not achieve an average higher than 95. In college admissions applications, an explanatory letter is forwarded to colleges to explain this fact.
Instead of using numbers to represent class periods, Murrow uses letters from A-J, excluding I. The periods are called "bands" (e.g., A-Band, D-Band). Some students take classes that meet before A-Band and after J-Band. These bands are "0 (zero)-Band" and "K-Band"
There are no daily "home room" meetings. Entering students are assigned to a "Student Communication Section", or SCS, and remain in that SCS until graduation. The SCS meets only on an "as needed" basis and is used solely for dissemination of school-wide administrative/logistical information (e.g., distribution of report cards or new class schedules; election of class officers); 2 morning bands are cut short to allow time for SCS to convene. For mandated citywide testing, students usually attend a half-day of classes, followed by the test in the SCS.
While many state-mandated courses (e.g., science- and math-based courses) are geared toward students of a particular class year, other elective courses (e.g., performing arts, physical education electives) are not; students taking these electives will usually find themselves in classes with students from other class years.
Edward R. Murrow High School is also known for its outstanding theater program. Their success in the arts was recognized by Mel Brooks, who granted the school to be the first-ever to gain rights to the smash hit musical "The Producers" in Spring 2008.
In attempt to diversify schools, some high schools in NYC, including Murrow, use the DOE's "Educational Option" model. Instead of tracking, schools admit learners of all capabilities by purposefully accepting a set percentage of students with high, middle and low test scores.
Student demographics
There were over 4,000 students in the school as of the 2016–2017 school year. The ethnic breakdown of the school is 28% White (non-Hispanic), 23% Black or African American, 26% Asian, 21% Hispanic or Latino and 0.2% Native American. The student/teacher ratio is 30/1. The Department of Education has released the annual Progress Reports for all high schools and Murrow.
Programs and activities
Theater
Murrow has a theater program that explores all the collaborative components of theater. Students learn all the aspects of theater including acting, technical theater, musical theater, and theater management. According to an article in The New York Times, students voluntarily stay after school work with theater program even on weekends and free periods. Students were painting the backdrop for the school's annual musical Into the Woods. Students prepare months before the musical. In the costume department, freshmen were busy sewing leaves and vines. Students were designing lighting sets.
Music
The school has instrumental and vocal music programs that includes large ensemble, small ensemble, solo performance, and musicianship. Both programs require audition. For instrumental music, students may audition for more than one instrument. Students must bring their own instruments (except piano, tuba, double bass, harp, percussion and guitar amplifiers, which are provided by the school) and a copy of the music they are performing. For vocal music, students must perform a song without accompaniment.
In 2018, the schools music technology program hosted the Second Annual Music x Tech Fest, a show in which students and alumni performed original songs and presented music videos that they had created to raise money for charity.
Fine and visual arts
The school has a discipline-based visual art program that includes studios in drawing, painting, sculpture, mixed media, animation, digital media, photography, fashion, art history, and portfolio development. In 2014, the school renovated its TV studio.
Bilingual programs
The school has Spanish and Chinese transitional bilingual program open to English language learners. Classes in two major content areas are taught in English and the other language.
Sports
The school offers a variety of varsity and junior varsity sports. These sports include badminton, bowling, cross-country, golf, soccer, table tennis and volleyball. The school shares an athletic field with Midwood High School.
Extracurricular activities
The school offers extracurricular activities including academic teams, art shows, chess, community services, concerts and productions, digital media. key club, mock trial, moot court, music technology, National Honor Society, robotics, s!ng, technical theater and virtual enterprise.
Chess
The Edward R. Murrow chess team has won seven national championships, fifteen state titles and sixteen city championships. The Edward R. Murrow HS chess team's success has been chronicled in the book The Kings of New York, by sportswriter Michael Weinreb. The Kings of New York follows the 2005 championship-winning season of the Murrow Team. It was reviewed positively in the March 4, 2007 NY Times Book Review. The team was personally congratulated by President Bush in the Oval Office on December 15, 2004. A movie, based on "The Kings of New York" will begin production sometime in 2014.

Homer Dwight Chapman (October 4, 1898 – April 4, 2005) was an American scientist, scholar, author, and early pioneer in the development of leaf analysis for diagnosing plant nutrition. Chapman was also former director of the University of California Citrus Experiment Station and a founding faculty member at the University of California, Riverside.
Early life and education
Chapman was born on October 4, 1898 in Darlington, Wisconsin to William Chapman and Finetta Merriam Chapman. They were the youngest of six children, spending much of their time as a young boy along the Pecatonica River. At age 9, the family moved to a 28-acre farm in the outskirts of Darlington where they produced several goods for sale to the town. In 1917, Chapman graduated from Darlington High School and worked for a year doing odd jobs before attending college. Chapman enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in September 1918 and was drafted into the United States Army shortly thereafter, serving in World War I until they were honorably discharged in December 1918. They received their B.S. (1923), M.S. (1925), and Ph.D. (1927) degrees from the University of Wisconsin.
Professional life
In 1927, Chapman joined the faculty of the University of California Citrus Experiment Station at the invitation of Dr. Walter P. Kelly and accepted the position of Assistant Chemist. They were appointed as Associate Chemist in 1938 and went on to become full Chemist and Professor in 1944. Chapman also chaired the Department of Soils and Plant Nutrition from 1938-1961 and directed the University of California Citrus Experiment Station from 1950-1951. They were instrumental in organizing the first International Citrus Symposium that was held in 1968. This symposium led to the formation of the International
Society of Citriculture where Chapman served as Secretary from 1970-1986. In 1981, they were recognized for their service to the organization by being awarded the Society's first Honorary Membership.
Personal life
Homer Dwight Chapman was married to Daisy Ernst in March 1928 by Reverend Catherwood at a ceremony held in Riverside, California. The couple never had any children and lived in Riverside, California for much of their married life. In 1950, Chapman built the couple's first home, one that they and Daisy would occupy until 1993 when they relocated to Regents Point, a continuing care retirement community in Irvine, California. Chapman was an active member of the local Kiwanis Club in Riverside, California for sixty-five years, serving as president in 1952. Daisy Chapman died at the age of 96 in 1999.
Death and legacy
Homer Dwight Chapman died on April 4, 2005 at the age of 106. They were an active member of the Riverside, California community for over sixty-five years and an avid supporter of the University of California, Riverside. Chapman and their wife Daisy established funds, upon their death, to support students in the sciences and performing arts. In their honor, the University of California, Riverside named the building that Chapman had worked in for many years while employed by the university, Chapman Hall.

The Vilnius Academy of Arts (, previously State Art Institute of Lithuania) in Vilnius, Lithuania, grants a variety of degrees in the arts.
History
The Academy traces its roots back to the creation of the Architecture Department at Vilnius University in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1793. The Department of Painting and Drawing was established in 1797, followed by the Department of Graphics (Engraving), and in 1805 – the Departments of Sculpture and History of art. In 1832, the university was closed, and reopened in 1919 with departments of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Art. In 1940, the art studies in Lithuania were united under Vilnius Art Institute and Kaunas Art School. Later, the Academy saw several re-organisations, and in 1990 the name of Vilnius Academy of Arts was reinstated.
The academy began working with UNESCO in 2000, when the UNESCO department of culture management and culture policy was created.
The museum of the Academy holds about 12,000 pieces, ranging from the 16th century to the works of its most recent students and graduates.

Celso Caesar Moreno (1830 – March 12, 1901) was an adventurer and a controversial political figure on the world stage, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hawaii under Kalākaua. Born in Italy, they fought in the Crimean War and lived throughout Asia, Hawaii and the United States. They moved from one career to another, one grand scheme to another, usually trying to convince governments to pay huge sums of money for their proposals. Their efforts at establishing a trans-Pacific telegraph cable got official government authorization, but no financial backers. They became a naturalized American citizen in 1878, and a naturalized citizen of Hawaii in 1880. Moreno spent their final years living in Washington, D. C., trying to eliminate the padrone system that created slavery conditions within the Italian immigrant labor force.
Early life
Celso Caesar Moreno, also known as Cesare Moreno and C. C. Moreno, was born into a Roman Catholic family in the Piedmont region of Italy at Dogliani. According to testimony they gave in an 1896 court trial, they were born in 1830, and became a naturalized United States citizen in California in 1878. Their family was financially well off enough to send them to private Catholic schools where they became fluent in multiple languages. After furthering their education at a military academy, Moreno enlisted in the Piedmontese regular army, serving in the Crimean War. Before the war's end, they decided against a military career, and enrolled in the University of Genoa, graduating as a civil engineer in 1856.
Asia
They quickly lost interest in working as a civil engineer, and became captain of their own steamship, eventually arriving in Indonesia. In the Dutch East Indies territory of Sumatra, Moreno changed their occupation once again, and was in the service of the Sultan Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah 1859–1862, marrying one of the sultan's daughter. After running afoul of the Dutch government, they abandoned their wife and fled the Dutch East Indies, returning to Europe. They began lobbying efforts in Italy and France advocating a colonization of Sumatra, first with Victor Emmanuel II and then with Napoleon III. Neither of those efforts came to fruition, but Napoleon III was sufficiently impressed by Moreno to send them as a representative to Tonquin in Vietnam.
About two years after they had arrived at Tonquin, Moreno made the acquaintance of Li Hung-chang, the Viceroy of Zhili, who founded the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company with a vision towards establishling a steamship line between China and California. Li Hung-chang had already begun formulating plans for a trans-Pacific telegraph line. Moreno would become a key player in both projects.
The United States
Moreno showed up in Washington D. C. in 1868, as the "White Chief Mustapha Moreno", trying to sell the United States government an unnamed Malaysian island, and their services as an envoy to the island, for $500,000. The story they gave to newspapers, is that they discovered the inhabited island in February 1862, "took possession in their own name", and was elected the White Chief Mustapha by the locals. They were making the offer, they said, as a promise to the island's inhabits that in selling the island they would have the protection of the United States. A newspaper mention inferred that Secretary of State William H. Seward, who had negotiated the 1867 Alaska Purchase, was in favor of the sale; however, nobody took Moreno up on the offer.
In 1869, they published American Interests in Asia, a 40-page pamphlet urging the United States to expand its sphere of influence by establishing treaties, "territorial concessions" and naval stations in Asia. He, in fact, suggested that the US team with Russia to divide up India between themselves. President Ulysses S. Grant allowed Moreno an audience to expound on the subject.
As a representative of the American and Asiatic Telegraph Company, Moreno promoted Li Hung-chang's idea of an undersea telegraph cable between Asia and the mainland United States. They spent time in California lobbying among influential leaders in hopes of gaining financial support for the project, then began lobbying the United States Congress. Senator Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen introduced a bill on May 18, 1874, to grant a charter to Moreno and thirteen others for the construction and maintenance of the trans-Pacific cable. Moreno addressed Congress four months later on September 26, detailing the specifics of the proposal. A bill was passed and signed by President Grant, for a non-exclusive charter requiring the project to begin no later than three years after the bill's August 15, 1876 passage. Subsequent fund raising efforts for the project were unsuccessful, and the deadline expired without the cable being started.
Kingdom of Hawaii
King Kalākaua
When Congress was considering Moreno's telegraph cable charter in 1874, Kalākaua was in the nation's capital as head of the Kingdom of Hawaii delegation negotiating the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. According to journalist Helen Geracimos Chapin, that is the place and time period the two first became acquainted. Hawaiian historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall pinpointed the same time frame, but placed their first meeting at San Francisco. The December 1, 1874 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle report of the king's trip attests to their first meeting being during a public reception held by Kalākaua in San Francisco's Grand Hotel. Moreno first approached the king as owner of three telegraph cable charter companies, regaling Kalākaua with tales of their global adventures.
Moreno arrived in Honolulu, November 14, 1879, on the Chinese steamer Ho-Chung as the official representative of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, empowered to negotiate with the Kingdom of Hawaii. Among its regular line of business, the steamer ferried Chinese contract laborers to Hawaii and the United States; 451 laborers arrived with Moreno. American minister to Hawaii General described Moreno as a gregarious personality, who ingratiated themselves through frequent visits to the palace. Kalākaua believed that Moreno held similar perspectives to their own on many issues. Moreno got Kalākaua to press the legislature on June 1, 1880 for an $18,000 annual trade subsidy for the company. The proposal was sent to a committee composed of George Washington Pilipō, Samuel Gardner Wilder, Godfrey Rhodes, John L. Kaulukou, and John K. Hanuna. The committee recommended against it on the basis that there was no market in China for Hawaiian exports, and that providing a subsidy might result in the reverse effect of Chinese imports glutting the Hawaiian market. The legislature concurred with the recommendation of the committee.
In spite of the expiration of the telegraph cable legislation, Moreno managed to convince Kalākaua and the legislature in the first week of July, to pass a resolution guaranteeing them a $1,000,000 bonus in gold coins upon completion of the cable. Trying to make themselves look more influential than they are, Moreno claimed to be a close associate of James A. Garfield, who was at that time a candidate (and subsequent winner) in the United States presidential election. Comly asked Garfield directly about the alleged relation, with Garfield issuing a strong denial. It was only through legislative intervention by Wilder that the resolution was defeated.
Their efforts at overturning Hawaii's stringent opium laws, and acquiring a monopoly on the manufacture and distribution of the drug for trafficking in the Pacific area, were almost successful. It took several weeks, and three different versions of the verbiage, but the legislature passed an opium bill on July 30 that would grant a two-year $120,000 per-annum license. Added to the final version of the bill was a $24,000 subsidy for the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company. When it reached Kalākaua for their signature, they vetoed it.
The king had been at odds with their ministers for some time, and dismissed their entire cabinet on August 14, 1880, the same day Moreno became a naturalized citizen of Hawaii. Moreno replaced Minister of Foreign Affairs John Mākini Kapena. Wilder was replaced by as Minister of the Interior. Attorney General Edward Preston was replaced by W. Claude Jones. Minister of Finance Simon Kaloa Kaai was replaced by Moses Kuaea. The diplomatic corps stationed in Hawaii refused to acknowledge Moreno's position, and Comly privately tried to reason with the king about the inappropriateness of having Moreno in the cabinet. Mass meetings were held in Honolulu, and community leaders urged Kalākaua to remove him. On August 18, Kalākaua accepted Moreno's resignation from the cabinet.
Robert Wilcox and John Colburn
On August 30, Moreno left Honolulu for Italy, as guardian of Robert Napuʻuako Boyd, Robert William Wilcox and James Kaneholo Booth, the first students under the new Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad. When Kalākaua visited Italy on their 1881 world tour, they learned Moreno had misrepresented the young men as Kalākaua's family. Although Moreno was immediately removed as their guardian, Wilcox maintained contact with them for years.
When the 1887 Bayonet Constitution ended their funding, Wilcox was forced to return to Hawaii. On July 30, 1889, they led 150 insurrectionists in a failed attempt at forcing Kalākaua into reverting to the 1864 Constitution. A published letter from Moreno to Wilcox was indicative that Wilcox relied on them for political advice and reassurance.
After the 1891 death of Kalākaua, their sister Liliuokalani became regent and was deposed in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Published correspondence from Wilcox to Moreno is affirmation that Wilcox believed Moreno had enough political ties in Washington D. C. to influence the events in Honolulu. Shortly before they led the failed 1895 Wilcox rebellion, they sent a letter to Moreno asking them to return to Hawaii to become Premier.
John F. Colburn, a Hawaii businessman who was appointed the Minister of Interior of the Kingdom of Hawaii under Liliuokalani, also kept in touch with Moreno after their departure from Hawaii. When Liliuokalani tried to promulgate a new constitution, Colburn and the rest of their cabinet refused to sign it, an act that helped lead to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. In spite of their role in those chain of events, Colburn penned a letter to Moreno in October 1893 expressing their hope for restoration of the monarchy and indemnity for the royalists who were loyal to Liliuokalani.
Later years
Moreno stayed in Italy for a while after being removed as guardian of the three Hawaiian youths, and was a member of the Chamber of Deputies in the Kingdom of Italy until King Umberto I discharged all the deputies in 1882.
They eventually returned to Washington, D. C. where they were active in the Italian community, trying to abolish the padrone system (a form of slavery) existent at that time in contract labor from Italy. In 1886, they persuaded Congressman Henry B. Lovering of Massachusetts to introduce a bill to ban importation of slave contact labor from Italy into the United States. On July 11, 1895, Moreno was indicted for libel against Italian minister to the United States, Baron Saverio Fava. The libel case stemmed from an article written by Moreno and published in The Colored American. Therein, they referred to Fava as "Don Bassillo", the hypocrite in the Barber of Saville. Moreno accused Fava of corruption in using their position and influence to perpetuate the trafficking of slaves from Italy, while also reaping financial benefits from the practice. When the case was tried before a jury on October 29, Moreno testified that they had never had any contact with Fava or evidence upon which to base their claims, but rather wrote the article on hearsay. The jury rendered a guilty verdict the same day. Moreno served 90 days jail time.
Congress once again began to consider legislation on a trans-Pacific telegraph cable in 1895. Moreno unsuccessfully lobbied the United States House of Representatives for an extension of their 1876 charter for construction and maintenance of the cable.
In the last year of their life, an endorsement allegedly from Moreno for the patent medicine Peruna appeared in newspapers. Peruna was marketed to ease or cure catarrh, and had an alcohol content of 28%. Moreno was not the only public figure reputed to endorse the product. The manufacturer ran ads with testimonials from well-known doctors, athletes, entertainment celebrities, and members of the United States Congress. Years after Moreno's death, investigative journalist Samuel Hopkins Adams found that the endorsements were often fakes, or the results of blackmail.
Death
Moreno died of a stroke on March 11, 1901, having collapsed on a Washington D. C. sidewalk the day before. They were financially destitute at the time of their death. Local Italian societies took care of the arrangements, and they were buried in a donated plot at St. Mary's Catholic Church cemetery.
Three months after Moreno's death, Baron Fava was recalled "at their own request" to Italy. An editorial in the Barton County Democrat disdained the continuing padrone system, blaming the Italian government for encouraging it and stating that Fava ran interference whenever the United States immigration officials tried to intervene. Moreno had been correct in their accusations, just incorrect in how they had gone about it.

Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters gave the album 6 stars out of 10, saying, "While Port Entropy contains some of Tokumaru's most accomplished compositions yet, on the whole, it's a bit too monochrome for its own good."

The Richter Glacier is a low gradient coastal glacier located west of the Scott Nunataks on the northern side of Edward VII Peninsula. The feature saddles with the Butler Glacier and flows north-west to the sea where it forms a small tongue. The glacier and tongue are depicted on the map of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1928–30. The map indicates that the landing party from the Kainan Maru (Shirase) traversed up this glacier to the summit of the Scott Nunataks in January 1912. The glacier was mapped in detail by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from ground surveys and US Navy aerial photographs, 1959–65. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Gregory S. Richter, meteorologist-in-charge and scientific leader of the Byrd Station winter party in 1968.

By the Sword Divided is a British television series produced by the BBC between 1983 and 1985.
The series, created by John Hawkesworth, was a historical drama set during the mid-17th century, dealing with the impact of the English Civil War on the fictional Lacey family, made up of both Royalist and Parliamentarian supporters.
It follows the family as it is torn apart by the conflicting and changing loyalties of the war, as families were during that time, and the defeat of the Royalist forces at the end of the First English Civil War. Series two covers the second and third civil wars and the eventual Restoration of the Monarchy. The last episodes see the surviving members of the family (from both sides of the divide) witness the arrival of King Charles II on a visit to the ancestral Lacey home.

Charles Ferdinand Venneman (7 January 1802, Ghent - 22 August 1875, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode) was a Belgian painter who specialized in anecdotal genre scenes, Flemish fairs, and landscapes with animals.
Biography
They received their artistic training from Joseph De Cauwer and Ferdinand de Braekeleer. When they were only eighteen, they took part in the Salon in Ghent. From 1821 to 1836, they made their living doing decorative and furniture painting. After 1836, they were able to devote themselves entirely to their art.
They moved to Antwerp in 1837, to work with their former teacher, De Braekeleer. While there, they came under the influence of the works of David Teniers and Adriaen van Ostade; particularly those that depicted villagers and peasants having fun. The resulting works are nostalgic in nature: pleasant, and reminiscent of similar works from the 17th century. A story line is always implied.
During their career, they had successful exhibitions at the Salons in Antwerp and Brussels, as well as in Ghent. Their paintings became very popular and were often referred to as "Vennemannekens".
As with many prolific 19th century painters, they used a pitch-based paint that does not preserve color very well; leaving their works less colorful and nuanced than they were originally.
Their daughter, also became a painter, but worked in a more Realistic style.

Miriam Santos is an American politician who served as City Treasurer of Chicago.
City Treasurer of Chicago
In 1989, Santos was appointed by newly-elected mayor Richard M. Daley as City Treasurer of Chicago. They were appointed to replace Cecil A. Partee, who had resigned in order to accept an appointment to succeed Daley themselves as Cook County State's Attorney. Santos was being the first Latinx individual to hold citywide office in Chicago.
In 1991, after Santos raised alarm over the city's management of pension funds, mayor Richard M. Daley made an attempt to decrease their powers.
Santos was reelected as City Treasurer in 1993 and 1995, and 1999. In 1998, Santos unsuccessfully ran for Illinois Attorney General.
Santos' 1999 reelection came despite the fact that they are, at the time, under federal indictment for mail fraud and attempted extortion. Months after the 1999 election, they were convicted and forced to resign. Mayor Daley appointed Barbara Lumpkin as Santos' successor. However, Santos' conviction was overturned in 2000, and they were allowed to reclaim their elected position with back pay. However, six months later they again had to resign, as they pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud rather than facing retrial.

Machir Bay is a small bay on the Western coast of the isle of Islay in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. It is one of the features of the Rhinns of Islay and lies within a few hundred metres of the small settlement of Kilchoman. To the north, the cape of Coul Point separates Machir Bay from Saligo Bay. Kilchiaran Bay lies immediately to the south.
The northern and southern parts of Machir Bay are largely rocky, with a sandy beach area near the top of the bay. Several small streams flow into the bay, notably Allt na Criche and Allt Gleann na Ceardaich, both of which flow into the north of the bay.
Area
The area surrounding Machir Bay is sparsely populated today, but archeological evidence shows a long history of human settlement. There are remnants of two duns to the southeast of the bay: one, Dun Neadean is located on a rocky knoll by the coastline, near the old road between Kilchoman and another small hamlet to the south, Kilchiaran. The enclosed area covers an area of 20 metres by 13. There remains little more of the 3.5 metre-thick wall than foundations covered in grass. The second dun, Dun Chroisprig is also located on a hill. Its outer wall roughly encompasses the hill, with a diameter of about 13 metres. An entrance 1.5 metres in width faces to the west-northwest.
Shipwrecks
On 18 November 1835, the Stella, a vessel from Palermo bound for Greenock, ran aground at Machir Bay. The entire crew and part of the cargo were saved.
On 16 November 1888, during a storm, a Norwegian barque, La Plata, sailing from Newcastle to Buenos Aires and carrying coal and coke, was wrecked at Machir Bay due to the sudden shift of unsecured cargo, causing the ship to list and run aground after becoming uncontrollable. 3 of 12 crewmen were lost.
Perhaps the most famous incident was the wreck of in October 1918, shortly before the end of the Great War. A navigation error caused it to collide with . The casualty toll was estimated at 470 men, which makes it one of the worst convoy accidents of the war.
Miscellaneous
One of the whiskies made at the nearby Kilchoman distillery is named after Machir Bay.
A charity on Islay - Islay Development Initiative - has a range of candles made with Islay beeswax from their apiary of native dark European bees, named after beaches on the island using scents of plants found on each beach. Machir Bay scent is spearmint and chamomile. The Charity uses funds raised to support Islay BeachWatch, which keeps the beaches clear of marine litter.

"Driving Home for Christmas" is a Christmas song written and composed by British singer-songwriter Chris Rea. The first version was originally released as the B-side to their single "Hello Friend" in 1986. In October 1988, a re-recorded version served as one of two new songs on Rea's first compilation album New Light Through Old Windows. It was issued as the fourth single from the album in December 1988, where it peaked at number 53 on the UK Singles Chart as the lead track of The Christmas EP.
Despite its original modest chart placement, the song has made a reappearance on the UK Singles Chart every year since 2007 when it peaked at No. 33, and is featured among the Top 10 Christmas singles. It reached a new peak of number 10 on the UK Singles Chart in 2021. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted twelfth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.
The song has since been covered by numerous artists, including Engelbert Humperdinck. A 2011 version by Stacey Solomon peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart.
Background
In interviews for the BBC Radio 4 programme Today in 2009, and The Guardian in 2016, Rea said they wrote "Driving Home for Christmas" many years before its first recording; this was in 1978 when Rea needed to get home to Middlesbrough from Abbey Road Studios in London. Their wife had come down to drive them home in their Austin Mini to save money because it was cheaper to drive than travel by train. Rea was recently out of contract and the record company wasn't willing to pay for the rail ticket. The inspiration for the song came as they were getting stuck in heavy traffic, while the snow was falling. They started looking at the other motorists, who "all looked so miserable. Jokingly, I started singing: "We're driving home for Christmas..." Then, whenever the street lights shone inside the car, I started writing down lyrics". Rea said Driving Home for Christmas is a "car version of a carol", and that they wrote it for Van Morrison but did not manage to get it to him.
It was cited that Rea never played the song live until 2014 at Hammersmith Odeon, they recall: "the gig was on 20 December, so the road crew kept badgering me to do it. I went, 'If I'm going to sing this fucking song, we're gonna do it properly.' So we hired 12 snow cannons. When we started the song, you couldn't hear it for the noise of the crowd, and we let go with the machines. We put three feet of artificial snow in the stalls. The venue charged me £12,000 to clean it up". However, they did play it on the final night of the Old Light Through New Windows tour at the NEC in Birmingham, UK. Not renowned for showmanship, Rea departed from their usual performance style with falling snow and balloons in the auditorium and an enormous grinning Santa Claus appearing behind the drum riser.
It was used in Christmas commercials for supermarket chain Iceland in 1997, 1998 and 2011; the last featured a cover by Stacey Solomon. An alternative version of the single was released in Japan as part of an EP called 'Snow'.
Recording
Rea never planned to write a Christmas song. It was several years later that while testing pianos with keyboard player Max Middleton they found a tune that fit the lyrics. Initially, it was released as a B-side (to the 1986 single "Hello Friend"), but afterwards was re-recorded with strings. Middleton played the distinctive jazzy intro, and together they produced a typical 1950s Christmas carol-type arrangement.
Music video
A video clip was broadcast on 23 December 1986 by Dutch pop music TV show TopPop, interspersed with stock footage of the motorways around Hilversum.
In 2009, 21 years after the song was first released, an original video was made in aid of Shelter; all proceeds from digital download were donated to the charity. The celebrities who featured in the video were Mike Read, David Hamilton, Martin Shaw, Kristian Digby, Gail Porter, Lizzie Cundy, Ewen MacIntosh, Carol Decker, Giles Vickers-Jones, and Lionel Blair. On the project, Rea stated: "I wanted to do something special this Christmas and what better way than to help keep a roof over people's heads when they need it most – at Christmas. By teaming up with Shelter we can hopefully make a difference".
Critical reception
Upon its release as a single in 1988, David Giles of Record Mirror described "Driving Home for Christmas" as a "jaunty, happy song" with "the joys of the season and some lilting ripples of guitar".

Stacey Solomon version
Singer and television presenter Stacey Solomon covered the song in 2011 and it was released on 18 December 2011 as their debut single. Originally intended to be used solely in commercials for supermarket chain Iceland and cabins, it was later released as a single due to popular demand, hitting number 27.
Background
The single was released on 18 December 2011 on iTunes with all proceeds going to Alzheimer's Research UK and children's hospice charity Together For Short Lives. They subsequently said that they were not disappointed that the single did not make it into the UK top 20.

In popular culture
The Chris Rea and Stacey Solomon versions of "Driving Home for Christmas" were used in the Christmas adverts for supermarket chain Iceland in 1997 and 2011 respectively.
In December 2020, a joke about Dominic Cummings' journey to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown, which referenced the song in the punchline, was announced as the winner of UK TV channel Gold's annual "Christmas Cracker Joke" competition. The joke read: "What is Dominic Cummings' favourite Christmas song? 'Driving Home for Christmas'".

Field effect may refer to: relative influence of electricity to the substrate within a given field.
Field effect (chemistry), an effect that a pole (either an unipole or dipole) has on a remote reaction centre (reaction rates, equilibrium). This effect operates through space not through bonds which distinguishes it from the inductive effect.
Field effect (semiconductor), the physical mechanism modulating the conductivity of a semiconductor using an applied voltage difference.
Field effect also known as field cancerization, a field of molecular and cellular changes in normal appearing tissue, which predispose to the development of cancer.
Vienna effect, in electrolytes, an increase in ionic mobility or conductivity of electrolytes at very high gradient of electrical potential.
In mathematics, a statistical manifold is a Riemannian manifold, each of whose points are a probability distribution. Statistical manifolds provide a setting for the field of information geometry. The Fisher information metric provides a metric on these manifolds. Following this definition, the log-likelihood function is a differentiable map and the score is an inclusion.
Examples
The family of all normal distributions can be thought of as a 2-dimensional parametric space parametrized by the expected value μ and the variance σ2 ≥ 0. Equipped with the Riemannian metric given by the Fisher information matrix, it is a statistical manifold with a geometry modeled on hyperbolic space.
A simple example of a statistical manifold, taken from physics, would be the canonical ensemble: it is a one-dimensional manifold, with the temperature T serving as the coordinate on the manifold. For any fixed temperature T, one has a probability space: so, for a gas of atoms, it would be the probability distribution of the velocities of the atoms. As one varies the temperature T, the probability distribution varies.
Another simple example, taken from medicine, would be the probability distribution of patient outcomes, in response to the quantity of medicine administered. That is, for a fixed dose, some patients improve, and some do not: this is the base probability space. If the dosage is varied, then the probability of outcomes changes. Thus, the dosage is the coordinate on the manifold. To be a smooth manifold, one would have to measure outcomes in response to arbitrarily small changes in dosage; this is not a practically realizable example, unless one has a pre-existing mathematical model of dose-response where the dose can be arbitrarily varied.
Definition
Let X be an orientable manifold, and let be a measure on X. Equivalently, let be a probability space on , with sigma algebra and probability .
The statistical manifold S(X) of X is defined as the space of all measures on X (with the sigma-algebra held fixed). Note that this space is infinite-dimensional; it is commonly taken to be a Fréchet space. The points of S(X) are measures.
Rather than dealing with an infinite-dimensional space S(X), it is common to work with a finite-dimensional submanifold, defined by considering a set of probability distributions parameterized by some smooth, continuously-varying parameter . That is, one considers only those measures that are selected by the parameter. If the parameter is n-dimensional, then, in general, the submanifold will be as well. All finite-dimensional statistical manifolds can be understood in this way.

LRN, founded in 1994, is an American company which provides advising and educating on ethics, regulatory compliance, and corporate culture to other organizations. When founded, the company focused on the legal industry and was named Legal Research Network, before expanding into other fields. The company's founder Dov Seidman, also wrote the book How (2007), about the role of ethics in business.
History
Founding (1994)
Dov Seidman founded Legal Research Network (later changed to "LRN") two years out of Harvard Law School. Seidman's business plan was to offer legal knowledge and analysis services through an expert network of academics and lawyers. This research could then be repurposed in a database licensed to companies. They were able to pre-sell a $500,000 contract to MCI based on the idea. They raised $2 million from 42 investors to launch the company.
In the first year, LRN had a network of 1,100 legal experts in over 2,500 subjects reported by The Washington Post as being "mostly law professors, solo practitioners and lawyers on leave from their regular jobs".
Expansion into Training
The company added ethics and compliance training in the later 1990s as part of an effort to spread legal and ethical awareness throughout organizations, instead of just in their law departments. Online classes, starting in the 2000s, facilitated mass training of thousands of employees at large multi-nationals like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Pfizer trained all 150,000 of its employees with LRN courses. Subjects included complying with sexual harassment laws, trade secrets and anti-trust.
By the year 2000, 200 of the Fortune 500 companies were clients of LRN. Starting in the early 2000s, the company offered "common standards" for ethics and corporate compliance education. Competitors like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer shared as much of 90% of the course materials, helping to standardize best practices for business ethics in corporate America.
Seidman testified in 2004 before the U.S. Sentencing Commission, regarding the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, about the need for companies to develop ethical cultures instead of "check-the-box", compliance-only approaches.
Since 2008, LRN has been the corporate partner of The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity's Prize in Ethics Essay Contest, an annual competition for students to analyze ethical issues.
Operations
Services
LRN's services include analyzing corporate cultures, rewriting their codes of conduct, and providing ethical-compliance education and training to their employees. LRN emphasizes principles and values rather than "blindly" following rules.
Its online education platform offers about 500 courses in 50 languages, on topics including international corruption law, intellectual property, data protection, and environmental sustainability. LRN ethics training materials include videos, blogs, quizzes, social media and video games. Dell told The Wall Street Journal in 2014 that LRN developed an ethics game for it entitled the "Honesty Project."
Organization
Job titles were largely eliminated from the company, and "employee councils" handle major functions like recruiting and conflict resolution.
LRN was originally headquartered in California and moved its headquarters to New York City in 2012. It also has offices in London and India.
In 2007, Seidman published the book How, which discussed the business philosophy created at LRN. In it, they argue that companies that "outbehave" the competition will also outperform the competition financially.
Finances
It received a $30 million investment from Softbank in 2000.

C
Carver Hale
Carver Hale was a story about a London mobster possessed by a demon. It was written by Mike Carey with art by Mike Perkins (with some fill-in inking by Dylan Teague). It came about because then editor Andy Diggle was commissioning more horror stories and Carey said they "was aiming to get some of the flavour of Hellblazer, but in a more in-your-face, action-oriented story."
It was published in 2000 AD #1236-1240 and 1247-1249 in 2001 (split because of deadline problems), and collected into a hardback volume in 2005 ().
Citi-Def
Citi-Def by Tony Lee, with art by Jack Lawrence. The series is set in the Judge Dredd universe, focusing on the City Defence units of armed militia. The first instalment as described as a good start with "cute" and "cartoony" art, and the second part was "an awesome romp" and "a fabulous idea, and here it's executed with great aplomb," although the reviewer felt it was pitched at a younger audience that usual. Another reviewer felt that while the artist "is pretty good at this sort of art, but I hate it" and reiterated concerns about the lack of sophistication but did acknowledge that "there are bags of fun ideas here."
The first story, "Field Trip", ran in Judge Dredd Megazine starting in issue #279.
Cradlegrave
Cradlegrave is a body horror comic story which ran in 2000 AD #1633-1644, written by John Smith, with art by Edmund Bagwell.
It is set in the Ravenglade Estate (nicknamed "Cradlegrave"), somewhere in Lancashire. It follows the story of teenage Shane Holt, who has recently been released from Thorn Hill young offenders institution.

Cursed Earth Koburn
Cursed Earth Koburn is a character who has appeared in an eponymous series in Judge Dredd Megazine, written by Gordon Rennie, with art by Carlos Ezquerra. It is about a judge who has taken the Long Walk into the Cursed Earth.
D
Dinosty
Dinosty was the first series Pat Mills and Clint Langley had collaborated on (Langley's first job at 2000 AD had been a Future Shock with Mills) and they would go on to work together on Mills' long-running stories ABC Warriors and Sláine.
The story itself was originally supposed to appear in the spin-off comic Earthside 8, but this title was never published. However, this was not the end of the problems as the move to 2000 AD happened when Mills felt their relationship with the editors was breaking down and they came to believe that "Dinosty suffered from covert and non-verbalised editorial opposition, or maybe just disinterest." The story would eventually run in 1994, in issues #873 - 882.
G
Glimmer Rats
Glimmer Rats is a military science fiction story which appeared in 2000 AD, written by Gordon Rennie, with art by Mark Harrison. It was collected into a sixty-page hardcover (). Rennie has described the inspiration for the story as "Sven Hassel novels and a certain oblique pretentiousness."
The Grudge-Father
The Grudge-Father was a "lurid" 1994 story written by Mark Millar, with Jim McCarthy providing the art, which ran in 2000 AD #878-883.
I
Insurrection
Insurrection is a series by Dan Abnett published in Judge Dredd Megazine starting in January 2009. Abnett explains that "the actual brief was to bring to the Dredd Universe something of the epic war-in-space scale of the stuff I write for Warhammer 40K. Tharg (Matt to their friends) wanted a stonking big space war story that would suit the universe of the Mega-Cities".
The series was drawn by artist Colin MacNeil, who has also worked on a number of Warhammer 40K stories, and one reviewer notes the similarities suggesting "MacNeil is reprising exactly the same art style that they used on the "Bloodquest" strip in the Warhammer Monthly comic."
The reception has been positive with reviews of the first episode suggesting "With cracking art and a storming first episode I have to say ‘Insurrection' has the potential to be the best Dredd off world spin-off ever" and "This was as good a first episode as I can remember reading and I can see Insurrection having the legs to deliver on that initial promise." Reviews only got better after that, including: "Quite simply, this is the best non-Dredd story ever to run in the Megazine" and "glorious"
A sequel series entitled "Lawless" was later published in Judge Dredd Megazine.
The first two instalments are being collected into a trade paperback ().
J
Journal of Luke Kirby
The Journal of Luke Kirby was a long-running series, first appearing 1988 and published until 1995. It was written by Alan McKenzie and had art by John Ridgway, Steve Parkhouse and Graham Higgins. Luke Kirby predates other boy wizards, such as Harry Potter and the Vertigo character Timothy Hunter.
M
Maniac 5
Maniac 5 was, along with Red Razors, one of Mark Millar's major solo series at 2000 AD, the others being co-written with Grant Morrison. It formed part of the "Summer Offensive" in 1993, along with Judge Dredd: "Inferno", Slaughterbowl, Really & Truly and Big Dave. The initial, eponymous story was drawn by Red Razors artist Steve Yeowell, who would also draw the final story "Maniac 6". Other artists worked on the one-offs: David Hine on "War Journal", in 2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 1993, and Richard Elson on "Maniac 6 Prologue", in 2000 AD Winter Special 1993.
N

Purgatory
Purgatory was a Judge Dredd spin-off that focused on Judge Grice and was written by Mark Millar, with art by Carlos Ezquerra. The series ran in 2000 AD #834-841 in 1993 and led straight into up the Judge Dredd story "Inferno", with Ezquerra remaining on art and Grant Morrison taking over writing duties.

Rose O'Rion
Rose O'Rion span out of Pulp Sci-fi and was written by Kek-W, with art by Andy Clarke. The character returned in the 2000 AD fanzine Zarjaz #10 as an illustrated text story, with art from Dylan Teague.
S
Sancho Panzer
Sancho Panzer is a story which ran in seven consecutive stories in 2000 AD #1112-1123 in 1998. It was written by Dan Abnett, with Henry Flint providing the art, and featured the eponymous character who pilots a giant tank called Mojo with the assistance of their technician Tool.  They are pursued by reporter Lynx Fahren/Farren, who is trying to get to the truth behind the legend, and General Herman Spurn, who was defeated by Panzer and is looking for revenge. Everyone has to pull together when the planet, Vainglory Five, is invaded by giant worms.
Abnett had tried to repeat the success of Sinister Dexter by seeing what worked and basing another story on those elements:
Silo
Silo was Mark Millar's first series at 2000 AD which was greenlit after they had had just two Future Shocks published,; it was drawn by Dave D'Antiquis. The story ran in issues #706-711 in 1990 and was reprinted in Extreme Edition #14 and involved two American soldiers in a nuclear missile silo apparently haunted by the ghost of Edward Bulwer-Lytton who was intent on ending the world.
Slaughterbowl
Slaughterbowl is a story by John Smith and Paul Peart that ran in 2000 AD #842-849 as part of their "Summer Offensive". It featured convicts piloting cybernetic dinosaurs as a sport of the future.
Snow/Tiger
Snow/Tiger was a story featuring "a mixture of paranoid politics and extreme violence" written by Andy Diggle: originally pitched to Vertigo, it was turned down as being "too mainstream". They reworked it, "I just took out the politics and left in the extreme violence", but the politics that remained still proved controversial, although Diggle concludes that "the fact the story pissed people off on both sides of the political spectrum suggest I probably pitched it about right."
Only one story was published, "Pax Americana", in 2000 AD ##1336-1342 and it was collected in a free trade paperback given away in the Judge Dredd Megazine #276.
Stalag 666
Stalag #666 is a fifteen-part story, with a double-length (ten page) first instalment, by Tony Lee, with art by Jon Davis-Hunt. Lee describes it as "a futuristic space story that happens to be set in a prison camp. and it's (and I'll be honest here) a mash of clichés and homages as let's be truthful here, you couldn't do a prison camp story and not be like that."
The story ran in 2000 AD #1600-1614, between August and November 2008.
T
Tales from Beyond Science
Tales from Beyond Science was a series of one-off Future Shock-style stories all drawn by Rian Hughes with scripts by Mark Millar, Alan McKenzie and John Smith. The story was devised by Millar and then editor McKenzie who brought Smith and Hughes in as the last members of the team.
The series was published in 1992 in 2000 AD #774-779 and as part of a couple of special issues. Hughes has had these stories collected, along with new material, by Image Comics ().
Thirteen
Thirteen was a one-off story written by Mike Carey, with art by Andy Clarke. The story had been on Carey's mind for seven years before appearing in the comic. The writer has said "I wanted to do a story that was an insane, over-the-top space opera combined with the seventies paranoid thriller. I also had this idea for a narrative structure that would start small and then just keep on opening outwards like Chinese boxes until it was working on a cosmic level"
The story appeared in 2002 in 2000 AD #1289-1299 and has been collected into a trade paperback ()
Tyranny Rex
Tyranny Rex is a story by John Smith and Steve Dillon. The main character is an artist and reptile, whose story crossed over with Indigo Prime. The stories appeared between 1988 and 1994, with a number of artists including Will Simpson, Dougie Braithwaite, Steve Sampson, Duncan Fegredo, Mark Buckingham, Paul Marshall and Richard Elson, and the character made a comeback in 2004, with Steve Yeowell on art duties but no further stories appeared.
W
Witch World
Witch World is a series that appeared twice in 2000 AD, written by Gordon Rennie, with art provided by Siku, Paul Johnson, Will Simpson and John M. Burns.
Rennie describes the origins of the story (one of their first in 2000 AD after stories being published in Judge Dredd Megazine): "It came about when I and a number of other writers were asked to put together pitches for a new fantasy strip, with guidelines suggested by the editor". However, they do not rate the story highly:
Z
Zombo
Zombo is a story written by Al Ewing, based on ideas by series artist Henry Flint, who also provided the art. The first series was set on a "death planet", one of a number of hostile and malevolent living planets, where the eponymous character has to lead the passengers of a crashed spaceship to safety.
Zombo first appeared in 2000 AD #1632.

Sarfarāz Khān (, ; c. 1700 – 29 April 1740), born Mīrza Asadullāh, was a Nawab of Bengal. Sarfaraz Khan's maternal grandfather, Nawab Murshid Quli Khan of Bengal (Bengal, Bihar and Orissa) nominated them as the direct heir to them as there was no direct heir. After Murshid Quli's death in 1727, Sarfaraz ascended to the Masnad (throne) of the Nawab. Sarfaraz's father, Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan, then the Subahdar of Orissa, getting to know it arrived at Murshidabad, the capital of the Nawabs of Bengal with a huge army. To avoid a conflict in the family the dowager Begum of the Nawab asked Shuja-ud-Din to ascend to the Masnad after Sarfaraz abdicated in favour of their father. However, circumstances led Shuja-ud-Din to nominate Sarfaraz as their heir and after Shuja-us-Din's death in 1739, Sarfaraz Khan again ascended to the Masnad as the Nawab of Bengal (Bengal, Bihar and Orissa).
Early life and succession
Born Mirza Asadullah, sometime after 1700, Sarfaraz Khan was the son of Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan by their wife Zinat-un-nisa Begum. Sarfaraz Khan was the maternal grandson of Nawab Murshid Quli Khan of Bengal who died on 30 June 1727. In absence of a direct heir, Murshid Khan nominated Sarfaraz Khan to succeed him. Thus, Sarfaraz Khan ascended to the Masnad (throne) as the Nawab in 1727 before abdicating in favour of their father Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan in the same year. On hearing of Sarfaraz's accession to the Masnad, Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan, the Diwan Nazim of Orissa, marched at the head of a large army towards Murshidabad. To avoid a conflict in the family, the dowager Begum of Murshid Quli Khan intervened; and their son-in-law Shuja-ud-Din ascended to the Masnad of Bengal. By August 1727, Shuja-ud-Din was firmly established and recognised as the second Nawab of Bengal.
Shujauddin appointed Sarfaraz as the Naib Nazim of Bihar. In 1734, Sarfaraz Khan succeeded their cousin, Mirza Lutfullah Tabrizi, as the Naib Nazim of Jahangirnagar (Dhaka). Instead of moving to Dhaka, Khan appointed Ghalib Ali Khan and Jaswant Rai as the Diwan. During their tenure, the city of Jahangirnagar saw rapid economic growth through agriculture and trade - the greatest since the time of Governor Shaista Khan.
But as fate had, circumstances lead Shuja-ud-Din to nominate their son, Sarfaraz again as their heir and successor and after Shuja-ud-Din died on 26 August 1739 Sarfaraz Khan again ascended to the Masnad as the Nawab of Bengal on 13 March 1739 with the title of Ala-ud-Din Haidar Jang.
Reign
Known to be an extremely pious, religious and moderate ruler they left the administration into the hands of their Nazims and Naib Nazims. Religious matters was their priority. This neglect in administrative matters resulted the gradual rise of Alivardi Khan the Nazim of Azimabad (Patna).
Sarfaraz Khan became the Diwan of Bengal for sometime early into the reign of their father Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan and later became the Nazim of Jahangir Nagar (Dhaka). Sarfaraz, however, did never live in Dhaka and administered it by their adviser Syed Galib Ali Khan. This was because of their disinterest in administrative and economic matters. Such negligence would cost them dearly towards the end of their life.
Sarfaraz Khan was a pious man, full of the outward forms of devotion, and extremely regular in their stated prayers and ablutions. They moreover fasted three full months besides the blessed month of Ramzan, and was scrupulous in the discharge of the several forms of worship to be attended to at different periods throughout the year. They are, however, totally deficient in those great qualities of mind, so indispensably necessary in sovereigns. Wholly engrossed in the little forms of religion, they neglected the affairs of state, and paid no attention to the observance of those duties requisite in a man of their high station and rank. It is true, they offered no injury to the persons of Ray-Rayan, Alam Chand, the Dewan of their father, nor to Jagat Seth or Haji Ahmed, their two other ministers, the latter, men of great abilities and influence, who, together with the Ray-Rayan, had the absolute direction of affairs in the late reign ; but they resigned the reins of government into the hands of a few interested men, who had personal wrongs to revenge.
Among these were Haji Lutfullah, Mardan Ali Khan, Mir Murtaza, and others, who, long incensed against Haji Ahmed, depreciated their character everywhere, and insulted them with taunting expressions. These incensed noblemen, intent on giving vent to their enmity and hatred against Haji Ahmed, caused caricatures to be drawn of him, and eventually effected in Sarfaraz Khan's mind a total alienation of regard towards him. Haji Ahmed was accordingly removed from the office of Dewan, which they had held ever since Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan's accession ; and the office was now bestowed on Mir Murtaza. The viceroy wanted also to deprive Ataullah Khan, son-in-law of the Haji, of the military command of Rajmahal, to give it to their own son-in-law Hassan Muhammad Khan.
Intrigues in their Durbar
Haji Ahmed dreading the influence of their numerous enemies, endeavoured to gain strength to oppose them; they therefore wrote every thing to their brother Alivardi Khan, magnifying trifles exceedingly in the representation. Haji Ahmed had the art, too, to persuade the new viceroy to disband great part of their forces, and otherwise to retrench their expenses. Advice so consonant to their feelings was adopted without hesitation ; but while they listened to the counsel of Haji Ahmed to effect reduction, they allowed the arrest of Haji Ahmed's two sons Zain-ud-Din Ahmed Khan, who was on the road from Patna (Azimabad), and Ahmed Khan, who had just arrived from their command of Rangpur.
Sarfaraz Khan now set on foot an inquiry into the management of the public revenue of Azimabad (Patna), and recalled the troops that had been placed by their father under Alivardi Khan, and for whom during many years they had conceived an attachment. On their seeming to hesitate about being removed, they resumed the grant of land which their father Shuja bestowed on them. All these acts were minutely reported by Haji Ahmed, and assiduously transmitted to their brother Alivardi Khan with the usual exaggeration ; and to give more weight to their own assertions, they used to superadd the testimony of their son Ahmed Khan, who on such occasions submitted to the influence of paternal authority.
Conspiracy of Alivardi Khan
Alivardi Khan daily informed of these events, resolved to avail themselves of their acquaintance and connection with their friend Ishaq Khan, at the court of Dehli, a nobleman who was now in complete possession of the Mughal Emperor's ear. They wrote them a secret letter, in which they requested to have the patents of the three provinces transferred to himself, under promise of sending to court a present of a crore (ten million) of rupees, besides the whole of Sarfaraz Khan's wealth. To effect this, they required an imperial commission directed to himself, empowering them to wrest the three provinces out of the hands of the present viceroy, Sarfaraz Khan. After having dispatched these letters, they gave out that they intended marching against the zamindars of Bhojpur, and under that pretence they mustered their troops, which they always kept in constant readiness. At the same time, they had the art to give Sarfaraz Khan public notice of their project, though they in reality waited ready to avail themselves of the first opportunity to effect their true purpose.
At length, ten months after Nadir-shah's departure for Persia, and just thirteen months after Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan's decease, they received the imperial commission, drawn up in the style they had requested. Being now resolved on marching against Sarfaraz Khan, they wrote secretly to Jagat Seth and Fateh Chand, that on a certain day they would commence their march. In March 1740; Alivardi Khan, set out for Murshidabad, on the context of expedition to Bhojpur, and encamped at some distance from the city of Patna.
Alivardi Khan in a message to Sarfaraz Khan suggested that they were not marching on them but was arriving to pay homage to the Nawab. Initially satisfied, Sarfaraz Khan eventually decided to march on the head of their army and arrived at the town of Comrah on 9 April 1740. Alivardi in the interim, secured the Teliagarhi pass and camped at Rajmahal. The Nawab's army was being led by a seasoned general, Ghaus Khan and Ray-Rayan, Alam Chand also accompanied. The rebel army was being led by Alivardi Khan with Nandalal and Nawazish Muhammad Khan as their deputies.
They're opposing armies marched on to Giria (Battle of Giria), a village on the banks of the river Bhagirathi for a showdown on 26 April 1740.
Defeat, death and succession
Sarfaraz was stark unlucky to have an opponent like Alivardi who besides being an excellent leader even at the age of 70, knew Sarfaraz's weaknesses. Sarfaraz Khan was defeated and killed in the Battle of Giria on the banks of the river Bhagirathi. The incumbent Alivardi Khan, the Nazim of Azimabad (Patna) defeated them in a direct conflict. The battle was short but bloody and intense given the "loyalty standards" of the time. The outcome was decided early by Sarfaraz Khan falling to a bullet. The remnants of their army continued to put up a brave resistance but Alivardi Khan was too good a general for them.
The primary cause for this debacle was that Sarfaraz never saw what was coming in the form of Alivardi Khan and did not take precautionary measures in time. Besides, Alivardi did not give them much time to settle down. Sarfaraz was more concerned of the "bigger threat" Nadir Shah who was vandalising Delhi and Punjab. Nadir had in fact written to Sarfaraz which aggravated matters further. They can be best described as mild mannered person who neither had the opportunity nor the exceptional merit required to leave a "mark" on history on such troubled times and was consigned to the footnotes of history.
Sarfaraz Khan's reign was for a little over 13 months. The Nasiri Dynasty of Murshid Quli Khan ended with the death of Sarfaraz Khan. Sarfaraz Khan had five sons and five daughters who never made it to the doors of power thus Alivardi Khan toppled the Nasiri Nawabs and became the new Nawab of Bengal. Alivardi Khan also founded the Afshar Dynasty. They lie buried at Naginabag in Murshidabad.
According to the Archaeological Survey of India, the Tomb of Nawab Sarfraz Khan at Naginabagh is a State Protected Monument (Item no S-WB-80).

Arm DDT is a commercial C, C++ and Fortran 90 debugger produced by Allinea Software now part of Arm of Warwick, United Kingdom. It is widely used for debugging parallel Message Passing Interface (MPI) and threaded (pthread or OpenMP) programs, including those running on clusters of Linux machines.
Debugger
It is used to find bugs on both small and large clusters, from 1 to 100,000s of processors. It features memory debugging which detect memory leaks, or reading and writing beyond the bounds of arrays.
It was the first debugger to be able to debug petascale applications - having been used to debug applications running concurrently on 220,000 processes on a Cray XT5 at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. This is possible interactively as the debugger's control tree architecture leads to logarithmic performance for most collective operations. Arm DDT uses the GNU Debugger as debug engine.
Arm DDT also supports coprocessor architectures such as Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors and Nvidia CUDA GPUs.
It is part of Arm Forge - a suite of tools for developing code in high performance computing - which also includes the performance profiler for scalar, multithreaded and parallel codes - Arm MAP.
, 80 percent of the world's top 25 supercomputers on the TOP500 list, use Arm's tools.

Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) is a non-profit organization founded in 2012 to fund and support free speech and freedom of the press. The organization originally managed crowd-funding campaigns for independent journalistic organizations, but now pursues technical projects to support journalists' digital security and conducts legal advocacy for journalists.
The foundation's SecureDrop platform aims to allow confidential and secure communication between journalists and their sources, and has been adopted by more than 65 news organizations globally. It also manages the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a database of press freedom violations in the United States.
The organization's board of directors has included prominent journalists and whistleblowers such as Daniel Ellsberg, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, and Xeni Jardin, as well as activists, celebrities, and filmmakers. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden joined FPF's board of directors in 2014 and began serving as its president in early 2016. Jardin left the board in 2016.
Crowdfunding
The organization's founding was inspired by the WikiLeaks financial blockade. In late 2012, FPF's launch re-enabled donations to WikiLeaks via Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, after the payment processors cut off WikiLeaks in late 2010. In December 2017, after five years of processing donations on behalf of WikiLeaks, FPF's board unanimously found that the blockade was no longer in effect, and severed ties with WikiLeaks as of January 8, 2018.
FPF has also crowd-funded support for a variety of other transparency journalism organizations, as well as encryption tools used by journalists, including: WikiLeaks, MuckRock, the National Security Archive, The UpTake, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Center for Public Integrity, Truthout, the LEAP Encryption Access Project, Open Whisper Systems, Tails, and the Tor Project.
In May 2013, FPF raised over $100,000 in online donations to hire a professional court stenographer to take transcripts during the trial of whistleblower Chelsea Manning after the government refused to make its transcripts available to the public. They posted the transcripts online at the end of each day of the trial for members of the media to use in their reports. Secrecy expert Steven Aftergood later called the crowd-funding effort "unprecedented", saying "it eloquently demonstrated public expectations of openness...the court and the prosecutors may have been shamed into reconsidering their habitual secrecy."
In October 2014, FPF raised over $28,000 for New Zealand independent journalist Nicky Hager to fund their legal challenge against the government of New Zealand after their house was raided by police. The raid reportedly was an attempt to uncover one or more of Hager's anonymous sources used in their book Dirty Politics. A court later ruled the raid of Hager's house was illegal.
In 2015, FPF raised more than $125,000 in online donations for Chelsea Manning's legal defense stemming from their conviction under the Espionage Act for leaking information to WikiLeaks. Notwithstanding the January 2017 commutation of their sentence and May 2017 release from prison, Manning's military appeal is ongoing.
As of June 2018, FPF accepts donations with crypto-currencies. On April 16, 2021, Edward Snowden raised 2,224 ETH (around $5.4 million) to benefit Freedom of the Press Foundation through the sale of an NFT on foundation.app. This signed work, titled "Stay Free", combines the entirety of a landmark court decision ruling the National Security Agency's mass surveillance violated the law, with the portrait of the whistleblower by Platon. This is the largest donation in the history of the organization.
Technical projects
In October 2013, FPF took over the development of SecureDrop, a free software whistleblower submission system developed in part by the late programmer and transparency activist Aaron Swartz. Swartz developed SecureDrop with Kevin Poulsen and James Dolan. Dolan moved it to FPF upon the death of Swartz. The SecureDrop system facilitates anonymous communication between two parties using the Tor Network, and allows whistleblowers to contact journalists without ever exchanging one another's identities or contact information.
The system is now in use at more than 65 news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, ProPublica, HuffPost, NBC News, and The Intercept. According to a study done by the Columbia Journalism School, it has since successfully led to the publication of many stories at the news organizations that use it.
FPF also teaches journalists how to use other encryption methods and digital security tools to better protect their sources.
In collaboration with The Guardian Project, FPF released a free and open-source mobile app named Haven in 2017. Haven turns an Android device into a security sensor and, optionally, alerts the device owner to activity occurring in its vicinity.
Legal activism
Freedom of the Press Foundation has been involved in several Freedoms of Information Act cases surrounding journalists' rights and government transparency.
In January 2016, FPF's lawsuit against the Justice Department revealed that the US government has secret rules for targeting journalists with National Security Letters (NSLs) and FISA court orders.
In March 2016, another FPF lawsuit showed that the Obama administration secretly lobbied against bipartisan Freedom of Information Act reform in Congress, despite the bill being based word-for-word on the Obama administration's supposed transparency guidelines.
Awards
FPF co-founders Daniel Ellsberg, John Perry Barlow, Trevor Timm, and Rainey Reitman won the 2013 Hugh Hefner First Amendment award for their role in founding FPF. The organization was the recipient of the Society of Professional Journalists' James Madison award in 2016.

Ingmar De Vos (born 5 August 1963) is a Belgian professional sports manager serving as the thirteenth and current President of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (Fédération Equestre Internationale) (FEI). Educated in sports management, business administration and international law, they began their career in mainstream politics before working for the Belgian Equestrian Federation and supported that nation's equestrian teams at the Olympics and the FEI World Equestrian Games. They were one of the founders of the European Equestrian Federation and became secretary-general of the FEI in 2011 prior to being elected President of the organisation in 2014.
Education and Career
Studying at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (V.U.B), De Vos began their university education gaining master's degrees in Political Science (department International Relations) and International and European Law. They also studied business administration and later went on to gain further degrees including Sports Management from the Belgian Olympic Academy.
Following completion of their Masters in International and European law, De Vos joined the Belgian Senate, as an advisor to the Liberal Group.
Equestrian organisation management career
Ingmar De Vos began their career within Equestrian Sports Management in 1990 at the Belgian Equestrian Federation, first taking on the role of Managing Director which was later combined with the Secretary General role. In their time at the Belgian Equestrian, De Vos was successful in modernising the organisation and administration including the restructuring of the organisation to allow the regional federations to receive government funding.
Alongside their core responsibilities as Managing Director and Secretary General, De Vos was also Head of the Belgian Equestrian Delegation at the Olympic Games from 2000-2008 in Sydney, Athens and Beijing as well as heading up the Belgian Delegation at the first five FEI World Equestrian Games between 1990 and 2010.  They are also on the board of the Belgian National Olympic Committee.
They were co-founder of the European Equestrian Federation (EEF) in 2010 and was also Secretary General from 2010 until 2011, when they joined the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI), world governing body for horse sport.
From 2011 to 2014, Ingmar De Vos became Secretary General of the FEI which headquarters are based in Lausanne (SUI) they were elected FEI President in Baku (AZE) in 2014 and re-elected for a second four-year term in Manama (BRN) in 2018.

They also served in the past as a member of the Digital and Technology Commission (2018-2019).
 They are a member of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) Governance Task Force since 2016 and became an ASOIF Council Member in April 2019.
In early November 2018 they were appointed to the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) Council and, since 2018, as the GAISF representative on the 12-member World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Executive Committee. They became the ASOIF representative on the WADA Executive Committee and Foundation Board in 2018.
In March 2017, they became a UN International Gender Champions (IGC), joining a leadership network that brings together female and male decision-makers determined to break down gender barriers and make gender equality a working reality in their spheres of influence.
In 2014, Ingmar De Vos became Vice-President of the International Horse Sports Confederation (IHSC), an umbrella body created by the FEI and the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) – the first formal vehicle for cooperation between the world's leading governing bodies for equestrian sport. They served as IHSC President from December 2019 to April 2022, and will once again take on the role of IHSC Vice-President for a two year period.
Fédération Equestre Internationale
Ingmar De Vos joined the FEI as Secretary General in 2011 during the second presidential term of HRH Princess Haya. During their time as Secretary General they worked closely with HRH Princess Haya, implementing a number of reforms to improve lines of communication with the National Federations and stakeholders. One of the key steps in this process was the creation of the FEI Sports Forum in 2012 to provide a platform for all stakeholders to discuss matters relating to the sport in an open and transparent manner.
They were also instrumental in the restructuring of FEI's Commercial strategy which subsequently resulted in the signing of the organisation's biggest commercial deal with the Swiss watchmakers, Longines.
Following the decision of FEI President HRH Princess Haya not to run for a third term, Ingmar De Vos stepped forward as one of six candidates. The Presidential election took place at the 2014 FEI General Assembly in Baku, Azerbaijan where De Vos was elected in the first round of voting. A total of 131 National Federations voted:
Note: The two other candidates, Ulf Helgstrand (DEN) and Javier Revuelta del Peral (ESP) withdrew from the election process prior to the vote.
Ingmar De Vos' Presidential manifesto focused on five main pillars: "Serving our community", "Sport: our core business", "Equestrian Sport in the Olympics", "FEI Solidarity" and "Horses as our Partners". These five pillars will serve as their blueprint for the four-year presidential term. De Vos' manifesto speech prior to their election can be seen here.
As FEI President, De Vos has been very active; they attended Australian Sport Achievement Awards Night in July 2015 and in the same month visited the Bulgarian Federation Summer Camp supported by FEI Solidarity.

Eraser Cut is an EP by the Creatures, consisting of singer Siouxsie Sioux and drummer Budgie formerly of Siouxsie and the Banshees. It contains four unreleased songs taken from the Anima Animus recording sessions which took place in 1995–1996. This EP was later included on the compilation U.S. Retrace.
After the last Banshees tour, the Creatures reconvened in autumn 1995. In April 1996, when the Banshees officially called it a day, Siouxsie and Budgie announced that the Creatures were now their full-time effort. This EP was the first release of the Creatures since 1989's Boomerang. Eraser Cut was released in August 1998 on both 10-inch vinyl and CD. Prior to that, a stand-alone single "Sad Cunt" had been issued in a limited edition a few months earlier in May and given away at two Creatures concerts in London.

Zhongyuansaurus (meaning “Zhongyuan lizard”) is a monospecific genus of ankylosaurid dinosaur from Henan that lived during the Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian, ~125.0-100.5 Ma) in what is now the Haoling Formation. Zhongyuansaurus is possibly a junior synonym of Gobisaurus, a basal ankylosaurid from the Ulansuhai Formation of Inner Mongolia.
Discovery and naming
The type species, Zhongyuansaurus luoyangensis, was named and described in 2007 by Xu and colleagues. The holotype specimen of Zhongyuansaurus, HGM 41HIII-0002, consists of a nearly complete skull, fragments of the lower jaw, a cervical neural spine, dorsal vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, posterior caudal centra, fused distal caudals, ribs, a humerus, both ischia, a pubis, and osteoderms. The specimen was obtained from the Haoling Formation of the Henan Province, Ruyang County. The specimen is currently housed at the Henan Province Geological Museum in China.
The generic name, Zhongyuansaurus, is derived from “Zhongyuan”, after the area south of Yellow River area, and the Greek word “sauros” (lizard). The specific name, luoyangensis, refers to the Luoyang area where the holotype was found.
In 2015, Victoria Arbour and Phillip J. Currie considered Zhongyuansaurus a junior synonym of Gobisaurus domoculus. The synonymization of Zhongyuansaurus is based on the holotype having all the diagnosable characteristics of Gobisaurus, except for features that cannot be assessed because of damage, like having vomers with elongated premaxillary processes.
Description
Zhongyuansaurus, like other ankylosaurids, had numerous osteoderms that would have been embedded in the dermis of the skin. Xu et al., 2007 recognised eight different sets of osteoderms pertaining to the holotype specimen. These osteoderms include: A large, thin irregular quadrangle osteoderms that may have been located on the front portion of the back; large, thick, irregular quadrangle osteoderms that had a flat surface, and front edges that extend considerably downwards; circular osteoderms that have an off centred keel on the outer surface; asymmetrical circular osteoderms that have a well developed keel on the outer surface; small circular osteoderms that have irregular grooves and no ridges on the outer surface; hollow cone osteoderms that have an irregular grooved sculpture on the outer surface; kidney shaped osteoderms that have the sides folded upwards and one edge being thicker than the other; ridge shaped osteoderms that have an irregular grooved sculpture on the outer surface.
As noted by Xu et al., an arrow-shaped bone with a pointed end was found near the region of the nasal. The authors interpreted it as a nasal horn homologous to other osteoderms that would have protruded from the nasal bone on an angle without being fused to the bone, a feature not seen in any ankylosaur. The authors suggested that the nasal horn may have been used for intraspecific and interspecific combat.
The tail club of Zhongyuansaurus only preserves the “handle” and no “knob” osteoderms. The holotype preserves the terminal caudal vertebrae, so the absence of the “knob” osteoderms is not because the distal end of the tail is missing. Although the holotype specimen represents an immature individual based on cranial sutures, ontogeny does not seem to be an explanation for the absence of the knob osteoderms. Arbour & Currie, 2011 suggested that it was likely that the knob osteoderms were present in life and disarticulated from the handle after death but later ruled out the explanation as isolated tail club knobs from ankylosaurines often preserve some fragments of the distal caudal vertebrae or ossified tendons associated with the knob osteoderms.
Classification
Xu et al., 2007 originally considered Zhongyuansaurus to be a nodosaurid ankylosaur based on the skull proportions and the absence of a tail club. However, longer-than-wide skulls are a pleiomorphic trait of Ankylosauria and not a derived condition of nodosaurids. Carpenter et al., 2008 re-evaluated Zhongyuansaurus to the clade Shamosaurinae based on similarities with Shamosaurus. Thompson et al., 2012 recovered Zhongyuansaurus as a basal ankylosaurine and Arbour & Currie, 2015 later concluded that Zhongyuansaurus was a probable junior synonym of Gobisaurus.
A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Thompson et al., 2012 is reproduced below.
Paleoenvironment
The holotype specimen of Zhongyuansaurus was recovered from the Haoling Formation, which possibly dates to the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous. Zhongyuansaurus would have shared its habitat with the oviraptorid Luoyanggia, the sauropods Xianshanosaurus, Yunmenglong, Ruyangosaurus and Huanghetitan, an indeterminate ornithomimid, an indeterminate iguanodontian, and an indeterminate carcharodontosaurian.

Konger is a Polish performance art group from Kraków, Poland, established in 1983 by a group of professional artists in protest against the imposition of Martial law in Poland. The artists boycotted all state galleries and took up performance art instead, an obsolete medium in the eyes of the official art critics.
The Group was founded by Wladyslaw Kazmierczak, Artur Tajber, Marian Figiel and Marcin Krzyżanowski. Others included Kazimierz Madej and Peter Grzybowski. The activity was documented by Barbara Maroń.
The artists performed individual art actions at a time when Polish performance art was experiencing political repressions. The performance in Zakład nad Fosą was transmitted live through video equipment and monitors outside the gallery.
The performances of Konger Group triggered strong criticism from the Polish authorities and resulted in a ban on performing in public for Artur Tajber, issued by the local committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.
Selected performances

Thomas Haxby (25 January 1729 – 31 October 1796) was an English instrument maker, particularly of keyboard instruments, including harpsichords, pianos, and organs.
After an early career as a parish clerk at St Michael-le-Belfry in York, and as a singer at York Minster, they opened an instrument shop in York in 1756. During the late 1750s they acquired a reputation as an organ tuner and repairman, and began building organs as well as other instruments in the 1760s. Their square pianos – of which they made between 24 and 36 per year, gradually increasing the number towards 1790 – are highly regarded. After their death their shop passed to their nephew and brother-in-law, who changed the name to Tomlinson & Son.

The International Pesticide Application Research Consortium (IPARC), previously the International Pesticide Application Research Centre and before that the Overseas Spray Machinery Centre (OSMC), has focused on pesticide application methods appropriate for smallholder farmers since 1955. It is now a research and training group whose purpose is to promote practical and cost-effective techniques, wherever possible reducing the use of chemical pesticides, as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPARC has been an integral part of pesticide research and teaching at Silwood Park and has specialised in the needs of small-holder farmers, application techniques for migrant pests and control of disease vectors. IPARC is a World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centre.
Objectives
Besides teaching at postgraduate level and carrying out bespoke training, staff carry-out consultancy work for international organisations and commercial companies. Core expertise includes:
Long-standing knowledge base on selection and use of sprayers appropriate for the developing world and seeing pesticide application as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
Pinpointing the target for control techniques: and bridging the gap between laboratory and field via appropriate formulation and application; this has proved especially valuable in the development of biological pesticides (e.g. participation in LUBILOSA).
Making application technology more accurate - research on development of nozzles, etc.
Ensuring quality of equipment - standards setting for application equipment and sprayer testing to ensure users get value for money.
IPARC's activities are endorsed by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) and they include evaluation of application equipment (e.g. compression sprayers) used for mosquito control.
Participatory training of farmers and trainers; providing manuals & books to assist in IPM training world-wide.

Legends of Might and Magic is a first-person shooter video game developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and published by The 3DO Company in 2001. As a spin-off of the Might and Magic franchise, Legends has a fantasy theme. Reviews likened the game to a medieval Counter-Strike, but criticized it for being a mediocre clone.
Gameplay
Gameplay in Legends is almost entirely online. An offline practice mode exists, but the game does not provide bots to simulate actual gameplay conditions. Players pick a server, and then choose from six classes of either the evil team or the good team. The evil team consists of the Heretic, Archer and Warrior, and the good team of the Paladin, Druid and Sorceress. The players then enter a map. Each map exhibits one of four game types:
Sword in the Stone: Each team must attempt to gain control of the sword and reach the exit. It is essentially a variation of one-flag CTF.
Rescue the Princess: The good team must try to save a princess who is guarded by the evil team. This mode is similar to the hostage rescue mode in Counter-Strike.
Warlord Escape: A player assumes the role of the warlord, who must be escorted by the others to safety. This is nearly identical to the VIP missions in Counter-Strike.
Slay the Dragon: Both teams battle in a map containing a fire-breathing dragon. The team that kills the dragon wins the match.
In addition to the opposing team, hostile creatures may be present for players to fight (the host of each game decides whether or not there will be monsters). By killing monsters and opening treasure chests found on the map, and also by winning rounds, players earn gold with which to buy equipment. Players lose these items when they die or at the end of a match, whichever comes first. This was another flaw attributed to the game; as players lose everything once matches end and start with only basic gear at the start of each new one, there was no long-term reward and no way for more experienced players to gauge their skill against the less experienced.
History
Legends of Might and Magic was announced at the 2000 E3 by 3DO as the first Might and Magic game designed for online play. At the time, it was intended to be an Action/RPG that focused on co-operative multiplayer. With up to six players able to join up, the game was not as extensive as MMORPGs of the time, but it also included 16-player deathmatch, a random adventure generator, and a player vs. monster arena. The game would allow characters to choose one of six classes with differing proficiencies in might and magic before embarking on a quest to collect four artifacts from four worlds to defeat the deranged advisor to the king before they can alter history. The assignments given to the players would depend on their level and how far they had progressed.
By the beginning of 2001, however, the game had abandoned the Action/RPG elements and had become a deathmatch game, with six proposed gameplay modes, 25 maps from Might and Magic history, and the ability for weapons, skills, abilities, and equipment to carry over between games. The move was defended by Executive Producer Jeffrey Blattner, who said:
"We got to a certain checkpoint some time ago and examined what we had. One thing we pride ourselves on at New World is the gameplay, and we just didn't feel like we would be able to deliver a fun experience for people with what we had at the time, so at that point a decision was made to not proceed in the original direction, and instead we decided to make a different type of game," explains Executive Producer Jeffrey Blattner. "The Might and Magic series is already so varied in terms of gameplay anyway. We have the Heroes strategy series and the tried and true Might and Magic RPG series, and everyone was really interested in branching out into an action style game, so that's how we found ourselves here. The original goal of Legends was to deliver the first online Might and Magic game, and we're still going to do that."
A demo for the game was released on April 18, 2001. On June 8 it went gold. The first patch (Version 1.1) came out on July 20.
Reception
Critical reviews
Legends of Might and Magic received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was likened to a fantasy version of Counter-Strike by most reviewers; according to Tal Blevins of IGN, Legends "pretty much blatantly rips off Counter-Strike." Blevins also criticized the game for its lack of strategy, lack of differences between classes, and unbalanced weapons. Will Abner of GameSpy criticized the game for its poor implementation of single-player gameplay and lack of a map editor. The LithTech-based graphics were praised, however, and the game was said to have potential to grow. Scott Osborne of GameSpot criticized the game for its uninspired similarities to Counter-Strike, oping that "if mediocrity and complacency were crimes, Legends of Might and Magic would get tossed in the dungeon." Carla Harker of NextGen said of the game, "Unoriginal and uninspiring, this team-based FPS is not the stuff of legends."

The following lists events that happened during 1929 in Afghanistan. The Afghan Civil War continued from the previous year.
Incumbents

14 January-17 January – Inayatullah Khan
17 January-16 October – Habibullāh Kalakāni
starting 16 October – Mohammed Nadir Shah
Prime Minister –

starting 1 November - Mohammad Hashim Khan
January 7
In order to placate the Shinwaris, Amanullah issues a proclamation cancelling most of their reforms, such as the education of women, and the introduction of conscription and European dress, and also promises to appoint a council, including clergy, nobles, and officials, to assist them in revising the law, and in reviewing the decisions of the popular assembly. But their efforts are now too late to save him. When Bacha-i-Saqao resumes the offensive on January 9 Amanullah is able, with the help of Russian airmen, to ward off their attacks, but the Shinwaris clamour for further concessions, and in fact seem determined upon their dethronement. Feeling themselves powerless to resist them, Amanullah, on January 14, abdicates in favour of their elder brother, Inayatullah Khan, who for the previous ten years had lived a private life. Soon after, they succeed in making their way to Kandahar, where the tribesmen are still loyal to their house, and where they had sent their queen Souriyah some time before. The change of monarchs only hastens the fall of the dynasty. Bacha-i-Saqao continues to press their attack on Kabul and by January 17 succeeds in gaining possession of the city. Inayatullah immediately abdicates, after a reign of three days, and Bacha-i-Saqao declares themselves amir, with the name of Habibullah Ghazi. Inayatullah is allowed to retire in safety with the members of their household, being conveyed, with them, by British aeroplanes to Peshawar, and they soon after joins their brother in Kandahar.
January
Britain is loudly accused in the Russian and German press of fomenting civil strife in Afghanistan. The charge, which is not supported by any evidence, is officially denied, and the Indian government takes stringent measures to prevent the border tribes from taking part in the Afghan fighting.
January 21
Amanullah, in Kandahar, under pressure from the tribesmen, formally rescinds their abdication and again proclaims themselves king. At the same time a force favourable to them begins to concentrate at Ghazni, between Kandahar and Kabul. The tribes in the eastern part of the country also show no disposition to acknowledge Habibullah, partly because they look upon them with suspicion as being a Tajik and not a true Pashtun, partly because they prefer to be independent. Thus the new amir's authority extends to only a comparatively small part of the country, comprising chiefly Kabul and the district north of it, where their own tribesmen reside. Himself being illiterate, they have no sympathy with the reforms of Amanullah, and restores the old regime in Kabul.
End of January
Though up to this point foreigners in Kabul have not been molested, nor is there any sign of an anti-foreign movement there, the Indian government, mistrusting the ability of the new ruler to keep order, decides to advise all British subjects to leave the city, and to place aeroplanes at their disposal for doing so. The work of evacuation commences early in February, and goes on throughout the greater part of the month. Besides British subjects - mostly Indians - a large number of Turks and members of other nationalities are brought to Peshawar by the British aeroplanes. The evacuation is completed with the departure of Sir Francis Humphrys, the British minister, and the last members of their staff on February 25. Within two months the British aeroplanes have brought from Kabul to Peshawar some 600 people in seventy-two flights, without casualties and almost without mishaps - a remarkable achievement considering the height of the mountain ranges which had to be crossed and the intense cold. After the departure of Sir Francis Humphrys, the only diplomats left in Kabul are the Russian and Turkish ambassadors, and the Persian and German chargés d'affaires.
Early February
The Shinwari and other tribes of the neighbourhood being no more disposed to accept the rule of Ali Ahmad Khan (who had declared themselves amir at Jalalabad when Habibullah entered Kabul) than that of Amanullah, they inflict a severe defeat on them at Jagdalak. At about the same time tribesmen enter and plunder Jalalabad. A powder magazine is blown up in the course of the plundering, killing hundreds of people, and the town is reduced nearly to ruins. The tribes which supported Ali Ahmad now offer their allegiance to the amir of Kabul, but the rest remain independent, and commence to quarrel with one another. Ali Ahmad makes their way to Kandahar, where they are first imprisoned by Amanullah but afterwards released.
February and March
Habibullah is engaged in military operations with the Tagari and Wardak tribes immediately south of Kabul. They succeed in defeating or pacifying them, and thus clears a way for themselves to Ghazni, where the Malik Ghaus-ed-Din, of the Ahmadzai Ghilzais, has proclaimed themselves amir. During this time Amanullah has been inactive at Kandahar, though their agents were busy trying to win for them adherents in eastern Afghanistan, without success, as it proves. They show little confidence in themselves and at one time seriously thinks of withdrawing to Herat, and only desists in deference to the protests of the townsmen of Kandahar, who point out that such a step would involve them in heavy loss. A well known Shinwari Mir Akbar (k.b) from Lavargi (Landikotal) was the supporter of Habibullah, while taking oath as the King requested Mir Akbar to come to Kabul & give them the security from other tribes. The offer was accepted, as it was because of Mir Akbar Shinwari that the king gained power.
March 6
Shah Nadir Khan, a member of the royal family who was living in retirement in the Riviera and who watched the disruption of the country and its gradual relapse into anarchy with deep concern, returns to Afghanistan. They had been minister of war in 1919, and had won for themselves a position of unique influence among the tribes. In 1925, not being able to agree with King Amanullah, they had gone as Afghan minister to France, but after holding that post for two years they had resigned and gone to live in the Riviera for the benefit of their health. They now determined to return to their native land, ostensibly to look after the interests of their relatives there, but really to see whether they could do anything to restore peace and unity to the country. They reached Peshawar on February 25 - the same day as Sir Francis Humphrys - and on March 6, in company with one of their brothers, Sardar Shah Wali Khan, crosses the frontier. Habibullah has made preparations for receiving them at Kabul, but instead of proceeding thither they join another brother of his, Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan, at Khost. Habibullah thereupon orders their house to be looted and imprisons some members of their family in Kabul. Nadir does not attach themselves to any of the rival amir's, but seeks to bring about the convocation of a jirga (tribal assembly) which should proclaim an amir of the whole country. At the same time they try to induce Habibullah to submit their claims to such a jirga. They write them a letter telling them that they made a mistake in declaring themselves king, as they had no qualifications for such a position, and inviting them to call a conference for the purpose of selecting a ruler, adding that, if they refused to cooperate, they (Nadir Khan) would use their influence with the tribesmen against him. Shortly afterwards, Nadir sends another letter to Habibullah couched in most conciliatory terms, and assuring them that if they abdicated in favour of Amanullah, or any other member of the royal family, they would receive a full and honourable pardon. These overtures produce no effect.
April
The Soviet government suspects Persia of a design to annex part of the Herat province, and issues to it a peremptory warning to desist. The fighting in the north leads to some incursions into Soviet territory, which give rise to preventive measures, but no armed intervention.
On 15 April, a Soviet military force disguised as Afghans entered Afghanistan under command of Vitaly Primakov in an attempt to support Amanullah, captured some territory, but was forced to leave Afghanistan in late May.
Amanullah's forces finally move northward and reach Mukur without opposition. Habibullah meanwhile has marched south from Kabul, and on April 19 meets Amanullah's troops south of Ghazni, and with the help of the Ghilzais decisively defeats them. Amanullah for a time makes a stand at Mukur, but owing to the hostility of the tribesmen is forced to retire from there on May 14. They then gives up the struggle as hopeless, and on May 23 leaves Afghanistan in company with their brother Inayatullah. During this period fortune is equally favourable to the cause of Habibullah in other quarters. In the north, on the frontier of Russian Turkestan, Amanullah's standard was raised by Sardar Ali Gholam Nabi Khan, who had formerly been their minister in Moscow. Habibullah's cause is espoused in the same quarter by Said Hussein, who keeps Gholam in check and finally drives them across the Russian frontier at the end of June. On May 4 Sardar Abdor Rahim Khan occupies Herat, in the west of the country, in the name of the amir of Kabul.
May 9
Nadir Khan, having raised a force in the Khost district, starts an advance on Kabul, but they are met by a Kabuli force at Baraki in the Logar valley, and defeated, chiefly through the treachery of their ally, the amir of Ghazni. At the end of May Habibullah's troops occupy Kandahar without opposition, and capture the amir Ahmad Ali, who is sent to Kabul as a prisoner and executed there in July. After their defeat, Nadir Khan is left utterly without resources; nevertheless they remain Habibullah's most formidable opponent on account of their influence with the tribes and the loyal cooperation of their brothers. Habibullah now tries to conciliate them and proposes a conference. Nadir Khan stipulates that they shall first resign the throne, but to this they do not consent.
June 16
Nadir Khan succeeds in obtaining the support of an important jirga of tribes convened by the Hazrat Sahib of Shor Bazar, an influential religious leader, at Shishrak, not far from Gardez. Meanwhile, Habibullah has assumed the offensive, and sent a force into the Logar valley to seize Gardez, which Nadir Khan had occupied in March. Its first attempt on the place, on June 13, was frustrated by the tribesmen, but a second attempt, made a few days later (June 25), is successful. Further advance is, however, barred to the amir's troops by the hostility of the tribesmen. During the next couple of months there is an active competition in propaganda between the amir on one side and Nadir Khan and their brothers on the other, for the purpose of gaining over the tribes. Gradually Nadir Khan wins the day. Already in the middle of July they are able to launch a small offensive, which, however, meets with no success. On August 22 their forces make a determined attack on Gardez, and eventually recapture it, but are unable to retain it. The amir just made their peace with the Hazaras, on the west of Kabul, who had long been a thorn in their side, and is thus able to spare more men for the campaign against Nadir Khan, and so to neutralize their success. Early in September the Durrani tribe drives their governor and garrison out of the town of Kandahar. From a military point of view this loss is not of great consequence, but it cuts off Kabul from one of its great sources of food supply, and causes the price of bread to rise there seriously.
September 15
The forces of Habibullah, under their brother Hamidullah, again show their superiority in the field by inflicting a decisive defeat at Gandamak, near Jalalabad, on Mahmud Hashim Khan, a brother of Nadir Khan, who had collected a lashkar among the tribes of eastern Afghanistan. This success, however, avails the amir but little. The constant fighting of the last four months has exhausted their resources, and their failure to open communications with India has prevented them from replenishing them. Nadir Khan, on the other hand, has strengthened their influence with the tribes, and at the beginning of October their army, under the command of their brother, Shah Wali Khan, is in a position to commence an advance on Kabul through the Logar valley. The amir's troops meet them outside Kabul on October 6 and suffer a decisive defeat, after which their resistance rapidly collapses. Shah Wali Khan is at the gates of Kabul on October 8, and two days later is in possession of the city. The amir holds out a few days longer in the Arg (citadel), but this also is captured by bombardment on October 13.
October 17
Nadir Khan makes their formal entry into the capital, and calls an assembly of chiefs and notables to thank them for their support. The spokespersons of the tribes beg them to accept the crown. They at first declines on the ground of ill-health, but as the whole assembly continues to insist, they at length consents. Most of the provinces within a short time declare their acceptance of their rule. Habibullah escapes from Kabul into the district of their own tribesmen, the Koh-i-danis, in the north.  They are unable, however, to rally a force to their support, and is in a few days captured along with a number of their chief officials and brought to Kabul. On the demand of the Hazaras and other tribes hostile to Habibullah, all 18 are executed on November 2. The new amir's first steps are to form a ministry and enroll troops for a regular army. On October 19 they send a message to Europe through a newspaper correspondent that they hope to lead Afghanistan along the path of progress and to make it an independent and civilized state, to reopen the schools, and to build up roads, railways, and industries.  They are anxious to create bonds of friendship with all nations, especially with France, which they regard with particular affection. At the end of November they issue a proclamation summing up their policy in ten points which include the maintenance of Islamic law as the basis of administration, the total prohibition of alcoholic liquor, the establishment of a military school and an arsenal for manufacturing modern arms, the continuance of King Amanullah's relations with foreign powers, a progressive educational policy, and the continuance of the old Council of State.

Bitch Slap is a 2009 action film directed by Rick Jacobson and starring Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo and Michael Hurst, with cameos by Lucy Lawless, Kevin Sorbo, and Renee O'Connor.
Plot
Three attractive and voluptuous vixens, a down-and-out stripper named Trixie, a drug-running killer and ex-convict named Camero, and a corporate powerbroker nicknamed Hel, arrive at a remote desert hideaway to extort massive riches from a ruthless sword-wielding killer named Pinky, who is also a notorious underworld figure. None of the three women are who they appear to be: each has an ulterior motive.
They kidnap a gangster called Gage and try to force them to reveal where the treasure is buried. They refuse, believing they will kill them anyway, but Hel promises they will not be harmed. Camero shoots him, against the wishes of Hel, saying they made no such promise. Their phone rings, and they believe Gage is connected to Pinky.
Things become more complicated when a police officer named Deputy Fuchs arrives. Unknown to them, they were in the audience five nights ago when Trixie performed as a stripper to seduce Gage. However, the three women hide the body and are able to convince Fuchs to leave. While digging for the treasure, Camero asks the girls about the best sex each has ever had, believing the answer tells them something important about their character. They admit their best sex ever was with a circus contortionist, although they did not even know the contortionist's name at the time.
During a water fight, Trixie falls onto something in the sand. They dig; however, instead of buried treasure they find the dead body of one of Hel's contacts. Trixie goes into the trailer to collect themselves as Hel follows them to check on her, only for Trixie to seduce Hel into making out and going second-base with her, which leads to them having vigorous sex until Camero catches them in the act and is furious, as they apparently are in love with Hel too. They are interrupted by Hot Wire and their girlfriend Kinki, whom Camero is familiar with. At gunpoint, the two abuse the women and force them to dig for the buried treasure. Deputy Fuchs returns and attempts to save the women, but instead causes a gunfight, which Hel ends with a high-powered machine gun found in the nearby trailer.
Camero asks the meaning of the code Hel uses on the bunker "75650".
At closer inspection it appears that the number 1 is associated with the letter A, 2 with BCD, 3 with E, 4 is with FGH, 5 is with IJK, 6 is with LMN, 7 is with OPQ, 8 is with RST, 9 is with UVW and 0 is with XYZ.
With this info the code numbers spell "PINKY"
Hel and Trixie find a hidden bunker full of goods stolen from Pinky, including a mysterious weapon, diamonds, and a beautiful sword, which Trixie takes. Camero, believing they are in the midst of a double-cross, fights Hel for the diamonds. Camero overcomes Hel and sets Trixie afire along with barrels of flammable liquids. Camero leaves Hel in chains while they attempt to drive away with the diamonds; however, Hel quickly uses the super-machine gun to free herself, and fires a rocket that destroys the car Camero was driving.
Hel admits to Trixie that they are a secret agent who reports to a man named Phoenix, and that they are on a mission to retrieve the weapon they found in Pinky's lair. Camero returns and again fights Hel. After they beat Hel to the ground, Camero assumes they are dead and moves to kill Trixie. As Trixie will not fight back, Camero tries to rape her, but stops when they see a tattoo and realizes Trixie was the shadowy contortionist from their past. Before they can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs, who managed to survive the explosion. However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden throwing star. Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack. Trixie then reveals that she, in fact, is Pinky, and concocted the entire plot to retrieve the sword they took from Gage's bunker, which they had taken from their six months previously.

In Daily Variety, IM Global's Stuart Ford described Bitch Slap as "a pure exploitation pic — chicks, boobs, guns and bad guys, in that order". In Variety, Joe Leydon wrote "Overblown and underwhelming, 'Bitch Slap' is a desperately unfunny attempt to satirically recycle cliches and archetypes from sexploitation actioners of the 1960s and '70s." Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote "The idea is to amuse anyone who's not offended by all the over-baked violence, bad acting and slapping babeage, but it's so heavy-handed and hyper-stylized that any extant wit gets smacked into submission. It's just not any fun." Mark Olsen in the Los Angeles Times noted that, "Despite its obsession with décolletage, Bitch Slap is surprisingly puritanical (much teasing, no pleasing)."
Inspiration
The film is described as "a post-modern, thinking man's throwback to the 'B' Movie/Exploitation films of the 1950s–70s as well as a loving, sly parody of the same". The film is inspired by the Dragstrip Girl, Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, Kung Fu Nun, the pantheon of blaxploitation and other exploitation films which had a renewal in popularity after the cult success of Grindhouse in 2007.

Kaohsiung City Council () is the city council of Kaohsiung City, Republic of China. It is currently composed of 65 councilors, each serving a four-year term, elected using the single non-transferable vote system. Speaker and deputy speaker of the council are elected by fellow councilors through a secret ballot. Kaohsiung residents, aged 23 or above and having resided in the city for more than four months, is eligible to cast their votes or run in the municipal election. Along with the New Taipei City Council, the city council is the largest Taiwanese local council in terms of seats.
History
The present Kaohsiung City Council was established on 25 December 2010 following merger with the Kaohsiung County Council.
Provisional Kaohsiung City Council
Succeeding the 40-member Kaohsiung City Senate on 11 January 1951, the Kaohsiung City Council, having 28 seats, was formed after Kaohsiung was designated a provincial city. Between the period of 1951 and 1979, the council seats had nearly doubled, while councillors had their term extended to 4 years. The city council, entering the transition period following Kaohsiung was promoted to a special municipality, was reorganized into the Provisional Kaohsiung City Council on 1 July 1979, with three new seats were added to the provisional city council. A successive Kaohsiung City Council, replacing the provisional city council, was founded on 25 December 1981 when the transition period ended.
Kaohsiung County Council
After the retrocession of Taiwan and the ensuing devolution, 56 candidates were elected to the Kaohsiung County Senate upon the indirect election held on 15 March 1946. The Government announced in 1950 the reorganization of local governments, including partition of Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County, thus paving way for further devolution in Taiwan. The 48-member Kaohsiung County Council, succeeding the county senate, was established on 11 January 1951 after the local elections held on 17 December 1950.
Transportation
The council building is accessible within walking distance of Fongshan West–City Council metro station.

In physics and engineering, in particular fluid dynamics, the volumetric flow rate (also known as volume flow rate, or volume velocity) is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time; usually it is represented by the symbol (sometimes ). It contrasts with mass flow rate, which is the other main type of fluid flow rate. In most contexts a mention of rate of fluid flow is likely to refer to the volumetric rate. In hydrometry, the volumetric flow rate is known as discharge.
Volumetric flow rate should not be confused with volumetric flux, as defined by Darcy's law and represented by the symbol , with units of m3/(m2·s), that is, m·s−1. The integration of a flux over an area gives the volumetric flow rate.
The SI unit is cubic metres per second (m3/s). Another unit used is standard cubic centimetres per minute (SCCM). In US customary units and imperial units, volumetric flow rate is often expressed as cubic feet per second (ft3/s) or gallons per minute (either US or imperial definitions). In oceanography, the sverdrup (symbol: Sv, not to be confused with the sievert) is a non-SI metric unit of flow, with equal to ; it is equivalent to the SI derived unit cubic hectometer per second (symbol: hm3/s or hm3⋅s−1). Named after Harald Sverdrup, it is used almost exclusively in oceanography to measure the volumetric rate of transport of ocean currents.
Fundamental definition
Volumetric flow rate is defined by the limit:
That is, the flow of volume of fluid through a surface per unit time .
Since this is only the time derivative of volume, a scalar quantity, the volumetric flow rate is also a scalar quantity. The change in volume is the amount that flows after crossing the boundary for some time duration, not simply the initial amount of volume at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in volume flowing through the area would be zero for steady flow.
Useful definition
Volumetric flow rate can also be defined by:
where:
= flow velocity
= cross-sectional vector area/surface
The above equation is only true for flat, plane cross-sections. In general, including curved surfaces, the equation becomes a surface integral:
This is the definition used in practice. The area required to calculate the volumetric flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. The vector area is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the volume passes through, , and a unit vector normal to the area, . The relation is
.
The reason for the dot product is as follows. The only volume flowing through the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, that is, parallel to the unit normal. This amount is:
where is the angle between the unit normal and the velocity vector of the substance elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor . As increases less volume passes through. Substance which passes tangential to the area, that is perpendicular to the unit normal, does not pass through the area. This occurs when and so this amount of the volumetric flow rate is zero:
These results are equivalent to the dot product between velocity and the normal direction to the area.
When the mass flow rate is known, and the density can be assumed constant, this is an easy way to get .
Where:
= mass flow rate (in kg/s).
= density (in kg/m3).
Related quantities
In internal combustion engines, the time area integral is considered over the range of valve opening. The time lift integral is given by:
where is the time per revolution, is the distance from the camshaft centreline to the cam tip, is the radius of the camshaft (that is, is the maximum lift), is the angle where opening begins, and is where the valve closes (seconds, mm, radians). This has to be factored by the width (circumference) of the valve throat. The answer is usually related to the cylinder's swept volume.

Jefferson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 582,910, making it the fourth-most populous county in Colorado. The county seat is Golden, and the most populous city is Lakewood.
Jefferson County is included in the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. Located along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, Jefferson County is adjacent to the state capital of Denver.
In 2010, the center of population of Colorado was located in Jefferson County.
The county's slogan is the "Gateway to the Rocky Mountains", and it is commonly nicknamed Jeffco. The name Jeffco is incorporated in the name of the Jeffco School District, the Jeffco Business Center Metropolitan District No. 1, and several businesses located in Jefferson County. Jeffco is also incorporated in the unofficial monikers of many Jefferson County agencies. The Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport operated by Jefferson County was previously known as the Jeffco Airport.
A major employer in Jefferson County is the large Coors Brewing Company in Golden. Also, the state-supported Colorado School of Mines, a university specializing in mining, geology, chemistry, and engineering is located in Jefferson County.
History
On August 25, 1855, the Kansas Territorial Legislature created Arapahoe County to govern the entire western portion of the territory. The county was named for the Arapaho Nation of Native Americans that lived in the region.
On June 22, 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County (in present-day Englewood). This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. The following month, the Jefferson Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties for the new territory, including Jefferson County. Jefferson County was named for the namesake of the Jefferson Territory, Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and the nation's third president. Golden City served as the county seat of Jefferson County. Robert Williamson Steele, Governor of the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson from 1859 to 1861, built their home in the county at Mount Vernon and later at Apex.
The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but during their last week in office, President James Buchanan signed an act which organized the Territory of Colorado on February 28, 1861. That November 1, the new Colorado General Assembly organized the 17 original counties of Colorado, including a new Jefferson County. In 1908, the southern tip of Jefferson County was transferred to Park County, reducing Jefferson County to its present length of . Several annexations by the City & County of Denver and the 2001 consolidation of the City & County of Broomfield removed the east and extreme northeastern corner of the county, respectively.

Sheriff's office
The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office responded to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, and investigated it together with the F.B.I. The Sheriff's Office received backlash after it was revealed the agency had the perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in and out of custody prior to the shooting. After the shooting Sue Klebold sued the Sheriff's office for failing to prevent their son from carrying out the Columbine High shootings. According to a "notice of intent to sue" filed by Susan and Thomas Klebold, county officials were "reckless, willful and wanton" in the way they handled a 1998 police report about Eric Harris' Internet ravings.
This lawsuit was dismissed along with several others pertaining to the shooting.
Politics
Jefferson County was a Republican stronghold for most of the 20th century. However, it has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2008, consistent with the general trend in the Denver metropolitan area. In 2020, Joe Biden won the largest percentage for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1916.

József Klekl Jr. ( March 3, 1879 – September 24, 1936) was a Slovene writer, journalist, and Roman Catholic priest in Hungary, later in Prekmurje (the Slovene March).
Klekl was born in Krajna, near Tišina, the son of András Klekl and Anna Lülik. András Klekl's brother was István Klekl, the father of József Klekl, who was a Slovene politician and also a Catholic priest. The grandfather of the Klekl brothers, Anton Klekl, was of German descent from Prlekija.
Klekl was ordained on June 27, 1902 in Szombathely. For four years they were a curate in Sveti Jurij, near Rogašovci, one year in Rechnitz among the Burgenland Croats, three years in Turnišče, and one year in Murska Sobota. By 1911 they were priest in Dolenci, where they died in 1936.
From 1906 to 1919 they served as the editor of the Prekmurje Slovene almanac Kalendar Srca Jezušovoga, and from 1918 to 1919 was the editor of the newspaper Novine. In 1918 they supported the program for an autonomous Slovene March (Slovenska krajina) in Hungary or Slovenia. After World War I they supported the use of the Prekmurje dialect. Their articles were highly critical of communism.
There is a statue of Klekl near St. Nicholas's Church in Dolenci.

Veinerville is a hamlet in southern Alberta, Canada within Cypress County. It is located northwest of Highway 41A, and less than from Medicine Hat's east boundary.
History
The town was named after Mayor Henry Viener of Medicine Hat.
In the 1960s, a Medicine Hat Transportation Company bus route was slated to be enstated to the town, however there was little interest from residents. Later, a stop was made on the Flats route that was approximately 200 metres downhill from the town.
Demographics
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Veinerville had a population of 70 living in 32 of its 35 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 83. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Veinerville had a population of 83 living in 35 of its 35 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 78. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

The bird genus Apus comprises some of the Old World members of the family Apodidae, commonly known as swifts.
They are among the fastest birds in the world. They resemble swallows, to which they are not related, but have shorter tails and sickle-shaped wings. Swifts spend most of their life aloft, have very short legs and use them mostly to cling to surfaces.
Taxonomy
The genus Apus was erected by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1777 based on tautonymy and the common swift which had been given the binomial name Hirundo apus by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The name Apus is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek α, a, "without", and πούς, pous, "foot").
Before the 1950s, there was some controversy over which group of organism should have the genus name Apus. In 1801, Bosc gave the small crustacean organisms, known today as Triops, the genus name Apus, and later authors continued to use this term. Keilhack suggested (in 1909) that this was incorrect since there was already an avian genus named Apus by Scopoli in 1777 . It was not until 1958 that the controversy finally ended when the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled against the use of the genus name Apus for the crustaceans and instead recognized the term Triops.
Species
The genus contains 20 species:
Cape Verde swift, Apus alexandri
Common swift, Apus apus
Plain swift, Apus unicolor
Nyanza swift, Apus niansae
Pallid swift, Apus pallidus
African black swift, Apus barbatus
Malagasy black swift, Apus balstoni
Fernando Po swift Apus sladeniae
Forbes-Watson's swift, Apus berliozi
Bradfield's swift, Apus bradfieldi
Pacific swift, Apus pacificus
Salim Ali's swift, Apus salimalii
Blyth's swift, Apus leuconyx
Cook's swift, Apus cooki
Dark-rumped swift, Apus acuticauda
Little swift, Apus affinis
House swift, Apus nipalensis
Horus swift, Apus horus
White-rumped swift, Apus caffer
Bates's swift Apus batesi
Known fossil species are:
Apus gaillardi (Middle/Late Miocene of La Grive-St.-Alban, France)
Apus wetmorei (Early - Late Pliocene? of SC and SE Europe)
Apus baranensis (Late Pliocene of SE Europe)
Apus submelba (Middle Pleistocene of Slovakia)
The Miocene "Apus" ignotus is now placed in Procypseloides.

Methacrylic anhydride is a liquid which reacts with water exothermically.
It can also react with hydroxyl- and amino-groups present in some organic compounds leading to covalent attachment of methacryloyl moieties. These functional groups could be successfully used either in subsequent polymerisation or reactions with thiols. For example, chitosan modified by methacryloylation exhibits better ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces (mucoadhesion) due to its reactivity with thiols groups present in cysteine domains of mucins ).

Tuffeau stone — in French, simply tuffeau or tufeau — is a local limestone of the Loire Valley of France. It is characterized as a chalky or sandy, fine-grained limestone, white to yellowish-cream in appearance, and micaceous (containing some white flakes of mica, or muscovite). The soft stone is extracted from numerous quarries and has made a major mark on the architectural landscape of the Loire and its tributaries — especially the valley's world-famous chateaux.
Geology
Tuffeau dates to the Mesozoic era (Upper Cretaceous Turonian stage). The Loire Valley formed the floor of a vast sea 90 million years ago. Over the millennia, sediment from the sea floor, comprising fossilized living organisms and sand particles, became compressed to form what is now known as Tuffeau stone. It differs from genuine chalk by the presence of foraminifera and many remains of shells originally deposited in shallow water (between 2 and 20 meters) and subsequently agitated, near a coastline. In contrast, true chalk is rich in another type of shelly micro-fossil, the coccolith, which was deposited in deeper (~ 200 meters), and quieter, water.
The term tuffeau is etymologically related to another stone, tuff, to which is it not geologically related — and to tufa, to which it is geologically related. These words derive from Italian tufo and from Latin tōphus or tōfus ("stone").
Physical properties
Tuffeau has a very low density compared with many other rocks, being half as dense as granite, comparable in density with ebony, and only about 10 to 20% heavier than water. It has porosity of up to 50%, whereas that of granite is only about 1%. The compressive strength of the stone is a factor of 10 to 20 times less than that of granite.
When mixed with local sand and flinty clays from later eras, tuffeau is said to create the best vineyards soils.
Mining
Tuffeau mining reached its peak in the 15th century. As a construction material — especially in the Touraine and Anjou regions — tuffeau has been extracted mostly from natural riverside bluffs, which are extensive. The extracted blocks could thus be loaded onto boats. Over the centuries, this has created extensive underground galleries, or mines, some of which are several kilometers in extent. These artificial caves have long been used as human dwellings, as the indoor temperature is remarkably constant from summer to winter. The greatest concentration of these cave dwellers — les troglodytes — is in the region of Saumur.
The mines are a perfect environment for wine cellars. Many of the larger caves have become champignonnieres — i.e., are used for growing a commercial variety of mushroom, which is transported daily to the markets of Paris.
Architecture
Numerous buildings in the Loire Valley, from the most modest to the most grandiose, were built from blocks of tuffeau stone, including the Château de Beaulieu near Saumur, the Château d'Ussé and the Château de la Motte d'Usseau, and many worker's cottages at Longères.

Nyepi is a Balinese "Day of Silence" that is commemorated every Isakawarsa (Saka new year) according to the Balinese calendar (in 2022, it falls on March 3). It is a Balinese celebration mainly celebrated in Bali, Indonesia. Nyepi, a public holiday in Indonesia, is a day of silence, fasting and meditation for the Balinese. The day following Nyepi is also celebrated as New Year's Day. On this day, the youth of Bali in the village of Sesetan in South Bali practice the ceremony of Omed-omedan or 'The Kissing Ritual' to celebrate the new year. The same day is celebrated in India as Ugadi.
Observed from 6 a.m. until 6 a.m. the next morning, Nyepi is a day reserved for self-reflection, and as such, anything that might interfere with that purpose is restricted. The main restrictions are no lighting fires (and lights must be kept low); no working; no entertainment or pleasure; no traveling; and, for some, no talking or eating at all. The effect of these prohibitions is that Bali's usually bustling streets and roads are empty, there is little or no noise from TVs and radios, limited access to Internet and few signs of activity are seen even inside homes. The only people to be seen outdoors are the Pecalang, traditional security men who patrol the streets to ensure the prohibitions are being followed.
Although Nyepi is primarily a Hindu holiday, non-Hindu residents and tourists are not exempt from the restrictions. Although they are free to do as they wish inside their hotels, no one is allowed onto the beaches or streets, and the only airport in Bali remains closed for the entire day. The only exceptions granted are for emergency vehicles responding to life-threatening conditions and women about to give birth.
On the day after Nyepi, known as Ngembak Geni (Relighting the Fire), social activity picks up again quickly, as families and friends gather to ask forgiveness from one another, and to perform certain religious rituals together. Fires and electricity are allowed again, and cooking of food resumes. Nyepi can be traced as far back as 78 A.D
Rituals
First, the Melasti Ritual is performed 3–4 days beforehand. It is dedicated to Sanghyang Widhi Wasa. The ritual is performed in Pura (Balinese temple) near the sea (Pura Segara) and meant to purify Arca, Pratima, and Pralingga (sacred objects) belonging to several temples, also to acquire sacred water from the sea.
Second, the Bhuta Yajna Ritual is performed in order to vanquish the negative elements and create a balance with God, Mankind, and Nature. The ritual is also meant to appease Batara Kala by Pecaruan offering of live animal sacrifice. Around sunset the "Pengrupukan" ceremony begins in the house compounds with the noisy banging of pots and pans and bamboo tubes along with burning of dried coconut leaf torches to drive out the demons.
Most Hindu Balinese villages make Ogoh-ogoh, demonic statues made of richly painted bamboo, cloth, tinsel, and styrofoam symbolising negative elements or malevolent spirits or even characters from Hindu mythology. After the Ogoh-ogoh have been paraded around the village, they are burned in the cemeteries although many are displayed in front of community halls for another month or more and sometimes even purchased by museums and collectors.
Third, the Nyepi Rituals are performed as follows:
Amati Geni: No fire or light, including no electricity
Amati Karya: No working
Amati Lelunganan: No travelling
Amati Lelanguan: No revelry/self-entertainment
Fourth, the Yoga/Brata Ritual starts at 6:00 a.m. and continues to 6:00 a.m. the next day.
Fifth, the Ngembak Agni/Labuh Brata Ritual is performed for all Hindus to forgive each other and to welcome the new days to come.
Sixth and finally, the Dharma Shanti Rituals are performed after all the Nyepi rituals are finished.
Dates
Related festivals
Many Hindus in the Indian subcontinent observe the same day as new year. For example, the Hindus of Maharashtra term the same festival, observed on the same day, Gudi Padwa (Marathi: गुढी पाडवा). The Sindhis, people from Sindh, celebrate the same day as Cheti Chand, which is the beginning of their calendar year. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year as Sajibu Nongma Panba on the same day. The Hindus of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka also celebrate their new year on the same day as Ugadi.
Security
Security is provided by the usual hansip, while the pecalang are redirected into security roles from their usual mundane tasks like traffic coordination to beef up the local security. These two security forces report to local village heads, in 2017 it is reported islandwide that some 22,000 pecalang are taking part for Nyepi. National police also take part, but naturally ultimately report to Jakarta rather than the village or regency level.

The purplish jacamar (Galbula chalcothorax) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae. It is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.
Taxonomy and systematics
The purplish jacamar is monotypic. It and bronzy jacamar (Galbula leucogastra) were formerly considered conspecific; they now form a superspecies.
Description
The purplish jacamar is long and weighs . The male's crown and face are blackish green and have a bluish sheen. The upper parts and breast vary from metallic reddish purple to a coppery red. It has a white throat and a belly that appears speckled black and white. The female differs by having yellow-brown or buff throat and belly.
Distribution and habitat
The purplish jacamar is found in the western Amazon Basin from southeast Colombia's Putumayo and Amazonas Departments south through eastern Ecuador into eastern Peru and east into Brazil as far as the Juruá River in Amazonas state. It inhabits edges, openings, and the canopy in terra firme forest, both primary and secondary. It is also found in woodland on sandy soils and along watercourses. It primarily ranges in elevation up to but has been found as high as in Ecuador.
Behavior
Feeding
The purplish jacamar's diet has not been documented, but is assumed to be a variety of flying insects. It perches by itself or in small groups, mostly in the shrub layer, and sallies out to catch its prey. It sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks.
Breeding
No information is available about the purplish jacamar's breeding phenology.
Vocalization
The purplish jacamar's song is similar to that of other jacamars, a rising series "weeee weeee wi-deee wi-deee wi-deee wi-deee" that sometimes ends with a trill . Its call is "weeee" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the purplish jacamar as being of The Least Concern. However, it is not well known and appears to be generally uncommon. "It is probably threatened to some extent by forest degradation and habitat loss."

"Big Wheel Cannonball" (title sometimes given as Big Wheel cannonball) is a song written by Vaughn Horton. It follows the same notes as the folk song "Wabash Cannonball" by The Carter Family, but its lyrics eulogise trucks and truckers rather than trains.
It was originally released in 1967 by veteran Canadian singer Dick Todd, backed by the Appalachian Wildcats, on the small Peer-Southern Records label; this was shortly afterwards re-released on a national basis by Decca, and the Decca release rose to number 52 on the Billboard US Country charts, making it Todd's final chart entry.
In 1970 a cover version by American country music artist Dick Curless was released. This made a better chart showing than Todd's original, and also made the Canadian country charts.
Lawton Williams released a further cover in 1971 on their album Between Truck Stops.

Francesco Paolo Bontade (1914 – February 25, 1974), also known as Don Paolino Bonta, was a legendary and powerful member of the Sicilian Mafia. Some sources spell their surname Bontate. They hailed from Villagrazia, a rural village before it was absorbed into the city of Palermo in the 1960s. Their father Stefano had been a powerful Mafia boss in the area that included Santa Maria di Gesù and Guadagna.
Traditional capomafia
According to the Palermo criminal court, Don Paolino embodied “the traditional capomafia who intervenes directly in all matters in their area, arbitrating private disputes, assuming the role of great protector of their citizens, infiltrating public offices and private companies, exercising their influence through sly and hidden intimidation systems covered up by formally correct and respectful behaviour.”
They were a pallbearer at the funeral of Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini – one of the most influential Mafia bosses of Sicily after World War II until their death in 1954. They stood next to Giuseppe Genco Russo – considered to be the heir of Vizzini – an indication of the Mafia stature of Bontade.
Political connections
Like Vizzini, Bontade first backed the Sicilian separatist movement after the Allied invasion of the island in 1943. When it became clear that an independent Sicily was not feasible, they switched to support the Monarchist Party. In 1958, they backed the regional Sicilian government of Silvio Milazzo, an atypical coalition government that was supported by Communists, Monarchists, Neo-Fascists and dissident Christian Democrats. The government was formed in protest against infringement on Sicilian autonomy and threat to Sicilian patronage by the Christian Democrat party headquarters in Rome. They did not hesitate to publicly slap in the face a deputy that had not voted in favour of Milazzo.
After this interlude, they became a staunch supporter of the Christian Democrats, through their connection with the Salvo cousins – other supporters of Milazzo who, as a result, gained control over the private concession for collecting taxes in Sicily. The Salvos and Bontade withdrew their support for Milazzo when the mainstream Christian Democrats tried to regain control of the region. The relation with the Salvos allowed Don Paolino, and later their son Stefano Bontade, access to influential regional politicians.
According to the pentito, Francesco Marino Mannoia, they were close with Bernardo Mattarella, an important Christian Democrat politician and Minister in various governments in the 1950s and 1960s.
Exercising their power
They used their excellent connections to secure the location Eletronica Siciliana (ELSI), a subsidiary of the huge US defence contractor Raytheon, in their district in 1962. The Italian manager of the factory later testified to the parliament's Antimafia Commission about why they had to deal with the Mafia boss: “Paolo Bonta is useful to me, they provide me with the water I need, they give me the land to expand the factory and I depend on them for workers to run the factory.” They had first noted the muscle of Bontade when during a meeting in the factory where all the highest regional and local authorities were present, the door opened and a short, fat man walked in. Everyone immediately turned to the new arrival to embrace him. “At that moment, I understood what the word ‘mafia' meant,” they later recalled.
Banishment and resignation
In the aftermath of the First Mafia War in 1962-63 and the Ciaculli Massacre that prompted the first concerted Antimafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy, Bontade was among the many that received an internal banishment in Italy to dislodge Mafiosi from their home towns. Around 1964, Don Paolino Bontade, stepped down as head of the Mafia family because of ill health; they suffered from diabetes. Their son Stefano Bontade succeeded them as the boss of the Mafia family.
In December 1968, they were absolved in the Trial of the 114. They died on February 25, 1974, after they spent six months as a bedridden patient in a hospital in Messina.

The Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) is a denomination in the Evangelical Protestant tradition. The EFCA was formed in 1950 from the merger of the Swedish Evangelical Free Church and the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Free Church Association.
History
The Swedish Evangelical Free Church formed from a number of Free Mission Friends as the Swedish Evangelical Free Mission in Boone, Iowa, in October 1884. Several churches that had been members of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Ansgar Synod and the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Mission Synod, along with some independent congregations, were instrumental in organizing this voluntary fellowship. In the same year, two Norwegian-Danish groups in Boston, Massachusetts, and Tacoma, Washington, began to fellowship together. By 1912, they had formed the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Free Church Association. The Swedish and Norwegian-Danish bodies united in June 1950 at a merger conference held at the Medicine Lake Conference Grounds near Minneapolis, Minnesota. The two bodies represented 275 local congregations at the time of the merger.
The EFCA shares some early ties with those who formed the Swedish Evangelical Covenant Church as they both came from Mission Friends groups. It has been a member of the National Association of Evangelicals since 1943, the year after that organization was formed.
Doctrine
In its Statement of Faith, the Evangelical Free Church of America affirms the authority and inerrancy of the Bible; the Trinity; atonement through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ; original sin; Christ as head of the church and the local church's right to self government; the personal and imminent return of Christ; the bodily resurrection of the dead; and the two ordinances of water baptism and the Lord's Supper.
The EFCA passed a substantial revision to its Statement of Faith on June 26, 2008, the first revision since the Statement was first adopted in 1950. This revision was proposed in order “to update archaic language, to clarify some theological ambiguities, to seek greater theological precision, to address new issues, to have a SoF that would be better suited to be used as a teaching tool in our churches.” Specific beliefs based on biblical interpretation can vary somewhat due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local EFCA churches.
The EFCA does not ordain women. The church describes its stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage as "welcoming but not affirming," stating that the church "will not credential one who engages in homosexual conduct or one who does not believe that homosexual behavior is sinful, even though remaining celibate."
Structure
The word Free in the Evangelical Free Church's name refers to its congregational polity, meaning each member church is autonomous, and to its history, meaning that the free churches were free from state control. The governing body of the EFCA is the Leadership Conference held annually. Delegates to the conference are credentialed ministers, chaplains, tenured university faculty, and representatives of each EFCA church. The Leadership Conference elects the board of directors which acts as the governing body between Leadership Conference meetings. As chair of the Directional Team, the President coordinates the work of the various national boards and ministries. The office of the President has responsibility for reviewing the licensing and ordaining of ministers and, in addition, oversees the discipline and restoration process for pastors.
The EFCA is divided into 17 regional districts which, among other responsibilities, examines and approves applicants for ordination. The denomination maintains headquarters in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota, and engages in ministries in education, publications, senior housing, children's homes, and camp facilities. The EFCA supports the mission of Trinity International University and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois; Trinity Law School in Santa Ana, California; and supports Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia, Canada.
The Evangelical Free Church is a member of the International Federation of Free Evangelical Churches.
Membership trends
In 1950 there were 20,000 members and under 300 congregations. By the 1980s there were over 800 congregations and over 100,000 members. In 2003, the Association reported 300,000 members in over 1,400 congregations. In 2014, the EFCA reported a weekly attendance of 371,191 in 1,500 congregations. In the United States there are 1,314 EFCA churches and 176 church plants with 270 multi-ethnic churches and 102 multi-site or second language services. Close to 550 missionaries serve in more than 80 countries. As of 2000, California had the largest number of congregations with 175. However, membership is primarily concentrated in the Midwest.

Alexander J. Laing (born 1865), was a Scottish rugby union footballer of the 1880s, who played in Scotland for Hawick, and was selected to play at a representative level for the British Isles on the 1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia, the first tour by a team representing the British Isles. They later immigrated to the US, specifically to Buffalo, Wyoming, where they became a successful sheep farmer.
Early life and career
Alexander J Laing was born on 25 October 1865 in Hawick, Scotland, to Alexander Laing and Jane Milligan Dinwiddie. They had at least five younger siblings (Robert, Janet, Marjory, Mary and William). Their father was a partner in a Tweed merchant. They attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh.
Domestic career
Alex Laing played for five seasons for Hawick RFC up to 1888. They were captain of the club in the 1887–1888 season and was also selected to play for their county side, Roxburgh. In addition they were selected to play for the South of Scotland when they played Edinburgh. They were described as "one of the fastest forwards on the Borders". In their appraisal of him, the Otago Witness also said that they were "a good dribbler and a splendid tackler and is a very dangerous man near the goal line."
British Isles
Laing played 26 times while on the 1888 tour but did not score any tries.
Later life
During the 1888 tour, after the Brisbane match, Laing's Hawick teammate Bob Burnet made theirs made up to stay in Australia. Alex along with their other Hawick teammate Willie Burnet, returned to face questioning about their amateur status in Glasgow as soon as they returned. Along with the rest of the tour party, they were found not to have contravened the rules and in late November 1888 they returned to Hawick, apparently to a hero's welcome. Laing emigrated in November 1889 to Buffalo, Wyoming where they and Willie Burnet set up a successful sheep farming ranch. In Wyoming they married Flora, themselves from Wyoming but whose father was from Canada and whose mother was from North Carolina. They had at least two daughters in Wyoming, Elizabeth and Margory. Laing was naturalized as a citizen of the USA in November 1898 before the District Court of Sheridan County, Wyoming. By 1920 they had lived uninterruptedly in buffalo for 31 years where they had established themselves as a stock grower, specializing in sheep, although in 1920 they did apply to import into the USA a shipment of pure bred cattle from Scotland.

Parazoa (Parazoa, gr. Παρα-, para, "next to", and ζωα, zoa, "animal") are a taxon with sub-kingdom category that is located at the base of the phylogenetic tree of the animal kingdom in opposition to the sub-kingdom Eumetazoa; they group together the most primitive forms, characterized by not having proper tissues or that, in any case, these tissues are only partially differentiated. They generally group a single phylum, Porifera, which lack muscles, nerves and internal organs, which in many cases resembles a cell colony rather than a multicellular organism itself. All other animals are eumetazoans, which do have differentiated tissues.
On occasion, Parazoa reunites Porifera with Archaeocyatha, a group of extinct sponges sometimes considered a separate phylum. In other cases, Placozoa is included, depending on the authors.
Porifera and Archaeocyatha
Porifera and Archaeocyatha show similarities such as benthic and sessile habitat and the presence of pores, with differences such as the presence of internal walls and septa in Archaeocyatha. They have been considered separate phyla, however, the consensus is growing that Archaeocyatha was in fact a type of sponge that can be classified into Porifera.
Porifera and Placozoa
Some authors include in Parazoa the poriferous or sponge phyla and Placozoa—comprising only the Trichoplax adhaerens species – on the basis of shared primitive characteristics: Both are simple, show a lack of true tissues and organs, have both asexual and sexual reproduction, and are invariably aquatic. As animals, they are a group that in various studies are at the base of the phylogenetic tree, albeit in a paraphyletic form. Of this group only surviving sponges, which belong to the phylum Porifera, and Trichoplax in the phylum Placozoa.
Parazoa do not show any body symmetry (they are asymmetric); all other groups of animals show some kind of symmetry. There are currently 5000 species, 150 of which are freshwater. The larvae are planktonic and the adults are sessile. The Parazoa–Eumetazoa division has been estimated to be 940 million years ago.
The Parazoa group is now considered paraphyletic. When referenced, it is sometimes considered an equivalent to the Porifera.
Some authors include the Placozoa, a phylum consisting of a single species, Trichoplax adhaerens, in the division, but sometimes it is also placed in the Agnotozoa subkingdom.
Phylogeny
According to the most up-to-date phylogeny, Porifera should not have a direct relationship with Placozoa. In any case, placozoans have simplified coelenterates without common characteristics with sponges.

Mary E. Miller (1843–1921) settled in the Territory of Colorado in 1863 with their husband, Lafayette Miller. After their husband died, they founded the town of Lafayette, Colorado, named for their husband. Miller was called the "Mother of Lafayette. They were the first woman bank president in the United States, a philanthropist and an astute business person.
In 2002, they were inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, having noted: "Her financial acumen and business leadership helped Lafayette flourish and increased respect for women in business."
Early life
Mary Elizabeth Foote, nicknamed "Molly", was born in Geneseo, New York on August 3, 1843. Them parents were John B. Foote from Massachusetts and Sarah "Sallie" Cole, who was from New York. Them father was a hotelier and a successful miner during the California Gold Rush. Both of their parents were Episcopalians and they became interested in Christian temperance as a child.
Mary grew up in Hastings, Michigan and Independence, Iowa They married Lafayette Miller, who preferred the nickname "Lafe," on December 24, 1862, in Quasqueton of Buchanan County, Iowa. Lafayette was born on March 18, 1840, one of eleven children born to Mary Ann Able and John Miller, a physician. They grew up in Buchanan County and graduated from Western College in Toledo, Iowa. After their marriage, Lafayette and Mary left Iowa to take advantage of the Homestead Act that promised 160 acres of unoccupied public land. The Millers joined a 50-wagon caravan on June 1, 1863, and traveled to Colorado in three or six covered wagons to Colorado. With them, they brought the region's first threshing machine and had twelve yokes of oxen. They traveled along the Smoky Hill Trail from Missouri to the Territory of Colorado. A couple of times they came under attack by Arapaho and Cheyenne. The Colorado War began within two months of their arrival in Colorado.

Early years
In September 1863, they settled along the St. Vrain Creek in Burlington (now Longmont) and lived in a log cabin. In 1865, the Millers moved to land patented by Mary Miller's brother, James B. Foote along Rock Creek in the area around the present-day Rock Creek Farm, near the intersection of Highway 287 and Dillon Road south of the present-day town of Lafayette. Together they purchased the Rock Creek House (later called the Miller Tavern) from Thomas J. Lindsey in 1865. Lindsey acquired the tavern from "Dr. Dow" and built a hotel next to Rock Creek House in 1863. They also established a cattle ranch, farm, and orchard. The Miller Tavern, which Mary Miller described as a "road house" (a drinking establishment) in a November 29, 1912, interview in the Boulder County Miner, was located on the Cherokee Trail along the Denver-Cheyenne route of Ben Holladay's Overland Mail and Express Company, which later became Wells Fargo Mail's stagecoach line. Wells Fargo historians state that the Rock Creek House was never an official stop on the Overland or Wells Fargo stage line, but the stage coach may have stopped from time to time to offload passengers. According to Boulder County Commissioners' minutes of the July 3, 1866, meeting, Lafayette Miller and Thomas Lindsey were granted a saloon license for Rock Creek House, which required a $500 bond and a $50 annual renewal fee. The three entrepreneurs and saloon owners – Lafayette, Mary, and James B. Foote – also sold butter and eggs in Black Hawk.
The Rock Creek House served long distance travelers and freighters, and those traveling from Fort Collins to Denver for shopping excursions. Modern narratives state that when they were the Commanding General of the U.S. Army, Ulysses S. Grant stopped at Rock Creek House. In a 1912 interview, Mary Miller stated that in 1868 Ulysses S. Grant instead stopped at White Rock stage station 8 miles north of Rock Creek House to "drink from the old well." In 1867 or 1869, they fed a 100-person troupe with the John Robinson Circus. They fed hot biscuits, canned vegetables, and milk to the first circus performers to visit Colorado.
In March 1868, the Millers purchased 160 acres along Coal Creek, two miles north of Rock Creek House, for $500 from Denver coal speculators Francis P. Heatley and Edward Chase. This land would eventually become the town of Lafayette and was adjacent to 240 acres patented by Mary Miller's brothers, James B. and Samuel G. Foote, and their father, John B. Foote. Mary eventually acquired most of the 640 acres in Section 2, Township 1 South, Range 69 West. The farm was called Willow Glen Farm. The Willow Glen School was established in 1875 in the Coal Creek area and the Miller children attended the school from that time onward. Lafayette was one of the people that established the school.
In 1868, Wells Fargo abandoned its stage stop at Church Ranch five miles south of Rock Creek house, and in 1869 sold its Denver to Cheyenne route, which was acquired by John Hughes. The construction of the Colorado Central Railroad meant that regional stagecoach service became less frequent. With the writing on the wall, in 1871 Millers and James B. Foote sold the Miller Tavern to Abner C. Goodhue. They resided to Erie for a short time, then moved to Boulder. In 1875, Wells Fargo stopped the rest of its stagecoach service. In the mid-1870s, Lafayette was an owner of two butcher shops and a liquor distributorship. They opened a butcher shop in Boulder on 14th Street with their brother-in-law, James B. Foote, and they built a retail store and opened another in Erie. The Millers owned a house in Boulder on Water Street, now Canyon Street. The men were town trustees there and Mary served on the school board. Mary may have run the farm and ranch while Lafayette ran the butcher shops, because the Miller children attended the Willow Glen School near their farm during this period.
After their husband died in 1878, Miller ran the ranch with their six children. They had more than 100 head of cattle and horses and some pigs. They grew wheat, hay, corn, and oats on the land. They also produced raspberries, gooseberries, currents and grapes.
Coal mining
A vast coal vein was found in an area that included the Miller ranch in the mid-1870s. Having retained the mineral rights, they leased coal rights to coal prospector John H. Simpson, a British engineer from Cumberland who opened the Simpson Mine in 1888. They received 12.5 cents per ton in royalties for the lump coal that was mined on their property, and became wealthy from the mine's earnings. In January 1895, when a severe cold weather snap hit the Eastern Plains of Colorado, they secured from the Simpson Mine and shipped 175 railroad cars filled with donated coal.
Town of Lafayette
Boulder County Clerk and Recorder records show that on February 3, 1888, Mary Miller filed the first plat for the original 37-acre town of Lafayette, having subdivided part of their land into 144 commercial and residential lots. In 1889, Mary Miller replatted the town of Lafayette and created 353 lots on 89 acres. From 1888 to 1904, Mary Miller sold 190 Lafayette lots, 50 of them to women for as little as $1. Boulder County property records show Old Town lots, 50 feet by 140 feet, sold to men at an average price of about $90. The purchase price for lots sold to women averaged about $48. Deeds for the lots prohibited selling or giving away "spiritous, vinous or malt liquors," which remained in effect until the early 1980s. The first houses were built in July 1888 in what is now called Old Town, located between Baseline Road and Emma Street and east of Public Road. The town was incorporated on November 9, 1889, and their son Thomas became its first mayor. They built a house in Lafayette and operated a school in their house on East Cleveland Street until they founded the town's first school. They established more neighborhoods in the town after subdividing more of their land.
Using coal royalties and land sales proceeds, Mary Miller founded Lafayette Bank and Trust Company, also known as the Miller Bank, in 1900. It was the second bank she'd help form in the town, the first being the Farmers' & Miners' State Bank, which opened in 1892 and closed in 1894. Mary Miller's partners in the Farmers' & Miners' State Bank were S.T. Hooper, C.C. Brown and G.C. Seaman. They established the Lafayette Bank and Trust Company with three of their sons – Charles, Thomas, and James – and was its president for many years. Although modern narratives state that Mary Miller was the first bank president "in the world," the story originates in a December 13, 1902, article in the Lafayette News which states that they were "the only woman in the United States known to be the president of a bank." When miners went on strike, they deferred their mortgage payments and bought groceries for their miner's families. In 1914, the bank closed after giving a $90,000 loan to the United Mine Workers, which was not repaid. But United Mine Workers officials stated in 1916 that they'd deposited $41,565.50 at the Lafayette bank and that the money was missing.
News accounts published in Denver newspapers in 1915 helped clarify the closing of the Lafayette Bank and Trust. While Mary Miller was president of the bank, the Lafayette bank merged with the Louisville bank in December 1914. In early 1915, the banks were seized by state regulators and closed. A grand jury empaneled to investigate the closure stated that both banks "had been in appalling condition for a long time prior to the consolidation or merger, which was entered into on Dec. 12, 1914, but it particularly shows that while the Louisville bank was hopelessly insolvent, the Lafayette Bank and Trust Company was in far worse condition." The grand jury found that the Lafayette bank had defrauded depositors and handed down two indictments for false reporting against Mary Miller, but the indictment was never enforced because the Boulder district attorney never signed the paperwork.
In 1905–06, Mary Miller helped finance and manage a new flour mill, the Lafayette-Louisville Milling & Grain Company. I partners for the new venture included son, James P. Miller, George Bermont, W.A. Burke, William Padfield, John Lipsey, Dr. Horace R. Burns, P.M. Peltier, J.O. Van Debergh and Denver business person E.L. Milner who was the general manager of the mill. The mill was located on a Burlington railroad spur built for the mill in the 800 block of E. Baseline Road, about 200 feet west of today's Lafayette Feed and Grain elevator. W.F. Wehman sold their grist mill to Lafayette-Louisville Milling & Grain Company in June 1905, about nine months before the new mill opened. The Milling & Grain Company flour mill produced its premium brand Silver Tip Flour and operated primarily on electricity provided by the Interurban Power Plant, one of the nation's first distributed power systems built on land that Mary Miller owned at today's Waneka Lake. Mary Miller sponsored a contest to name the premium brand flour in September 1905. The prize was 300 pounds of flour. Company ledgers show that Silver Tip Flour sold for about 12 cents per pound in 1906 and 1907. The Lafayette-Louisville Milling & Grain Company mill closed in the 1920s and burned down in 1935.
Mary Miller paid for the construction of the Congregational Church, which was established in 1890 by John and Annie Jones, Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Van Deren and Laura Kimbark. Mary Miller helped other churches obtain land for their churches and established the first school. They also helped organize local clubs and organizations, like the Order of the Eastern Star. They ran for senator and state treasurer for the Prohibition Party in 1900. They became president of School District No. 43, which later became the Broomfield School District.
Personal life
During their marriage, the Millers had six children. On May 28, 1878, their husband died at age 38 and obituaries attributed their death to "Bright's Disease of the kidneys coupled with derangement of the liver" (derangement being a respectful term used at the time to describe cirrhosis of the liver due to overconsumption of alcohol). After Lafayette's death, Mary ran the ranch. In 1887, their eleven-year-old son, Frank, died due to an illness. Them daughter Amelia died when they were twelve years old. They then had four sons, George, James, Thomas, and Charles. James attended University of Colorado and became an attorney and vice president of the bank. George established Lafayette Supply Company and was a farmer. Thomas became Lafayette's mayor and died in 1902 in a mining accident.
Miller died on November 14, 1921. Rebecca Schwendler, chairperson of the Lafayette Historic Preservation Board states, "It was remarkable what they did at a time when women didn't have very much of a voice... They had a business side and a soft side."  They are buried at Columbia Cemetery in Boulder, Colorado.

Mercedes College is an independent Roman Catholic single-sex secondary day school for girls, located in the Perth central business district, Western Australia.
The school was founded in 1846 by the Sisters of Mercy, thus making it the oldest independent Catholic girls' school in Australia, and the oldest existing secondary school in Perth. There are currently 800 students from Year 7 to Year 12 and the college's brother school is Trinity College. The current principal is Kerrie Fraser.
The name Mercedes comes from the Spanish word for mercy.
History
The school has its beginnings in the landing at the Swan River Colony of Irish Sisters of Mercy. Led by Sister Ursula Frayne, they founded the first Catholic school in the colony on 2 February 1846 beginning their teaching with just one pupil. Classes were conducted in a rented St Georges Terrace cottage, near Victoria Avenue. By the end of the first day's teaching, the numbers had swelled to six students. Enrolment grew to 100 by the end of 1846, by which time the school had moved to permanent accommodation at Victoria Square.
The first Mercy Convent in Australia was constructed in 1847 on the Victoria Square site, and remains in use today, known as "Holy Cross Convent".
Two separate schools were run from the Victoria Square site. The original was known as St Joseph's School, and was a free, co-educational school. The other school run from the site was Ladies' College, opened in 1896, which did charge for tuition. It was later renamed Our Lady's College. The two schools amalgamated in 1967 to form Mercedes College. The last of the school's boarding students left in 1981.
Over the years, the number of Sisters of Mercy at the site has dwindled, with the last Mercy Sister Principal of Mercedes, Sister Assisium Wright, retiring in 1996.

Would It Kill You To Stop Doing That? is a 2012 non-fiction book by the American humorist Henry Alford that details manners from around the world.
After being interested in a quote by Edmund Burke about how important manners are, Alford traveled around the world researching manners. They also interview people such as etiquette authority Judith Martin.
Reception
Jincy Willet of The New York Times said that the book "amuses as much as it informs". Sarah Halzack of The Washington Post called the book "a bit haphazard" although "his self-effacing tone and dry sense of humor help to unify the pieces". Philip Marchand of National Post said that "sometimes their humour is a bit strained" although their advice can be "very practical".

George Jones was an American country music singer-songwriter who has been widely regarded as "The Greatest Country Music Singer," and an extremely influential one. Their voice has become iconic to country, as they inspired artists like Ricky Van Shelton, Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, and even other artists like Gram Parsons and Bob Dylan.
George Jones' first releases were made in 1954; they started off as a 22-year-old honky-tonk Hank Williams imitator who couldn't find their own image. It wasn't until the early-mid 1960s that their voice matured into their very own, and they released multiple No. 1 hits. During the 1960s, they were one of the busiest recording artists in country music. By the late-1970s Jones became addicted to cocaine, in addition to their excessive drinking, and the combination of the drugs and excessive alcohol took its toll and contributed to missing concerts and tours often. Also, according to Jones' 1996 autobiography, shady concert promoters in the late '70s and early '80s would deliberately book the singer in multiple places on the same night...knowing they wouldn't be there. Their commercial career was revitalized in the spring of 1980 after they released their most famous classic: "He Stopped Loving Them Today." The song resumed Jones' success just as they had gotten clean of their near-fatal cocaine addiction. They met their future wife, Nancy, in 1981 and they married in early 1983. They single handedly took control of their new husband's resurgent career and they became their manager. Anyone in the music industry that wanted contact with George Jones now had to go through their wife. Jones' career flourished throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s. Country radio turned their back on the singer by the early 1990s but they continued making records and touring all over the country and Canada. Since the release of "He Stopped Loving Them Today", which has been titled as The Greatest Country Song, Jones has become a beloved figure in music. When they died in April 2013, they had charted more songs than any other country music artist.
The following is a chronicle of singles released by George Jones. The releases cover their first to last releases from 1954 and on:

Thumper Jones
Because of the heat Starday Records was feeling from the current mainstream popularity of rock n' roll in 1956, Jones was requested to do a rock n' roll slide himself. Hesitantly, they agreed to record the songs and release them under the name 'Thumper Jones'. They later regretted ever cutting the songs and tried to buy all of the copies they could so that it wouldn't surface again, however, unsuccessfully.
