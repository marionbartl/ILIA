Saint-Ambroise Church () is a church in the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is situated on Beaubien Street, between de La Roche Street et de Normanville Street.
Architecture
Saint-Ambroise Church was built between 1924 and 1925. It is part of an architectural ensemble that also includes the presbytery and École Anthelme-Verreau. All three buildings were designed by Montreal architect Ernest Cormier. Also located nearby is École Saint-Ambroise which was designed by Jean-Omer Marchand.
Saint-Ambroise Church was one of the first major works by Ernest Cormier. The Church's architecture was inspired by the Pre-Roman architecture of Northern Italy, notably for the layout and the simple form of the ensemble. The belltower is reminiscent of St Mark's Campanile in Venice. The facade and the walls of the church are covered in brown brick.

Art
In the tympanum above the door there is an icon representing St. Ambrose of Milan dressed as a bishop with the pastoral staff and pen to write. An angel inspires with the breath in their ear what they have to write.
To understand this representation, we must know that St. Ambrose was born in Trier around 340 and died in 397, Bishop of Milan from 374 to 397, is one of the Fathers of the Latin Church. It was said of St. Ambrose it was more a theologian than a catechist, because everyone can understand what they wrote.
It is known as a writer and poet. They have written to protect the Church. It is one of the protagonists of debates against Arianism. It is to them that Augustine of Hippo converted to Christianity.
 They are honored as a saint by the Catholic Church and celebrated on the December 7.

Triple fff Brewery is a small independent brewer of real ale based in Four Marks, Hampshire, England, founded in September 1997. They produce award winning beers of styles including bitters, milds and stouts. They own three pubs, the Railway Arms in Alton, The White Lion in Aldershot and The Artillery Arms in Portsmouth.
Triple fff was launched by Graham Trott, and their partner Frank. They installed a five barrel plant in one of the units vacated by the now closed Magpie Furniture factory on Station Approach in the village of Four Marks. Graham (a skilled cabinetmaker by trade) started their career at Magpie Furniture and once the company closed down, they saw an opportunity to turn their hobby into a profession.
Graham and Frank took a musical theme for their brewery. Naming it Triple fff which stands for fortississimo and means "very very loud". Franks share of the business was bought out after a few years by Graham.
The beer names came from song titles of 1960's rock icons, Van Morrison, Led Zeppelin and Cream with Moondance (4.2%ABV), Stairway (4.6%ABV) and Pressed Rat and Warthog (3.8%ABV). Other beer names brewed by Triple fff include Midnight Rambler, Hunky Dory and Comfortably Numb.
The year 2000 saw an expansion into an 18 Barrel plant and in 2006 the brewery became a 50 Barrel system brewing over 31,000 pints a week and opened their onsite shop. In November 2017 the brewery launched their onsite bar.
The brewery produces real ale and has won over 50 awards, including overall Champion Beer of Britain at the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Great British Beer Festival.
Their beers include:
Moondance - one of their original beers and champion Best Bitter of Britain 2002 when it also won the bronze award in the overall competition. In 2006 it won silver in the Best Bitter category.
Alton's Pride - a golden brown session bitter which gained the bronze award in the Bitter category at Olympia in 2003 and 2004 and the overall Champion Beer of Britain award in 2008.
Pressed Rat and Warthog - champion Mild of Britain 2002
Stairway - a pale brown ale
Little Red Rooster - a rich, dark beer from a combination of pale and dark malts
Triple fff also produce a beer from a recipe by Gilbert White, the famous naturalist born in 1720 in nearby Selborne. The recipe uses hops and smoked barley.

An infrared gas analyzer measures trace gases by determining the absorption of an emitted infrared light source through a certain air sample. Trace gases found in the Earth's atmosphere become excited under specific wavelengths found in the infrared range. The concept behind the technology can be understood as testing how much of the light is absorbed by the air. Different molecules in the air absorb different frequencies of light. Air with much of a certain gas will absorb more of a certain frequency, allowing the sensor to report a high concentration of the corresponding molecule.
Infrared gas analyzers usually have two chambers, one is a reference chamber while the other chamber is a measurement chamber. Infrared light is emitted from some type of source on one end of the chamber, passes through a series of chambers that contains given quantities of the various gases in question.
Principles of Operation
The design from 1975 (pictured above) is a Nondispersive infrared sensor. It is the first improved analyzer that is able to detect more than one component of a sample gas at one time. Earlier analyzers were held back by the fact that a particular gas also has lower absorption bands in the infra red
The invention of 1975 has as many detectors as the number of gases to be measured. Each detector has two chambers which both have an optically aligned infrared source and detector, and are both filled with one of the gases in the sample of air to be analyzed. Lying in the optical path are two cells with transparent ends. One contains a reference gas and one will contain the gas to be analyzed. Between the infrared source and the cells is a modulator which interrupts the beams of energy.
The output from each detector is combined with the output from any other detector which is measuring a signal opposite to the principal signal of each detector. The amount of signal from other detectors is the amount that will offset the proportion of the total signal that corresponds to the interference. This interference is from gases with a principal lower absorption band that is the same as the principal band of the gas being measured.
For instance, if the analyzer is to measure carbon monoxide and dioxide, the chambers must contain a certain amount of these gases. The infrared light is emitted and passes through the sample gas, a reference gas with a known mixture of the gases in question and then through the "detector" chambers containing the pure forms of the gases in question. When a "detector" chamber absorbs some of the infrared radiation, it heats up and expands. This causes a rise in pressure within the sealed vessel that can be detected either with a pressure transducer or with a similar device. The combination of output voltages from the detector chambers from the sample gas can then be compared to the output voltages from the reference chamber.
The latest Infrared Gas Analyzers
Like earlier infrared gas analyzers, modern analyzers also use nondispersive infrared technology to detect a certain gas by detecting the absorption of infrared wavelengths that is characteristic of that gas. Infrared energy is emitted from a heated filament. By optically filtering the energy, the radiation spectrum is limited to the absorption band of the gas being measured. A detector measures the energy after the infrared energy has passed through the gas to be measured. This is compared to the energy at reference condition of no absorption.
Many analyzers are wall-mounted devices intended for long-term, unattended gas monitoring. There are now analysers that measure a range of gases and are highly portable to be suitable for a wider range of geoscience applications. Fast response high-precision analyzers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using eddy covariance method when used together with fast-response sonic anemometer.
In some analyzers, the reliability of measurements is enhanced by calibrating the analyzer at the reference condition and a known span concentration. If the air would interfere with measurements, the chamber that houses the energy source is filled with a gas that has no detectable concentration of the gas being measured. Depending on the gas being measured, fresh air, chemically stripped air or nitrogen may be used.

The Jamestown Polish craftsmen's strike of 1619 took place in the settlement of Jamestown in the Virginia colony. It was the first documented strike in North America. Skilled craftsmen were sent by the Virginia Company to Jamestown to produce pitch, tar, and turpentine used for shipbuilding. When the colony held its first election in 1619, many settlers were not allowed to vote on the grounds that they were not of English descent, and they went on strike. Due to the importance of the skilled workers in producing valuable naval stores for the colony, company leaders bowed to labor pressure and gave full voting rights to continental workers.
History
John Smith first encountered and was impressed with the talents of Polish craftsmen when they traveled through Poland in 1602, fleeing the Turks who had enslaved him. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was then the largest kingdom of Europe, covering the present territory of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Russia.
Early in Jamestown's history, Smith and the Virginia Company began recruiting workers from mainland Europe to come to their new colony. The first of these foreign workers came with the second group of settlers who arrived in the colony in 1608; two of these workers would later save Smith's life in an attack by Native Americans as noted in Smith's writings. Contemporary historical accounts refer to this first group of foreign craftsmen as Dutchmen and Poles.
The foreign craftsmen began producing glassware, pitch, and potash soon after their arrival in 1608. These goods were used in the colony, but were also important as they were the first goods exported from the colony to Europe. Later more skilled workers arrived and continued to produce tar, resin, and turpentine, and clapboard and frankincense as well.
When the first elections in the colony were held in 1619, the colony did not allow any continental settlers to vote, including approximately 50 Polish craftsmen and their families. They were denied the right to vote on the grounds that they were not of English descent. The craftsmen in response, refused to work unless they were given the right to vote. Under this labor pressure, the Virginia Company's Council reversed the decision to disenfranchise the craftsmen, and simultaneously struck an agreement with the craftsmen to apprentice young men from the colony. The company leaders feared not only the loss of income and labor, but that the colony might gain a reputation for not being welcoming to further settlers not of English descent, especially skilled craftsmen.

Elhanan Tannenbaum, (, born 12 August 1946) was an Israeli colonel, business person and drug dealer, who was kidnapped in 2000 and held for more than three years by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. They were released in a prisoner exchange, together with the bodies of several Israeli soldiers, for 435 Arab prisoners held by Israel.
Early life
Elhanan Tannenbaum was born in Poland, the son of Holocaust survivors. Most of their relatives had been killed in the Holocaust. In 1949, Tannenbaum and their parents and sister immigrated to Israel and moved to Holon, where Tannenbaum grew up and attended high school. They were also active in the local scouts movement.
At the age of 18, Tannenbaum enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, studying economics and political science. They began their compulsory military service in the Israel Defense Forces during their academic studies, and served in the Artillery Corps between 1965 and 1968. After graduating, they completed their active military service as an officer. They then studied business administration at Tel Aviv University. After their discharge from active service, they served as a reservist officer in the IDF Artillery Corps. Tannenbaum saw action in the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition, and the Yom Kippur War. They eventually reached the rank of Colonel in the Artillery Corps reserves.
Capture
In 2000, Tannenbaum, who was in debt due to gambling and business failures, was approached by their childhood friend Kais Obeid, an Israeli-Arab, who was working for Hezbollah, and who had previously been tried by an IDF military court in the Gaza Strip for a planned operation to abduct an Israeli in Gaza and taking them to Lebanon by boat. Obeid, along with Lebanese Hezbollah operative Kaid Biro, was planning to abduct Tannenbaum in Dubai and take them to Lebanon for Hezbollah to use as a bargaining chip. Obeid offered Tannenbaum a part in an alleged lucrative drug-dealing operation. Tannenbaum was told they would have to fly to Dubai, and their role would be to consult Obeid on how to smuggle drugs into Israel.
In December 2006, Tannenbaum admitted to having knowingly gone to Dubai in 2000 to complete a drug deal, and said that they had expected to make $200,000 (€152,000) on the deal.
On the night of October 3, 2000, Tannenbaum flew to Brussels, where they met Obeid and Biro, who gave them a forged Venezuelan passport. From there, they caught a flight to Frankfurt, and boarded a Gulf Air flight to Dubai. They were met there by a man holding a sign with their name, who took them to a limousine. Tannenbaum claimed that they were then driven to an affluent neighborhood in Dubai, where they were attacked by two or three individuals and blacked out after being beaten with a club. Tannenbaum was then flown to Lebanon on a private plane.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared on 16 October 2000 on al-Manar TV station: "We have an Israeli colonel in our hands". Israel was initially unsure who that person might be, until Nasrallah confirmed it was Tannenbaum a few days later. According to Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, Tannenbaum held an important position in the IDF Northern Command, doing 150 days of reserve duty a year, and was privy to many important military secrets. Bergman wrote that only five days before Tannenbaum's abduction, they were on reserve duty at the Northern Command bunker in Safed overseeing a sensitive exercise: a simulation of a full-scale war with Hezbollah and Syria. Tannenbaum could have exposed the details of Israel's war plans to Hezbollah. Israel therefore decided to try to get them back as quickly as possible.
Following the abduction operation, Obeid moved to Lebanon to avoid prosecution in Israel, and is considered a wanted fugitive by the Israeli government.
Prisoner exchange
Tannenbaum was released in January 2004 as part of a prisoner swap with Hezbollah. The swap, mediated by Germany, resulted in the exchange of 435 prisoners held by Israel in return for Tannenbaum's release and the return of the bodies of three soldiers killed during an ambush along the Israeli-Lebanese border. Among the 435 people released were Mustafa Dirani and Abdel Karim Obeid. These two individuals were kidnapped, in 1994 and 1989 respectively, for use as bargaining chips in the effort to secure the release of the most famous of the Israeli MIAs, Ron Arad. Fearing the release of these men would end any hope of finding Arad, their family attempted to take legal action to prevent their release. Nothing came of this effort.
While campaigning against the proposed Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange Mossad Chief Meir Dagan in 2011 claimed that 231 Israelis were killed by terrorists freed in the Tannenbaum exchange deal.
Later life
Following their release and arrival in Israel, Tannenbaum was arrested for their illegal actions that led up to their capture. They agreed to a plea bargain and admitted to the reasons behind their travel to Dubai and described the details of their capture. In exchange, they were not charged with any crime and served no prison time.
Tannenbaum continued to be heavily in debt from their past dealings, owing payment to the National Insurance Institute, mortgage debts, compensation for bad checks, as well as other debts along with monthly alimony to their ex-wife. In 2005, they were arrested and detained for 10 days after failing to pay alimony. They told the court that at the time, they had no source of income and was living in their sister's home. In October 2006, they began studying law, and in 2008 was working as a taxi driver. In 2010, they were arrested for failing to pay debts totaling some NIS 2 million ($550,000). While in court, they claimed that they had recently completed their law studies and was about to begin an internship.
Personal life
Tannenbaum married in 1971, and had a son, Ori, and a daughter, Keren. Tannenbaum later divorced theirs wife.

Cabanis's wren (Cantorchilus modestus) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is found in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua.
Taxonomy and systematics
Cabanis's wren, with what are now the canebrake wren (C. zeledoni) and the isthmian wren (C. elutus), were called the plain wren. The three were split from each other in 2016 on the basis of a 2015 publication that described their different vocalizations and genetic divergence. Cabanis's wren is monotypic according to the International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and the Clements taxonomy. However, BirdLife International (BLI) retains C. modestus as "plain wren" with elutus as a subspecies of it rather than as a full species.
Description
Cabanis's wren is long. Two males weighed and two females . Adults have a dark gray-brown crown, a rufous-brown back, an orange-rufous rump, and a rufescent brown tail with narrow darker bars. They have a white supercilium, a gray-brown stripe behind the eye, and cheeks mottled gray-brown and gray-white. Their throat is white, the chest pale grayish buff, and the belly buffy white between orange-buff flanks. Individuals in the far northern part of the species' range tend to be darker and less rufous on the back. Immatures are a duller version of the adult.
Distribution and habitat
Cabanis's wren is found from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas south through Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to the Pacific side of central Costa Rica. It inhabits both dry and humid areas, occurring in a variety of surroundings including forest edges, second growth, and gardens. In elevation it ranges from sea level to approximately .
Behavior
Feeding
Cabanis's wren usually forages in pairs in low dense vegetation, though it occasionally will hunt higher in trees. Its diet is mostly insects and spiders.
Breeding
The nest of Cabanis's wren is roughly football-shaped with an entance hole on the side. It is constructed of grass and other vegetable fibers, lined with softer material, and placed in dense vegetation within of the ground. The usual clutch size is two though clutches of three eggs are known.
Vocalization
The song of Cabanis's wren is "a loud motif of 3–4 clear whistles" . Its calls include a "harsh chur and a "rippling, tinkling chi-cho-chi" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed Cabanis's wren as being of The Least concern. It is common to abundant and does well in human-modified landscapes.

Robert E. Kowalski (1942–2007) was a noted American medical journalist and best-selling author.
Kowalski came to national prominence in 1987 with the publication of their New York Times best-selling book - On the list for a record-breaking 115 weeks - "The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure". An updated and revised - "The NEW 8-Week Cholesterol Cure" was published in 2002/2003. Kowalski also wrote "The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook", "Cholesterol & Children", "8 Steps to a Healthy Heart (a guide to recovery from heart attack and bypass surgery)", "The Type II Diabetes Diet Book", and "The Blood Pressure Cure: 8 Weeks to Lower Blood Pressure Without Prescription Drugs".
Kowalski was 35 when they suffered a major heart attack and multiple-bypass surgery. They had inherited the tendency for heart disease from their father, who died too young several years before. At that time, surgery was considered the only solution. Within six years, Kowalski was back on the operating table for another set of bypasses, following yet another major heart attack.
They used their medical and journalist training to find the solution to saving their own life. The result was a heart-health program which they practiced and popularized in their books, centered on megavitamin doses of niacin and lifestyle changes. They were a pioneer advocate for quitting smoking, reducing saturated fat and cholesterol, increasing moderate exercise, and adding oat bran and fish oil to a heart-healthy diet.
Kowalski received their education at Iowa State University, where they were a dual major in biology-chemistry. They received their bachelor's in journalism, then a master's in journalism and physiology. They also completed the course work for a doctorate in physiology at Iowa State but did not finish their dissertation for the degree.
Kowalski died November 9, 2007, in Southern California at the age of 65 from a pulmonary embolism.

Georgios Konstantinides (b. Trebizond, 1878 - d. Alexandria, 1919, nom de plume Skliros, , «Σκληρός») was an early Greek socialist, who published realist writing on the common reality of their time on the basis of the class structure of society and in order to analyse Greek society with Marxist tools, provoking discussions and struggles among the progressive circles of the day.
Biography
Skleros was born to a middle-class family of Trebizond in Ottoman Pontus, and took a typical education and cosmopolitan outlook for the city and its Greek quarter of that age, and in their younger years travelled to Odessa in Russia to work as a merchant. Later they left for Moscow, where they engaged in medical studies, in 1904, at the University of Moscow. The following year they got involved in the revolutionary movement, under the influence of Georgi Plekhanov, taking up the pseudonym of "Skliros" ("Severe"). A series of problems with the Tzarist establishment drove them to Estonia and then to Jena in Germany. There, as representative of Marxist theory they met with Dimitris Glinos in the "Filiki Prodevtiki Enosi" ("Friendly Progressive Unity"), a student society oriented in a socialist direction.
Skleros then moved to and lived in Alexandria, where they died in 1919.

Colonia Catriel, or simply Catriel, is a town in the northern tip of the province of Río Negro, Argentina, near the border with La Pampa Province. It has a population of about 18,000, with postal code 8307 and telephone prefix 0299.
Catriel was named after Cacique Catriel, a Native American who according to several stories participated in the defence of Argentine government interests against aborigines.
The town has a dry and temperate climate, with hot summers and winters which barely see snow. A characteristic dry strong wind is also common.
The main economic activity in and around the town is oil extraction, which started in 1959 and made the city grow fast, as state owned YPF set extraction points nearby. However, nowadays the main oil company in the city is Petrobras, which has made several investments in the city.
Transport
The town is served by the Colonia Catriel Airport .

The Red River Exhibition (or "The Ex" for short and historically as Manisphere) is a ten-day festival hosted every summer, in June, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The event takes place at Exhibition Park and features a midway, concerts, stage shows, and agricultural exhibits. The park is operated by the Red River Exhibition Association, a not-for-profit organization. Winnipeg's The Guess Who played there in 2015, and the Crash Test Dummies played there in 1992.
The Ex was started in 1952 at the Osborne Stadium complex near the Manitoba Legislative Building. It later moved to the Polo Park Race Track and then to the Winnipeg Stadium, Winnipeg Arena, and Winnipeg Velodrome facilities.
In 1997, it moved to its present location. The total amount of land owned at the western edge of Winnipeg . Red River Exhibition Park was built as a multi-purpose facility on only 90 of those acres leaving almost for future growth and expansion.
The annual fair continues to grow despite the fact its arrival is frequently accompanied by significant amounts of rain, (seven days out of ten in 2014). The record for attendance at the Ex is 223,183 paid visitors, set in 2011.

Javier "El Tigre de Villarubia" Hernandez (born 2 November 1989 in Spain) is a Spanish lightweight kickboxer currently fighting out of Tiger Team.  They are a former I.S.K.A. inter-continental champion and former It's Showtime 61MAX champion.
As of November 2012, Hernandez is ranked the #7 lightweight in the world by LiverKick.com.
Career/Biography
Growing up fighting on the Spanish scene Javier had a decent amateur record winning the national title in 2008 and winning a bronze and silver medal in Full-Contact and K-1 rules at the W.P.K.A. world championships, held at the end of the year. They also had a number of professional fights that year, culminating by winning the Iberian pro belt. In 2009 Javier won their first professional international title by becoming the I.S.K.A. inter-continental champion.
These victories still left Javier virtually unheard of outside of Spain and this was echoed when they were announced as the challenger to 61MAX world champion Karim Bennoui for the first ever It's Showtime event to be held in Spain in June, 2011. Bennoui had looked great in beating the previous champion Sergio Wielzen a few months' previously and many fancied them against the underdog Hernandez. Javier proved everyone wrong in what was arguably the most exciting world title fight ever held by It's Showtime, surviving a second round knockdown to come back with a knockdown of their own to take a unanimous decision victory after five rounds and become the new champion.
They lost to Yuki by KO due to lowkicks in round two at RISE 90 in Tokyo, Japan on October 25, 2012.
They beat Mickael Peynaud by decision at Heroes IV in Cordoba, Spain on November 17, 2012.

"Wildflower" is a song by Japanese musical act Superfly. Used as the theme song for the drama Gold, it was released as a single on September 1, 2010. The single release was packaged as "Wildflower" & Cover Songs: Complete Best 'Track 3', a four-song extended play featuring a cover album as a bonus disc.
Background and development
In September 2009, Superfly released the act's second studio album Box Emotions, their second release in a row to reach number one on Oricon's album chart. This was followed by a single, "Dancing on the Fire", Superfly's second upbeat dance song to be used in commercials for Canon's Digital IXUS range of cameras.
On June 18, Superfly released the song "Tamashii Revolution", a song used as the theme song of the NHK broadcast of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, played during relay clips and highlight shows. It became one of Superfly's biggest commercial successes, eventually becoming certified platinum twice by the RIAJ.
"Wildflower" was first announced as being the theme song for the drama Gold on June 15. It was the second drama starring Yūki Amami, after "My Best of My Life" was used for Boss in 2009. Ochi wrote the lyrics for the song after reading the script for the drama, and was inspired by the stoic story-line and language. Ochi wrote the song about wildflowers, wanting to create a song that reflected the feeling of wanting to live earnestly and strongly.
The single's jacket features vocalist Shiho Ochi holding a different object representing each song on the single: a dahlia flower for "Wildflower", a djembe drum for "Tamashii Revolution", a globe for "Free Planet" and on the back cover a rainbow for "Roll Over the Rainbow".
Promotion and release
"Wildflower" was the leading track of a four song single, commemorating Superfly's 10th single since their debut in 2007. Each song featured a different style of rock, and a different commercial tie-up. The single came packaged with Cover Songs: Best 'Track 3''', a compilation album compiling Superfly's English language cover songs that were featured on the B-sides of their singles, as well as three new recordings. One of the new recordings was a cover of Elvin Bishop's 1976 song "Fooled Around and Fell in Love", which was used in the drama Gold as an incidental song, alongside "Wildflower". A limited edition version of the set featured a bonus 8cm single, featuring an acoustic version of "Fooled Around and Fell in Love".
On September 15, Wildflower & Cover Songs: Complete Best 'Track 3' was released as an iTunes LP, the first such download released by a Japanese artist.
Superfly performed "Wildflower" at Music Japan on July 18, followed by performances at Bokura no Ongaku on August 27 and Music Station on September 3.
Music video
A music video was released for the song, directed by Shuichi Banba. It features scenes of Ochi in a Western-style prairie, standing in wooden farming structures and next to a windpump. The music video also features an old man dressed in Western clothing, and a little girl who resembles Ochi. Many scenes depict the old man next to the little girl, who is replaced by the fully-grown Ochi. The man gives some seeds to the little girl, who plants them. In the final scenes of the video, one of the seeds sprout into a red wildflower.
Critical reception
Hirokazu Koike of Rockin' On Japan praised the song developing from its minor chord progression into a bold chorus. They were deeply impressed by the song's ability to make you feel a sense of a tough life force. CDJournal reviewers described "Wildflower" as a "medium" rock song, that was simple and driven with strong vocals. They praised the song's subtle guitar riff introduction which lead into a firmly charming song, as well as the "international atmosphere" caused by the mandolin accents. They felt that the song had strong imagery of a flower rooted firmly in desolate earth, caused by the song's strong sound and heart-resonating vocals.

Hypselodoris obscura is a species of colourful sea slug or dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae. It is the type species of the genus Hypselodoris.
This species eats sponges.
Distribution
This nudibranch was described from Port Jackson, Australia. It is a warm temperate species only found in Southeastern Australia. It is related to the widespread tropical species Hypselodoris infucata and the similar Australian species Hypselodoris saintvincentia.
Description
Hypselodoris obscura has a mottled appearance due to a grey or grey-blue background colour with yellow and black spots, which vary considerably in size between individuals. There is a paler stripe down the midline. The edge of the mantle is pale blue alternating with yellow. The gills and rhinophores are bright red.

Causey Pike is a fell in the English Lake District. It is situated in the Newlands Valley, 5 km south-west of the town of Keswick. Even though it has a modest height of 637 metres (2,090 ft) it is one of the most distinctive fells when viewed from the Derwent Water and Keswick area due to its distinguishing summit "knobble" which catches the eye. The fell is one of 214 fells described by Alfred Wainwright in their series of Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells: Causey Pike features in Book Six, The North Western Fells.
Topography
The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north–south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Causey Pike. The highest ground in the North Western Fells is an east–west ridge in this central sector, beginning with Grasmoor above Crummock Water and then gradually descending eastwards over Crag Hill, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike.
Causey Pike is separated from Barrow and Outerside to the north by Stonycroft Gill. Southward across Rigg Beck is Ard Crags. Causey Pike has a long blunt-ended shoulder running eastward to the Newlands Valley, dropping steeply from its terminus at Rowling End.
Geology
The entire hill is formed from Ordovician-age rocks assigned to the Skiddaw Group. The summit ridge and northern slopes are composed of the laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirkstile Formation, whilst the summit knobble and southern slopes are formed from the Buttermere Formation, an olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. The eastern spur and Rowling End reveal the large olistoliths of greywacke sandstone of the Robinson Member, a sub-unit of the Buttermere Formation.
Ascents
The direct ascent of the fell is usually started from the Newlands valley at Stonycroft where there is some car parking space; this route is steep at the beginning and the end with an easier section in the middle, the final 20 metres of ascent being a rocky scramble. An easier and longer alternative from the same starting point goes by an old track which used to serve the cobalt mine on the slopes of Scar Crags, this approaches the fell "from the back" reaching Sail Pass and then crossing the summit of Scar Crags before attaining Causey Pike. The fell is also part of the horseshoe walk known as the Coledale Round which is usually started at the village of Braithwaite just west of Keswick (but can also be started in the Newlands Valley) and includes the additional fells of Grisedale Pike, Hopegill Head, Grasmoor, Eel Crag, Sail and Scar Crags. It is a strenuous 11-mile (18-km) ridge walk with over 4000 feet (1200 m) of ascent.
Summit
The summit of the fell is unique: it is a narrow ridge with the highest point being on the "knobble" but with four other smaller bumps of almost equal height further on. The scree slopes around the summit have yielded some fossils: trilobites, trace fossils and graptolites are found on rare occasions. The view from the summit is extensive with Derwentwater, the Newlands valley, Skiddaw, Blencathra and the Helvellyn range seen very well.
Fell race
There is an annual Causey Pike fell race which takes place in March; it starts and finishes in the Newlands Valley and has a distance of 4.5 miles (7 km) with 542 metres (1780 ft) of climbing. The 2005 race was won in a time of 32 minutes 51 seconds.

Donn mac Cumasgach was a king of Maigh Seóla who died in 752.
They may be the earliest recorded ruler of Maigh Seóla, as they are referred to as King of the Uí Briúin of the South in the annals' obit. In the Leabhar na nGenealach, they are stated to be the great-grandson of Cenn Fáelad mac Colgan and the father of Coscrach Mór, the eponym of the Clann Cosgraigh. The Annals of Ulster place their killing sub anno 757, but do not name their killer.
The king-list of Maigh Seóla is difficult to reassemble due to its royal line's sporadic annalistic appearances. However, Connmhach Mór mac Coscraigh—apparently Donn's grandson through the Coscrach Mór mac Duinn in the Leabhar na nGenealach line—is the next king of the region mentioned in the annals. Connmhach appears as the victor at the Battle of Drung in 836 and in their obit is described as "King of Uí Briúin", though they were themselves also king of Hy Briuin Seola.

PC Music is a record label and art collective based in London and run by producer A. G. Cook. It was founded in 2013, making its music available on SoundCloud that year. Artists on its roster have included Hannah Diamond, GFOTY, Danny L Harle, EASYFUN, Namasenda, and Planet 1999. The label's releases have been showcased on the compilations PC Music Volume 1 (2015), Volume 2 (2016), and Volume 3 (2022).
The label is known for its surreal or exaggerated take on pop music tropes from the 1990s and 2000s, often featuring pitch-shifted, feminine vocals and bright, synthetic textures. PC Music has been characterized as embracing the aesthetics of advertising, consumerism, and corporate branding. Its artists often present devised personas inspired by cyberculture. The label has inspired both praise and criticism from journalists, and has been called "polarizing".
Background
The label functions as a collective in which acts frequently collaborate with each other. Many of the acts are aliases, obscuring the identities and number of artists on the label. Early on, the label kept tight control over its branding and limited its interaction with journalists, and as its profile grew, Cook declined to engage with press, described as a sort of Berry Gordy figure within the group. Vice magazine said that PC Music's acts are best understood not as living people but as "meticulously planned and considered long-running art pieces…living installations who put out music." Cook mentioned preference for "recording people who don't normally make music and treating them as if they're a major label artist." Rather than engaging in extended promotional campaigns, the label continually announces new acts. Each develops a persona that is conveyed through Internet slang and cartoon imagery.
History
Cook had previously worked on Gamsonite, a "pseudo-label" and blog collecting their early collaborations, among other projects while studying music at Goldsmiths, University of London. They founded PC Music in August 2013, as a way of embracing an A&R role. Within a year the label had published 40 songs on SoundCloud where, as of September 2014, some of its songs had accumulated over 100,000 listens. It had not released a physical single, and its first paid download did not come until the November 2014 release of Hannah Diamond's "Every Night". QT's "Hey QT" single was also released in 2014, on XL Recordings, with production from Cook and PC Music-affiliate Sophie.
In March 2014, the label made their live debut in the United States when Cook, Sophie and QT performed at Hype Machine's Hype Hotel during South by Southwest. The following year, in March 2015, several members of the collective appeared at a label showcase at South by Southwest. Cook described it as a "rebirth moment" for the group, moving toward functioning as a real record label. Shortly after, they released their first official compilation album, titled PC Music Volume 1. On 8 May 2015, PC Music artists performed at BRIC House in Brooklyn, New York as part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival, to premiere Pop Cube, "a multimedia reality network".
On 21 October 2015, the label announced on Facebook a partnership with major record label Columbia Records. The first release through this partnership was an EP from Danny L Harle. In December 2015 PC Music released the single "Only You", a collaboration between A. G. Cook and the Chinese pop star Chris Lee, with a music video directed by Kinga Burza.
On 18 November 2016, PC Music released PC Music Volume 2, a compilation featuring most of the label's roster. A review in The Guardian praised it for being "more beautiful and progressive than ever before" and proof that "Cook and their gang are the cleverest, most thoughtful people in British pop".
On 16 February 2018, PC Music released a limited dual-vinyl compilation of both PC Music Volumes 1 and 2 and in December 2018, PC Music announced new vinyl and CD reissues of PC Music Volumes 1 and 2, as well as the first physical release of the label's Month of Mayhem compilation. GFOTY also announced their departure from the label at this time. They have since signed with a new label, Pretty Wavvy.
Sound and influences
The label has released music with a consistent sound that Clive Martin, writing for Vice, described as "A playful composite of disregarded sounds and genres". Lanre Bakare, writing for The Guardian, identified the music's elements as "the huge synth blasts favoured by Eurodance chart-botherers such as Cascada, grime's sub-bass, and happy hardcore's high-pitched vocal range". The styles and influences of music incorporated include bubblegum dance, Balearic trance, wonky and electro house. Cook cites Korean & Japanese pop music and gyaru culture, as well as the production work of Max Martin and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Their production involves layering discordant sounds on top of each other to produce chaotic mixes, similar to the techniques used in black MIDI music. Abrupt shifts in timbre and rhythm are used to create multiple perspectives of a personality. Cook also indirectly cites American musician Conlon Nancarrow as a source of inspiration in the PC Music Pop Cube Trailer 1.
PC Music's songwriting often deals with consumerism as a theme. In their take on haul videos, Lipgloss Twins include references to fashion and makeup brands. Vocals on the label's mix for DIS Magazine reflect various forms of marketing: producer ID tags, film trailers, and product placement for a sponsor. The label brings in inexperienced singers to record its songs. It thoroughly processes the vocals, shifting the pitch upward or chopping it to use as a rhythmic element. These distortions create a post-ironic representation of consumerism, money, and sex.
PC Music's aesthetic combines elements of cuteness, camp, and kawaii, though often, as music critic Maurice Marion points out for Rare Candy, with a sinister, Lynchian undertone achieved by dissonant inversions and caustic harmonization. Critics likened the label to Ryan Trecartin in its irregular pacing, "feminine appropriation", and valley girl slang. In a piece for Vice, Ryan Bassil suggested that PC Music's style allows for a more candid expression of emotions.
PC Music has been described as less "macho" take on the "house revival" , bringing "playfulness and femininity" to dance music subculture. The availability of music software has allowed for the spread of high-production dance music by independent musicians, particularly on SoundCloud. PC Music often exaggerates the homogenised, high-fidelity aesthetics of these songs. Vogue deputy editor Alex Frank commented that the overt manipulation of cultural references showcased a cynical sense of humour, creating an insular approach to making dance music during a period of house revival.
In the late 2010s, the term "hyperpop" began to be used as a microgenre referring to music associated with the PC Music label and the artists it influenced.
Reception
As PC Music became more prominent in 2014, the reaction to it was often described as "divisive". Joe Moynihan, writing in Fact, remarked that "PC Music have, in just over a year, released some of the most compelling pop music in recent memory." Some critics have found its high-tempo trance sound artless or aggravating.
PC Music received accolades in several 2014 year-end summaries. Dazed included A. G. Cook at number 12 in their "Dazed 100"; Fact named PC Music the best label of 2014; The Huffington Post included PC Music at number 3 in their "Underrated Albums - 2014"; Resident Advisor included PC Music at number 4 in their "Top Labels of The Year" in 2014; and Tiny Mix Tapes included it in their "Favorite 15 Labels of 2014". Spin magazine named PC Music its "Trend of the Year" for 2014. In 2021, The Forty-Five named several PC Music artists – including A.G. Cook, umru and Hannah Diamond – in their list of the best hyperpop songs of all time.
Live shows
PC Music have produced a number of label focused showcases since their inception. After a brief showcase at SXSW in 2015, on 8 May 2015, PC Music launched a "multimedia reality network" called 'Pop Cube'. An event in conjunction with the network was created and became part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival in New York, which quickly sold out. In May 2016, PC Music presented 'Pop Cosmos' at the Scala in London, featuring Danny L Harle, Hannah Diamond, GFOTY, A. G. Cook, Felicita, Easyfun and Spinee. In July 2016 PC Music held a new one-off event called 'Pop City' at Create in Los Angeles. As well as scheduled performances from PC Music performers, the show featured guests, including Carly Rae Jepsen, Charli XCX, and QT. On the 405 webzine, PC Music's live shows have been described as being surrounded by a care-less authentic aura and have been recognised for their "forward-thinking fearlessness to push pop music into new and daring areas".

St. Adalbert Parish - designated for Polish immigrants in Enfield, Connecticut, United States. Founded in 1915, it is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Archdiocese of Hartford.
In 2017, St. Adalbert was merged with St. Patrick Parish in Enfield to form St. Raymond of Penafort parish. Both church buildings remain open for regularly scheduled worship within the consolidated parish.
History
On September 1, 1907, Bishop of Hartford Michael Tierney made the priest Paul W. Piechocki responsible for the Polish immigrants. Bishop John Joseph Nilan established St. Adalbert Parish on January 17, 1915. Stanislaus Federkiewicz was named first pastor.
The first Mass was offered in the unfinished church basement on Christmas 1915. Nilan dedicated the lower church on May 7, 1916. Finally, the completed St. Adalbert Parish was dedicated by Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe on July 8, 1928.

Gripe water is a non-prescription product sold in many countries around the world to relieve colic and other gastrointestinal ailments and discomforts of infants. No evidence supports the efficacy of gripe water and one limited study in India questions whether the consumption of gripe water is related to vomiting in babies that already showed signs of colic. The original formula contained alcohol and sugar in addition to sodium bicarbonate and dill oil. Present-day products do not contain alcohol, and may contain fennel, ginger, chamomile or lemon balm in addition to or replacement for dill oil. Some gripe water products still contain sugar, while others may contain charcoal. Amounts given are one to several teaspoons (5 ml = one teaspoon) per day.
History
Gripe water was invented in 1851 by William Woodward, an English pharmacist who did their apprenticeship in Lincolnshire and later bought a business in Nottingham. Gripe water was adopted as a prescription by physicians. In the 1840s, babies in Eastern England had a condition known as "fen fever", and during that time there was also an outbreak of malaria in England. Woodward took their inspiration from the treatments for malaria and "fen fever". They noted that the formula used to treat fen fever was an effective "soother of fretful babies and provided relief from gastrointestinal troubles in infants." The original Woodward's Gripe Water contained 3.6% alcohol, dill oil, sodium bicarbonate, sugar, and water. Woodward registered "Gripe Water" as a trademark in 1876. It was initially marketed with the slogan "Granny told Mother and Mother told me." The modern era formula for Woodward's Gripe water does not contain alcohol or sugar.
Prior to alcohol's removal from the recipe, Woodward's maximum recommended dose of gripe water contained an alcohol content equivalent to five tots of whiskey for an 80kg adult. It was only in 1992 that Britain mandated that alcohol be removed from Gripe water, and in 1993 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered an automatic detention of all shipments of Woodward's Gripe Water into the U.S. on the basis of its being an unapproved drug. In response to the FDA's import alert, gripe water products are sold as dietary supplements.
Use
The formulation now varies according to brand and the country of manufacture. In most countries alcohol is no longer in the product. Sugar may or may not be in the product. Sodium bicarbonate, dill seed oil, fennel oil and sometimes ginger extract are the ingredients claimed to be effective. Evidence of gripe water's effectiveness has been limited to anecdotal accounts. Its commercial success has led to imitation brands of varying formulas.
Gripe water is recommended by some pediatricians and alternative practitioners as a 'natural' option. It is available in the United States as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. A 2000 review in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine found that most of the ingredients in Woodward's gripe water are of little value in relieving infantile discomfort and that any benefit may be no more complicated than the baby receiving some sweet-tasting liquid. A 2012 review also came out against the use of these products. Yet, commercial attention has continued to grow as companies have produced product options claiming to provide various digestive benefits, like Wellements who introduced a probiotic gripe water in 2016.
In a 2015 study of 350 infants conducted in Puducherry, India, two-thirds of mothers of infants ages 1 to 6 months admitted to administering gripe water to their children at least once a day. The mothers believed that gripe water helps in digestion and prevents stomach ache. However, infant colic, vomiting and constipation were significantly more common in gripe water administered infants compared to those who were exclusively breastfed. The study did not indicate the rate of constipation or vomiting prior to the use of gripe water to compare with during use. Constipation was reported for 19.5% of the infants who were given gripe water compared to 5.8% for those who were not.
In Canada, gripe water comes in both original formulation and alcohol-free versions. Since there is a ban in the United States, the original formulation is usually not able to be shipped outside of Canada.

Anna Laughlin (October 11, 1885 – April 5, 1937) was an American actor on stage and in silent films. In 1902, they became the first actor to play Dorothy Gale.
Early life
Anna Laughlin was born in Sacramento, California. They began appearing on stage as a "child elocutionist", and then in vaudeville and touring companies.
Career
Laughlin went to New York as a young teenager, and was in Broadway shows by 1900's The Belle of Bohemia. In 1902, at age 16, they played Dorothy Gale in a musical production of The Wizard of Oz that started in Chicago and ran on Broadway through 1904. Other shows featuring Laughlin included Their Majesty (1906), The Top o' th' World (1907), Mama's Boy (1912), When Claudia Smiles (1914). They also had a solo variety show in 1909. "Miss Laughlin is such a demure, pretty, and winsome little body that their appearance alone is sufficient to please the most hardened playgoer or vaudeville attendant," commented a New York reviewer, "but when combined with their truly artistic singing, it is a treat that none can fail to enjoy. In widowhood they had a brief comeback on Broadway in 1925, in The Fall Guy.
Laughlin appeared in more than a dozen silent films, all made between 1913 and 1915, including The Rebellious Pupil (1913, a short), Northern Lights (1914), The Greyhound (1914), The Amazing Mr. Fellman (1915), and What Happened to Father (1915), and The Crown Prince's Double (1916).
Personal life
Laughlin married Evan "Van" Monroe, a jeweler, in 1904. They had a daughter, Lucy Monroe, who became a noted singer. Laughlin was widowed by 1925 and died by suicide from gas poisoning in 1937, in New York. They were 51 years old.
In 2011, Anna Laughlin's personal copy of The Wizard of Oz was auctioned on eBay.

SecondStreet.org is a federally incorporated charity and conservative-leaning public policy think tank in Canada. The organization's mission is "to tell stories of everyday Canadians — from coast to coast — and show how they're impacted by government policies.”
The organization derives its name from "Second Street" being the most common street name in Canada - a place "where people live, work, learn, pray, shop, eat..." and where stories of those affected by government policies are to be told. The organization is also headquartered in Regina with staff and contributors based across Canada.
Board of directors
SecondStreet.org has a volunteer board of directors. As of 2021, the SSO board of directors is composed of Adam Allouba (Chair), Adam Daifallah, Scott Hennig, Tracy Johnson, Steven Muchnik and Walter Robinson.
Research
SecondStreet.org has examined numerous government policies including health care, taxation and natural resources projects, and often produces publications (including news columns and policy papers) supporting its proposals.
Health care
A prominent topic of research for the organization is examining Canada's health care sector and Canadians who have died while awaiting surgery on hospital waiting lists. In November 2021, the organization filed freedom of information requests to learn more about patients dying while waiting for surgeries, revealing that government data showed over 11,400 waiting-list deaths between April 1, 2018 and Dec. 31, 2020. In March 2021, the organization also released data demonstrating the number of surgeries, procedures and specialist consultations that were postponed across Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic, amassing close to 354,000.
Government accountability
SecondStreet.org has also publicly criticised governments for not introducing paycuts for public employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing that when asking the federal government, provincial governments and 13 cities across Canada if they had ever implemented a paycut, responses ranged from "decades ago to never". This included the government of Alberta who last implemented a paycut in 1994 of five percent.
Other publications have included revealing hospital run restaurants in Ontario and Alberta which have accumulated millions of dollars worth of debt at taxpayers' expense.
Natural resources
The organization also frequently comments on natural resource development in Canada, taking a pro-oil and gas stance and publishing data on the consequences of cancelled pipeline projects (equalling $213 billion since 2014). SecondStreet.org also criticises the government's approach to outsourcing oil production to foreign nations instead of producing oil in Canada.
Affiliations
Many commentators have identifited similarities between SecondStreet.org and the right-wing advocacy group Canadian Taxpayers Federation, citing both organizations as recipients of donations from the Donner Canadian Foundation and both operating with "numerous" and "tight" links.

Johann-Georg Richert (14 April 1890 – 30 January 1946) was a German general during World War II. They commanded the 286th Security Division whose personnel committed numerous war crimes in occupied Belarus, in the Army Group Center Rear Area.
The 35th Infantry Division also committed war crimes during early 1944 while Richert was its commanding officer. The division's operations against "partisans" (who were often civilians) became more frequent and brutal after Richert assumed command. Richert also ordered that all of their soldiers who were in hospitals without injuries or a diagnosed illness be executed, and threatened units and commanding officers who were defeated in battle with severe penalties.
With the help of troops from Sonderkommando 7b of Einsatzgruppe D, Richert was forced at least 40,000 civilians into the Ozarichi death camps, makeshift camps which had been established by Josef Harpe. Dieter Pohl has called the establishment of the camp "one of the worst crimes the Wehrmacht ever committed against civilians". By the time troops of the 65th Army of the First Belorussian Front liberated those in camps on 19 March 1944, at least 9000 people had died. The troops freed 33,480 people, including 15,960 children under the age of 13, from the Ozarichi concentration camps.
Richert was taken prisoner by Soviet troops on 8 May 1945. In 1946, they were put on trial by a Soviet military court in Minsk for their role in the deportations, as well as other crimes against Soviet civilians. Richert was sentenced to death, and publicly hanged the next morning in Minsk on 30 January 1946. Richert was hanged with 13 of their codefendants with over 100,000 people watching.

The Davis Avenue Recreation Center is a historic recreation facility in Mobile, Alabama. The facility was established in 1921 as the first public leisure center for African Americans in segregated Mobile. Initially known as the Davis Avenue Community House, it also featured tennis courts, a swimming pool, and a small park. The need for a larger facility was soon realized, and in 1936 the current structure was completed. It was the only public recreation facility in Mobile built using Works Progress Administration funds. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 27, 2011, due to its significance to the African American history in the city.

Blanche of Navarre (1226 – 12 August 1283), also known as Blanche of Champagne, was the daughter of Theobald the Troubador, King of Navarre and Count of Champagne, and their second wife Agnes of Beaujeu. They were a member of the House of Champagne. By their marriage to John I, Duke of Brittany, they became Duchess consort of Brittany.
Life
Blanche was firstly betrothed to Otto III, Count of Burgundy; the marriage contract was signed on 16 January 1236. However, the engagement was broken.
Blanche was instead married in 1236 to John I, Duke of Brittany: the main reason they married Blanche was so they could get Navarre, and Theobald did make John heir to the throne. However, John renounced the claim after Margaret of Bourbon bore Theobald two sons.
Marriage and children
Blanche and John had:
John II, Duke of Brittany
Peter of Brittany (2 April 1241–Paris, 19 October 1268), Lord of Hade
Alix of Brittany, Dame de Pontarcy
Theobald (1245–1256), died young
Theobald (died soon after birth)
Eleanor (1248), died young
Nicholas (1249–1261), died young
Robert (1251–1259), died young
Of their eight children, only their eldest three lived to adulthood.
In 1270 Blanche founded the Abbey de la Joie near Hennebont; they were later buried there. They died in 1283; their husband outlived them by three years. Blanche outlived six of their eight children.

WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 1 (WIPI-1), also known as Atg18 protein homolog (ATG18) and WD40 repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides of 49 kDa (WIPI 49 kDa), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the WIPI1 gene.
Structure and function
WD40 repeat proteins are key components of many essential biologic functions. They regulate the assembly of multiprotein complexes by presenting a beta-propeller platform for simultaneous and reversible protein–protein interactions. Members of the WIPI subfamily of WD40 repeat proteins, such as WIPI1, have a 7-bladed propeller structure and contain a conserved motif for interaction with phospholipids.

In the Polynesian mythology of Tonga, Laufakanaa (speak to silence; i.e.: command [the winds] to calm down) was a primordial creator god their home was Ata.
In Tongan cosmogony, the sky and the sea, and the land of Pulotu (the dark underworld, the home of the souls of departed chiefs) existed from the earliest times. All other lands were created later. Either they were thrown down from the sky by Havea Hikuleo or, subsequently, they were fished up by Maui from the bottom of the ocean. All the makafonua (landstones) of Hikuleo were full of unevenness, and tended to jump around (that is, they were the source of earthquakes) and were full of holes and pits (that is, volcanoes), while Maui's lands were smooth (coral islands and atolls). ʻAta and ʻEua, the islands which were fished up first, were quite hilly, as Maui apparently was not an expert fisherman yet. Their next catch, (Tongatapu) they kept much smoother.
The first people of Ata came forth directly from the same uanga (fly larva, maggot) as Kohai, Koau, mo Momo, and were the ancestors of all other men. At that time the god Tamapoulialamafoa was the king of the sky, and they commanded some of the Tangaloa gods to tell the faahikehe (sub-god) Laufakanaa to go down to the realm of light (i.e. the earth, not Pulotu) to become ruler of Ata and also ruler of the winds. Whenever a boat came to Ata in stormy weather, Laufakanaa had to listen to the prayers of the crew and give them a good wind to sail on. The prayer had to consist of an offering of mā (bread) cooked in the oil of the grated coconut.
Laufakanaa also brought a special fishing net with him. This typical Ata-net was used by the islanders on special occasions, as when they went fishing for the Tuʻi Tonga. As well, the putalinga (a kind of plantain), the sī (ti (plant)), the ngū-ata and tua-ata yams were brought down from the sky by Laufakanaa and first grew on Ata, before they spread to the other islands.

Hawkchurch is a village and civil parish in Devon, England, north east of Axminster on the border of Devon and Dorset, and about south of Somerset. It is north of the tourist and fishing town of Lyme Regis.
The parish, in the Archdeaconry of Dorset and Diocese of Salisbury is located on the border of Devon and Dorset. Because of its location, it has been classified as part of each county at different times, but was formally transferred from Dorset to Devon in 1896.
The parish church of St. John the Baptist dates from Saxon times, however, the building was heavily restored in 1862.
In 1878 the Rev. John Going became rector to the parish and planted rose trees on the walls of every cottage, which gave Hawkchurch its title "The Village of Roses".
The village pub, "The Old Inn", is a traditional coaching house, and a hostelry has been on the site since 1543.
The Manor House, Wyld Court, dates from 1593. It was built for Robert Moore, whose coat of arms is inscribed above the door. An earlier mediaeval house on the site belonged to Cerne Abbey, prior to the dissolution of the Monasteries. It is a Grade II* listed building.
In 1870–1872, Hawkchurch was described as:a village and a parish in the district of Axminster and county of Dorset. The village stands near the boundary with Devon, the river Axe, and the Yeovil and Exeter railway, 3¼ miles NE by E of Axminster; and has a post office under Axminster.Population Trends: The parish has witnessed a fluctuating population over the past few centuries, a major surge around 1820–1840, which was followed by a steady decline until the early 1900s. From the early 1900s to the present day, the parish has only experienced mild fluctuations in the population and has stayed relatively steady overall. The parish is currently on a steady population surge.
According to the 2011 Census, there were 271 males and 282 females living in the parish.
Occupation Trends: Over the course of history, due its location and size, the parish has centred its income around agriculture, with this field being the leading occupation. This fact has remained the same however in modern days, agriculture has had to compete with the surge in a now thriving tourist industry due to the locations scenic views. According to the 2011 Census, there were 256 people aged 16 to 74 in employment with full-time employment being slightly higher than part-time employment in the tables.
Religion in Hawkchurch: Christianity is the most prominent religion in the parish with 373 out of 553 identifying as Christian, and 123 people identifying as non religious by 2011.
Solar panel installation controversy: In November 2015, residents of a west Dorset valley had joined forces to protest against proposals for a solar farm they had labelled an “environmental disaster waiting to happen”.
Villagers from Thorncombe and Hawkchurch had combined to launch the Stop Sadborow Solar, which would have seen the installation of solar panels on a site near Gashay Farm in Hawkchurch, on the Dorset-Devon border.
The application was lodged with West Dorset District Council by developers British Solar Renewables, and now villagers have slammed the proposals and are calling on the district council to refuse the application, due to the area's landscape and popularity with tourists.
Hawkchurch's first community shop: In June 2014, Hawkchurch residents turned out in force for the official opening of their new community shop.
The volunteer-run store had been set up in a portable cabin on land near the village hall – with plans for a purpose-built structure once it was established.
County Councillor Andrew Moulding cut a ribbon to declare the new venture up and running following a two-year campaign.
Hawkchurch had been without its own store for more than 20 years and the new shop will open seven days a week and is designed to serve not only the village but the surrounding communities and visitors.
Organiser reports indicated that the store had already proven popular with a wide variety of shoppers shortly after its opening.

1903–1972
A total of 20 people were executed by Nebraska after 1897 and before the 1972 Supreme Court capital punishment ban.
After 1976
Four people convicted of murder have been executed by Nebraska since 1976. Three were executed by electric chair. On April 21, 2011, the Nebraska Supreme Court set the first execution date via lethal injection for June 14, 2011. On May 26, 2011, the Nebraska Supreme Court stayed the execution due to objections that the sodium thiopental that Nebraska purchased from a Mumbai company failed to comply with U.S. pharmaceutical standards. The state's first lethal injection was carried out on August 14, 2018.

Tragacanth is a natural gum obtained from the dried sap of several species of Middle Eastern legumes of the genus Astragalus, including A. adscendens, A. gummifer, A. brachycalyx, and A. tragacantha. Some of these species are known collectively under the common names "goat's thorn" and "locoweed". The gum is sometimes called Shiraz gum, shiraz, gum elect or gum dragon. The name derives from the Greek words tragos (meaning "goat") and akantha ("thorn"). Iran is the biggest producer of this gum.
Gum tragacanth is a viscous, odorless, tasteless, water-soluble mixture of polysaccharides obtained from sap that is drained from the root of the plant and dried. The gum seeps from the plant in twisted ribbons or flakes that can be powdered. It absorbs water to become a gel, which can be stirred into a paste. The major fractions are known as tragacanthin, highly water-soluble as a mucilaginous colloid, and the chemically related bassorin, which is far less soluble but swells in water to form a gel. The gum is used in vegetable-tanned leatherworking as an edge slicking and burnishing compound, and is occasionally used as a stiffener in textiles. The gum has been used historically as a herbal remedy for such conditions as cough and diarrhea. Powders using tragacanth as a basis were sometimes called diatragacanth. As a mucilage or paste, it has been used as a topical treatment for burns. It is used in pharmaceuticals and foods as an emulsifier, thickener, stabilizer, and texturant additive (E number E413). It is the traditional binder used in the making of artists' pastels, as it does not adhere to itself the same way other gums (such as gum arabic) do when dry. Gum tragacanth is also used to make a paste used in floral sugarcraft to create lifelike flowers on wires used as decorations for cakes, which air-dries brittle and can take colorings. It enables users to get a very fine, delicate finish to their work. It has traditionally been used as an adhesive in the cigar-rolling process used to secure the cap or "flag" leaf to the finished cigar body.
In the Middle East, and in Turkey in particular, gum tragacanth is used in paper marbling to make size on which to float and shape the pigments, just as carrageenan is used in the West.
Gum tragacanth is also used in incense-making as a binder to hold all the powdered herbs together. Its water solubility is ideal for ease of working and an even spread, and it is one of the stronger gums for holding particles in suspension. Only half as much is needed, compared to gum arabic or something similar.
As food
It is common in Indian cuisine as "Goond Kateera" (also spelled as "Gond Katira"). "Goond" means "glue" or "tree sap" in Hindi, so that would mean "tree sap of Kateera". A common dish that uses it is the Jammu and Kashmir cuisine's special sundh.
Fisherman's Friend menthol lozenges contain gum tragacanth as an ingredient.

Julius E. F. Gipkens (16 February 1883 – 1968) was a German painter, illustrator and graphic designer.
Early life and career
Julius Gipkens was born in Hannover, Germany. Gipkens was self-taught and found inspiration in Lucian Bernhard's work, eventually contributing greatly to the Sachplakat (Plakatstil) style himself. Gipkens moved to Berlin and started working. Alongside Lucian Bernhard, Hans Rudi Erdt and Julius Klinger they were employed on an exclusive contract with Hollerbaum & Schmidt. They created posters for Germany during World War I. After the war, they created illustrations for advertising and design firms, and newspapers. They immigrated to the United States in 1933.

A hostler or ostler is a groom or stableman, who is employed in a stable to take care of horses, usually at an inn. In the twentieth century the word came to be used in railroad industry for a type of train driver.
Etymology
The word is spelled "hostler" in American English, but "ostler" in British English. It traces to c. 1386, meaning "one who tends to horses at an inn"—and also, occasionally, "innkeeper"—is derived from Anglo-French hostiler (modern French ), itself from Medieval Latin "the monk who entertains guests at a monastery", from hospitale "inn" (compare hospital, hospitaller, hospitality). A similar word, hostelero (innkeeper, the one that took care of a hostal), exists in Spanish.
Modern uses
According to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, a hostler in motor transportation is a type of truck driver who directs trucks or tractors at vehicle parking or docking areas to move, position, or park trucks or trailers. In the United States railroad industry a hostler is a train driver, a type of railroad engineer who moves locomotives in and out of service facilities.

The Spring Creek Fire was a wildfire near Fort Garland and La Veta, Colorado in Costilla and Huerfano counties in southern Colorado. The fire burned a total of and was the third-largest wildfire in Colorado history.
Origin and trial
The Spring Creek Fire started on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 near Fort Garland, Colorado. Jesper Jørgensen (modified to Joergensen or Jorgensen in English), 52, a citizen of Denmark and reported by immigration authorities as being in the United States illegally because they had overstayed their visa, has been arrested and faces arson charges for allegedly starting the fire. They had been using a fire pit to grill food while camping in rural Colorado. Jørgensen claimed they were unaware of the open fire ban. They had presumed the fire in the pit was fully extinguished, but was woken from their afternoon nap by the smell of smoke a few hours later. They initially attempted to extinguish it himself, getting minor burns in the process, and when that failed they called 911. When the first firefighters arrived the fire had already engulfed trees and vegetation. The blaze was declared 100% contained on September 10, 2018. More than 140 structures were destroyed in the fire.
Shortly after their arrest in June 2018, Jørgensen was declared mentally incompetent, causing a delay in their case.
Evacuations
The Forbes Park neighborhood near Fort Garland was under mandatory evacuations during the fire.
In Huerfano County, mandatory evacuations were ordered for Cuchara, Chama, Red Wing, Malachite, and Badito south of Highway 69. The community of Gardner was placed on "pre-evacuation" for a time.

is a Japanese mathematics teacher who invented the numerical logic puzzle KenKen. (It is called Kashikoku-Naru-Puzzle in Japanese, which literally means "a puzzle that makes you smarter." It is also known as Keisan Block.)
Miyamoto developed KenKen in 2003 to help their students improve their calculation skills, logical thinking and patience. Their puzzle series has sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan. It was introduced to the rest of the world at the 2007 Bologna Book Fair as KenKen and has been translated into Korean, Thai, German, French, Czech, Mandarin Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Slovene, Spanish, Portuguese, and Icelandic. KenKen made its debut in The Times (London) in March 2008, and the New York Times in February 2009. The first U.S. KenKen tournament was held in March 2009 in Brooklyn, with Miyamoto in attendance.
Miyamoto graduated from Waseda University in Tokyo. They worked as an instructor at a juku (university preparatory cramming school) in Yokohama. In 1993 they founded their own school named Miyamoto Sansuu Kyoushitsu (Miyamoto Math Classroom) in Yokohama, and established their unique "non-teaching classroom" methodology called "The Art of Teaching Without Teaching". They moved their classroom to Tokyo (near Tokyo station) in 2009, and moved their classroom to Manhattan in 2015. Their Manhattan class is named Miyamoto Mathematics Inc. They currently spend 8 months in New York and 4 months in Japan. They teach KenKen to children on weekends.
They wrote over 180 books in Japanese, including their teaching methodology book called "Kyouikuron" that has been sold over 100,000 copies and the "Kashikoku-Naru-Sansuu" series that is consisted of 96 math problem books that scaffold gradually.

Pale is the second album by American alternative rock band Toad the Wet Sprocket. It was recorded independently in 1989 for roughly $6000. During the recording of Pale, the band signed with Columbia Records. However, they declined to re-record any of the album in a more polished way. Columbia released the album without alterations, as it had done with the 1989 re-release of their debut 1988 album Bread & Circus. Pale was released in January 1990. "Come Back Down" was the first radio single for the album.
In May 2009, the band announced plans to re-release Pale, out of print since 2001, in a remastered edition with expanded artwork and bonus tracks culled from the album sessions that didn't make it onto the album. Their debut, Bread & Circus would also get the same kind of re-issue. In 2010 the band signed a deal with Primary Wave to handle their back catalog and licensing. These reissues had been confirmed by lead singer Glen Phillips via Toad's "Fan Questions" portion of their official website for release in 2011, but never occurred. Instead, a remastered vinyl LP reissue of fear and Dulcinea were released in 2018 through the band's online store.

The Washington Free Beacon is an American conservative political journalism website launched in 2012.
The website is financially backed by Paul Singer, an American billionaire hedge fund manager and conservative activist.
History
The Free Beacon was founded by Michael Goldfarb, Aaron Harrison, and Matthew Continetti. It launched on February 7, 2012, as a project of the Center for American Freedom, a conservative advocacy group modeled on the liberal Center for American Progress.
The site is known for its conservative reporting, with the intention of publicizing stories and influencing the coverage of the mainstream media, and modeled after liberal counterparts in the media such as Think Progress and Talking Points Memo. The site has roots in the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party.
Jack Hunter, a staff member of Senator Rand Paul's office, resigned in 2013 after a Free Beacon report detailing their past as a pro-secessionist radio shock jock known as the "Southern Avenger".
The publication also broke several stories about Hillary Clinton's successful 1975 legal defense of an accused child rapist that attracted national media attention.
From October 2015 to May 2016, the Washington Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on "multiple candidates" during the 2016 presidential election, including Donald Trump. The Free Beacon stopped funding this research when Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination. Fusion GPS would later hire former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and produce the Steele dossier that alleged links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Paul Singer, a billionaire and hedge fund manager, who is a major donor to the Free Beacon, said they were unaware of this dossier until it was published by BuzzFeed News in January 2017. On October 27, 2017, the Free Beacon publicly disclosed that it had hired Fusion GPS, and stated that it "had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."
The Free Beacon came under criticism for its reporting on Fusion GPS. Three days before it was revealed that it was the Free Beacon that had funded the work by Fusion GPS, the Free Beacon wrote that the firm's work “was funded by an unknown GOP client while the primary was still going on." The Free Beacon has published pieces that have sought to portray the work by Fusion GPS as unreliable "without noting that it considered Fusion GPS reliable enough to pay for its services." In an editor's note, Continetti said "the reason for this omission is that the authors of these articles, and the particular editors who reviewed them, were unaware of this relationship," and that the outlet was reviewing its editorial process to avoid similar issues in the future.
In 2022, a Free Beacon article by Patrick Hauf accused the administration of President Joe Biden of planning to use federal dollars to fund safe smoking kits that included crack pipes, as part of a harm reduction initiative; this prompted outrage among Republicans in Congress, some of whom proposed a bill to ban the federal government from funding drug paraphernalia. The Washington Post later reported that, according to a United States Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson, "Hauf jumped to a conclusion that was not warranted" because, while the safe smoking kits were meant to reduce risk in smoking "any illicit substance", the agency funding the program "d[id] not specify the kits' elements, only the parameters"; thus, although such smoking kits often include crack pipes and (according to a Drug Policy Alliance spokesperson interviewed for the Washington Post article) some of the groups planning to apply for the funding had assumed that its kits would also include them, it was not clear that the agency had intended to include them.
Reception
Jim Rutenberg of The New York Times described the reporting style of the Free Beacon as "gleeful evisceration." The Atlantics Conor Friedersdorf called the Free Beacons mission "decadent and unethical".
Ben Howe wrote in The Daily Beast that The Washington Free Beacon established "itself as a credible source of conservative journalism with deep investigative dives and exposes on money in politics", but after Trump's election it was "producing less actual reporting" and moved "more towards the path of the least resistance: spending their time criticizing the left and the media, along with healthy doses of opinion writing." McKay Coppins in the Columbia Journalism Review wrote in September 2018 that while the website contains "a fair amount of trolling... it has also earned a reputation for real-deal journalism ... If a partisan press really is the future, we could do worse than the Free Beacon."
Jeet Heer wrote in The New Republic: "Much of the conservative press is terrible but the Free Beacon is far superior to propagandist fare like The Daily Caller. Unlike other comparable conservative websites, the Free Beacon makes an effort to do original reporting. Its commitment to journalism should be welcomed by liberals." In 2015, Mother Jones wrote positively of the Free Beacon, commenting that it is far better than contemporary conservative outlets such as The Daily Caller. Mother Jones however said that "the Beacon hasn't always steered clear of stories that please the base but don't really stand up," and that it tends towards inflammatory pieces that "push conservatives' buttons". That same year, the Washingtonian wrote that "The Beacons emphasis on newsgathering sets it apart among right-facing publications."
In 2019, Eliana Johnson left Politico to become Editor-in-Chief of the Free Beacon. Ben Smith wrote in BuzzFeed News that the Free Beacon was "[a]lternately parodic and wire-service serious," and had "broken major political news, mostly negative" (although its focus was mainly directed against Democrats). Smith continued that the Free Beacons hard news reporting differentiated it from other conservative outlets which were either opinion focused or did not produce journalism which met mainstream standards.

Shane Stephen Rattenbury (born 25 August 1971), is the Attorney-General of the ACT and former Speaker of the ACT Legislative Assembly, and a member of the multi-member district unicameral Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly representing the electorate of Molonglo from 2008 to 2016 and the electorate of Kurrajong since 2016 for the ACT Greens. They were the first Speaker in any Parliament in the world representing a Green political party.
Early life, education and career before politics
Rattenbury first moved to Canberra in 1984. They attended Canberra Grammar School and went on to gain a BEc and LLB(Honours) from the Australian National University and commenced employment, working with the Australian Government Department of Industry, Science and Tourism. Prior to their election to the Assembly, Rattenbury travelled between Amsterdam and Australia as the International Political Director of Greenpeace International. During this time, they gained publicity for their work on global campaigns on climate change and whaling.
Political career
In the 1996 federal election, Rattenbury was the Greens candidate for the newly-created Division of Namadgi in the southern suburbs of Canberra. They came in 3rd with 7.22% of the primary vote.
Rattenbury stood for election to the ACT Legislative Assembly at the 2001 ACT election, as a candidate in the electorate of Ginninderra for the ACT Greens. After the distribution of preferences, Rattenbury was defeated by both Labor's Wayne Berry and the Australian Democrats' Roslyn Dundas.
In June 2008, the ACT Greens announced that Rattenbury would again stand as a candidate for election in the electorate of Molonglo. Independent polling released in October suggested the Green vote had doubled since the last election at the expense of Labor, with the Liberal vote remaining relatively unchanged. Commentators predicted the Greens would hold the balance of power and decide who forms government. The Greens stated they were willing to court both major parties. With 82.1 per cent of the vote counted, Labor had obtained 37.6 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals at 31.1 per cent and the Greens at 15.8 per cent. Swings were recorded against both Labor (−9.3 per cent) and the Liberals (−3.7 per cent) with a +6.6 per cent swing towards the Greens, resulting in the election of Rattenbury, Meredith Hunter, Amanda Bresnan, and Caroline Le Couteur.
Parliamentary career and election as Speaker
After deliberations with both the Labor and Liberal parties, the Greens chose to support a Labor minority government. Hunter was a key negotiator of the Parliamentary Agreement between the ACT Greens and the Labor Party. Under the agreement, the Greens secured a range of policy outcomes in the areas of schools and education, health service provision, housing, public transport and gay rights. It also ensures that the Greens will Chair three of the Assembly's key committees. In exchange, the Greens agreed to maintain confidence in Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope. The Greens also secured Government support for the nomination of Rattenbury as Assembly Speaker. While on the cross bench in the 7th Assembly, Rattenbury was Greens spokesperson in the portfolios of Attorney-General, Environment, Climate Change and Water, Energy, Police and Emergency Services, Tourism, Sport and Recreation.
Ministerial roles
Following the 2012 ACT election, Rattenbury was the only Greens MLA to retain their seat in the Assembly. With the election resulting in a hung parliament, Rattenbury, who held the balance of power, announced they would support Katy Gallagher and the Labor Party in the formation of government. The ACT Labor Caucus agreed to appoint Rattenbury as a minister in Gallagher's five-member cabinet, and to support 100 Greens policies. Rattenbury served as the ACT Minister for Ageing, Minister for Housing, Minister for Corrections, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as well as, Minister for Territory and Municipal Services in the Second Gallagher Ministry and the First Barr Ministry.
Rattenbury was re-elected at the 2016 ACT election. Following the election, Rattenbury was joined by party colleague Caroline Le Couteur in the Legislative Assembly, taking the Greens tally to 2 out of 25 total seats in the Assembly. Rattenbury subsequently struck a deal with the minority Labor Government to retain a place in the cabinet as the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, Minister for Justice, Consumer Affairs and Road Safety, Minister for Corrections, and Minister for Mental Health. Although a member of the Barr government, they reserved the right to withdraw from Cabinet discussions on divisive issues and vote independently in the Assembly.
Re-elected again at the 2020 ACT election with six Greens elected to the then 25 member Assemblies, the Greens negotiated a Parliamentary and Governing Agreement with Labor which saw three Greens enter the Ministry. Rattenbury holds the portfolios of Attorney-General, Minister for Water, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Minister for Gaming and Minister for Consumer Affairs.

Page numbering is the process of applying a sequence of numbers (or letters, or Roman numerals) to the pages of a book or other document. The number itself, which may appear in various places on the page, can be referred to as a page number or as a folio. Like other numbering schemes such as chapter numbering, page numbers allow the citation of a particular page of the numbered document and facilitates to the reader to find specific parts of the document and to know the size of the complete text (by checking the number of the last page).
Numbering conventions
Even numbers usually appear on verso (left-hand) pages, while odd numbers appear on recto (right-hand) pages. In the printing industry, in cases where odd numbers appear on verso pages and even numbers on recto pages, this is referred to as non-traditional folios (in the past, it had been referred to as Chinese folios, however this term has fallen out of favor in recent years).
In books, some pages, known as blind folios, of the front matter and back matter are numbered but the numbers are not printed. Publishers are not consistent about how they number the pages of their books. Some publishers stick with the default numbering of the tool they are using, which is typically to number the first page of the front matter as 1 and all pages after that in a consecutive order. When publishers wish to distinguish between the front matter and the body, the initial title pages are blind folios, the front matter is numbered using lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii...) and the first page of the body or main content begins with 1. The title page of the body, if present, is a blind folio; similarly, any section title pages (e.g., when the body is broken into multiple parts), are blind folios. The first page of chapter one would then be numbered as page 3.
The sixteenth edition of the Chicago Manual of Style calls for the beginning of the text to begin with the Arabic number 1, while the front matter that precedes it is to be numbered with lower-case Roman numerals. If the front matter is extensive and a second half-title page is included, it is to be numbered as page 1 and its verso as page 2. If a part title is included, it is to be included in the same numbering as the text. Page numbers do not appear on part titles.
Most citation systems call for the identification of the page number from which a quote or point is drawn. For example, such usage is specified in their citation formats of both the Chicago Manual of Style, and The Bluebook.
Unique numbering schemes
In the book Humble Pi by mathematics communicator and YouTuber Matt Parker, the book uses a page numbering scheme where the pages count backwards from 314 to 0, referencing the approximation of 3.14 for the mathematical constant pi (π).
Electronic documents
E-books and other electronic documents published in a non-reflowable format such as PDF are normally paginated and numbered in the same way as their printed counterparts.
While reading devices for reflowable documents such as EPUB e-books may display page numbers, these numbers change from device to device depending on factors such as the size of the display and the selected font size. This makes them unsuitable for citation purposes. To remedy this problem, Amazon Kindle e-books contain what are called "location numbers", that is, numbers in the margin of the electronic text that indicate where the corresponding page begins in the printed version of the book.
Manuscripts
In codicology, each physical sheet (, abbreviated fol. or f.) of a manuscript is numbered and the sides are referred to as and , abbreviated as r and v respectively. This results in designations like 5r (the front side of the fifth sheet) and 8v (the back side of the eighth sheet).

"When Betty Met YETI" is the ninth episode in the third season, the 50th episode overall, of the American dramedy series Ugly Betty, which aired on November 20, 2008. The episode was directed by Victor Neili, Jr.
Plot
Former Mode employee Nick Pepper has come to Mode one last time to boast about their achievement of being a high-paid newspaper employee, thanks to YETI which causes Betty to think about their future. Although Betty is facing a rivalry with Marc to get into YETI, Justin's friendship with Randy is endangered due to peer pressure.
Comparisons
Around the time this episode aired, its Philippine counterpart I ♥ Betty La Fea had a storyline in which the titular character was preparing to launch a similar magazine that was also called B. This case of similarities can also be contributed to the Filipino version using some of the elements from the American version, as well as from Yo soy Betty, la fea, from which the Filipino and American versions derived their ideas.
Reception
In a review from zap2it's Hahn Nguyen, "For anyone who has struggled to break out of their entry level position, does Ugly Betty has an episode for you. I kinda loved this part [Betty's attempt to get into YETI] of the episode."
The episode's take on affirmative action, especially on racial and homosexual stereotyping, didn't go unnoticed in this review from Television Without Pity.
Entertainment Weekly's Tanner Stransky notes that the scenes involving Betty and Marc were among the best in this episode.
Ratings
The episode ran second in most categories at 8 o'clock with a 5.4/9 rating, a 2.5/7 in 18-49s and 8.3 million viewers overall. However it was off by 900,000 viewers (down 10 percent) from the previous episode after several weeks of rating increases.

Tender Comrade is a 1943 black-and-white film released by RKO Radio Pictures, showing women on the home front living communally while their husbands are away at war.
The film stars Ginger Rogers, Robert Ryan, Ruth Hussey, and Kim Hunter and was directed by Edward Dmytryk. The film was later used by the HUAC as evidence of Dalton Trumbo spreading communist propaganda. Trumbo was subsequently blacklisted.
The film's title comes from a line in Robert Louis Stevenson's poem "My Wife" first published in Songs of Travel and Other Verses (1896).
Plot
Jo Jones works in an airplane factory and longs for the day when they will see their husband again. The couple have a heart wrenching farewell at the train station before they leaf for overseas duty in the war. With their husbands off fighting in World War II, Jo and their co-workers struggle to pay living expenses. Dissatisfied, they decide to pool their money and rent a house together. Soon after which they hire a German immigrant housekeeper, Manya. Jo discovers they are pregnant and ends up having a son whom they name Chris, after their father. The women are overjoyed when Doris's husband comes home, but the same day Jo receives a telegram informing them that their husband has been killed. They hide their grief and descends the stairs in order to rejoin the homecoming celebration.

Moca chrysocosma is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Alexey Diakonoff in 1967. It is found on Luzon in the Philippines.
The wingspan is about 20 mm. The forewings are dark fuscous with a blue-lilac gloss in certain lights, the markings bright yellow, well defined. There is a clavate patch along less than the anterior half of the costa, extending over the upper half of the base of the wing, posteriorly dilated into a rounded-triangular tooth almost to the middle of the wing, the lower edge of the patch concave, the posterior edge convex. A slightly oblique erect semi-oval moderate patch is found on two-thirds of the costa and there are faint markings of lilac-blue iridescence. A short transverse streak is found along the closing vein and a marginal line along the posterior fourth of the costa, in the apex and along the termen. The hindwings are dark fuscous, the dorsum with a narrow pale yellow streak.

The Michigan–Michigan State men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey and Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey that is part of the larger intrastate rivalry between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. It constitutes the most-played rivalry in college hockey. The rivalry between the Spartans and Wolverines notably includes football and basketball rivalries, although it extends to almost all sports and many other forms of achievement. The most notable examples of the hockey rivalry are two outdoor games, the October 6, 2001 Cold War in East Lansing and the December 11, 2010 Big Chill at the Big House in Ann Arbor, which set the world record for attendance at a hockey game. This record however was broken four years later at the 2014 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2014. As of 2013, both teams are members of the Big Ten Conference, although they have previously competed together in both the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).
Michigan currently leads the series, which began on January 11, 1922. The Wolverines lead 172–137–24, as of the end of the 2021-22 season. The regular home arenas for the teams are Yost Ice Arena (capacity 5,800) and Munn Ice Arena (capacity 6,470). The two schools play at least four times a year through conference play, and with regularity play a fifth game in the Great Lakes Invitational. It is possible for the teams to meet nine times throughout the season with regular season, GLI, Big Ten tournament and NCAA tournament games. The teams often play games on neutral sites and have played at least once per year since 1990 in Detroit, starting at Joe Louis Arena (capacity 20,066). The teams generally alternate years in which they hold a home game there. Beginning during the 2015–16 season, the winner of each game at Joe Louis Arena receives the Iron D Trophy. The last contest at "The Joe" was on February 10, 2017, as the contest will be held at the new Little Caesars Arena (capacity 19,515) from now on.
Since the Little Caesars Arena's hockey configuration capacity exceeds that of all regular collegiate hockey home venues as well as the Beanpot Tournament host venue, TD Garden, the annual game at LCA is among the most attended college hockey games each year, rivaled only by the Frozen Four.
An element of the rivalry is that Michigan (1964, 1992*, 1993* and 2018) and Michigan State (1999 and 2001) are the only two schools to have had both their hockey team and basketball team qualify for the Final Four of the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship and NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in the same season.
"Duel in the D" series
Michigan and Michigan State meet once a year in Detroit for a neutral site game. Michigan gets home team designation in even years, while Michigan State gets home team designation in odd years. Michigan leads the Duel in the D series 18–11–5. In 2016, the teams started competing for the "Iron D" trophy, Michigan has won the trophy five times, while Michigan State has won once.
Game results
Full game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1995–96 season.

Laser trimming is the manufacturing process of using a laser to adjust the operating parameters of an electronic circuit.
One of the most common applications uses a laser to burn away small portions of resistors, raising their resistance value. The burning operation can be conducted while the circuit is being tested by automatic test equipment, leading to optimum final values for the resistor(s) in the circuit.
The resistance value of a film resistor is defined by its geometric dimensions (length, width, height) and the resistor material. A lateral cut in the resistor material by the laser narrows or lengthens the current flow path and increases the resistance value. The same effect is obtained whether the laser changes a thick-film or a thin-film resistor on a ceramic substrate or an SMD-resistor on a SMD circuit. The SMD-resistor is produced with the same technology and may be lasered trimmed as well.
Trimmable chip capacitors are built up as multilayer plate capacitors. Vaporizing the top layer with a laser decreases the capacitance by reducing the area of the top electrode.
Passive trim is the adjustment of a resistor to a given value. If the trimming adjusts the whole circuit output such as output voltage, frequency, or switching threshold, this is called active trim. During the trim process, the corresponding parameter is measured continuously and compared to the programmed nominal value. The laser stops automatically when the value reaches the nominal value.
Trimming LTCC resistances in a pressure chamber
One type of passive trimmer uses a pressure chamber to enable resistor trimming in a single run. The LTCC boards are contacted by test probes on the assembly side and trimmed with a laser beam from the resistor side. This trimming method requires no contact points between the resistances, because the fine pitch adapter contacts the component on the opposite side of where the trimming occurs. Therefore, the LTCC can be arranged more compactly and less expensively.
Function mode:
The LTCC is mounted in the contact unit.
From the opposite side a rigid probe contacts the circuit.
From the top side the chamber is pressurized to 1 to 4 bars, with a controlled exhaust port to achieve air flow through the chamber.
As the resistance material is vaporized, the waste particles are removed in the air flow.
Advantages of this method:
Trimming of unlimited number of printed resistors in one step without obstruction from test probes.
No contamination on board, adapter or in system.
Density up to 280 points/cm².
Trimming potentiometers
Often designers use potentiometers, which are adjusted during end testing until the desired function of the circuit is reached. In many applications, the end user of the product would prefer not to have potentiometers, as they can drift, be mis-adjusted or develop noise. Therefore, manufacturers determine the needed resistance or capacitance values by measurement and calculation methods and afterwards solder the suitable component into the final PCB; this approach is called "Select on Test" (SOT) and is quite labor-intensive.
It is simpler to substitute the potentiometer or the SOT part with a trimmable chip resistor or chip capacitor, and the potentiometer adjusting screwdriver is replaced by the laser trimming. The achieved accuracy can be higher, the procedure can be automated, and the long-term stability is better than with potentiometers and at least as good as with SOT components. Often the laser for active trimming can be integrated in existing measurement systems by the manufacturer.
Program from digital logic circuits
A similar approach can be used to program digital logic circuits. In this case, fuses are blown by the laser, enabling or disabling various logic circuits. An example of this is the IBM POWER4 microprocessor where the chip contains five banks of cache memory but only requires four banks for full operation. During testing, each cache bank is exercised. If a defect is found in one bank, that bank can be disabled by blowing its programming fuse. This built-in redundancy allows higher chip yields than would be possible if all cache banks had to be perfect in every chip. If no bank is defective, a fuse can be blown arbitrarily, leaving just four banks.

Founded in 1999, MissionFish is the partner charity of eBay, which runs auction and shopping websites in 30 countries. Through MissionFish, eBay users are able to donate to registered nonprofit organisations when they buy and sell through the eBay.com and eBay.co.uk sites. The programmes are called eBay Giving Works and eBay for Charity, respectively.
In June 2008, eBay announced that its global user base, through eBay Giving Works and eBay for Charity, had raised over $150M for good causes from listings created around the world.
History and milestones
MissionFish was launched in the US in 2000 as an online exchange, where nonprofits could accept in-kind gifts, keep anything useful, and sell the rest. MissionFish was supported by Points of Light (formerly the Points of Light Foundation), The Case Foundation, and The Pew Charitable Trusts.
In 2003, eBay and MissionFish collaborated to build the eBay Giving Works programme, which enables eBay sellers to donate a percentage of their proceeds to the registered nonprofit of their choice.
Later that year, the nonprofit Communities in Schools auctioned lunches with leaders through eBay Giving Works, raising $157,000.
By May 2004, over 2000 nonprofits had signed up for eBay Giving Works, and had raised about $30m.
In 2004 MissionFish was awarded First Place for growth stage ventures in the Social Enterprise Alliance's 2004 Earned Income Showcase. In 2005, MissionFish was a Grand-Prize winner of the Yale School of Management and Goldman Sachs Foundation's joint Partnership on Nonprofit Ventures.
MissionFish (UK) was set up in 2005, and began working on eBay for Charity that year. The first eBay for Charity auction took place in November 2005 for the charity BBC Children in Need.
In 2006, the NSPCC ran part of its Dream Auction through eBay for Charity, raising over £500,000.
eBay for Charity opened to all registered charities in 2006. Since then, over 5,500 charities have joined the programme, raising over £27m.
Recent developments
In May 2008, eBay and MissionFish relaunched eBay Giving Works and eBay for Charity, incorporating all MissionFish's donation functions within eBay users' My eBay accounts. This change removed the need for donors to register separate accounts with MissionFish, and led to a considerable growth in charity listings. As of July 2008, there were over 100,000 live listings benefiting charities on the eBay websites.
In June 2008 a lunch with investor and philanthropist, Warren Buffett, was sold to a Chinese business person for $2.1m, becoming the most expensive charity item ever to be sold on eBay.
It narrowly beat the record set by Rush Limbaugh, when they auctioned a letter of complaint about their on-air remarks signed by 41 democratic senators.
In July 2008, two board members of MissionFish UK, Abbie Rumbold and Mike Kelly, were appointed to the Cabinet Office's third sector advisory panel, which was set up to provide ministers “with clear and authoritative advice on policy regarding the third sector.”
Products and donation processing
In 2009, MissionFish launched new giving products on eBay, enabling eBay users to make cash donations to charity when they shop and browse the eBay site. The most successful of these, which enables eBay buyers to add a small donation at checkout, has raised over $5m in the US, and over £2.5m in the UK.
MissionFish is partly funded by deductions from donations. These vary from 3.75% for cash donations, up to around 11%-20% from donations made from the proceeds of eBay sales, on a sliding scale. (For US sellers, the scale is as follows: 20% of the first $50, 15% of the next $50–$199, 10% of the next $200–$999 of each individual donation for processing costs)

The Orange Mill Historic District is the only historic district in the Town of Newburgh in Orange County, New York. It encompasses the of county-run Algonquin Park and many of the surrounding lands. It is centered along Powder Mill Road just off NY 52, a mile northwest of the city of Newburgh, at the edge of the suburban hamlet of Gardnertown.
The district takes its name from the old gunpowder mill complex, built by Asa Taylor in 1816 and operated by the Laflin & Rand Powder Company after 1869. It is located along the unnamed Orange Lake outlet brook which flows through the park just above its outlet at Quassaick Creek.
While it primarily produced powder for local residents' use in hunting and shooting sports, during the Civil War the Union Army procured some higher quality material. In the years before that conflict, local historian Edward Ruttenber claimed the mills were "the most complete and extensive works in the country" when they were under the ownership of a man named Daniel Rodgers.
After production stopped in the early 20th century, developers began building on houses on some of the property. Col. Frederic Adrian Delano (1863–1953), uncle of future President Franklin D. Roosevelt, purchased the remaining land, which included the core of the manufacturing operation, for use as a public park. Originally it was to have belonged to the City of Newburgh and in fact was deeded to the city, even though it was not contiguous with the city and is over a mile outside the city limits. The City of Newburgh maintained the park until the mid-1970s, at which time it became cost prohibitive and it gave up ownership. Eventually, Orange County purchased the property and it remains a part of the Orange County Parks and Recreation system to this day. It is adjacent to Cronomer Hill Park, which borders it across Powder Mill Road to the northwest. Cronomer Hill Park is a separate Orange County Park.
Today the historic district includes 14 of these buildings which had been the core of the manufacturing operation as contributing properties. It was designed to incorporate the old buildings as an essential feature, and many of the roofless stone structures still stand next to the park's barbecue pits and picnic grounds. It is the only remaining 19th-century gunpowder production facility in New York. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

UCL Undergraduate Preparatory Certificate (UPC) is a foundation course for international students taught at University College London (UCL). It is an intensive one-year course to prepare international students for a variety of degree programmes at UCL and other leading UK universities.
The course is targeted at international students of high academic ability whose own country's education system does not allow direct admission to undergraduate degree programmes at UCL and other top UK universities.
The course is both intensive and challenging, combining the study of academic subjects with Academic English (or a Modern European Language, for native English speakers). All lectures, seminars, tutorials and laboratory sessions (for Science and Engineering students) are delivered by UCL staff within the university.
UPC students are registered as UCL students and have access to all the academic, welfare, social and cultural resources of the university. UPC students are supported with their UCAS application and the aim is to ensure that on completing the course students are confident enough to meet the challenges of university study in the UK.
UPC Pathways
UPCSE
The Undergraduate Preparatory Certificate for Science and Engineering (UPCSE) is a full-time foundation course in science and engineering for international students who are aiming to gain access to science-based undergraduate degree programmes. Students are prepared for the following undergraduate degrees: Architecture, Astrophysics, Biological Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Earth Sciences, Economics, Information Management for Business, Life Sciences, Mathematical and Physical sciences, Statistical Science, Medicine and Urban Planning amongst others.
Students take two compulsory subjects: Academic English and Science & Society, alongside two core science modules chosen from Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics and Architecture (optional for those taking the UCL Architecture BSc Pathway).
UPCH
The Undergraduate Preparatory Certificate for the Humanities (UPCH) is a foundation course for the humanities and social sciences designed for international students who are aiming to gain access to humanities/social science-based undergraduate degree programmes. Students will be prepared for the following subjects at undergraduate degree level including Anthropology, Archaeology, Architecture, Economics, European Social and Political Studies, History of Art, History, Information Management for Business, Geography, Law, Modern Languages and Culture, Philosophy and Psychology.
Students take two compulsory subjects: Academic English and Culture & Society, alongside two core modules from Classical World, Economics, Geography, Mathematics, Modern European Art & Literature and Modern European History & Politics.
UPCHmel
The Undergraduate Preparatory Certificate for the Humanities (with a modern European Language) is a UPCH variant for students from native English Speaking countries who hold a High School Diploma of grade 3.0 and above (or equivalent). Students are offered the same subjects as those from the UPCH except that Academic English is replaced by a modern European Language (either French, German, Italian or Spanish).
Entry into UCL UPC
Entrance into the UCL UPC programme is competitive. Applicants are expected to complete the appropriate High School Certificate or Diploma in their own country and have obtained, or are expecting to obtain, very good grades. Generally, this is the equivalent of US High School Graduation Diploma (GPA) of 3.0 (and above) out of 4.0. A guide to the minimum national high school qualifications is given in the reference section of this entry.
Applications are accompanied by an essay similar to the UCAS Personal Statement required for undergraduate entry into UK universities. From here, shortlisted applications will be contacted to sit for an entrance exam. Depending on the core modules to be taken, applicants could sit for these entrance exams: Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics and/or Critical Thinking.
UPC Grades relative to A Levels
UCL offers the following equivalence between UCL grades and A levels:
UCL also offer the following suggestions for UPC equivalents to typical offers in terms of A level grades:
Scholarships
There are no entrance scholarships available from UCL for UPC study. However, there are two UPC Progression Scholarships. One scholarship will be offered each year to 2 UPC students (1 UPCSE student and 1 UPCH student) considered by UPC academic staff to have had the best academic performance.
Students awarded the scholarships must plan to progress to a UCL undergraduate degree programme after stating UCL as a ‘firmly accepted' choice on their UCAS form. The award will be worth £5,000 towards each year of the student's UCL undergraduate tuition fees.
An academic standard equivalent to at least an upper second class honours (2:1) must be maintained by the student in order to qualify for the award each year of the undergraduate degree programme.
Progression
UCL UPC graduates have progressed onto universities such as UCL, Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, Imperial College, SOAS, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Warwick, KCL, Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, City, York and many others. In 2010 60% of UPC students started UCL degree programmes and a further 12% enrolled on other leading university programmes. 40% of former UPC students graduating in 2008 and 2009 from UCL received a first-class bachelor's degree.

Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) is an Australian not-for-profit community organisation that promotes water safety and provides surf rescue services.
SLSA strives to create a safe environment on Australia's beaches and coastline through patrols, education and training, public safety campaigns and the promotion of health and fitness. the organisation had 181,603 members with 314 affiliated surf life saving clubs. The majority of its services are provided by volunteer surf lifesavers, that provided 1.26 million hours of service, rescued 7,731 people, performed 1,609,184 preventative actions and provided 68,766 first aid treatments during 2019/20. In 1973, the organisation established the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service that, during 2016/17, delivered 850 rescue missions via helicopter.
Surf Life Saving Australia also operates Australia's largest lifeguard service, contracting to local government and other coastal land managers. Additional income is sourced through community donations, fundraising and corporate sponsorship. SLSA is a foundation member of the International Life Saving Federation (ILS).
History
In 1902 it was against the law to enter the ocean during daylight hours in Australia . A Sydney newspaper editor William Gocher announced their challenge of this law at Manly Beach however it is unclear this act changed the rules. What did occur is that 10 days after an incident at Bondi on 13 November 1902, Randwick Council became the first to allow daylight bathing. Eventually as more people began to challenge the law it was reversed but inexperienced swimmers were having problems with unusual surf conditions such as rip currents and the number of drownings increased. Groups of volunteers began to patrol the beach to assist and on 21 February 1907 the Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club was formed. The Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales was formed on 18 October 1907 when nine voluntary surf life saving clubs and representatives of the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS) met and affiliated to represent the interests of surf lifesavers. In attendance were the Royal Life Saving Society, Manly Surf Club (this a different organisation to the Manly Life Saving Club which was formed in 1911), Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club, Coogee Surf Life Brigade, Bronte Surf Brigade, Bondi Surf and Social Club (North Bondi SLSC), Tamarama Surf Club (only lasted a few weeks/months and then collapsed), Maroubra Surf Club, United Wanderers Surf Club and Woollahra Surf Club. The meeting resolved: "That it is desirable to form an association of surf clubs, to secure improved facilities for surf bathing, and otherwise promote and regulate the sport..." and "That the association be called 'The Surf Bathing Association of N.S.W."
The name was changed to Surf Life Saving Association of Australia (SLSAA) in 1922; and changed again in 1991 to the current Surf Life Saving Australia.
Women were actively involved in surf-lifesaving for many years, and in 1980 the association rules were changed so that they could become active patrolling members of the SLSA.
Surf Life Saving
SLSA's vision is zero preventable drowning deaths in Australian waters, and is worked towards through patrolling beaches, coastal risk assessments, education, and training. Since 1907, surf lifesavers have rescued over 650,000 beachgoers. In 2017-18, surf lifesavers and Australian Lifeguard Service (ALS) Lifeguards performed 10,249 rescues, 65,296 first aid treatments, and over 1.5 million preventative actions on Australia's beaches.

Membership
As of 30 June 2020, Surf Life Saving has a membership base of 181,603. Nationally there are 72,689 junior members, or Nippers as they are more commonly known. Nippers are aged between 5–13 years and learn beach safety and awareness skills, in a fun and healthy environment.
Training
Surf lifesavers must be competent swimmers and skilled in rescue techniques, resuscitation and first aid. The entry level qualification to be a surf lifesaver is the Surf Rescue Certificate (SRC). Volunteers must be at least 13 years old to undertake this qualification, which involves theory and practical training, and an assessment of patrolling and lifesaving skills.
Upon completion of the Surf Rescue Certificate, surf lifesavers are encouraged to undertake the Bronze Medallion and then additional training in the areas of Emergency Care, Powercraft, Beach Management, Aquatic Rescue and Training and Assessment. Lifesavers must also participate in an annual skills maintenance session to ensure that they maintain and update their skills.
International Development
Most Surf Life Saving's international work is undertaken in the Asia-Pacific region, not only due to geographical location, but also because of the aquatic environments within the region. Also, as the largest developed country within the Asia Pacific region, a great deal of responsibility to support developing countries lies with Australia.
Research
Surf Life Saving Australia is focused on exploring statistical and analytical data to support development of education, technology, communications and operations to reduce coastal drowning deaths in Australia. Although SLSA has been conducting research for many years, 2010 was the birth of a dedicated and thorough research program. The SLSA Research Scheme was introduced to adopt rigour into research project design and provide funding for targeted and priority research projects.

Hatim Tai is a 1956 Indian Hindustani language fantasy film directed by Homi Wadia for Basant Pictures. The story, script and scenario were by JBH Wadia, with dialogues by Hakim Latta and Chand Pandit. The film had several past favorites of Wadia Brothers credited in the film title role, such as Sardar Mansoor, Mithoo Miyan and Dalpat as actors and Boman Shroff as production manager. The cast included Shakila, P. Jairaj, Meenaxi, Naina, Krishna Kumari, S. N. Tripathi, B.M. Vyas and Sheikh.
The film is about Hatim Tai (Hatim of Tayy), a merchant and poet who was known for their charity and kindness. In this Arabian Nights style fantasy Hatim Tai, referred to as Shehzada (Prince) from Yemen, undertakes a perilous journey in order to save a young fairy turned to stone. They can do this by answering seven questions posed to them on the way.
Plot
While dispensing charity, Hatim Tai (P. Jairaj), a kind-hearted Shehzada (Prince) of Yemen meets a young beggar who is the rich Shezada Munir. The girl Munir loves, Husn Bano, has been cursed by a fairy, Gulnar Pari (Shakila), that if they get married they will turn to stone due to their father Saudagar (merchant) Bardoz's unwelcome advances towards Gulnar. On finishing the curse, Gulnar themselves turns into a stone statue as a human hand has touched them The father is repentant and has tried to get wise men from all over to find a way out of this predicament. There are seven questions written on the wall and on finding the answers for all, the curse will be lifted and Gulnar too will return to their normal self. Hatim Tai agrees to undertake the mission and extracts a promise of marriage between Munir and Husn Bano. Bardoz agrees to the promise and keeps Munir with him. Hatim Tai sets out with their companion Nazroo Dhobi on the journey, coming across mermaids from an undersea kingdom, and are able to answer the first question. They go through several similar adventures meeting Gulnar pari's twin sister Husna Pari (Shakila), who helps them. Hatim Tai and Husna Pari fall in love, but the marriage can only take place if Husna gives up their wings. However, they have to wait as Hatim has to complete their task and Husna's father has to agree. Finally all the questions are answered along with several other adventures and Gulnar resumes normal form. Husna pari's father gives permission for Hatim to marry Husna and Munir and Husan Bano also get married.

Production
The film has been remade several times since 1929, but Homi Wadia's Hatim Tai in Gevacolour is cited to be the "most popular version". The film, though produced at Basant Studios, was credited as a Wadia Brothers production. The special effects for this rare A-Grade film from Basant were by Babubhai Mistry and were regarded as the main draw for the large audiences.
The film was dubbed into Tamil with the title Maya Mohini and released in 1956. Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass wrote the dialogues and lyrics for the Tamil version. T. Chalapathi Rao composed the music for the Tamil songs.
Music
The music direction was by S. N. Tripathi, and according to the credits of the film they were assisted by JBH Wadia. The lyricists were Chand Pandit, B.D. Mishra, Akhtar Romani and Raja Mehdi Ali Khan. The songs were sung by Mohammed Rafi, Suman Kalyanpur, Shamshad Begum, Asha Bhosle, and Sheikh. The song "Parwar Digaar-e-Alam", sung by Mohammed Rafi with lyrics by Akhtar Romani became popular. At the screening of the film in Hyderabad, the then Nizam of Hyderabad had the song repeatedly shown eleven times.

This Brings Us to Volume 1 is an album by Henry Threadgill featuring six of Threadgill's compositions performed by Threadgill's Zooid. The album, Threadgill's first in eight years besides the limited edition Pop Start the Tape, Stop (2005), was released on the Pi Recordings label in 2009.
Reception
The album was selected as one of the best jazz recordings of the year by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and PopMatters.
The Allmusic review by Michael G. Nastos awarded the album 3½ stars, stating: "A most unique combination of musicians that collectively sounds like no other modern jazz ensemble, Threadgill's Zooid must be heard to be appreciated, especially live, as the studio does not do the band justice." The All About Jazz review by Troy Collins stated, "Threadgill unfurls fluid variations from their vocally expressive flute on the first half of the album, tortuous bluesy cadences from their acerbic alto on the second".

Vigo railway station, also known as Vigo-Urzáiz, is a railway terminus in Vigo, Spain. It provides high speed train connection through the Atlantic Axis high-speed rail line with main Galician cities as Pontevedra, Santiago de Compostela and A Coruña every hour. The station is directly connected through the bus stop in Urzaiz street (50 m from the station hall) with the Airport (line 9A) and the Bus Station (line 4C). There is a taxi stop in front of the station.
History
The station is located on the grounds of the original Vigo-Urzáiz station built in 1878, from which the first train left on 18th June 1881 for Ourense, thus inaugurating the railway service in the city of Vigo.
On 27th August 2011 the old Vigo-Urzáiz station ceased to provide rail service, moving all services to the Vigo-Guixar station and proceeding to the demolition of all the facilities including the maintenance warehouses to proceed with the construction of the current underground station 15 metres below the original level.
Work then began on the new station, which was to be completed in March 2015. Initially, a Vialia shopping centre was to be built on top of the railway caisson, but the lack of interest from private developers led to its construction being postponed, with the structures ready for future construction, which began in November 2018 and is expected to last 20 months. As a result, it has been necessary to construct a temporary building outside the station site in order to provide railway services while work is being carried out on the future shopping centre.
On March 6, 2015, the first train to the new station, a Renfe 121 series train, went into service.
On 30 March 2015 the station was visited by the Minister of Public Works at the time, Ana Pastor, who arrived on a test train.
On 18 April 2015 the station was opened to commercial traffic with the entry into service of the new services, with high-speed services being operated from the new station and conventional services and the international link to Portugal being maintained from Vigo-Guixar station. The maintenance workshops were permanently moved to Redondela station in July 2012.
Since November 2018, work has been underway on the definitive station, designed by American architect Thom Mayne, with a Vialia shopping centre by Adif and operated by Ceetrus España.
Vialia Vigo shopping centre
In addition to its railway functions, the Vigo-Urzáiz station is part of the Adif Vialia network, which implies that an important part of the enclosure is used for commercial purposes, housing a shopping center in the upper part of the drawer railway. It's scheduled to go into service in September 2021.

It was announced on 18 November 2010 that Hušidić would graduate from the MLS Generation Adidas program at the end of the 2010 season. Baggio had their breakout season in 2010. They proved to be a vital part of the Fire, scoring goals and filling in voids in the midfield.
Hušidić didn't have a great season in 2011 and received only limited playing time. At season's end, Chicago declined their 2012 contract option and they entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Hušidić was selected by Colorado Rapids in stage 2 of the draft on 12 December 2011. However, Hušidić spurned Colorado and instead signed with Swedish second division side Hammarby IF on 23 December 2011.
Despite still being with Hammarby, LA Galaxy acquired the MLS rights to Hušidić in a trade with Colorado on 17 June 2013. On 11 November 2013, LA Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena confirmed that the team had signed Hušidić from Hammarby.
On 21 May 2016 Husidić was called to join the Bosnian national team for a friendly match with Spain.
Hušidić was released by LA Galaxy at the end of their 2018 season.
They announced their retirement on 7 March 2019.
Style of play
A dynamic, hard-working, intelligent, and tactically versatile player, with good distribution and offensive capabilities, which allows them both to score goals and provide assists, Husidić is capable of playing in any midfield position, both in the centre and out wide, and has also been deployed as a left-back.
Personal life
Hušidić was given the nickname 'Baggio' (after Italian player Roberto Baggio) at a young age by their father. They became a naturalized U.S. citizen while they were in college. An advocate of veganism, Hušidić has said of the benefits of their whole foods, plant-based diet: "I'm able to run the longest distance per game of any player on my team. My recovery rate is much faster. My muscles recover much quicker than most other players. My energy level is high; I nap once a year. I sleep very well, averaging around hours a night. I'm always happy, I have clear skin and no body odor, and I rarely ever get ill. I could go on and on."

The Loch of Hundland is a shallow freshwater loch in the parish of Birsay in the north west of the mainland of Orkney, Scotland. The loch lies between the larger lochs of Swannay and Boardhouse and acts as the main water catchment for Loch of Boardhouse. It has a great variety of aquatic plants including species that are unusual locally and nationally, and many types of birds including waders, gulls, larks and ducks that nest or use the loch. It is also popular for trout fishing.
The loch was surveyed in 1906 by James Murray and later charted as part of the Bathymetrical Survey of Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland 1897-1909.

V Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery was a brigade of the Royal Horse Artillery which existed in the early part of the 20th century. It served with 8th Division on the Western Front in World War I before becoming V Army Brigade, RHA in January 1917. It was reformed after the war but was disbanded in October 1928.
The successor unit, 5th Regiment, RHA, was formed in 1939 and still exists as 5th Regiment Royal Artillery.
The brigade had an earlier incarnation as E Brigade, RHA, formed from the Horse Artillery Brigade of the Honourable East India Company's Bombay Army in 1862 before being broken up in 1877.
History
E Brigade, RHA
The Bombay Army of the Honourable East India Company was the last of the Presidency armies to form Horse Artillery, only forming the 1st Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery on 11 November 1811 (still in existence as N Battery, RHA). By the time the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out, the Bombay Horse Artillery had grown to four batteries, organized as the Horse Brigade, Bombay Artillery.
Although the Bombay Army was almost completely unaffected by the Rebellion, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bombay Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Artillery as its 4th Horse Brigade. On transfer, 4th Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery comprised:
A Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (A/4) - formerly 1st Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Deesa
B Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (B/4) - formerly 2nd Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Kirkee
C Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (C/4) - formerly 3rd Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Nusserabad
D Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (D/4) - formerly 4th Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Ahmednagar
The 1st Brigade with 10 batteries was much larger than the other four (with four to seven batteries each). A reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades, 2nd Brigade become C Brigade, 3rd become D Brigade, 4th become E Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery, and 5th become F Brigade. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the batteries were also redesignated, the first of a bewildering series of redesignations. E Horse Brigade, RA now comprised:
A Battery, E Horse Brigade (A/E) - formerly A/4 Battery at Nusserabad
B Battery, E Horse Brigade (B/E) - formerly B/4 Battery at Kirkee
C Battery, E Horse Brigade (C/E) - formerly C/4 Battery at Mhow
D Battery, E Horse Brigade (D/E) - formerly D/4 Battery at Ahmednagar
From 1866, the term "Royal Horse Artillery" appeared in Army List hence the brigade was designated E Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time. The brigade was broken up on 1 February 1871 and the batteries were transferred to C and D Brigades. It was reformed on 31 March 1875 with five batteries. Another reorganization on 14 April 1877 saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each) and E Brigade was broken up again. Its batteries were transferred to C Brigade and redesignated again, for example, A/E Battery becoming A Battery, C Brigade.
The number of brigades was further reduced to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882. The brigade system was finally abolished in 1889. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation.
V Brigade, RHA
Formation
The brigade system was revived in 1901. Each brigade now commanded just two batteries and a small staff (a Lieutenant-Colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major). Initially, batteries were not assigned to brigades in any particular order, but in 1906, at the insistence of Edward VII, brigades were redesignated so that batteries were roughly in order of seniority (hence I Brigade commanded A Battery and B Battery).
V Brigade, RHA was formed on 1 March 1901 as the XI Brigade-Division, RHA with G Battery and O Battery. In 1903 it was redesignated as XI Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Ambala. On 1 October 1906, it was redesignated as V Brigade, RHA.
World War I
At the outbreak of World War I, the brigade was at Ipswich attached to 5th Cavalry Brigade, still commanding G and O Batteries. On 9 October 1914, the newly reformed Z Battery, RHA joined the brigade.
It joined 8th Division at Winchester on formation. With 8th Division, it crossed to France on 4 and 5 November 1914 (landing at Le Havre on 6 and 7 November) and served with the division on the Western Front until January 1917. While with the division, it saw action at the battles of Neuve-Chapelle (Moated Grange Attack, 18 December 1914), Neuve Chapelle again (10–13 March 1915), Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915), Bois-Grenier (25 September 1915), and of the Somme (Battle of Albert on 1 July 1916 and Battle of Le Transloy on 23–30 October).
On 24 November 1914, G Battery was transferred to XV (later IV) Brigade, RHA in 3rd Cavalry Division. O and Z batteries exchanged their 13 pounders for 18 pounders on 8 June 1915. It remained as a two-battery brigade until 8 May 1916 when D(H) Battery joined (designated D(H)/V Battery and armed with four 4.5" howitzers). This was formed from one section of 55th (H) Battery and one section of 57th (H) Battery, both of CXXVIII (H) Brigade, RFA. D(H)/V Battery was broken up on 13 January 1917 and the sections returned to their parent batteries.
Army brigade
On 13 January 1917, the brigade left 8th Division and became V Army Brigade, RHA. On the same day, B Battery of CLXXXVIII Brigade, RFA (B/CLXXXVIII Battery) joined and was renamed as A/V Battery. A/V Battery was redesignated as 402nd Battery on 1 June. On 9 April 1918, G and N Batteries, RHA joined from XVII Army Brigade, RHA and 402nd Battery transferred to XIV Brigade, RFA as 141st Battery, RFA.
At the Armistice, the brigade was serving as Army Troops with the Fourth Army with G, N, O and Z Batteries RHA (twenty four 18 pounders).
Post-war reorganisation
The brigade took part in the Victory Parade in Paris in July 1919. It returned to Aldershot from Germany in October 1919. At this point, N Battery was then transferred to IX Brigade, RHA and Z Battery to VIII Brigade, RHA; E Battery, RHA joined from III Brigade, RHA. The brigade survived the immediate post-war reductions in the strength of the RHA, serving on as the junior-most brigade, but was broken up at Meerut in October 1928.
5th Regiment, RHA
The successor unit, 5th Regiment, RHA, was formed on 25 November 1939 at Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire with G Battery, RHA and K Battery, RHA.

Charles Ernest Chadsey (October 15, 1870 – April 9, 1930) was an American educator and school administrator. They served as superintendent of city schools in Chicago, Detroit, and Denver, and Durango.
Eary life
Chadsey was in Nebraska City, Nebraska, to Frankin and Marie Barnum Chadsey. They graduated from Stanford University in 1892 and from Columbia University in 1894, receiving a Ph.D in philosophy from the latter.
Career
Chadsey was considered a very prominent American educator. In their obituary, their hometown paper, the Nebraska Daily News-Press, described them as having been, "one of the best known as brilliant young men of their era". In the April 20, 1922 issue of The Daily Illini, (the student newspaper of the University of Illinois, where Chadsey was working at the time) an article about Chadsey and their career was published praising their accomplishments, character, and the high regard in which students and faculty held him. The article declared that, "it was in the positions of superintendent of public schools in Denver, Detroit and Chicago that they proved themselves to be the most able man in their line in the country" and considered by many to have been "The foremost school superintendent of the United States."
Chadsey was a member of the National Educational Association and its Educational Council where they served as president of the Department of Superintendence in 1911 and 1912. Their fraternal organization affiliations were Phi Delta Theta and Phi Beta Kappa. They were also the author of several books and numerous educational magazine articles.
Chadsey additionally served as a lecturer at the University of Colorado and the University of Wisconsin. They also are a writer. They wrote elementary school readers and arithmetics, an historical tract on the Reconstruction era of American history, and articles in educational magazines.
Durango and Denver public schoools
Chase began their teaching career working in a high school in Durango, Colorado. They came to serve as the district's superintendent. He, thereafter, spent five years as superintendent of Denver Public Schools. They resigned their job in Denver in 1912 in order to serve as superintendent in Detroit.
Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools
After serving five years as superintendent in Denver, Chadsey was appointed superintendent of Detroit Public Schools at an August 9, 1912 meeting of the Detroit Board of Education after the board had voted to end Wales C. Martindale's fifteen years as superintendent. Chadsey was voted in by 10–1, with a single member of the board instead voting for Dubuque, Iowa school superintendent James H. Harris. No board members that had opposed Martindale's ouster were in attendance, in an apparent failed effort at preventing a quorum. Harris had previously been favored for the job by the members of the board in attendance until Chadsey appeared before the board that night to personally apply for the job.
In Detroit, their methods attracted national interest.
Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools
In 1919, after the death of superintendent of Chicago Public Schools John Shoop, Chadsey was appointed superintendent. They left their post as superintendent of schools for Detroit to assume the role of Chicago's superintendent in March. The Chicago Board of Education had hired Chadsey with an unprecedented $18,000 annual salary. This very large salary attracted significant public discussion.
On April 2, less than month after Chadsey had started in the position, mayor William Hale Thompson asked that they resign. Thompson had publicly taken issue with Chadsey having not been hired from within the ranks of the school district, remarking,
In late April 1919, being reelected mayor in the Chicago mayoral election earlier that month, Thompson had the majority of Board of Education that was aligned with them strip Chadsey of their powers and duties and replaced them with a "successor". Thompson also had the Chicago police lock Chadsey out of their office at the headquarters building of the school board after Chadsey refused to cooperate. Supporters of Chadsey brought about quo warranto proceedings seeking to compel their reinstatement by the Board of Education. On November 9, 1919, Circuit Court of Cook County Judge Kickham Scanlan ordered Mortenson removed and Chadsey reinstated with their authority as superintendent. However, Chadsey resigned on November 29, 1919, complaining that the Chicago Board of Education had refused to cooperate with their leadership as the school district's superintendent, and declaring that they did not intend to act as a figurehead superintendent. They have only been able to act as superintendent for mere weeks of their tenure due to the actions of Thompson and the Board of Education. Some members of the Board of Education were ultimately convicted of conspiracy for Chadsey's ouster, and sentenced by a judge in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
Later career
After leaving Chicago Public Schools, Chadsey taught at the University of Chicago. Their career ended at University of Illinois College of Education at Urbana-Champaign where they served as dean until their death at age 59.
Personal life and death
Chadsey married Callie Worth Price of Durango in 1897. They had one son, Charles Prince Chadsey. On April 9, 1930 at the age of 59, in Urbana, Illinois, Chadsey died in Urbana, Illinois of a heart attack which came following two days of illness. They were survived by both their wife and son.

Juan Fermín de Huidobro (died 1689) was a Spanish military engineer who was Governor of Margarita Province, in what is now Venezuela, between 1681 and 1683.
Early career
Juan Fermín de Huidobro was born in La Asunción, Isla Margarita, and joined the royal army at an early age.
They were of criolla descent.
In 1664 they were sent to serve in Trinidad, then in 1668 to New Granada.
From there they were appointed to Guayana as lieutenant governor.
They returned from Guayana to Margarita, holding various military positions and amassing considerable wealth.
Fermín was appointed maese de campo (military commander) of Margarita in 1677.
Governor Juan Muñoz Gadea commissioned them to start construction of the Santa Rosa de la Eminencia castle in La Asunción, on the site of the old San Bernardo fortress.
The two men fell out, and work stopped until 1680.
Fermín visited Spain, and on 15 June 1680 was authorized to return to Margarita.
That year the Council of the Indies ordered them to build a fort with four bastions and a watchtower in Puerto de la Mar, now Porlamar.
Governor of Margarita
Muñoz Gadea antagonized the local people with their demands, including restrictions on trade, and a group led by Fermín arranged to suspend them from office.
Muñoz remained on the island, but Fermín took over control.
Fermín was appointed Governor of Margarita on 17 May 1681.
As governor, Fermín inspected the defenses of the island and the coast of Cumaná.
They suggested demolishing and relocating the tower of Porlamar, and demolishing the castle and the main church of Cumaná,
as being cheaper than repairing them.
They continued to work on the Santa Rosa castle, contributing some of their own money to the effort.
On 6 February 1683 Fermín reported the completion of the Castillo de Santa Rosa.
They then asked for a transfer to another location.
They were about to complete the tower at Porlamar when they were arrested on 19 September 1683 by Muñoz de Gadea,
whom the Council of the Indies had restored as governor.
Later career
Fermín appealed to the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo.
They sent judge Gregorio San Millán to the island, but Muñoz forced them to leave.
A letter arrived from Spain on 28 March 1684 in which Muñoz Gadea was formally confirmed as governor.
The Real Audiencia sent judge Fernando Araujo y Rivera to Margarita, who arrived on 5 July 1688 with a body of troops.
Araujo arrested Muñoz and wanted to restore Fermín, but was opposed by the people of the island,
who had many complaints with their behavior while in office.
Araujo now started a trial of Fermín, who died the next year.

Kilinailai Trench is an oceanic trench delineating the oceanic boundary between the Pacific Plate and North Bismarck Plates, in Papua New Guinea. The Manus Trench, which looks as if it is a western continuation of the Kilinailai Trench, marks the boundary between the Caroline Plate and North Bismarck Plates. It is, however, disputed whether the Caroline Plate moves independently from the Pacific Plate. If not, the Manus and Kilinailau trenches form the Pacific-North Bismarck boundary together.

Game of Games Suomi is a Finnish version of the American game show Ellen's Game of Games. The show premiered in November 2021 on TV channel MTV3, and will be hosted by Aku Hirviniemi and Janne Kataja, with the show being first to have two official hosts.
In each 90-minute episode, a group of contestants has a chance to win money by playing humorous games, and advance to the final.
Format
The format of the show is slightly similar to the other international versions; on the first phase, contestants play a different set of games, of which half are eliminated, meanwhile the others advance. From the semifinal round, only one contestant has the chance to win €20,000.
Preliminary Games
In each episode, contestants face off in a different set of games, six on each episode. One contestant from each will advance. This is a list of games played in random order during the first round:
(Venyy ja paukkuu): Contestants are joined by a bungee cord. The first contestant to move five apples into a basket using only their teeth advances.
(Kielletty sana): Two teams of two members each play this game. One person on each team is shown a "winning word" and must give clues to help their partner guess it. The two teams alternate giving clues; a correct guess earns a strike for the opposing team, whose guesser is then sprayed in the face with the contents of one of three cannons. Each round also features a secret "forbidden word" that is related to the winning word; if a guesser says the forbidden word, he/she is sprayed and his/her team earns a strike. The first team to earn three strikes is eliminated, and one member of the winning team advances to "Blindfolded Musical Chairs".
(Päät pyörälle): The game starts with hosts reading aloud a trivia question to the contestants. Before contestants can answer, they are spun around in order to disorient them. To answer the question, the contestants must run to a nearby podium and grab the ball on top of it. The first contestant to answer three questions correctly advances to the next round.
(Lentoon lähdössä): In this game, three contestants are suspended in the air from harnesses. The contestants take turns to guess answers that fit a given category, such as "Countries on Europe". A category ends when one contestant gives an incorrect answer, repeats a previous answer, or takes too long to respond; when that happens, the contestant gets a strike. A contestant who gets three strikes is eliminated and launched to the top of the studio. The winner would then advance to "Blindfolded Musical Chairs".
(Kohta sataa): For this game, two contestants answer trivia questions asked by hosts for turns at pulling down one of several umbrellas. One of the umbrellas contains a chance at playing "Blindfolded Musical Chairs". The rest of the umbrellas are filled with cold water.
(Palat pelissä): This game involves three contestants attached to bungee cords. The contestants then compete to solve a jigsaw-style puzzle. The losing contestants are "blasted" into the air and do not proceed to the next round.
(Kykloopin kita): This game uses a set of giant prop monster jaws with removable teeth, one of which will cause the jaws to close and eliminate the contestant who pulls it. The contestants took turns answering questions from hosts which have an answer that's between 0 and 5. Depending on how far away they were from the answer, they would have to pull out that amount teeth (i.e., the distance between their incorrect answer and the correct answer). If they got it right, they didn't have to pull any teeth.
(Rikkinäinen puhelin): Played with two teams of four, competing one at a time. All members of the team except one wear headphones with loud music. Host reveals a sentence to the remaining contestant; the message must be relayed to the entire team using lip reading, similar to Telephone/Chinese Whispers. They earn one point for each correct word from the original phrase. The team with the most points wins; in case of a tie, the teams play again.
(Vaahtoareena): The game involves two teams of two joined in a giant, coloured 'jumper' and must work together to get five gigantic balls into a 'washing machine'. The teams must watch out for the soap, bubbles and giant, hanging t-shirts. The winning team, who gets all of their balls through the hole in the washing machine, get to choose one contestant to play in the next round, "Blindfolded Musical Chairs".
(Tuomion temppeli): Two teams of two must race to the top of a giant pyramid to answer a question from hosts, although the steps are slippery & covered in soap and massive boulders are pushed down to stop contestants. The team who reaches the top of the 'pyramid' and pushes the buzzer gets to answer hosts' question. If they answer incorrectly, the turn goes to the other team. At the end of the game, the team with 3 correct answers or the most points moves on to the next round.
(Tahnatuuba): Contestants sit at separate banks of 10 buttons that resemble the valves on a tuba. Host asks a series of trivia questions, one to each contestant in turn. If a contestant answers incorrectly, hosts spin a wheel to determine how many buttons (one, two, or three) they must press. One button triggers a blast of toothpaste into the contestant's face and eliminates them from the game.
(Parit pelissä): In this game, two teams of spouses or fiancés compete against each other. One partner from each couple is suspended from the ceiling in a harness. The other two partners do an auction-style bid on how many answers their partners can give in a given category (e.g., "national brands of toothpaste") within the 30-second time frame. When one of the partners on the ground issues a challenge, the other team's suspended partner must give the required number of responses. There is no penalty for incorrect answers. Giving the required number of responses earns that team one point, while the opposing team's suspended partner gets dropped. If the challenged team fails, the corresponding spouse is dropped. The first team to earn three points wins and chooses one member of the pair to advance to the next round.
Final Games
(Sokkotuolit)
Contestants, who won the preliminary games, play this game and are blindfolded. The contestants dance around until the music stops and must find a randomly placed stool to sit on to stay in the game. Hosts will press a button to determine where the chairs will appear on the dancefloor. The last contestant to not find a seat is eliminated, and others move on to Know or Fall.
(Tiedä tai tipu)
The winners of the four preliminary games stand on a row of trap doors, and take turns answering questions. An incorrect answer results in the contestant being eliminated from the game and dropped through the trap door, sliding down a chute that empties below the stage. The last contestant standing advances to the last final game.
(Julkkisruletti)
The contestant has a limited time to identify the faces of celebrities that fit a certain category. After identifying a celebrity, the contestant must press a button to move on to the next face. Contestants may pass if they are unsure but will need to wait three seconds until the next face appears. Contestants earn an escalating amount of money based on the number of faces they correctly identify, as shown in the table below. Correctly identifying all celebrities earns the grand prize of €20,000.

Poly, formerly Polycom, a part of Plantronics, is an American multinational corporation that develops video, voice and content collaboration and communication technology. Polycom was co-founded in 1990 by Brian L Hinman and Jeffrey Rodman. In 2018 Polycom was acquired by Plantronics
and in 2019 the name of the combined entity was changed to Poly. On March 28, 2022 HP Inc. announced it would be acquiring Poly (company) in a deal totaling US$1.7 billion, with a total transaction value of $3.3 billion, including debt.
History
Polycom was co-founded in 1990 by Brian L Hinman and Jeffrey Rodman, who were colleagues at PictureTel Corp. The startup was based in San Francisco, California but soon moved to San Jose, California, with Hinman using $400,000 of their own money and $100,000 from friends as seed money. Oak Investment Partners and Accel Partners then contributed an additional $3 million in venture capital. Polycom's stated goal was to develop solutions for all the major ways people communicate, specifically including audio, content such as documents, and video. Its first products to market were audio conferencing speaker phones. The company later added content sharing, video conferencing, video network and bridging, and system monitoring and management products.
Brian Hinman served as CEO from the company's founding in 1990 until 1998, when they were succeeded by Bob Hagerty. Hagerty was succeeded by Andy Miller in 2010. At Polycom, Miller was with several expense and accounting violations by the SEC in 2012, and settled with the SEC by agreeing to not serve as an officer for any company for five years. Miller left Polycom after being paid $24 million USD in compensation. They were succeeded as CEO by Peter Leav, who was then succeeded in 2016 by Mary McDowell following Polycom's acquisition by Siris Capital Group.
The firm employed approximately 3,800 employees in 2014.
In 2015, Polycom cut 15% of its workforce after posting large dips in sales.
Polycom reported revenues of $1.3 billion for the year of 2015. Peter Leav at that point was both president and CEO, and Laura Durr was chief financial officer and executive vice president (EVP).
Acquisition
In 2016, telecommunications executive Mary McDowell was named as its chief executive officer. On April 15, 2016, Polycom announced that rival Mitel Networks would purchase them for $1.96 billion. As Mitel, a smaller company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, paid a lower tax rate, the acquisition would have been an example of tax inversion, where a smaller company purchases a larger company in order to provide the combined larger corporate entity with the tax benefits of the smaller company's location. In July 2016, the Mitel deal was scrapped in favor of an all-cash offer from New York City–based private equity firm Siris Capital Group. Siris acquired Polycom for $1.7 billion.
In 2017, Polycom had revenues of $1.1 billion. On March 28, 2018, Plantronics announced that it would acquire Polycom for approximately $2 billion. On December 27, 2018, Plantronics agreed to pay $36 million to settle a bribery investigation connected to Polycom. The United States Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges for misconduct that allegedly occurred between 2006 and 2014, citing Polycom's voluntary disclosure.
Timeline of acquisitions
Note : 1 June 2011 – HP and Polycom, announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Polycom will acquire the assets of HP's Visual Collaboration (HPVC) business, including the Halo Products and Managed Services business of HPVC.
Products
The company also licensed a variety of technologies, including H.264 video codecs, Siren codecs, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), native 1080p high-definition cameras and displays, native 720p and 1080p high-definition encoding/decoding, low-latency architecture and low bandwidth utilization, wideband advanced audio coding with low delay (AAC-LD), multichannel spatial audio with echo cancellation and interference filters to eliminate feedback from mobile devices, and inter-operation with legacy video conferencing.
SoundStation
Its first product in 1992 was SoundStation, a triangular speakerphone with full-duplex audio allowing both parties to simultaneously speak and be heard. SoundStation and its successor, SoundStation Premier became the leading brand in the market in the 1990s.
The SoundStation was superseded by the SoundStation 2 in 2004 when AT&T discontinued the AT&T DSP16A processor on which the original SoundStation was based. Building on technological advancements that occurred during the nearly 10-year period, the SoundStation 2 exhibited more features and improved sound transparency, although was still limited to 3 kHz audio bandwidth due to its conventional analog POTS connection.
It was supplemented by the SoundStation 2W wireless speakerphone, which was a DECT system (WDCT in North America), and by the SoundStation VTX1000 wired speakerphone, the first POTS speakerphone capable of 7 kHz audio or HD Voice operation over conventional telephone lines.
Audio Products
When the first SoundStation conference phone shipped in 1992. The original device was followed by versions offering extended performance (SoundStation Premier, Premier Satellite, SoundStation EX). The SoundStation first shipped internationally (to the UK) in 1993, followed by other products and an expanding list of countries.
In December 2001, Polycom acquired ASPI networks, a company specializing in installed voice systems including the ASPI Vortex. With the 12-input and 12-output Vortex, Polycom's offerings could be extended to audio visual integrators who needed to handle many more microphones and speakers than traditional teleconferencing systems provided. In 2007, Polycom introduced the Vortex successor, the Polycom SoundStructure series.
In the first quarter of 2001, Polycom introduced its first voice over IP conference phone, the SoundStation IP 4000. In 2008, the SoundStation IP 6000 and SoundStation IP 7000 models were introduced, both offering Polycom's HD Voice and Acoustic Clarity technology. In 2003, the firm introduced its first HD Voice product, the SoundStation VTX 1000 conference phone. In 2006, Polycom introduced its Communicator, the C100S, which was the industry's first HD Voice speakerphone for a PC.
In 1998, the firm entered the circuit-switched desktop phone business with a line of SoundPoint phones. In the third quarter of 2001, it entered the IP desktop phone business with the SoundPoint IP product line, starting with the SoundPoint IP500. Polycom VoIP phones use the open standard SIP to work with different call control platforms.
In 2007, Polycom acquired Spectralink Corp., whose product lines consisted of Wi-Fi and proprietary wireless telephone systems, as well as the KIRK DECT product line.
In 2008, Polycom added applications enablement to its SoundStation and SoundPoint IP phones. The first product to market was the company's Productivity Suite, for which the company offered an open API for third-party developers.
In 2009, the firm introduced two video-enabled voice products. One was the VVX 1500 business media phone, which combines a personal video conferencing system with a voice over IP (VoIP) telephone having HD Voice and an open API and Web browser. It also launched the CX5000, a table-mounted video and audio conferencing console with a 360-degree camera, by licensing the distribution rights for Microsoft Roundtable.
In 2011, Polycom announced the VVX 500, a VoIP business media phone with a gesture-based touchscreen interface.
In 2012 the Wifi and DECT products were divested to a new company called Spectralink, spinning it off to Sun Capital Partners for about $110 million.
Video Products
Polycom entered the video conferencing market in 1998 with the set-top unit ViewStation which integrated a PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) camera with codec and communication electronics, and connected to a user-supplied video monitor on which it was designed to sit. ViewStation sold at the time for US$6000, and was relatively lightweight compared to competitors.
Polycom began the development of its first product in the new category of "Document Conferencing Projector", called ShowStation in 1994. In April 1996, Polycom went public on NASDAQ. In 1997, the company began shipping ShowStation in addition to its growing line of audio products and had total revenues of $47 million.
In January 1998, Polycom acquired ViaVideo for $54 million and its video conferencing product, which would be named ViewStation. The compact device provided the functionality of a webcam and included additional onboard processing capabilities to offset the computation limitations of most desktop and laptop computers at the time. As computer processing power increased, Polycom transitioned this hardware-software desktop solution to software-only clients called Polycom PVX, and later the Polycom RealPresence Desktop, or RPD.
Other members of the ViewStation product line included models with embedded multipoint capabilities, content sharing capabilities, and support for the emerging H.323 IP network protocol.
In February 2001, Polycom entered the multipoint bridging market through its acquisition of Accord Networks, which offered the MGC-100 line. In October 2001, it acquired PictureTel.
In 2006, Polycom introduced its first HD (High Definition) video conferencing system. Soon after, it announced the Polycom RealPresence Experience (RPX), a three-screen, three-camera room-within-a-room "immersive" teleconferencing system based on a design by Destiny Conferencing (formerly TeleSuites) which Polycom acquired in January 2007.
In February 2007, the firm introduced a new multipoint bridge platform called RMX 2000 designed to support HD and telepresence applications. It also expanded its telepresence and HD video product lines in 2007 with the Polycom Telepresence Experience solutions, and new executive desktop solutions, which further expanded its line of room-based conference rooms.
In 2008, Polycom delivered the Polycom Converged Management Application (CMA) a video network and system management application for video networks. Later that year, the firm introduced the Distributed Media Application (DMA) 7000, a network-based application that manages and distributes multipoint video calls within a network. Toward the end of 2008, Polycom also announced its plans to increase performance of its systems from 30 to 60 frames per second at higher resolution – 1080p and 720p. In 2010, the firm introduced the Polycom Open Telepresence Experience (OTX 300), another three-screen immersive conference system with improved data-efficient codecs that used half the data bandwidth of other comparable systems at the time.
In 2011, Polycom posted $1.5 billion in revenue.

David Elson Gratz (born 7 July 1927 in Columbus, Ohio; died October 19, 2017) was a professional engineer best known for their work on, and notable for their extensive historical documentation of, the Monongahela Railway. They currently reside in Brownsville, Pennsylvania.
After graduating in 1950 from the University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering, Gratz started their lifelong career in railroading, working on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In 1957, they began work in the engineering department of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Later that year, they became Track Supervisor of the Maintenance of Way Department of the Monongahela Railway. In 1961 they were promoted to Division Engineer.
In 1974, Gratz was appointed Superintendent of the Monongahela Railway, a position that they held until 1989 when they became the Director of Real Estate and Labor Relations. They held this position until their retirement in 1992.
After their retirement, Gratz assembled the information that they had gathered across their 35-year affiliation with the Monongahela Railway into a book entitled The Monongahela Railway: Its History and Operation 1903-1993. With access to over 11,000 glass plate and acetate negatives dating from the early 1900s, along with additional photographs by co-author Terry E. Arbogast, historic maps, timetables, and other documentations, Gratz produced the comprehensive 212-page book, published in 2003.
Until August 2008 a location on the Loveridge Secondary was named DAVE after Gratz. The switch sat north of Maidsville and was the start of MN Siding. When NS changed from NORAC Operating Rules to Norfolk Southern's own rules, the Block Limit Station was removed and DAVE was taken off of the timetable.

The Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848 () occurred in a year replete with revolutions and popular revolts. It commenced on 12 January 1848, and therefore was the first of the numerous revolutions to occur that year. Three revolutions against Bourbon rule had previously occurred on the island of Sicily starting from 1800: this final one resulted in an independent state surviving for 16 months. The constitution that survived the 16 months was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of an Italian confederation of states. It was in effect a curtain raiser to the end of the Bourbon kingdom of the Two Sicilies which was started by Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand in 1860 and culminated with the siege of Gaeta of 1860–1861.
The revolution
Background
The former kingdoms of Naples and Sicily were formally reunited following the 1815 Congress of Vienna to become the Bourbon kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Both kingdoms had previously comprised the single Kingdom of Sicily (created by the Normans in the 11th century) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and were split in two following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282.
The seeds of the revolution of 1848 were sown prior to the Congress of Vienna, in 1814. This was during the tumultuous Napoleonic period when the Bourbon court was forced to escape from Naples and set up its royal court in Palermo with the assistance of the English navy. The Sicilian nobles were able to take the opportunity to force on the Bourbons a new constitution for Sicily that was based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government, and was in fact quite a liberal constitution for the time. However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples.
In 1837 a very serious cholera epidemic had caused almost 70 thousand deaths in Sicily that had caused a feeling of mistrust and recriminations towards power in the population, accused of having voluntarily spread pestilence by polluting water and air. Social tension erupted in a popular uprising that broke out in Syracuse and Catania. The hostility of the Sicilians towards the Bourbon rule was due to a number of reasons, which included the suppression of all forms of autonomy of the Sicilian people and the dominance of Neapolitan elements, the poverty of the island, the harsh police regime and violations of the commitments made by the governments of Naples.
Political events after the revolution
The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centered in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred on 12 January 1848. The timing was deliberately planned to coincide with the birthday of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, themselves born in Palermo in 1810 (during the Napoleonic period mentioned above).
The Sicilian nobles were immediately able to resuscitate the constitution of 1812, which included the principles of representative democracy and the centrality of Parliament in the government of the state. Vincenzo Fardella was elected president of Sicilian Parliament. The idea was also put forward for a confederation of all the states of Italy. However the Sicilian Parliament was never able to control the well fortified city of Messina, which ultimately would be used to take back the island by force. Similarly, it was the city of Messina that held out the longest against Garibaldi's attack on the island in 1860.
Thus Sicily survived as a quasi-independent state for sixteen months, with the Bourbon army taking back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force. The effective head of state during this period was Ruggero Settimo. On capitulating to the Bourbons, Settimo escaped to Malta where they were received with the full honours of a head of state. They remained exiled there for the rest of their life and died there in 1863. Upon the formation of the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861, Settimo was offered the position of first President of the Senate of the newly created national parliament, but they were forced to decline for health reasons. Nevertheless, this invitation provides more than a casual hint as to the nexus that existed between the events of 1848 and 1860-61 in the History of Italy.
The Revolution which began in Palermo was one of a series of such events in Italy, though perhaps more violent than others. It quickly spread across the island and throughout Italy, where it prompted Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, to follow the example of Ferdinand II and issue a hastily written constitution. In imitation of these events, riots and revolutions followed around Europe at the same time, and may be considered a taste of the socialist revolts to come.
Violence towards Sicilians: massacres, rapes, fires and looting
At this point, on the evening of September 7, the battle could be said to be practically over. Filangieri, however, dared not let their troops enter the set of alleys that then made up the historic center of Messina: although the regular Sicilian forces had been exterminated or forced to flee, the bombardment of the Bourbons continued on the defenseless city, that is, on the part that had not yet been occupied by the regi, for another seven hours. The soldiers of the Bourbon army gave themselves to the looting and violence against the inhabitants: "(The Swiss and the Napolitani marched only preceded by fires, followed by robberies, looting, murder, rape, etc.) Women were violated in churches, where they hoped for security, and then murdered, priests killed on altars, maidens cut to pieces, old and sick slaughtered in their own beds, whole families moved from the windows or burned inside their homes, the loan mountains looted, the sacred vases fluttered".
During the days of September 1848 there were numerous cases of civilians who were intentionally killed by Bourbon troops, who in some cases raped women who took refuge in churches before murdering them, killed all the children and murdered sick people in their beds, as happened for example for the elderly farmer Francesco Bombace, octuagenarian, and for the daughter of Letterio Russo, who was beheaded and to whom the breasts were amputated. Homes of foreigners living in Messina were also looted and destroyed, so much so that the English consul Barker reported the incident to their government writing that many English subjects living there were reduced to ruin and that even a diplomat, the consul of Greece and Bavaria M. G.M. Rillian, despite being in uniform, had been wounded by sabre, before their dwelling was also looted and burned down. The Bourbon troops did not spare even the religious buildings from looting. For example, the church of San Domenico, rich in works of art, was first looted of its sacred objects, then burned down and totally destroyed. Loss of life was incalculable. A Bourbon official wrote to their brother, immediately after the capture of Messina, stating that the Neapolitan departments had recaptured the city with a very intense fire and "trampling corpses in every step that progressed for the space of about two miles" and then commenting "What a horror! What a fire!" British Admiral Parker also condemned the work of the Bourbons, and in particular the prolonged terrorist bombardment of the city even after the end of all resistance for eight hours: "The greatest ferocity was shown by the Neapolitans, whose fury was incessant for eight hours, after all resistance had ceased".
Messina was also troubled by the work of common criminals sent by King Ferdinand II to Sicily against the insurgents and that after tormenting the Sicilians for months with brigand actions (crimes, violence, thefts, etc.) they gave themselves at the time of the fall of the city to its looting, arriving with small boats from Calabria to make loot.

The Southern Punjab Railway (SPR) was a broad-gauge railway built to provide a more direct connection from Karachi to Delhi by linking to the original Indus Valley State Railway at Samasata and avoiding the North Western Railway loop via Lahore.
History
The Southern Punjab Railway Company was formed in 1895 with Bradford Leslie as Chairman. Under contract with the Secretary of State for India, Leslie and their partners formed the company to build a BG railway from Delhi to Samasata about 400 miles to the west. Horace Bell was the consulting engineer for SPR in London for the construction.
The main line ran northwest from Delhi to Bathinda then southwest through Bahawalpur State to Samasata, a total distance of 402 miles (643 km). Several extension lines (Jullunder, Sutlej Valley etc.) extended the length to 502 miles(803 km) in 1905. In 1873, metre-gauge Delhi–Rewari line from the Delhi–Rewari section of Rajputana–Malwa Railway was extended to Hisar, and then to Bhatinda in 1883–84, connecting it all the way to Karachi via Delhi–Karachi line.
The railway was worked by the North Western State (NWR) Railway (see "Records L/AG/46/34"). The railway eventually became part of Indian Railways.

John Harris Whitmire (born August 13, 1949) is an American attorney and politician who is the longest-serving current member of the Texas State Senate. Since 1983, they have represented District 15, which includes much of northern Houston, Texas. Their tenure earns them the title of Dean of the Senate. Previously they were a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1973 through 1982. They also served as the Acting Governor of Texas in 1993 as part of the Governor for A Day tradition.
Early life and education
Whitmire was born in Hillsboro north of Waco, Texas, to James Madison Whitmire, the Hill County clerk, and the former Ruth Marie Harris, a nurse. Their parents divorced when they were seven years old, and the family moved several times, facing difficult financial circumstances.
In their early teenage years, they moved to North Houston and attended Waltrip High School. Whitmire attended college at the University of Houston to study political science while paying for their education by working for the Texas State Welfare Department, where they interviewed food stamp recipients for compliance.
Texas House of Representatives
Under pressure from the Federal Courts, the 1971 legislature drew up Texas's first single-member district plan for the House of Representatives. Whitmire's political science professor Richard Murray was the one to inspire them to run for office as they illustrated the newly drawn district lines that encompassed Whitmire's neighborhood. Whitmire won the primary following a runoff election and easily defeated their Republican opponent. Their father provided them a $5,000 loan for their campaign funds.
Whitmire served in the Texas House with colleagues Gene Green, Craig Washington and Mickey Leland and eventually finished their undergraduate degree. In their early years, they were not seen as a particularly influential legislator, and they were criticized by Texas Monthly magazine for their low impact. They began their law studies at the Bates College of Law, then passed the bar in 1981 while still serving in the House. They did not graduate, as state law at the time allowed legislators entrance to the bar without a full J.D.
Texas Senate
In 1982, Senator Jack Ogg vacated their seat to pursue the Attorney General position. Whitmire captured the Senate District 15 seat, taking office in 1983.
Whitmire won reelection to the state Senate in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 152,728 votes (65.2 percent), they defeated the Republican candidate, Randy Orr, who polled 75,423 (32.2 percent). Another 6,266 votes (2.7 percent) went to the Libertarian choice, Gilberto "Gil" Velasquez, Jr.
Criminal justice
In 1993, Whitmire was appointed by Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock as Chair of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, where they oversaw reforms to the penal code and increased construction of prisons, to generally favorable reception. Whitmire remains the chair as of the Eighty-seventh Texas Legislature.
Freeing the Tulia 13
Senator Whitmire passed legislation to free the Texans who were imprisoned as a result of the Tulia drug raid. That incident resulted in the conviction of 38 Texans based on the testimony of one individual who has since been indicted and arrested for perjury. The legislation allowed the judge to release the prisoners on bond pending the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. On June 10, 2003, the Tulia defendants were freed on bond as provided for in Senator Whitmire's legislation. They were later pardoned by the Governor.
End to special last meals
Whitmire was angered by convicted murderer's Lawrence Russell Brewer refusal to eat the extensive last meal they ordered prior to their September 21, 2011, execution. Whitmire said that this was Brewer's attempt to "make a mockery out of the process." The senator contacted the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and asked the agency to end the practice of last meal requests or they would get the State Legislature to pass a bill doing so. The agency replied that last meal requests were accommodated "within reason" from food available in the prison kitchen, but it agreed to end the practice immediately at Whitmire's insistence.
AC in prisons
In 2021, Whitmire stirred controversy by responding to questions about the lack of air conditioning in prisons by saying “You know, we can talk about this all day, it's not gonna change. The prisons are hot. They're uncomfortable. And the real solution is, don't commit a crime and you stay at home and be cool. We're not gonna air condition them. One, we don't want to. Number two, we couldn't afford it if we wanted to.” Whitmire's quote was featured the following month on a segment on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver criticizing Texas for not air conditioning its prisons, exacerbating medical conditions and even causing the death of some prisoners. Heat has killed numerous prisoners and cost Texas taxpayers a million of dollars in wrongful death suits brought by victims' families.
Redistricting
In 2003, Whitmire was one of the "Texas Eleven", a group of Democrats who fled the state for New Mexico in 2003 in a quorum-busting effort aimed at preventing the passage of redistricting legislation that would have benefited Texas Republicans. They ultimately returned to the legislature, creating a quorum and undoing the efforts of the rest of the Texas Eleven.
Ethics
During the 1990s, Whitmer was the subject of several controversies related to potential conflicts of interest with clients and employers stemming from their position on the Senate Criminal Justice Committee.
In 1993, weeks after passing a bill benefitting the Houston Firefighters' Relief and Retirement Fund, Whitmer was hired by the Fund as a Washington, D.C. lobbyist. The Fund allowed the contract to expire following public scrutiny. In 1995, Whitmer came under investigation by the Harris County district attorney's office for taking a job with a state agency whose funding they oversaw via the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. The district attorney eventually cleared them of wrongdoing. Whitmer also came under criticism from watchdog groups and colleagues for hiring a friend as a consultant to the Criminal Justice Committee.
Election history
Whitmire won re-nomination to Senate District 15 in the Democratic primary election held on March 4, 2014. They defeated their intraparty challenger, Damian LaCroix, 9,756 (75.1 percent) to 3,232 votes (24.9 percent).

Flight of the Fire Thief is a novel written by Terry Deary, and is the second installment of The Fire Thief Trilogy. The book continues the story of Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the gods.
It follows on directly from The Fire Thief. Prometheus goes back to 1795 to try to find a hero who is worshipped in a temple in the first book, only to find out they did not travel back far enough. They return to Eden City to find it under siege against Wild People, just like Troy. They help a Dr. Dee and their daughter, Nell, to end the siege and help the Wild People get their princess back. However, the Avenger is still looking for him, and has a team of Achilles and Paris, also from Troy, and a monster from the underworld, a 50-headed, 100 armed Hecatonchires. To get past the walls, Hera attempted to repeat the Trojan Horse method, but that failed. Nell eventually sneaked in and launched the spring cannon. The Avenger's team eventually turns on him, allowing Prometheus to escape once again.

Khanka Nature Reserve ( Khankaiskiy zapavyednik) (also Khankaisky) is a Russian 'zapovednik' (strict nature reserve) that covers portions of the shore and waters of Lake Khanka, the largest freshwater lake in the Russian Far East. It is an important area for nesting and migrating waterfowl and other birds. The reserve is divided into five distinct sectors on the southern and eastern shores of the lake. The reserve is situated in the Spassky District, in the southwest of Primorsky Krai. It was formally established in 1990, and covers an area of . It is part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
Topography
The southern two-thirds of Khanka is in Russia; the northern third is in China. The total surface area of the lake is 4,190 km2. The Khanka Reserve is split into five sections that cover parts of the southern shore, the eastern shore, and a spur that extends from the northeast of the lake. The terrain around the lake is mostly flat and lacustrine-alluvial, with rolling hills off the lake; the highest point is 147 meters. The five sections are:
River - (12,494 ha)
Crane - (9,479 ha)
Devil's swamp - (16,641 ha)
Pine - (375 ha)
Melgunovsky - (300 ha)
Around the lake are bogs underlain by a thick layer of clay. Because water cannot sink through the clay, the plains around the lake are frequently waterlogged. There are 9 rivers than feed into the lake, but only one, the Songacha River, that flows out. The Songacha is a tributary of the Ussuri River, and ultimately the Amur River to the north.
Climate and Ecoregion
Khanka is located in the Suiphun-Khanka meadows and forest meadows ecoregion, a forest-less area around Lake Khanka in the Russian Far East, on the Upper Ussuri River, and along the Suiphun River to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by fire tolerant meadows and Mongolian oak woodland, with high levels of species diversity and endemism.
The climate of Khanka is Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The maximum monthly mean temperature is in July, while the minimum monthly mean temperature is in January. Rainfall mainly occurs in summer, with average annual precipitation of 500–650 mm annually.
Flora and fauna
The reserve covers many different floral habitats - meadow, swamp, steppe, lacustrine, and forest. About 30% of the meadows are reed grass. The steppe-type areas are grasslands at the feet of the ridges, with characteristic species being bent grass, wild onion, and horsetail. Average height of vegetation in these areas is 20–40 cm. Inland of the eastern shore of the lake are widespread peat bogs. The marshes, usually dominated locally by one type of reed grasses, are valued by the waterfowl for food and shelter. Aquatic vegetation is diverse. In the shallow bays are thickets of pondweed, with floating patches of lilies and other surface cover. Shallow areas feature arrowhead, knotweed, and bloodroot, while all shores feature reeds, grasses, and wild rice. There is one forest on the site, of Mongolian oak and associated plants. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 685 species of vascular plants.
The animal life of the reserve is most notable for birds: 337 species have been recorded, and 140 species are known to breed on the site. Characteristic mammals are raccoon dog and fox, and nine species of mice. The fish of the lake include catfish, pike, and various species of carp.
Ecoeducation and access
As a strict nature reserve, the Khanka Reserve itself is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are, however, buffer zones along the lakes that are open from low-impact tourism and leisure use. Also, there are 'ecotourist' routes with bird observation towers for seasonal use by the public, but use requires permits to be obtained in advance and group size and numbers are limited. The main office is in the city of Spassk-Dalny.

William Chandler Crowe (born September 9, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). They previously played in MLB for the Washington Nationals.
Amateur career
Crowe attended Pigeon Forge High School in Sevier County, Tennessee. The Cleveland Guardians selected them in the 31st round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. They declined to sign, instead of attending the University of South Carolina, where they pitched for the South Carolina Gamecocks.
While at South Carolina, in April 2015, Crowe tore the ulnar collateral ligament in their right throwing elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews. They spent the next two years rehabbing with fellow Gamecocks pitcher Cody Morris, who described Crowe as "a mentor" to them during the process even though Crowe had their elbow procedure just a month sooner. Crowe made their return to pitching on June 1, 2016, starting the home opener for the Lexington County Blowfish and showing off a sharp slider and a fastball that reached 95 mph. The Guardians again selected them in the 2016 MLB draft, using their 21st-round pick on him, but Crowe again did not sign, returning to South Carolina as a redshirt junior.
Crowe led the Gamecocks in strikeouts while posting a 3.41 ERA across 92⅓ innings in 2017 before being drafted with the 65th overall pick by the Nationals in the 2017 MLB Draft, who were known for selecting amateur players who had previously had or needed to undergo Tommy John surgery. Crowe received a $946,500 signing bonus from the Nationals, in line with the slot value of the selection.
Professional career
Washington Nationals
After Crowe's signing, MLB Prospect Watch ranked them as the Nationals' sixth-best prospect, with Baseball America listing them eighth. Crowe made their professional debut with the GCL Nationals, and after giving up two earned runs in 3.2 innings, was promoted to the Auburn Doubledays, where they finished the season, posting a 2.61 ERA with a 1.02 WHIP in seven games started. Crowe opened their season with the High-A Potomac Nationals in 2018 by winning eleven straight decisions, earning a berth in the Carolina League All-Star Game. They were promoted to the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators midway through the season, losing all five of their decisions at the higher level. After the season, Crowe was named a co-Minor League Pitcher of the Year (with Ben Braymer) by the Nationals.
In 2019, Crowe was invited to participate in their first major league spring training as a non-roster invitee, giving them the opportunity to work with veteran Nationals pitchers Patrick Corbin, Max Scherzer, and Stephen Strasburg, something they described to The Washington Post as "like getting a PhD in pitching". They were ranked before the season as the fifth-best prospect in the Nationals organization by MLB Pipeline, and the team's second-best pitching prospect behind Mason Denaburg.
Crowe made their Major League Baseball debut on August 22, 2020, starting the second game of a doubleheader against the Miami Marlins.
Pittsburgh Pirates
On December 24, 2020, the Nationals traded Crowe and Eddy Yean to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Josh Bell. On September 20, 2022, Crowe delivered a pitch that Aaron Judge hit for their 60th home run of the season, tying Babe Ruth for the second-most in New York Yankees history.
Pitching style
Crowe throws both four-seam and two-seam fastballs, reaching as of 2018. They complement their fastballs with a changeup, curveball, and slider. In their downtime, Crowe studies baseball analytics.
Personal life
Crowe and their wife, Hilary, married in December 2018. Their great-great uncle is Red Ruffing, a Hall of Fame pitcher.

Something Fierce is a punk rock band from Houston, Texas, formed in 2002. They have released three albums, along with several singles and split releases.
History
The members of the band are Stephen Garcia (guitar and vocals), Niki Sevven (bass and vocals), and Andrew Keith (drums). Garcia was previously in Gun Crazy and Born Liars, while Sevven was previously a member of the Neckbreakers with their father Bic Crater.
They self-released their debut album, Come for the Bastards, in June 2006. They followed this with extensive touring and several single releases before releasing in 2008 their second album There are no Answers, which was picked up and reissued the following year by Dirtnap Records. Mitch Clem provided the artwork for the "Modern Girl" single. They toured nationally with The Cute Lepers.
The band's third album, Don't Be So Cruel, was released in April 2011, and was described by PopMatters, who drew comparisons with The Clash, as "strictly music to break stuff to, or at least pump your fist in the air to...a strong rallying cry". In the opinion of Mark Deming, reviewing the album for Allmusic, the songs displayed "a greater stylistic sophistication" than the first two albums. The Austin Chronicle also identified a Minutemen influence.
In 2012 the band released a split EP with Denton band Occult Detective Club.

Salvador Fernández Beltrán D.J.C. (born at Matanzas, Cuba – 1987 in Venezuela) was among the first in the Americas to receive Wood Badge training, at Gilwell Park, England. They were the first to receive honorary appointment as Deputy Camp Chief of Gilwell. With this influence, the Scouts of Cuba began to use short trousers like those worn by the English.
Fernandez Beltrán was known for their work within the Scouts of Cuba, but served World Scouting in several capacities. With the support of the Boy Scouts of America, they were appointed the International Bureau's Traveling Commissioner for Latin America in November 1947, the first professional Scout executive, whose operations center was first in Mexico and then in Cuba. They later served as General Secretary of the Inter-American Advisory Committee, assisting in the creation of the InterAmerican Scout Office, the divisional office of the World Scout Bureau of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, founded and maintained with headquarters in Havana from 1946 to 1960. In 1948 Fernández Beltrán and J. S. Wilson took a six-week tour of the Americas, for assessment and planning, covering 23,000 miles and 110 hours of flying time. In 1955 they held the first Wood Badge training in Venezuela. At the beginning of the 1960s Fernandez Beltrán was appointed to the office of Deputy Secretary of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in Geneva, Switzerland.
Fernández Beltrán was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting, in 1957.
They retired to Venezuela where they died in 1987.

ABC Great Southern is an ABC Local Radio station based in Albany. The station broadcasts to the Great Southern and parts of the Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. This includes the towns of Albany, Denmark, Katanning and Narrogin.
History
The station was originally planned in 1930 as 6WA, in the midst of the Great Depression. It was the first transmitter of the ABC in South West WA, and was positively received by the local residents. It was fully constructed by 1935, and consisted of a control-amplifier, battery and transmitter rooms, as well as a workshop and an engine room to power the transmitter.
On 7 December 1936, an official opening function was held to celebrate the opening of the transmitter. A number of bands were played either in studio or via Perth, and an opening speech was relayed to the gala from Canberra. However, one of the bands' vehicles got into a crash and passengers had to be treated by ABC staff.
By the time regular transmission began, five people were on site ensuring 6WA went to air every day. In World War 2 staff were prevented from enrolling in the armed forces and had protection firearms on standby. The station even went as far as setting up a skeleton studio in a Wagin house so the ABC could continue to broadcast emergency information in the event that Perth was overtaken by Japanese forces.
In 1957 the transmitter upgraded its power to 50 kilowatts, and in 1961 mains power took over the diesel supplies, resulting in the diesel being removed and staff numbers slightly reduced as a result.
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the station, a broadcast was made at the transmitter with a reunion of former staff. In 1994 plans were brought out to upgrade the station to an unmanned facility, but negotiations with the Shire Council stalled and did not eventuate. Another unmanned facility was eventually built, and in 2002 the original station was demolished and converted into a private residence.
In 2003, the ABC opened a new studio on 58 Tudhoe Street in Wagin to better broadcast to the Great Southern region. The studio consisted of a new office, studio, production area and also had the old gold safe retained from the building's Commonwealth Bank era. The only local program at this time was a two-hour breakfast program specifically for the Great Southern, presented by Shane Foley.
More presenters were added to the studio, and some even lived in the station's residence quarters in the back. However, in 2007, it was mothballed and only used by casual presenters for events like the Wagin Woolarama. Finally, in 2014, after drastic budget cuts, the ABC closed down the Wagin studio and transferred all activity to the studios in Albany. The building was thus sold in June 2016 to an unknown tendant for $200,000.
The station in Albany, ABC South Coast had its facade briefly renovated in that same year and was rebranded to ABC Great Southern, to "better reflect the region they cover" after the Wagin studio axe.
Local Programming
ABC Great Southern airs three local programs throughout the week:
Great Southern Rural Report 6:15 - 6:30 - presented by Daniel Mercer
Breakfast 6:35 - 8:00 - presented by Tim Wong-See
Mornings 10:00 - 11:00 - presented by Peter Barr
At all other times the station is a relay of ABC Perth.
Staff
As of 2021, there are a total of twelve full-time staff and several casuals at ABC Great Southern.

The Tibet Code is a series of fantasy adventure novels written by They Ma. The novels follow Qiang Ba, an expert on Tibetan Mastiffs, and their mentor Fang Xin, as a mysterious letter pulls them into a convoluted search for a hoard of Buddhist treasure hidden during the persecution of the 9th-century Tibetan emperor Langdarma. Elements of Tibetan culture, geography, and mythology are prominent throughout the story, alongside modern aspects of intrigue and globetrotting.
The series' first two novels were posted online and publication began quickly after an interested publisher bought the rights in 2008. It became an instant success, with the ten novels selling a combined 10 million copies.
A film adaption, co-produced by the newly formed Oriental DreamWorks and China Film Group, was announced, but was cancelled.
Background
He, an ethnic Han Chinese, grew up in ethnically Tibetan Sichuan province and lived for more than a decade in Tibet itself. They developed a love for trekking though the Tibetan landscape, even undertaking a solo trek through the Hoh Xil region (known for being the world's third-least populated area).
They started writing The Tibet Code in 2005 as a short adventure story about the pursuit of a rare breed of Tibetan Mastiff, while still working full-time as a part of a medical staff. But as the plot expanded, they turned to a daily consumption of books and historical texts about Tibet (reading more than 600 books on the subject).
The story was initially posted online and attracted a small readership of about 30,000, until 2008, when it first attracted the attention of publisher Hua Nan. Hua quickly bought the rights and rushed the series to print (some critics, suspicious of such deeply researched material being published so quickly, accused They of "fronting a secret collective of collaborators", which they denied).
The series, initially titled The Last Temple, was rebranded by the publisher as The Tibet Code, in a nod to the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code.
Film adaptation
In April 2013, DreamWorks Animation announced an adaption of The Tibet Code as the first project of its newly formed Chinese venture, Oriental DreamWorks, in collaboration with China Film Group. DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg described the film as "be[ing] for China, like the Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code films" and having "all the makings of a world-class, quality, blockbuster franchise." China Film Group chairperson Han Sanping suggested that the film could also "represent traditional Chinese culture and Chinese morality" to the world. In June 2015, Los Angeles Times reported that the film adaptation had been cancelled. According to Katzenberg, their company could not come to terms with the producer who owned the rights to the book.
Criticism
The announcement of DreamWorks' participation in a film about Tibet, a region often associated in the West with accusations of human rights violations and forced cultural assimilation, was greeted by some critics as pandering to the Chinese government for access to the country's lucrative film market. At the announcement press conference, Katzenberg stressed that "the books themselves are not political. The movie shouldn't be assumed to be controversial and political."

The oral history of the Iban has traditionally been committed to memory in the oral forms of literature i.e. inchantations (timang or pengap) and genealogies (tusut), and some of these are recorded in a system of writing on boards (papan turai) as pneumonics by the initiated shamans, or lemambang. This includes elaborate genealogical records, which usually go back about fifteen generations, although some purport to go back up to twenty-five. These genealogies (tusuts) are essentially records of who married who and whom begat whom. Names of individuals with great achievements in life are accompanied by a short description, a praise-name (ensumbar) and the respective narratives of their accomplishments. So, this is how the Iban records their history in the oral form.
Some of the songs of the Iban people's oral history (such as the ritual pengap chant, sung during festivals) are mythological or historical accounts composing of key events, major milestones or famous names.
Pre-colonisation
According to oral histories, the Iban arrived in western Sarawak from Indonesia about 1675. There are three groups of Iban i.e. the original Bejie group who was the first Ibans in Borneo, the People of Panggau and Gelong who migrated from Java and the Raja Durong group originating from Sumatra, whom becomes the People of Tansang Kenyalang under Sengalang Burong. Prior to these secondary migrations, there were two more groups arriving at Borneo during the first migrations to the Borneo Island i.e. the Sebungkok group at Tanjung Datu (Melano Cape) and the group at the Merudu Hill near Brunei. These two groups arrived at about the same time with the arrival of the Bejie group at Ketapang. After initial phase of colonising and settling the river valleys, displacing or absorbing the local populations of Bukitans and Serus, there began a period of total war both inter-tribal and inter-tribal in nature.
Local leaders were forced to resist the tax collectors of the Malay sultans (Brunei).
At the same time, the Iban started to be culturally influenced by the Malay, and Iban leaders begin to be known by Malay titles such as Orang Kaya and Panglima. Several of the Malays active on the river-estuaries, such as Indra Lela, Sharif Japar and Sharif Sahap, claimed to be descendants of the prophet. Sharif Ahmit was killed by the Iban.
The Bajau and Illanun, arrived from the Philippines in galleys plundered in Borneo, and were fought by the Iban. Oral tradition recounts such a fight by Unggang "Lebor Menoa" from Entanak near modern Betong.
According to tradition, Unggang or Sunggang "Lebor Menoa" encountered Chinese traders who came in ships to the Saribas in order to sell cooking pots, brass pots, pottery bowls, shell armlets and cowry shells for padi.
During that time, the Ibans were also engaged in conflict with the Orang Ulu of northern Sarawak, the Bidayuh of southern Sarawak, the Kantu and other Indonesian ethnic tribes from eastern Sarawak; the Iban successfully controlled the western coastline of Sarawak.
The start of enmity between Sebuyau, Balau and Undup Ibans against Saribas and Skrang Ibans can be traced back to the incitements by the Malays who collected taxes on behalf of the Brunei Sultanate.
The Malay leader Indra Lela, brother of Lela Wangsa of Lingga and Lela Pelawan, incited the Saribas and Skrang Ibans to war against the Sebuyau Dayaks in order to control them.
Undoubtedly, the Malays did encourage Iban warfare, among Ibans themselves (intratribal war) and against Malay-ruled peoples who evaded contribution (intertribal war).
The Saribas were led by Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang" of Padeh, in alliance with Linggir "Mali Lebu" who was the son of Uyut "Bedilang Besi" of Paku, Bunyau Apai Bakir of Entanak and Unal "Bulan" of Ulu Layar.
The Skrang were led by Libau "Rentap", Orang Kaya Gasing and Orang Kaya Rabong. Rentap was later conferred the title of Raja Ulu (Upriver King) by their followers while fighting Rajah Brooke at Mount Sadok and was famous for their battle cry of "AGI IDUP AGI NGELABAN" meaning "STILL ALIVE, STILL FIGHTING".
The Sebuyau Dayaks were led by their chief Ngelambong and later their son Temenggong Jugah of Lundu.
The outbreak of intratribal warfare coincided roughly with the beginnings of friction with Brunei and contacts with the Illanuns and other sea raiders. However, even prior to this, there had been fighting on several occasions, one of which is the story of Beti (Brauh Ngumbang) of Skrang and their quarrel with the Sebuyau warrior named Chagik who had unsuccessfully courted Riti who became Beti's seventh wife.
Two more occasions that led to the intra-tribal wars involved men from the Saribas who had become involved in quarrels in their own home rivers fled to the Sebuyau settlements. They subsequently involved the Sebuyau people in the dispute with the Saribas Ibans.
The first occasion was between two friends by the name of Brayun versus Janang over a lady known as Bremas, in the Ulu Samu during the chieftain of Saing, the son of Tuah. Brayun slashed one of Janang's ears who then fled to Sebuyau and returned with some Sebuyau people to attack Brayun's house.
Another incident of the Saribas-Sebuyau hostility took place as a result of a quarrel over a tapang tree which was a source of honey at a small Bangkit stream that lies between the Paku and Rimbas rivers in Saribas. There were two longhouses here, one under the leadership of Anal and Sana and the other under Senabong who claimed ownership of the same tapang tree.
Both sides agreed to settle the dispute over a diving (kelam ai) contest which Sana and Anal claimed that Senabong had lost but they disagreed. Senabong people then migrated to Telong Semerang from which they first sent a war party back to their old home to fight against Sana and Anal.
After they had migrated to Sebuyau, Senabong's men again raided Bangkit but this time with the assistance of the Sebuyau people. By now, Sana and Anal were so worried by these attacks that they humbly invited Gerijih (Ai Marang) of Paku to come and live with them in Bangkit. After many more adventures, Gerijih finally defeated Senabong and took their head.
Further clash between the Sebuyau and the people of Saribas took place in the time of Luta who was the son of Unggang (Lebur Menua) of Entanak. According to Saribas oral history, the Sebuyau Dayaks themselves murdered Luta's brother named Ngadan. It should be remembered that more Sebuyau Dayaks lived at other areas in Sarawak including Lundu and Samarahan.
In retaliation for this incident, Luta led the Saribas people to raid Sebuyau where they killed many of the enemies. After the missing of Luta and their brothers Mulok and Ketit in search of the valuable tuchong shell armlet off Cape Datu, the leadership in the Saribas was passed from their family at Entanak to that of Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana (Bayang) of the Padeh tributary.
While chief Nyanggau and their followers living in their longhouse at Lemas in the Undup river, they were attacked and defeated by Indra Lela and their forces from the Skrang. Due to this defeat, Nyanggau and their people fled away to settle at Dau, in Indonesian Borneo.
About 1834, the Skrang led by Orang Kaya Rabong made a raid on Banting Hill, which was inhabited by Balau Dayaks and Malays, who suffered heavy losses. Before the fight, one Balau shaman (medicine man) by the name of Manang Langgong announced loudly that Indra Lela was the instigator for the quarrel between them as follows:
“Why are we fighting? We have no quarrel with each other. It is all the fault of Indra Lela who has been playing a double game!” shouted Langgong.
When Indra Lela heard this, they jumped into the Lingga River to escape being beheaded by the Dayaks. According to a story, they turned into a crocodile, which for years afterwards caught unwary people swimming and bathing in the region.
However, despite this, the battle continued and the Banting Malays and Balau Dayaks were badly defeated. It was during this attack that Chulo (Tarang) a leading warrior of Linggir (Mali Lebu) made their praise-name or ensumbar "Tarang".
Three years later in 1837, Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana made war on the Undup Ibans who had killed their brother Angkum and utterly defeated them, taking many captives and looting a famous guchi jar that was thought to have magical properties. This war was famously called "Bala Besai" (Great Force) because all people from Skrang and Saribas joined the war or "Ngayau Lus" (Extinct War) because the great force attacked not only one longhouse but all longhouses in the Undup to finish them off.
The surviving Undup Ibans took refuge in the Kapuas valley and Lingga and later settled in the area of Salimbau. Only under the rule of Brooke did they return to Banting hill, which had meanwhile been settled by the Skrang.
In retaliation, the Sebuyau Sea Dayaks under Orang Kaya Temenggong Jugah Anak Ngelambong of Lundu attacked Paku on the Saribas at about the time. They attacked Adir's longhouse at Matop but most inhabitants had fled earlier.
Ca. 1838, the Balau Sea Dayaks raided the Saribas and Kalaka (Krian) which is a place east of the Saribas under the leadership of Ijau "Lang" and their son-in-law Orang Kaya Janting to avenge their previous losses at Banting and revenge for their disturbed peace and harmonious lives. However, Ijau "Lang" was defeated by Unal "Bulan" at the Plassan stream in Saribas while Janting defeated the large longhouse of Orang Kaya Temenggong Tandok at the Melupa stream in Kalaka.
Early in 1839 in revenge for the defeat of their father-in-law Ijau "Lang", Janting and all their bravest warriors of Banting set out to fight the Saribas. They had decided to attack both the Paku and Rimbas tributaries in the Saribas. The combined Rimbas and Paku defenders agreed to fight the attackers in the Rimbas tributary at Nanga Undai stream on the night of the next full moon.
However, the Rimbas force came earlier than the Paku force but later than the Balau force who attacked them and capsized their smaller boats straightaway. Many of the Rimbas Ibans were killed including the sons of Orang Kaya Antau and Gun who had come with the war party.
The battles mentioned above were all between various groups of Ibans who lived at the mouths of different rivers. This intermittent struggle continued after 1839. It was because of these that the newly arrived James Brooke found that they could easily get the support of the Sebuyau, Undup and Balau Dayaks in their warfare against the Saribas and Skrang and later on against the Kanowit and Ulu Rajang.
The quarrel and war between the upper and downriver of Batang Ai resulted in the migration back to Batang Kanyau from which the Iban crossed over to the upper Batang Katibas and proceeded to the upper Batang Baleh, a branch of the Batang Rajang.
Rule by Brooke
The Iban fell under the rule of Rajah James Brooke in 1841. Notably, Brooke was not colonizing or ruling on behalf of the British Empire; they ruled Sarawak as an absolute monarch, unconnected to any imperial power. After defeating the rebellion led by Datu Patinggi Ali in Kuching (then Sarawak proper), James Brooke was appointed the Rajah of Sarawak. Their second biggest battle was against the Iban of Saribas and Skrang region led by Linggi "Mali Lebu" at the battle of Beting Maru. After this, James Brooke tried to sign the Saribas Peace Treaty with Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang".
Charles Brooke, the second rajah, was committed to ending purported headhunting and piracy on the part of the Iban, and made numerous attempts to quell such activities with military force which is mostly made of local inhabitants who were exempted from paying local door taxes and could take any heads and other valuable items like jars and brassware. This often led to organized resistance by the Iban. In one instance, the Iban leader Libau (Rentap) resisted Brooke from their fortress on Mount Sadok and only defeated after 3 successive punitive expeditions. The Ibans of Lingga, the Undup Ibans and the Sebuyau fought for Brooke. After Balang "Balai Nyabung" was executed by the Brooke government, their brother Enjop led a rebellion in the Katibas region which was quelled after 3 punitive expeditions. Bantin "Ijau Lelayang was another rebel leader along with Pengulu Ngumbang "Berauh Langit" in the upper Batang Ai. Lintong "Mua Ari" of Kanowit, Kana of Engkari and Kedu "Lang Ngindang" also once rebelled against the Brooke government. Thereafter, the Iban became vital allies of the Brooke dynasty, with the defeat of both Rentap and later the last rebel leader Asun.
Vyner Brooke was the third rajah of Sarawak. They had to quell rebellions by Tabur, Pengulu Merum and Asun of Entabai. They ceded Sarak to the British government after the second World War after winning a mojority vote in the Sarawak State Assembly and local resistance of the secession idea. However, Sir Edward Ardell who was the British governor in Sarawak gave independence to Sarawak on 22 July 1963. Soon Sarawak formed the Federation of Malaysia with Sabah, Malaya and Singapore (which ceded later).
Warfare between Dayak peoples continued to be an intermittent problem for the regime until the Great Peacemaking in Kapit in 1924, when the Rajah Vyner also consolidated the support of the Iban by appointing one of their great war heroes Koh Anak Jubang (1870–1956) to the position of Temenggong or paramount chief. Koh became a member of the advisory council of the state, the Council Negri, and converted to Christianity in 1949. They were awarded the Queen's Medal for Chiefs and the Order of the British Empire.
World War II
During the Japanese occupation of Sarawak from 1942-5 the Iban also played a role in guerilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division where headhunting was temporarily revived towards the end of the war.
At this time Sarawak came under the temporary military administration of the Australian forces, who were particularly prominent in the liberation of Borneo.
Sarawak got its own independence from the British on 22 July 1963 while Sabah got its independence on 31 August 1963.
On 16 September 1963, the Federation of Malaysia was formed between the Federation of Malaya at that time, Sabah (North Borneo), Sarawak and Singapore.
The Cobbold Commission which surveyed Sarawakians about the formation of Malaysia reported a third favours its formation while another third was against it and the remaining third did not form any opinion.
Brunei refused to join the formation of Malaysia and got its independence in 1984 from the British.
Singapore ceded from Malaysia in 1969 to be independent until today.

Giorgio Pini (1 February 1899, in Bologna – 30 March 1987, in Rome) was an Italian politician and journalist.
Biography
Pini studied law at the University of Bologna and served in World War I before joining the Bologna fascio in 1920. Following the establishment of the fascist state, they became an important figure in the journalists syndicate along with the likes of Lando Ferretti and Telesio Interlandi. As a journalist they made their name as an editor for il Resto del Carlino (1928-1930) and Il Gazzettino (1936) before graduating to the editorship of Il Popolo d'Italia in December 1936. They retained this post until 1943, although in the Italian Social Republic Pini, who was a noted moderate, returned to the local Resto. They did however serve as an undersecretary in the Ministry of the Interior in 1944.
Pini was most noted in Fascist Italy for their biography of Benito Mussolini, a hagiography from which Il Duce profited financially. It was translated by Luigi Villari into English as The Official Life on Benito Mussolini in 1939. After the Second World War they released an updated version of this book with Duilio Susmel whilst in 1950 they published Itinerario Tragica 1943/44 which was also pro-fascist in nature. Their continuing justifications for fascism led them to far right politics in the post-war era and they were a founding member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI). Within the MSI they were part of the 'left-wing' tendency that sought to add socialist economics to their rhetoric and when their position was not adopted they left in January 1952 to help launch the Raggruppamento Sociale Repubblicano with Concetto Pettinato. Pini continued their career on the socialist fringes of the far right and frequently attacked the MSI in later years for forging links to regimes in Greece, South Africa and Portugal that they dismissed as reactionary.

Charlotte Independence is an American soccer team based in Charlotte, North Carolina that plays in the USL League One, the third tier of the American soccer pyramid.
The Independence currently play their home games at American Legion Memorial Stadium in the Elizabeth neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina. Previously, the Independence have played at Ramblewood Soccer Complex and Sportsplex at Matthews.
The teams color's are navy, blue, and parchment. The independence wear blue kits at home, and grey on the road.
History
The Charlotte Independence were founded in 2014. They acquired the USL Pro franchise rights for Charlotte from the Charlotte Eagles, who moved into the amateur Premier Development League (PDL).
The Independence took their name from Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Their crest features the year 1775 (the year in which it was purported to have been signed) and a horse-mounted Captain James Jack, who is said to have carried the Declaration to Philadelphia. Supporters were asked to choose one of twelve designs; all 12 featured the year and Jack. The team is nicknamed "The Jacks," in Jack's honor.
Former Dallas Burn head coach Mike Jeffries was hired as the Independence head coach on December 5, 2014.
The Independence lost their first game to the Charleston Battery 3–2 on March 28, 2015, at Transamerica Field. Jack Thompson scored the team's first ever goal in the 13th minute.
After recording their best season in 2021, finishing second in the Atlantic Division, the club decided to drop down to the third tier USL League One for 2022, with the goal of better serving its youth players, as well as the fact that a new expansion franchise in the city Charlotte FC was joining Major League Soccer that season, with whom several Independence players had signed. The Independence signed an affiliation agreement with Charlotte FC for the 2022 season only on April 5. Charlotte FC will loan a minimum of three players.
Stadium
On February 25, 2015, the team announced they would play most of their 2015 season in a temporary soccer stadium being assembled at Ramblewood Soccer Complex, near the I-77/I-485 interchange in the southwest corner of the city. After splitting its first five home games between the University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Transamerica Field and Winthrop University's Eagle Field, the Independence won their Ramblewood debut on June 20, 2015.
On February 1, 2017, the team announced they would play in a permanent 2,300 seat soccer stadia at the Sportsplex at Matthews in Matthews, North Carolina.
In 2016, the club began working with Mecklenburg County on a refurbishment of American Legion Memorial Stadium. The club subsequently signed a 10-year lease with the county for Memorial Stadium to become its new home, beginning in 2021.

Ownership
In 2018, retired Nucor steel company chairperson Dan DiMicco became the majority owner. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, DiMicco sent out a series of "deeply offensive" tweets blaming the subsequent protests on "Antifa", George Soros and the Chinese Communist Party. DiMicco went on to spread a series of racist conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and false claims of election fraud. Supporters of the club responded strongly to these statements, with the official supporters' group condemning DiMicco, and the Independent Supporters Council urged the league to "take action" against him.
At the same time, the club struggled to pay its staff members, even as it collected more than $350,000 in Paycheck Protection Program loans. Staff members were paid late if at all.
On March 29, 2021, the club announced that several owners, including DiMicco, were "in the process" of selling their ownership stakes but are "in no rush" to do so. When the Independence opened their new stadium in July 2021, supporters hung a #DiMiccoOut banner from the parking structure overlooking the field.
Club culture
The club's original independent supporters' group, "Jack's Militia", was founded in 2012 to promote soccer in Charlotte. When the Charlotte Independence were announced, Jack's Militia became the new team's official supporters group. Jack's Militia criticized the club for a muted response to the George Floyd protests in 2020, and condemned majority team owner Dan DiMicco for their statements. In 2021, the Independence introduced an official members' rewards program called "Jack's Brigade". Despite the similar name, the club insisted that it was not intended to replace the supporters group, but to provided benefits to season ticket holders
A second self-described independent, grassroots supporters group, "The Mecklenburg Reserves," was formed in July 2021. The Mecklenburg Reserves occupy section 114 alongside the Independence Ultras.
The Independence compete for the Southern Derby against their rival, the Charleston Battery. The derby takes place over each team's final home game, and is decided on a points system. If the two games end in a tie, it is then awarded to the team who leads in aggregate goals. The independence won their first Southern Derby in 2021.
The teams games are broadcast on ESPN+.

The Tower of David is the northeast tower of the Citadel of Jerusalem. It has been identified as either the Phasael Tower or the Hippicus Tower described by Josephus.
The towers named Phasael, Hippicus and Mariamne were situated in the northwest corner of the so-called First Wall, the Hasmonean and Herodian city wall protecting the Western Hill of Jerusalem. They were situated close to where the Jaffa Gate is today and were built by Herod the Great at the same time they built their immediately adjacent royal palace. These towers protected the main entrance to the city, as well as the palace, constituting a potential last refuge for the king. All three towers have vanished except for the base of the Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower, upon which the present "Tower of David" rests.
The towers were named by Herod after their brother Phasael, their friend and general Hippicus who had fallen in battle, and their favourite wife, Mariamne.
When the city was razed in 70 AD, all three towers were left standing, in order to show off the strength of the fortifications the Roman army had to overcome. With time though, only one of Herod's towers survived - either Phasael, or according to some, including archaeologist Hillel Geva who excavated the Citadel, Hippicus. However, during the Byzantine period, the remaining tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the Tower of David - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as Mount Zion, presumed it to be David's palace mentioned in . The Citadel was gradually built up under Muslim and Crusader rule and acquired the basis of its present shape in 1310, under the Mamluk sultan Malik al-Nasir. Suleiman the Magnificent later constructed the monumental gateway in the east that you enter through today. The minaret, a prominent Jerusalem landmark, was added between 1635 and 1655, and took over the title of "Tower of David" in the nineteenth century, so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone.
On the site itself, from the top of the Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower, there are good views over the excavations inside the Citadel and out to the Old City, as well as into the distance south and west. Of the original tower itself, some sixteen courses of the original stone ashlars can still be seen rising from ground level, upon which were added smaller stones in a later period, which added significantly to its height. On the way up, a terrace overlooking the diggings has plaques identifying the different periods of all the remains. These include part of the Hasmonean city wall, a Roman cistern, and the ramparts of the Umayyad citadel, which held out for five weeks before falling to the Crusaders in 1099.

The Corpus Christi Terminal Railroad is a terminal railroad originally created in 1924 to facilitate heavy bulk freight cargo traffic flow from the recently completed deep water port channel of the new Corpus Christi Port. Wishing to maximize freight handling potential while holding down rates, the Port Authority decided to allow traffic to all of its docks and facilities by no less than three competing railroads, the Southern Pacific, the Missouri Pacific and the Tex-Mex railroads. To accomplish this the Port of Corpus Christi Authority built its own trackage along the channel and to the docks, and allowed all three carriers access to it. While the Authority's scheme at first heightened tensions among the three railroads, they eventually began to cooperate, assuring a good flow of bulk freight and the eventual success of the Port facilities.
On August 3, 1997, Rail Link, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming., leased the lines and took over day-to-day operation of the railroad, though the of physical trackage is still owned by the Port of Corpus Christi Authority. As of 2007 railroad connections existed with the Union Pacific, BNSF and Texas Mexican railroads.

Dance for the Sun, Yoga Songs for Kids, is the self-released 2006 debut album by Kira Willey.
Background
Willey initially began writing music in the forms of lullabies to their daughter. After a few years passed, they started playing the guitar, writing more often, and had begun teaching Yoga classes in New York City to children. The songs for Dance for the Sun were written with their class in mind, and after building up a collection, Willey began using these songs as a musical guide to complement their class, and received positive feedback from both their daughter and their class. When recording the album, Willey enlisted the help of their brother for bass vocals, their cousin for percussion and production, and several of the children in their class to provide vocals, nicknamed the "OmGirls". Dance for the Sun was released on December 1, 2006 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The album is primarily 15 tracks, the ones which appear first. The remainder are bonus tracks, which are of live recordings in their Yoga class that include children singing along and participating. The booklet contains educational illustrations of Yoga positions and poses that coincide with the bonus tracks.
The song "Colors" was popularized by its use in a Dell computers commercial, called "Portraits". The 31-second commercial showcased the company's laptop model, which featured casing in a variety of colors, presumably to match an aspect of the owner or their personality. This was part of a campaign that Dell ran, which asked consumers "What's your color?".
Review
Among critics of children's music, Dance for the Sun has received positive reviews, but it is said to be enjoyable by listeners of any age, and in the August 2007, Cookie Magazine said that Dance for the Sun was "joyful, upbeat, and eminently danceable. Willey's vocals have a breezy coffeehouse quality that will appeal to listeners young and old alike."
Dance for the Sun has won several awards; an Independent Music Award for Best Children's Album, as well as a 2008 Parent's Choice Award. The track Caterpillar Caterpillar has also won an Independent Music Award and a Children's Music Web Award for Best Song.

Hornblende gabbro is an intrusive rock similar to normal gabbro (gabbro sensu stricto). In the QAPF classification it falls within the gabbro field, in which quartz makes up 0% to 5% of the QAPF mineral fraction, plagioclase makes up 90% or more of the total feldspar content, and the plagioclase is calcium-rich (%An > 50). Hornblende gabbro is distinguished from other subtypes of gabbro by having a composition almost entirely of plagioclase and hornblende, with olivine and pyroxene each making up less than 5% of its mineral content.

Divya is now a popular TV actor, who returns to meet Raj. They learn that Raj is married to Sarita (Srishty Rode). Divya thinks that Raj has moved and they decide to marry Gaurav (Ayaz Khan).
They do not know that Raj and Sarita, even after ten years of marriage, have not consummated the relationship. Raj still loves Divya. Sarita challenges Divya: before marrying Gaurav, Divya has to make Raj love Sarita. Divya accepts this and comes to Raj's house to stay, trying their best to bring them close to Sarita. But the efforts fail and Divya goes away because they do not want to be responsible for breaking Sarita's marriage.
Feeling that they have been very unfair to Sarita, Raj decides to be a good friend to them and help them find happiness with a new partner. Raj fixes Sarita's marriage to Vikrant Suryavanshi (Eijaz Khan), who is a rich widower and their little son, Abhimaan, adores Sarita and wants them to become their mother. Meanwhile, Raj suddenly realizes that they love Sarita and tells them about their feelings. They break their engagement and returns to Raj. However, when Raj's younger sister gets into trouble, Sarita is forced to ask for Vikrant's help who agrees on condition that Sarita marry him. Having no choice, they agree. Raj is bitterly disappointed.
Vikrant and Sarita get married. Divya makes an re-entry. Raj visits Divya and slips an engagement ring onto their finger to prove to Sarita that they have moved on. When Raj discovers the truth behind Sarita's marriage to Vikrant, they ask them to elope with them but they refuse. Sarita falls in love with Vikrant but owing to a misunderstanding Vikrant becomes upset with them assuming they still have feelings for Raj. Raj sees the error of their ways and gets back together with Divya. Vikrant finally realises Sarita loves them but Sarita is accused of plotting the murder of Kajal and is arrested.
Vikrant realises that Sarita is innocent and helps them escape from the police. While they are on the run, they take refuge in Raj and Divya's house. Divya ultimately realises who the real killer is; Sarita is released. Vikrant, Sarita, Raj and Divya all live happily ever after.

Patrick Joseph Bourke Crowley (20 October 1923 – 9 June 1981) was a New Zealand rugby union player. A flanker, Crowley represented Auckland at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national rugby union team, from 1949 to 1950.
Career
At the age of 19, Crowley made their first class debut for an army division team in 1943. They then went on to represent Auckland from 1946 to 1950, making thirty-four appearances for the provincial side. In their first season with Auckland, they would also play for the North Island team in the annual North vs South rugby union match. Crowley played for the North Island every year afterward, apart from 1949.
Their performances saw them being called up for the national side, making their debut for the All Blacks during their tour of South Africa in 1949. The following year, they were part of the squad to face the British Lions in their tour of New Zealand and Australia. In an interview with The Scotsman, Angus Black was complimentary of the flanker, recalling: "Crowley was very good. I spent most of my day getting tackled hard. I was up in the air more often than I was on the ground. Crowley sorted us all out." The third test was to be Crowley's career defining performance as an Black. Due to injuries, New Zealand had to play much of the match with six forwards, and Crowley ended having to do the work of two men instead of one. Crowley scored two tries against the Lions, the first was in the second test, and the second was when they were playing for Auckland.
Crowley retired from rugby union later that year at the age of 26, having played sixty-four first class matches.
Personal life
Crowley was the grandfather of professional wrestler Cheree Crowley, better known by the ring names Evie and Dakota Kai.

The All About Jazz review by Glenn Astarita stated, "it is a joy to delve into the band's multidirectional evolutionary processes." The Boston Phoenix'''s Ed Hazell
stated, "Threadgill has mixed these elements before, but not all in one working band, and he's rarely given themselves as much solo room in music so heavily composed."<ref>Hazell, E. Changing Tunes: Two Sides of Henry Threadgill The Boston Phoenix, December 13–20, 2001</ref>

Naughton was a product of Sheffield United's academy before breaking into their first team in 2008, transferring to Tottenham Hotspur the following year. They have represented England at under-21 level as well as having loan spells with Gretna, Middlesbrough, Leicester City and Norwich City.
Club career
Sheffield United
Naughton was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. They were a product of Sheffield United's centre of excellence and academy, having trained with the club the age of seven. They attended an England under-15 training camp during the 2004–05 season, and over the years has become a regular in the Academy and reserve teams. They captained their club's academy team to the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup in the 2006–07 season.
They were signed by Scottish Premier League team Gretna on loan in January 2008, and made their league debut for Gretna against Rangers on 16 January 2008. They played regularly for the rest of the season at the troubled Scottish club who were placed into administration during their tenure there. Despite this Naughton continued for Gretna as the Blades agreed to cover insurance payments needed to allow them to play. Naughton played 19 times for the club but was unable to help them avoid relegation.
Naughton made their first team debut for the Blades the following season, coming on as a second-half substitute in the first round of the League Cup against Port Vale in August 2008. In their second substitute appearance for the club they netted the winning goal in a 2–1 League Cup success over Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town.
Naughton made their league debut on 20 September 2008 against Norwich City, they then went on to make their first start for Sheffield United in their 2–1 victory over Watford on 27 September 2008, gaining the man of the match award. From that point they cemented their place in the starting eleven and was virtually ever present for the rest of the season, becoming first choice at right back whilst also making a couple of appearances in midfield and finishing the season playing at left back to cover for the injured Gary Naysmith. Their successful season was rewarded when they were voted Young Player of the Year by the United supporters club, was runner-up to Matthew Kilgallon in the senior Player of the Year award and was included in the Championship PFA Team of the Year.
Tottenham Hotspur
Despite major interest from Everton, Naughton signed for Tottenham Hotspur in July 2009 along with fellow Sheffield United player Kyle Walker for a combined fee of £9 million. They made their Spurs non-competitive debut against Barcelona in the 2009 Wembley Cup which ended in a 1–1 draw. They came on as a substitute in the 94th minute in the match against West Ham United, which was the club's third match in the 2009–10 season to mark their debut in the Premier League. Naughton then signed a six-month loan deal with Middlesbrough on 1 February 2010. They made their debut in the 1–1 draw against Ipswich Town.
After returning to Tottenham they were loaned out again initially until January to another Championship club, Leicester City. They made their debut on 16 October in a 1–1 draw against Hull City. In their second match for Leicester City, against Leeds United, they scored the second league goal of their career. They scored again for Leicester City in the 5–1 win against Doncaster Rovers. They also scored against Barnsley in a 4–1 win on 5 February with a 30-yard drive into the top corner. Naughton also scored a 25-yard rocket to equalise for Leicester in the M69 derby against Coventry. On 12 March, Naughton scored Leicester's 3rd goal in their 3–0 win over Scunthorpe. Leicester extended Naughton's loan until the end of the 2010–11 season on 8 January after a permanent move failed to materialise. In April, Naughton was named as right back in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for the second time in three years and won the Leicester City Young Player of the Year award.
On 21 July 2011, Naughton signed a season-long loan deal to Premier League team Norwich City from Tottenham Hotspur. They were handed squad number 25 for their year in Norfolk. Naughton was an unused substitute for the Canaries opening Premier League fixture against Wigan Athletic on 13 August 2011. Naughton displaced Russell Martin as the first-choice right back, and started the matches against Stoke, Chelsea and West Brom. In all, they made twenty-three appearances over the course of the season at either right back or centre back.
Naughton made their first full league start for Tottenham on 16 September 2012 away to Reading, a match in which Tottenham won 3–1.
Swansea City
Naughton joined Swansea City on 22 January 2015 for a reported £5 million. Naughton quickly established themselves as first choice right back for Swansea, before being ruled out for the remainder of the 2014–15 Premier League season with ankle ligament damage in a 3–1 victory over Hull City.
International career
In November 2008, after only eleven league appearances, Naughton was called up to the England under-21 team for the friendly against the Czech Republic under-21 team at Bramall Lane. They duly made their England debut, coming on as a 60th-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory. Naughton is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland national team.

HMS Delphinium (K77) was a Flower-class corvette built for the Royal Navy (RN) from 1940-1946. From 1941 to 1943 they were active in the Mediterranean as an escort to convoys supporting the Eighth Army and the invasion of Sicily. From mid-1943 onwards they were on convoy escort duties between Africa, the Mediterranean and the United Kingdom; and Atlantic convoys between North America and the United Kingdom. They escorted a total of 68 convoys.
Design and construction
The early Flower class corvettes, such as Delphinium were long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was aft. Displacement was about standard and full load. Two Admiralty Three-drum water tube boilers fed steam to a Vertical Triple Expansion Engine rated at which drove a single propeller shaft. This gave a speed of . 200 tons of oil were carried, giving a range of at .
Design armament was a single BL 4-inch Mk IX naval gun forward and a single 2-pounder "pom-pom" anti-aircraft cannon aft, although the pom-poms were not available until 1941, so early Flowers such as Delphinium were completed with improvised close-range anti aircraft armament such as Lewis guns or Vickers .50 machine guns instead.
Delphinium was one of the first group of Flower-class corvettes modified for magnetic minesweeping In February 1941, they were also fitted with SA Type A Mark II gear (a submersible A-frame and bucket) to detonate acoustic mines. Delphinium retained anti-submarine capacity, although there was a reduction in the number of depth charges carried.
Delphinium formed part of the initial 26-ship order for Flower-class corvettes placed on 25 July 1939 under the 1939/40 Naval estimates. They were laid down at Henry Robb's, Leith shipyard on 31 October 1939, was launched on 6 June 1940 and commissioned on 15 November 1940.
Service history
In February 1942, Delphinium was adopted by Torrington and District, Devon, as part of a warship week National Savings Campaign. Between 1941 and 1945, Delphinium escorted a total of 68 convoys.
After commissioning, Delphinium escorted four Atlantic Convoys in January 1941. In February 1941 they joined convoy OG-53 as an escort during passage to Gibraltar. In December 1941, Delphinium was part of the 11th corvette group based in Alexandria.
Between March and June 1942, they escorted 11 convoys between Tobruk and Alexandria supplying the Eighth Army in North Africa.
In January 1942 (escorting convoy AT-16), Delphinium (along with ) ran aground in Great Pass Alexandria. They were refloated with minor damage. On 20 May 1942, the German Submarine U-431 spotted convoy AT-46 about 65 miles east of Tobruk and torpedoed Eocene. Delphinium and the other convoy escorts ( and HMS Falk) dropped depth charges over the suspected position of the U-431, however it remained undetected and managed to escape.
In June 1942, Delphinium took part in Operation Vigorous, escorting supply convoy MW11 from the eastern Mediterranean to supply Malta.
Between June 1942 and July 1943, Delphinium did not escort any major convoys and in September 1942, was organised as the lead of the 3rd Escort Group assigned to vessels sailing between Port Said and Alexandria. The other vessels in this group were HMS Gloxinia, the Royal Hellenic Navy destroyers and Spetsai, , , the minesweeping trawlers and , and the anti-submarine whaler HMS Klo.
On 11 February 1943, the Dutch Tanker, Saroena was torpedoed by German submarine U-81, and caught fire. Saroena was run aground in the St. George Bay, near Beirut and Delphinium assisted in the salvage operation.
In July 1943, Delphinium returned to convoy escort duty as part of the Allied invasion of Sicily (convoy KMS 019a), escorting a convoy of tankers sent to re-supply the invasion fleet.
In November 1943, Delphinium was made part of the 47th Escort Group, together with the Royal Hellenic Navy corvettes and , HMS Inver (K302), HMSAS Southern Seas and a vessel from the 19th Minesweeping Flotilla.
From August 1943 to May 1945, Delphinium escorted 14 convoys sailing between the Port Said and Chesapeake Bay (GUS/UGS), 20 Atlantic convoys between the Mediterranean and Liverpool (MKS/KMS), and a further 15 convoys variously between the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone (OS) as well as within the United Kingdom (TBC/BTC).

The Ferrée river is a tributary on the east bank of the Montmorency River. It flows in the municipalities of L'Ange-Gardien and Boischatel, in the La Côte-de-Beaupré Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The upper part of this valley is served by Chemin des Sucreries, by Chemin du Nord-de-la-Ligne Hydro and by a few forest roads. Forestry, in particular the exploitation of sugar factories, constitutes the main economic activity in this valley; second, recreational tourism. While the lower part crosses the northern sector of the urban part of Boischatel.
The surface of the Ferrée river is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March; however, safe traffic on the ice is generally from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.
Geography
The Ferrée river originates from a forest stream (altitude: ). This source is located in the heart of a mountain with three peaks (379 m, 385 m and 398 m) in the municipality of L'Ange-Gardien, at:
north-east of the Montmorency River;
north-west of the confluence of the Ferrée river and the Montmorency River;
north-west of the north-west bank of the St. Lawrence River.
From its source, the Ferrée river descends on , with a drop of according to the following segments:
Upper part of the Ferrée river (segment of )
north in L'Ange-Gardien, in a deep valley, to a bend in the river, corresponding to two streams, one of which comes from the southwest and the other North;
in forest territory to the east in a deep valley up to a bend in the river, then south-east, to the confluence of the Rivière la Retenue ( coming from the northeast);
Lower part of the Ferrée river (segment of )
to the south in a plain in forest territory by first forming a loop to the east, collecting a stream (coming from the west), crossing the Chemin du Pont- à-Mathias, successively forming a loop towards the east and another towards the west, up to a stream (coming from the northwest);
to the south by forming two loops to the east, up to the Boischatel limit corresponding to a stream (coming from the west);
in Boischatel, first towards the south in the forest zone by forming a loop straddling the inter-municipal limit between L'Ange-Gardien and Boischatel, and bypassing the northern part on the East side from the urban area of Boischatel, then south-west across a small artificial lake, to the dam at its mouth;
to the southwest by crossing rue des Rochers, then forming three loops to the southeast by crossing the Royal Québec golf course to the bridge on rue Notre-Dame ;
west in a small S, to its mouth.
The Ferrée river flows on the northeast bank of the Montmorency river, opposite the hamlet "Les Roches-Plates" located on the southwest bank.
From the confluence of the Ferrée river, the current flows over generally towards the southeast by the course of the Montmorency River, up to the northwest bank of the St. Lawrence River.
The Ferrée river has the particularity of having an underground section on . These losses feed the Boischatel cave. During major floods, the section between the losses of the Ferrée River and the Montmorency river can flow in the open air.
Toponymy
This river was formerly designated "Rivière Laval" and "Rivière Ferry".
The toponym "Rivière Ferrée" was formalized on August 14, 1997 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Semecarpus magnificus is a species of plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is endemic to New Guinea.
Description
According to the original describer Karl Schumann, Semecarpus magnificus is a tree growing to 4–6 m tall. Its leaves are 0.7–1.2 m long and 10.5–20 cm wide near the tip. They are crowded together at the ends of the branches, as in Clavija, Theophrasta and other similar genera. Schumann only had access to male flowers. They are grouped in inflorescences 60–80 cm long, that are composed of distant branches laden with flower clusters. The calyx is about 1 mm long. The petals are 3 mm long, the stamens 4 mm. The rudimentary ovary is about 1 mm long. The fruit is about 3 cm long, including the hypocarpium, and 2.5 cm across.
Taxonomy
Semecarpus magnificus was first described by Karl Schumann in 1889, based on a collection by Max Hollrung made during a research expedition to New Guinea from 1886 to 1888. Schumann used the feminine form of the specific epithet, magnifica, as also noted by the International Plant Names Index, which alters it to magnificus, in agreement with the masculine genus name.
Distribution
Semecarpus magnificus is endemic to New Guinea. It was first observed in what was then Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, in the northeast of the island.

Silvia Paracchini FRSE is a geneticist who researches the contribution of genetic variation to neurodevelopmental traits such as dyslexia and human handedness.
Education
As an undergraduate, Paracchini studied Biological Sciences at the University of Pavia, Italy. During this time they undertook an ERASMUS scholarship project at the Technical University of Denmark. They obtained their DPhil in Human Genetics from the University of Oxford in 2003.
Career and research
After obtaining their doctorate, Paracchini held a post-doctoral research position with the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics from 2003 to 2011. In 2011, they were awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. Them research group at the University of St Andrews School of Medicine explores the genetic underpinnings of human behavioral traits like handedness, and neurodevelopment disorders like dyslexia by combining large genetic screenings for quantitative measures followed by gene function characterization. In 2008, while working at the University of Oxford, they carried out a study on reading abilities in a cohort of 7 to 9 years old British children. The research established that the same variants of the KIAA0319 gene, already associated with dyslexia, affect the ability to read, even in the absence of a formal diagnosis of dyslexia.
In 2014 they proposed that the same mechanisms that establish left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry and contribute to handedness
. They also contributed to the largest study of human handedness in the world giving the best estimate of 10.6% for left-handedness.

The BMW 269, also known as the BMW F269, is an open-wheel Formula 2 race car. It was designed, developed and built by Lola Cars for BMW to participate in the 1969 and 1970 Formula 2 European Championships, as well as the 1969 Formula One World Championship, where it competed in the 1969 German Grand Prix.
Description
The need for BMW to develop an additional single-seater to confirm the growth period in Formula 2, prompted the Bavarian house to build, always supported by Lola, an evolution of the already used Lola T102. The car was therefore designed in 1969 by Len Terry, the single-seaters were partially built by Lola and assembled by BMW itself to be then used mainly in Formula 2 competitions. The engine was a BMW M12 from 4-cylinder in-line with an output of approx delivered @ 10,700 rpm.
Racing history
The BMW 269 made its first appearance in Formula 2 during the 1969 Madrid Grand Prix, where, however, due to technical problems, it was not used by Hubert Hahne who had to start with the reserve T102. In Austria at Tulln, Hahne themselves finished seventh, sanctioning the best result of the season for the single-seater in Formula 2. With the possibility of being able to field even lower category cars in the home Grand Prix of the Nürburgring, the car was also used in Formula 1 and BMW lined up three cars with Hubert Hahne, Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester. During Friday's free practice at the German Grand Prix, Mitter went off the track and crashed into the barriers, and was killed instantly. The accident forced the Bavarian team to withdraw from the race. After this brief interlude in the top motorsport championship, the 269 driven by Hahne, Jo Siffert and Quester continued the Formula 2 season with 4 retirements, without being able to score any points. The beginning of 1970 saw the car conquer the first points finishes, with Hahne who, after failing to qualify at Thruxton, finished fourth overall at Hockenheim, and with Questerwho after retiring in Germany, where they had also set the fastest lap, finished fifth in Barcelona. The car's first victory came with Hahne on 14 June at Hockenheim, in the untitled race of the Rhine Cup. The rest of the season, however, was anonymous for the car that with a series of withdrawals due to accidents and mechanical problems will no longer be able to score useful results for the team which will see, more and more frequently, prefer to field the definitive evolution of the single-seater, the BMW 270, which will make BMW gain affirmed competitiveness with the first, then with the retirement of the house become the last, successes in Formula 2.

Balmiki Prasad Singh (born 1 January 1942) was the 14th Governor of Sikkim, India.  They are an author, thinker and a retired IAS officer. They have written number of books and articles relating to Indian culture, in particular the culture of North-East India. Among their prominent books are Bahudha and the post 9/11 World and The problem of change: a study of North East India. They presided over the four-day Global Buddhist Conference in 2011 to mark the 2,600th year of Buddha's enlightenment. Around 1,000 Buddhist scholars, thinkers and followers from over 30 countries were present. B.P. Singh is also the principal architect of the Bahudha Approach, which outlines a path towards a harmonious world, as against the clash of civilizations.
Singh writes:
Pluralism could be the closest equivalent to Bahudha in the English language. But Bahudha is more than pluralism. For, the Bahudha approach is both a celebration of diversity and an attitude of mind that respects another person's point of view. Dialogue is central to this approach.
Education and family background
Singh was born on 1 January 1942 in Begusarai, Bihar. They were educated in a village school and later at the universities of Patna and Oxford. They passed their M.A. in political science from University of Patna in 1960, standing First Class with record marks and also winning several gold medals. At Oxford University, they obtained a Master of Arts degree. They became a lecturer in the Post-Graduate Department of Political Science at Patna University at the age of nineteen.
Singh hails from a family of activists for Indian independence. Their father, Harbansh Narayan Singh was an activist who had participated in the Quit India Movement (1942-1944) and courted imprisonment during this period.
Singh was married to Karuna on 10 March 1961 at Patna while they were in their teens. While B.P. Singh hails from a family of activists (not political leaders), the father of Karuna was Rai Bahadur Ganesh Prasad Rai, who retired as Commissioner in the Government of Bihar. Both these families owned agricultural land but have since joined the services. The two families, however, still have deep roots in their respective villages.
Singh and Karuna have three children: two daughters, Sumita and Preeti and Rajeev, a son and six grandchildren. While Rajeev is a member of the Indian Revenue Service (IT) and currently a Commissioner, their wife Kirti is a housewife. Sumita teaches physics in the Post-graduate Department of the Patna Science College, while their husband, P.N. Rai, IPS, is A.D.G of Police in Bihar. Preeti, a housewife, is married to Rajeev Ranjan, IAS, who is Additional chief secretary in the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Among the six grandchildren, Tanvi Rai is pursuing a Ph.D. in Finance at Wharton Business School in the United States on full fellowship; Aditya Ranjan is a graduate of MIT (on a full scholarship) and is currently attending Stanford Graduate School of Business for their MBA on a full scholarship; Karan Rai is pursuing their studies at Stanford University; and Akhil and Kaustubh are pursuing B.Tech. in VIT and BITS Pilani respectively.

Miss Bikini of the Universe is an international beauty pageant held annually in Beihai, Guangxi, China.
In 2009 the pageant was held from September 30 to October 6. It was planned to make a Guinness World Record with a T-shaped runway. The theme was "Taking Beauty to Beihai and Introducing Beihai to the World".
In 2006 the pageant was held from August 22 to 26, 2006 at the Silver Beach of Beihai. The winner was Olena Zhygan (Олена Жиган) of Ukraine. That year the competition gained worldwide attention because the competitors included Mariyah Moten, a Pakistani woman now living in the USA. Mariyah was the first Pakistani woman to compete in an international bikini beauty pageant. Pakistan being a Muslim nation does not let women take part in bikini pageants. The fact that Moten wore a bikini and held the Pakistani flag caused an uproar in their native country.
In 2005 Marijana Stanojkovska (Маријана Станојковска) of Macedonia was the winner. Miss Turkey Deniz Sirin and Miss Ukraine Olga Shylovanova (Ольга Шiлoвaнoвa) were the first and second runners-up.

1997 was an American pop/rock band from Chicago, Illinois, United States, who were formed in October 2005. They released three albums between 2007 and 2009, but broke up the following year.
History
Several of 1997's members previously played in the Chicago bands Constance, Funeral Etiquette, and October Fall. Their name 1997 was discussed widely, but via the band's MySpace blog, they have rejected all claims of the name's origination. They have since stated that the name came from the younger brother of Caleb Pepp (main vocals/guitar), as a suggestion for a previous band they had started. They began practicing together in October 2005, and after strong local performances signed with Victory Records in October 2006.
Victory issued their debut album ...A Better View of the Rising Moon. on April 17, 2007. In April 2007, as the group toured the US with The Audition and The Graduate. The title of the album comes from a haiku by Mizuta Masahide:
Since my house burned down,
I now own a better view
Of the rising moon.
Keyboardist/vocalist Kerri Mack left the group in April 2007 after recording the album, and was replaced with keyboardist/vocalist Alida Marroni. Kerri later performed under the band name Mega Deft where they perform at local clubs as well as wrote music for Tiny Riots.
The group benefited heavily from online buzz and ferocious touring; it was named band of the day by SPIN on April 27, 2007, and has received many reviews from press sites. In the fall of 2007, the group toured the US with Aiden, Still Remains, and Drop Dead, Gorgeous.
The band's second album, On the Run, was released on May 27, 2008, again on Victory. The band toured in support of the album, playing several dates on the 2008 Vans Warped Tour. On August 5, 2008, the band posted an entry on their MySpace Blog informing fans that Alida Marroni and Alan Goffinski had parted with the group on July 28. The first signs of trouble apparently came after the band failed to appear for a hometown show in Chicago in support of their second album. The band asked keyboard and vocalist Alida to leave the band because friendship between them and the band fell through, and boyfriend Alan Goffinski, the band's bassist, left with them
Marroni was replaced by Arthi Meera, who, after only planning to tour with the band until they found a replacement, was made a permanent member. Matt Wysocki, the band's photographer, joined as their bassist in September 2008. Meera continues to perform around Chicago open mics and has a band with their brother called "fair and kind". In February 2009, the band went on a short US tour with Death in the Park and Galaxy Down.
The band recorded their third album, titled Notes from Underground, which was released on October 13, 2009. As of that month, Wysocki was replaced by Brian Osters, and in the following month, Kevin Thomas was no longer in the band. They toured in November and December 2009. They were set to begin an extensive tour in January 2010, but Caleb Pepp announced that the band was "taking an indefinite break from playing shows" and felt that they "need to do some soul-searching and find some new ways to express" themselves. In March 2010, Pepp and the band announced their break up via Myspace.
Caleb is now playing in the band Young Coconut, and has released 7 solo EPs under the name &caleb. Caleb, Cody, and their merchandise girl Jazmin have started an artist community called "The Lily Pad" and a record label called MTFE Records.
Matt Wysocki is now creating under the name Ruby Heart Drips, and their art can be found at rubyheartdrips.com.

Dylan Blujus (born January 22, 1994) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently playing for the Utica Comets in the American Hockey League (AHL).
Playing career
Blujus originally played major junior hockey with the Brampton Battalion in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Following their second season with the Battalion in 2011–12, contributing 7 goals and 34 points in 66 games, Blujus was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the second round, 40th overall, in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.
In their fourth and final junior season in 2013–14, moving with the Battalion franchise to North Bay, Blujus recorded 30 points in 50 games from the blueline. Helping the Battalion reach the OHL finals against the Guelph Storm, they registered a career high 4 goals and 10 post-season points in 22 games. On May 22, 2014, Blujus was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
Blujus played the duration of their entry-level contract primarily with the Lightning's AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. In their final season under contract with the Lightning in the 2016–17 season, Blujus was limited to just 28 games through injury. Unable to progress up the depth chart with Tampa Bay, they were not tendered a qualifying offer at the conclusion of their contract, becoming a free agent.
Un-signed over the following summer, Blujus agreed to begin the 2017–18 season in the ECHL, joining the Jacksonville Icemen on October 14, 2017. In a top-pairing role, Blujus registered 7 points through 21 games before returning to the AHL in securing a professional try-out contract with the Utica Comets, affiliate to the Vancouver Canucks, on December 13, 2017. Enjoying a successful loan period, contributing with 8 points in 14 games from the blueline, Blujus was signed to an AHL contract for the remainder of the season with Utica on January 17, 2018. Enjoying a rebound season with the Comets, Blujus was signed to a one-year contract extension with the club on June 7, 2018.
In the 2018–19 season, adding a veteran presence Blujus collected 8 points through 43 games, they agreed to return for their third season with the Comets, signing a one-year contract extension on June 17, 2019.
As a free agent entering the pandemic-delayed 2020–21 season, Blujus opted to stay close to home in signing a one-year contract with their third AHL club, the Rochester Americans on January 18, 2021. In 21 games from the blueline with the Americans, Blujus contributed with 2 points.
On September 17, 2021, Blujus was signed as a free agent to a one-year contract to continue in the AHL with the Milwaukee Admirals. In the 2021–22 season, Blujus appeared in 43 regular season games contributing with 11 points. They were loaned briefly to the ECHL with the Florida Everblades before returning to the Admirals and making 7 playoff appearances.
As a free agent, Blujus left the Admirals and returned for a second tenure with the Utica Comets on July 18, 2022.

Two human polls comprised the 1956 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.
Legend
AP Poll
The final AP Poll was released on December 3, at the end of the 1956 regular season, weeks before the major bowls. The AP would not release a post-bowl season final poll regularly until 1968.
Final Coaches' Poll
The final UP Coaches Poll was released prior to the bowl games, on December 4.
Oklahoma received 26 of the 35 first-place votes; Tennessee received five, Iowa three, and Miami one.
Prior to the 1975 season, the Big Ten and Pacific Coast (later AAWU / Pac-8) conferences allowed only one postseason participant each, for the Rose Bowl.
The Ivy League has prohibited its members from participating in postseason football since the league was officially formed in 1954.

Sir Robert Travers ( – 13 November 1647) was an Irish judge, soldier and politician of the early seventeenth century. Despite their unenviable reputation for corruption, they had a highly successful career until the outbreak of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when they went into opposition to King Charles I. They fought on the side of the Irish Parliament, and was killed at the Battle of Knocknanuss. They were a nephew of the poet Edmund Spenser, and was the founder of a notable military dynasty.
Background
Robert was born in County Cork about 1596, the eldest son of John Travers of Ballinamona, who was Registrar of the Consistory Court of Cork and of the Diocese of Ross, and their wife Sarah Spenser, sister of Edmund Spenser. Their grandfather is recorded as one Brian Travers who came to Ireland from Lancashire in the middle of the sixteenth century. However, there is little evidence for this and a number of writers dispute the link to the Lancashire family. Sarah Spenser came to Ireland in about 1588 to keep house for their brother Edmund, who after the downfall of the Earl of Desmond was granted a part of the Desmond inheritance, including Kilcolman Castle. Edmund granted a portion of their lands to John and Sarah as a wedding gift. Both were buried at Cork in Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, where Robert erected a memorial to them, but the building has been so much altered since then that no trace of the memorial survives. A St. Fin Barre's chapter record dated 2 September 1623 shows that George Lee, Dean, and the Chapter, granted to Robert Travers, of Mooretown, in Ibawn, Esq., a place of burial in the south side of the chancel of our Church, next the south wall at the window now the most eastern of the same side, in which place John Travers, father of the said Robert, as well as Sara Spenser, als. Travers, mother of Robert, with their paternal grandmother, as also their two brothers are buried. In which place the said Robert, with our consent, heretofore had erected a marble tomb; until the next walls of the ruin being destroyed through age, in order that they may be repaired anew, the said monument was removed for a time for the sake of safety. The record notes that Sara Spenser is said to have been sister of the poet.
Early career
Robert was educated at the University of Oxford, and took there a degree in civil law. Since most though not all of the commanders in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms had seen military service, it is possible that they served as a soldier for a time. Unusually for the eldest son of a landowning family, they decided on a full-time legal career (this was a more common choice for a younger son). They practised mainly in the ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts. They won praise for their legal ability, but also gained a reputation for corruption which stayed with them throughout their life. They became Vicar General of the Diocese of Meath, but so many accusations of extortion, of the taking of bribes and of misappropriation of funds were made against them that in 1621 they were prosecuted in the Court of Castle Chamber (the Irish parallel to Star Chamber), and was found guilty of bribery. They were fined £300 and ordered to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure.
Castle Chamber was never very effective in enforcing its orders, and the sentence of imprisonment never took effect. Even so it is surprising that Travers' conviction did not result in their professional disgrace: on the contrary, they continued in legal practice and was knighted in 1625. Most likely they owed their immunity to their powerful friends, especially Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, whose cousin Elizabeth Boyle they later married.
Judge
In the early 1620s they were appointed Deputy to Sir Lawrence Parsons, the Irish Admiralty Judge, and was also made judge of the provincial Admiralty Court in Munster. Here again they became notorious for taking bribes and for keeping prizes for himself. By 1625 Sir Edward Villiers, who was briefly Lord President of Munster, was writing in despair that the Crown could not trust the conduct of the Admiralty to "such a one" as Travers, and referred pointedly to their Castle Chamber conviction for corruption. Villiers urged that Henry Gosnold, Travers' predecessor, who had a reputation for integrity, be restored to office. Gosnold did return to the Admiralty Court in the 1630s, but during the Civil War found themselves unable to exercise power. The Parliament of Ireland set up a rival court at Kinsale with Travers as its judge; not surprisingly, further accusations of corruption were made against him.
Politics
They entered the Irish House of Commons in 1634 as member for Clonakilty. Since the town of Clonakilty was Lord Cork's own creation (he obtained its charter in 1612), there is no doubt that Travers was the Earl's nominee. This Parliament had been called by the formidable Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who for several years was virtually all-powerful in Ireland. Lord Cork's initial friendly overtures to Strafford were firmly rebuffed: Strafford was determined to establish King Charles I's absolute authority in Ireland, and to achieve this they believed that it was necessary to curb Cork's power and influence. Lord Cork in return worked patiently for Strafford's destruction, and in May 1641 was able to write grimly in their diary: "the Earl of Strafford was beheaded on Tower Hill, as they well deserved".
Travers was returned to the House of Commons in 1639, again for Clonakilty, and was clearly identified as an opponent of Strafford. They signed the Remonstrance of November 1640 in which the Irish Parliament, having previously lavished praise on Strafford, now accused them of tyranny and corruption without parallel in Irish history. Travers was active in the Commons in 1641, especially in pressing home the attack on Strafford. Like most Irish and English MPs, they seem to have believed that, once Stafford was brought down, the King would be able to reach a compromise with the English and Irish Parliaments.
Civil War and death
The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 showed that any hope of a peaceful settlement was an illusion. Travers, like all Protestant landowners in Ireland, now feared for their lands and their life.
The Irish Parliament was deeply suspicious of the King's attitude to the Irish Confederacy. The rebels claimed to have the King's approval for their actions, and although this was probably untrue, it was clear that Charles never ruled out the possibility of employing the Confederate Army. Parliament's suspicions were confirmed by the Cessation of 1643, whereby James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, the Irish Royalist commander, signed a ceasefire with the Confederates, which was repeatedly renewed. Ultimately, Parliament was driven to fight the King as well as the Confederates.
Knocknanuss
The Parliamentary and Confederate armies clashed decisively at the Battle of Knocknanuss, near Mallow, County Cork, on 13 November 1647. Travers had been appointed the Parliamentary Army's Judge Advocate and they commanded a division. The battle was bloody and although Travers' side was victorious, they were killed.
Family
They married first in 1618 Catherine, daughter of Gerald Nangle of Kildalkey and their wife Anne Scurlock; their only child seems to have died young. Before 1638, they married secondly Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Boyle, Archbishop of Tuam, a first cousin of the Earl of Cork, and their wife Martha Wight. By this second marriage, they had four children:
John (died 1712), their father's heir, who married Mary Scudamore.
Richard (died 1700), who married Eleanor Stawell and inherited the lands of their uncle Zachary Travers of Garrycloyne Castle, near Blarney. Their granddaughter Eleanor Travers married their distant cousin Eaton Stannard (1685-1755), the popular eighteenth-century Recorder of Dublin and a close friend of Jonathan Swift.
Elizabeth, who married Colonel William Meade of Ballintober and had at least twelve children, including Sir John Meade, 1st Baronet. Them daughter Eleanor Meade was the fourth wife of Godwin Swift, the uncle of Jonathan Swift and cousin of John Dryden, while another daughter, Joanna, was the grandmother of Jonathan Swift's protégée Laetitia Pilkington.
Martha, who married first Captain Robert Stannard of Kilmallock (died 1655) and secondly in 1656 Sir Richard Aldworth of Newmarket, having children from both marriages; Eaton Stannard was their grandson. Them daughter Elizabeth Stannard married the prominent Anglican cleric and diarist Rowland Davies, Dean of Cork, in 1674, while their son Boyle Aldworth was High Sheriff of County Cork in 1693.
Both of Sir Robert's sons founded long-lasting branches of the Travers family, which was associated mainly with Timoleague, County Cork. Many of Robert's descendants were distinguished soldiers: the most notable of them were General Sir Robert Travers (1770–1834) and their son General James Travers (1820-1884).

The British Aircraft Company was a British aircraft manufacturer based in Maidstone. It was founded by C H Lowe-Wylde and produced gliders and light aircraft during the 1930s.
B.A.C. Ltd was registered as a Limited Company on 4 March 1931; directors were C H Lowe-Wylde, K Barcham Green and Mrs Sheila M Green. Around this time Lowe-Wylde was developing the principle of launching gliders by towing them using a powerful car. Giving demonstrations around the country, their Bentley, driven by Mrs Green, was able to launch them to a height of 300 ft, thus making hill sites and bungy-launch teams unnecessary. A public demonstration of this on the Brooklands Race Track's Finishing Straight on 9 April 1931 was filmed by British Pathe and almost ended in disaster when Lowe-Wylde clipped the port wing as they made an impressive landing under a footbridge. A school of auto-towed instruction was started at West Malling. The Sopwith Dove G-EBKY (now with the Shuttleworth Collection) was also used for aero-towing.
Glider production
Charles H Lowe-Wylde was the first person in Britain to earn the F.A.I. "A" gliding certificate, on 30 March 1930, flying a primary glider of their own design, built in five weeks by members of the Kent Gliding Club and named "Columbus". The glider was first flown at Detling on 23 February 1930.
Lowe-Wylde set up the British Aircraft Company in mid-1930, with works in an old brewery at Lower Stone Street, Maidstone.
B.A.C. I
The first true B.A.C. aircraft was another primary, the B.A.C. I, again used by the Kent Gliding Club.
B.A.C. II
The B.A.C. II was also a primary, but instead of an open girder-type frame, it had a box spar fuselage. This first flew at Lenham on 21 September 1930 and about fifteen were sold, including one in Jamaica. Lowe-Wylde would deliver the gliders personally and demonstrate them at the club's site (and if necessary take the pieces home for repair the same day).
B.A.C. III
The B.A.C. III consisted of the wings and tail from the B.A.C. II combined with a fuselage enclosing the pilot. First flying at Lenham on 12 October 1930, two went to the Glasgow and Accrington gliding clubs, while three further clubs had their B.A.C. II primaries delivered along with alternative B.A.C. III fuselages, so they could be flown in either configuration.
B.A.C. IV
An improved version of the B.A.C. III appearing in April 1931 was the B.A.C. IV with longer, tapered wings. One was sold to Mr C M C Turner of the Channel Gliding Club. For an intended channel crossing. it was towed to 10,000 ft by Sqn Ldr Probyn in their Westland Widgeon G-EBRQ on 18 June 1931, but this was not high enough for the planned flight.
B.A.C. V
The B.A.C. V was simply a B.A.C. III equipped with a pair of wheels for auto-towing. One was built for the Border Gliding Club, while the Preston & District club converted their B.A.C. III for towing off the beach at Middleton Sands, Heysham. However this aircraft crashed there fatally on 15 May 1932.
B.A.C. VI
When the B.A.C. IV was fitted with wheels, it was known as the B.A.C. VI. One was soared by Wolf Hirth at Balsdean on 1 April 1931 for 2hrs 13min.
The Taunton & West Somerset Gliding Club was presented with a B.A.C. VI by their president, Lt. Col. Hamilton Gault, M.P., which was first demonstrated for the club by Mr Lowe-Wylde on 9 July 1931.
B.A.C. VII
On 12 April 1931 the first two-seat B.A.C. VII flew, still using the 40 ft 10in span wings of the B.A.C. IV and VI, but with a new fuselage and an aircraft-type twin-wheel undercarriage for aero- or auto-towing.
A B.A.C. VII sponsored by novelist Barbara Cartland was intended to compete for the Daily Mail cross-channel competition prize, but in trials, flown by Edward Mole and towed by DH.60 Moth G-AAPA of National Flying Services, the combination was unable to get above 6,000 ft, insufficient height for a crossing, so instead a towed flight was made from Maidstone to Reading on 20 June 1931. (Robert Kronfeld made a successful channel crossing the same day.)
The RAF Pageant held at Hendon on 25 June 1932 included a display by three B.A.C. VII gliders.
At the British Gliding Association meeting at Huish/Pewsey Hill, G E Collins – the BGA instructor, made the first thermal-soaring flights in the UK, with a cross-country flight of 6 miles in a B.A.C. VII on 3 July 1933.
Some B.A.C. VIIs were sold as kits, including one built in Palestine, and a replica was built by Michael Maufe in the 1980s, using the wings from a Drone.
B.A.C. VIII
The B.A.C. VIII was a two-seat flying boat glider using B.A.C. VII wings and tail. Nicknamed the "Bat-Boat" after similar craft described in a short story by Rudyard Kipling, it was tested in August 1931 by being towed behind a speed-boat on the River Medway at Rochester. On 7 December that year it was demonstrated from the Welsh Harp reservoir at Hendon.
B.A.C. XI
The last of Lowe-Wylde's glider designs was the B.A.C. IX, a lightweight sailplane designed for possible home building. One only was built, first flown at Balsdean on 4 Oct 1931. The Kent Gliding Club were hoping to acquire it in 1933, but nothing more is known.
Powered aircraft
Planette
In Autumn 1932 the four B.A.C. Planettes appeared; these were conversions of B.A.C. VIIs fitted with a 600cc Douglas engine driving a pusher propeller. The first two were demonstrated at London Air Park on 27 November 1932. In 1932 the prototype Percival Gull, G-ABUR, was built in the B.A.C. works at Maidstone.
On 13 May 1933 Lowe-Wylde was killed in an accident while flying a Planette at Maidstone Airport.
British Aircraft Company Drone
Robert Kronfeld took over the company and started modifying the surviving Planettes to produce a more practical single-seat light aeroplane known as the B.A.C. Drone. The firm moved to a new factory at London Air Park (Hanworth), and became the British Aircraft Company (1935) Ltd. The Drone went into quantity production in 1935. On 21 May 1936 the company was renamed as Kronfeld Ltd.
The Drone was also built under licence at Issy les Moulineaux in France by the Societe Francaise des Avions Nouvelles (SFAN), and at Ghent in Belgium by the Societe Gantoise des Avions sans Moteur.

Poverty in Sri Lanka is 4%. Sri Lanka's life expectancy and literacy rate are nearly on par with those of developed countries, and even top the rankings for the South Asia region. While all these indicate that Sri Lanka should be experiencing a high standard of living, until recently it has only ranked in the medium category of the Human Development Index (HDI). This is despite the fact that Sri Lanka has been experiencing moderate growth in its GDP averaging 5.5 per annum between 2006 and 2009. One of the reasons is due to its relatively low GDP per capital;. The Sri Lankan government has been successful in reducing poverty from 15.2% on 2006 to 8.9% in 2010, urban poverty was reduced from 6.7 to 5.3% while rural poverty was reduced from 15.7 to 9.5%, and the nation has made significant progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.
Population
As of 2010, 8.9% of the population lives below the poverty line. This is evidence that while acute poverty is no longer an issue, poverty still remains widespread and continues to be a challenging problem in Sri Lanka. More worryingly however is the fact that 90% of the poor live in rural areas, with over 80% of Sri Lanka's population still living in rural areas. But in 2013 it has shown that the economy is growing more rapidly than in any other Asian country.
This highlights a link between isolation from social and economic infrastructure, cities and markets, and higher levels of poverty incidence. One explanation could be that it limits these people from earning income through off-farm activities. In addition, with more than 40 per cent of the rural poor people being small farmers, their production systems may be hampered by the usual suspects of fragmented landholdings, poor economies of scale, low investment levels resulting from poor financial services as well as inappropriate or limited technology.
According to the Asian Development Bank, the population of Sri Lanka was 19.71 million in 2015. In 2014, 6.7% of the country lived below the national poverty line. During the same year, it was also reported that 50.5% of the population aged 15 years and above were employed.
Development
In 2008, it was reported that tens of thousands of men from impoverished villages were joining the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and Sri Lanka Police Service to escape rural poverty, as the wages offered by the security services significantly raise the standard of living for soldiers and their families.
In order to reduce rural poverty (and thus poverty as a whole), rural development in terms of infrastructure is important. The need for a better road network and transport system to link up the rural areas as well as better credit facilities to aid in the investments of new technology and farming techniques are just a start in ensuring that the rural poor are not left behind.
While it is identified that development in the rural areas is crucial for poverty alleviation, the government cannot possibly channel unlimited funds into development plans without constraints, disregarding potential developments in urban areas, or more importantly, not considering the state of its overall economy. Therefore, the Sri Lankan government faces a dilemma of pursuing growth that is equitable; trying to promote economic growth without leaving the poor in the rural area behind.
Apart from government policies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) help ease the situation too. One of them is Sarvodaya. Sarvodaya is Sri Lanka's largest NGO, which includes many other divisional units dedicated to different development projects. Sarvodaya Economic Empowerment Development Services (SEEDS) began its operation as a separate division in 1986 and now reaches 18 of Sri Lanka's 25 districts. SEEDS is responsible for building the economic capacity of the poorest groups within the communities. Its aim is to stimulate an attitude of entrepreneurship, innovation, thrift and sustainable development in the rural areas.
Although SEEDS does not directly deal with the lack of physical infrastructure in rural areas, i.e. development plans in building roads, bridges, etc., it has helped people in rural areas to be a financially independent and improved livelihood, which in turn helps reduce rural poverty. It hopes that through their aid, villages can become self-governed and capable of serving their community's economic and social needs.
SEEDS provides saving and credit services for starting a small enterprise or to improve livelihood as well as non-financial services such as business counselling, training in technical skills and market information. It uses the village banking microfinance model to help the rural communities. Village banking treats the whole community as one unit and establishes semi-formal or formal institutions through which micro-finance is dispensed. The banks are run by their own people: they choose their members, elect their own officers, establish their own by-laws, distribute loans to individuals, and collect payments and savings. Their loans are backed, not by goods or property, but by moral collateral: the promise that the group stands behind each individual loan. Therefore, this is a means of ensuring that each individual will be disciplined in saving up to repay their own loans. 86% of SEEDS beneficiaries actually had functioning micro-enterprises. Statistics have shown that 51% of SEEDS beneficiaries showed increased revenues while 73% of them showed increased profits.
There are 1,129,344 members in these village banks, out of which 60% of the members are females. This in itself has empowered women as they are no longer dependent on others for their capital needs. They have more bargaining power within the households and thus need not feel as insecure as before. Secondly, they have guaranteed and sure access to capital thus removing uncertainty and permitting a confidential basis to stay in business and even expand. This is a major empowerment both socially and economically for these women, as this micro-finance model not only raises their level of productivity but also allows women to contribute to family income, leading to an overall reduction in poverty levels in the rural areas. Other than financial services, SEEDS has been able to integrate spiritual revival, social change and economic development. It has helped restore a person's sense of pride and self-esteem, as well as that of the village community. The earlier feeling of humiliation and of powerlessness vanishes with the collective sense that is generated.

The traditional martial arts of the Mainland Southeast Asia are related to one another, and as a group to Indian martial arts. The most salient common feature is Mainland Southeast Asia kickboxing. The region of Mainland Southeast Asia is believed to be the land of Suvarnabhumi that ancient Indians mentioned in Buddhist text and Hindu text. In 790 A.D., a Khmer prince who grew up abroad by the name of Jayavarman II returned to unify the Khmer civilization. In 802 A.D., Jayavarman II established the Khmer Empire, the precursor to modern Cambodia, and declared themselves the Chakravatin (universal ruler). Around 850 A.D., Pagan, the ancestor of modern-day Burma, was established by Tibeto-Burman speakers. For 200 years, Pagan remained a small principality until the reign of King Anawrahta. In 1238 A.D., Thailand's first state, Sukhothai, was started when the residents declared independence from the Khmer Empire. In 1353 A.D., Laos's first state, Lan Xang, was started by Fa Ngum with the assistance of the Khmer from Angkor.
Myanmar
Thaing (, ) is a Burmese term used to classify the traditional martial systems of Myanmar. There are three main generation of Thaing in Myanmar, named "Kanbawza" "Inwa" and "Yamanya". Burmese martial arts include bando, banshay, naban, shan't gyi and Lethwei:
Lethwei or Burmese boxing. A traditional style of striking with headbutts, kicks, punches, knee and elbow strikes.
Naban is the traditional form of wrestling from Myanmar. Originally based on Indian wrestling, it is practiced primarily in rural areas. Naban is especially popular among the Himalayan tribes. The Chin and Kachin people are both known for their skilled wrestlers. Techniques include joint locks, strikes to pressure points, and chokeholds.
Cambodia
Pradal Serey is an unarmed martial art from Cambodia. In Khmer the word pradal means fighting or boxing and serey means free. Originally used for warfare, pradal serey is now one of Cambodia's national sports. Its moves have been slightly altered to comply with the modern rules. The martial art was turned into a sport when French colonists arrived and added components of Western boxing such as a boxing ring, boxing gloves, weight classes and timed rounds.
Khmer traditional wrestling is a folk wrestling style from Cambodia. It has been practiced as far back as the Angkor period and is depicted on the bas-reliefs of certain temples. The earliest form of Khmer traditional wrestling was called Maloyuth. Maloyuth was created in 788 A.D. by Brahmin Timu. It evolved to the current form of wrestling, Cham Bab, in the 8th century. Although predominantly a male sport today, Khmer wrestling was once practiced by both sexes as female wrestlers are also displayed on the Banteay Srei temple.
Laos
Muay Lao is a traditional unarmed martial art from Laos. It incorporates punches, kicks, elbows and knee strikes. Muay Lao was an event at the 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane.
Malaysia
Tomoi is an unarmed martial art from Malaysia. It is practiced mainly in the northern states such as Kedah, Trengganu, and especially Kelantan.
Thailand
Muay Boran (, , ; ) is an umbrella term for the unarmed martial arts of Thailand prior to the introduction of modern equipment and rules in the 1930s. It is the predecessor of modern Muay Thai or Thai boxing.
Muay Thai (, , ; ) is the Thai style of striking with strong emphasis on kicks, punches, knee and elbow strikes.
Krabi-Krabong (, ) is a Thai weapon-based martial art. Krabi-krabong was developed by the ancient Siamese warriors for fighting on the battlefield. It was likely used in conjunction with muay boran but whether the two arts were developed together or independently is uncertain. Early warfare in Indochina was mostly between rival kingdoms and were fought en masse. Individual fighters were armoured and carried rhino hide shields. The system's name refers to its main weapons, namely the Thai sword (krabi) and staff (krabong). Typically, two swords (daab song mue) are wielded as a pair. Unarmed krabi-krabong (muay boran) makes use of kicks, pressure point strikes, joint locks, holds, and throws.
Vietnam
Traditional Vietnamese martial arts (Võ Thuật Cổ Truyền Việt Nam 武術古傳越南) can be loosely divided into those of the Sino-Vietnamese descended from the Han, and those of the Chams or indigenous Vietnamese. Qwan Ki Do and Vovinam are prominent modern Vietnamese martial arts.

Wāḍiḥ al-Ṣiqlabī (; died November 1011) was a Slav general of the late Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba. They served as governor of the Middle March and as the ḥājib, effectively prime minister, of the caliphs Muḥammad II (1010) and Hishām II (1010–1011). They played a major role in the opening of the final fitna (civil war) of Córdoba.
Wāḍiḥ, a Slav, was the governor of the Middle March with their capital at Medinaceli from at least the 990s. In 997, the leader of the Maghrāwa Berber tribe in Africa, Zīrī ibn ʿAṭīya, renounced their allegiance to Córdoba. In response, al-Manṣūr, the de facto ruler of the Caliphate, dispatched Wāḍiḥ to Africa at the head of a large army in 998 to expand the Umayyad beachhead there, which at the time consisted only of Ceuta. They later sent their son, ʿAbd al-Malik, to assist Wāḍiḥ. Together they defeated Zīrī, captured Fez and established an Umayyad administration over all of Morocco, which lasted until the death of al-Manṣūr in 1002.
After the forced abdication of Caliph Hishām II in February 1009, Wāḍiḥ supported the new caliph, Muḥammad II al-Mahdī. When Muḥammad alienated the Berbers in the army, many withdrew from the city of Córdoba north towards Calatrava, proclaiming as their caliph Sulaymān ibn al-Ḥakam. They approached Wāḍiḥ to lead them, but were rebuffed. Count Sancho García of Castile, however, accepted their offer and the combined Castilian–Berber army marched on Córdoba. After interfering with but failing to stop their advance, Wāḍiḥ retreated to Córdoba. In November 1009, the city fell. Muḥammad and Wāḍiḥ escaped to Toledo, while the Berbers installed Sulaymān as caliph.
Having failed to prevent the enthronement of Sulaymān, Wāḍiḥ sought to extricate themselves from politics. They went to Tortosa and from there sent a letter to Sulaymān, begging to be relieved of their post so they could go to Lorca and devote themselves to God, probably in a ribāṭ. They were refused, and began working for Muḥammad's restoration. They secured the allegiance of some of the Ṣaqāliba in the east. They negotiated an alliance with the Frankish counts Ramon Borrell of Barcelona and Ermengol I of Urgell. Each count received 200 dīnārs and together they supplied 9,000 soldiers, to be paid two dīnārs a day. The Frankish army joined with Wāḍiḥ's at Toledo and together they marched towards Córdoba. The Berber army of Sulaymān marched out to meet them. At ʿAqabat al-Baqar, on 22 or 31 May 1010, Wāḍiḥ and the Franks won a major victory and advanced to the capital. Wāḍiḥ was appointed ḥājib. On 21 June, however, the combined army was defeated at the battle of Marbella, after which the remaining Frankish contingent left for home.
Returning to Córdoba after their defeat, Wāḍiḥ staged a coup d'état with the support of other officers who had once served al-Manṣūr. They had Muḥammad, now extremely unpopular in the capital, arrested, tried and executed on 23 June 1010. They sent their head to the Berbers and had their body thrown into a sewer. Hishām II was reinstated, and immediately re-appointed Wāḍiḥ ḥājib. Unimpressed by the head of Muḥammad, Sulaymān and the Berbers laid siege to the city. Wāḍiḥ tried sending messengers to make terms with the besiegers, but they were intercepted. They were captured by their own allies while trying to flee Córdoba in November 1011 and killed.

Tribute is one of the older generations of ticket issuing systems introduced to ticket offices by British Rail during the mid-1990s, prior to the privatisation of the network. PC-based, it is one of several systems trialled with the aim of replacing the aging APTIS system. The original systems was developed by British Rail Business Systems, and was first installed at London St Pancras on 21 January 1994. By April 2005, around 250 terminals were in use Following privatisation, development and support was provided to the train operating companies (TOCs) by SchlumbergerSema, until they were bought by Atos in 2004.
Since the system was launched the software has undergone several major updates – release version 15 was use in ticket offices.
Today the Tribute software is owned by Atos. Development is guided by representatives from a number of TOCs, and several industry call centres. Development and systems integration work is undertaken by Atos.

Eva Rosencrans (1901-1994) was an American fashion designer of Russian descent who worked mainly for their sister-in-law Nettie Rosenstein as a business partner and head designer. They designed Mamie Eisenhower's inauguration gown.
Early life
Born Eva Greene in Russia, they came to Manhattan as an infant with their family. They were supported by a philanthropic group called Manhattan Trade which supported children from low-income families to pursue trades. They attended the Manhattan Trade School for Girls from 1914 to 1915, where they had consistently good grades, and won first prize for their self-made graduation dress. Aged 14, the school placed them with a local dressmaker's, where they worked for a year before leaving in 1916 to work for the then up-and-coming Nettie Rosenstein.
Nettie Rosenstein
In 1922, Eva married Rosenstein's brother, Alvin Rosencrans. In 1928, Nettie and their husband decided to retire, but following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 which almost wiped out the Rosensteins' fortune, Nettie Rosenstein decided to relaunch again. At this time, they insisted on their sister-in-law becoming their associate designer and one of their two business partners, alongside a man called Charles Gumprecht. Rosencrans was given a 30% stake and their own designing room, and they and Nettie shared designing responsibilities, which increasingly became more and more Rosencrans' responsibility as Rosenstein focused on the business of managing a highly successful fashion house that was worth over a million dollars by 1937.
In 1950, Mamie Eisenhower came to Nettie Rosenstein, where they were personally dealt with by Rosencrans, and became a good friend and regular client, having both their 1953 and 1957 inauguration gowns created by Rosencrans. Eva Rosencrans was happy to allow their sister-in-law to take credit for the designs. However, they would increasingly be acknowledged as a designer for Nettie Rosenstein from this point onward. In 1953 the journalist Phyllis Battelle acknowledged that Rosenstein did only half the designing for their brand herself, and that they were aided by Rosencrans. By 1959, Nettie Rosenstein designs were increasingly acknowledged as being by Rosencrans for the label. However, in 1961, Rosenstein would make the decision to stop offering clothing altogether, and instead focus upon jewelry, perfume and accessories.
Later life and death
After their sister-in-law ceased dress design, in 1961, Rosencrans moved on to Ben Reig, where, for the first time, they received consistent name credit for their designs. In 1968, the same year that Reig died, Rosencrans became a teacher at the Fashion Institute of Technology for two years before retiring.
They spent the rest of their life in New York where they died in 1994. One of their sons was the cable television pioneer Robert Rosencrans.

The Ungava Peninsula of Nunavik, Quebec, Canada, is bounded by Hudson Bay to the west, Hudson Strait to the north, and Ungava Bay to the east. This peninsula is part of the Labrador Peninsula, and covers about . Its northernmost point is Cape Wolstenholme, which is also the northernmost point of Quebec. The peninsula is also part of the Canadian Shield, and consists entirely of treeless tundra dissected by large numbers of rivers and glacial lakes, flowing generally east–west in a parallel fashion. The peninsula was not deglaciated until 6,500 years ago (11,500 years after the Last Glacial Maximum) and is believed to have been the prehistoric centre from which the vast Laurentide Ice Sheet spread over most of North America during the last glacial epoch.
Climate
The climate is extremely cold (Dfc in the Köppen climate classification) because the Labrador Current keeps the region (and all of northern Québec) colder in the summer than other regions at comparable latitudes:
Demographics
The 10,000 inhabitants of the peninsula (90% Inuit), live in 12 villages spread along the coast. The largest village, Kuujjuaq, is the capital of the Kativik Regional Government, which includes all of the peninsula. The peninsula's offshore islands are part of the Nunavut Territory. The region is accessible by air services, with links to southern Québec, and seasonal shipping when sea-ice breaks up. Thick permafrost prevents the use of conventional building techniques in some areas.
Geology
The Ungava Peninsula, situated on the northeast portion of the Canadian Shield, is where the Rae Province connects with the Superior Province. The region is composed of Archean rocks (ca. 2.7-2.9 Ga) from the Douglas Harbour Domain (see Superior Craton). The Archean rocks are overlain by Paleoproterozoic supracrustal sequences (ca. 1.8–2.1 Ga) and intruded by Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes (ca.2.0–2.2 Ga). The supracrustal rocks comprise nappes that form part of the Ungava and Labrador troughs. In the zone east of the Labrador Trough axis, the Paleoproterozoic deformation reworked the Archean rocks of the Douglas Harbour Domain, as well as the Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes. The metamorphic conditions which parallel the deformation increase from west to east and from middle amphibolite to granulite facies. U–Pb isotope analyses of zircon yield secondary ages around 1790 Ma. These results are interpreted as the age of metamorphism and indicate a reactivation of the northeastern margin of the Superior Province during a Paleoproterozoic tectono-metamorphic event, resulting from probable continental collision. (Madore, 2001). Pingualuit impact crater is located on the peninsula.
Fauna
The Ungava brown bear, an extinct population of the grizzly bear, is named after this peninsula.

Coccothrinax proctorii, the Cayman thatch palm or Proctor's silver palm, is a palm which is endemic to the Cayman Islands.
Henderson and colleagues (1995) considered C. proctorii to be a synonym of Coccothrinax argentata. It is considered Endangered by the IUCN Red List, having declined to about 435,699 mature individuals in 2000 from a projected original population of 600,000. This population has still continued declining, and the projected 2013 population is around 428,500 mature individuals. In a century, the population will have likely declined to only about 123,500 individuals, all restricted to protected areas.
Description
A medium-sized palm, with a slender trunk, and an open crown, of deeply divided leaves, with nearly perfectly symmetrical divisions, dark green above, and silvery white below. Trunk type: Solitary. Prefers a sunny, moist, but well-drained position. Salt tolerant, and prefers an alkaline soil. Slow growing. Can be grown on just coral limerock. It likes a position in full sun, or light shade, in a tropical, or subtropical climate, and once established, can endure quite a bit of coastal exposure. Indoors it also makes a neat bonsai, that can even be cultivated just on a piece of coral limerock, practically without soil.

Atelectotrauma, atelectrauma, cyclic atelectasis or repeated alveolar collapse and expansion (RACE) are medical terms for the damage caused to the lung by mechanical ventilation under certain conditions. When parts of the lung collapse at the end of expiration, due to a combination of a diseased lung state and a low functional residual capacity, then reopen again on inspiration, this repeated collapsing and reopening causes shear stress which has a damaging effect on the alveolus. Clinicians attempt to reduce atelectotrauma by ensuring adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain the alveoli open in expiration. This is known as open lung ventilation. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) with its use of 'super CPAP' is especially effective in preventing atelectotrauma since it maintains a very high mean airway pressure (MAP), equivalent to a very high PEEP. Atelectotrauma is one of several means by which mechanical ventilation may damage the lungs leading to ventilator-associated lung injury. The other means are volutrauma, barotrauma, rheotrauma and biotrauma. Attempts have been made to combine these factors in an all encompassing term: mechanical power.

Club Deportivo Walter Ferretti is a Nicaraguan football team who play in the Nicaraguan Premier Division. They are based in Managua.
History
The club was founded in 1984 on the initiative of Walter Ferretti Fonseca. Its intention was to serve as the sporting wing of the Sandinista Police, and it initially competed in an institutional league for government ministries. Later, the team moved into the Nicaraguan league system. At that time, they competed under the name of DGPS (Dirección General de La Polícia Sandinista). DGPS stormed through the lower levels of the Nicaraguan league system, winning the Second Division in 1985 with an undefeated record. That lifted them to the top flight of the country, where they have competed ever since.
Late in 1988, Ferretti died in a car accident on the road to Leon. In 1991, the club was renamed to C.D. Walter Ferretti in their honor.
The 1997–98 season saw Ferretti win its first ever title, defeating Masachapa 1–0 in the championship final. They reached the finals again in 1999–2000, losing in extra time to Diriangén. The next year, 2000–2001, saw them go win better and claim a second championship. It came against Diriangén, and after two scoreless legs Ferretti won on penalties, 5–3. Ferretti made it to the finals for a third consecutive year in 2002, but was run off the pitch by Jalapa, 4–1.
The club made no serious noise again until Clausura 2008, when they reached another final, this time facing Real Estelí. Both legs of the two-legged tie were scoreless, so the match went into extra time. Real Estelí ended up winning on a 115th-minute goal by Elmer Mejia. They reached the finals again in Clausura 2009, beating Diriangén on penalties before losing 3–1 on aggregate to Real Estelí.
The championship-less string finally ended in Apertura 2009. Ferretti was the dominant team in Nicaragua that year, topping the table in the first and second phases to reach the championship finals. Real Estelí won the first leg 1–0, and scored first in the second leg to build a 2–0 aggregate lead. Then Ferretti unleashed a torrent of goals, rallying to win the match 4–1 and the tie 4–2.
Ferretti's surge continued into the Clausura 2010, as they reached the finals again, only to lose 1–1 on away goals to Real Estelí. The two met again that May for the Grand Final to determine the 2009–2010 champion; Real Estelí won once again on away goals.
The next year, 2010–2011, saw Ferretti win the Apertura 2–2 on away goals against Diriangén. However, their quest to be grand champions came up short a second year in a row; they lost the Clausura final 3–2 to Real Estelí, and were beaten on penalties by the same team in the Grand Final.
Real Estelí's hold on Ferretti continued, as the Nicaraguan power beat them in the Apertura 2011, Apertura 2012, Clausura 2013 (that match was called early due to crowd trouble in the Ferretti stands) and Apertura 2013. The curse was finally lifted in the 2014 Apertura, when Ferretti prevailed 1–0 on aggregate to hoist their first crown since Apertura 2011. Then, in the Grand Final, Ferretti finally ended Real Estelí's string of eight consecutive Nicaraguan championships with a 2–1 aggregate win.
Real Estelí came back to win the next two titles, and beat Ferretti in the 2016 Clausura and the 2017 Clausura. However, Ferretti rallied for a fourth crown in 2017–2018, beating Managua 1–1 in the Apertura.

One human poll comprised the 1945 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. The Coaches' Poll began operation in 1950; in addition, the AP Poll did not begin conducting preseason polls until that same year.
Legend
AP Poll
The final AP Poll was released on December 2, at the end of the 1945 regular season, weeks before the major bowls. The AP would not release a post-bowl season final poll regularly until 1968.

St Peter's Church is a church in Threekingham, Lincolnshire. It is dedicated to St. Peter ad Vincula (St Peter in chains). It became a Grade I listed building on 1 February 1967. A Saxon church, mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, was located here but the Normans began rebuilding the church in 1170. Part of the church, notably the door and porch, is dated to 1310. A sundial on the turret to the left of the porch says "1688 Gifte of Edmond Hutchinson, Gentleman". The church contains three 14th-century tombs, one of which is inscribed "Hic intumulatur Johannes quondam dominus de Trikingham" ('Here is buried John, former lord of Threekingham'). The spire was restored in 1872.

Doin' the Thang! is the debut album by jazz pianist Ronnie Mathews featuring trumpeter Freddie Hubbard recorded for the Prestige label in 1963.
Reception
Alex Henderson of AllMusic said "the LP's focus is modal post-bop and non-soul-jazz hard bop. But even though the material isn't soul-jazz, Mathews' quintet is certainly soulful... Hubbard, who was only 25 when Doin' the Thang was recorded, brings a lot to the session – not only fire, guts, and passion, but also a big, highly appealing tone".

Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 () is an article in the Basic Law, the constitution of Hong Kong. It states that Hong Kong "shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies."
Attempts to implement the article and create the Hong Kong national security law have seen protests, particularly in 2003 and 2019. In 2020, the mainland National People's Congress imposed a security law on Hong Kong under Article 18 of the Basic Law.
Content
Article 23 of the Basic Law (BL 23) states:
Background
Article 23 had undergone significant revisions before the promulgation of its current form on 4 April 1990. The 1987 version of art.23 (Article 22 in 1987) was much shorter and only required that the
The 1989 February version of art.23 only contained the first half of the enacted version, with identical wording with the promulgated version up to the phrase “or theft of state secrets”. The consultative committee noted views that art.23 might affect the freedom of Hong Kong people. It also noted the view that the provision was against the Sino-British Joint Declaration since “it is generally held that the capitalist system is anti-communist and will undermine national unity and subvert the Central People's Government”.
Similar laws had been in force during the British colonial period, but they had not been strictly enforced since 1945. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) from the colonial period remains in force, but in 2019 the Court of First Instance ruled that it was "not compatible with the constitutional order laid down by the Basic Law" due to its unchecked and wide scope. The Court of Appeal later varied this by permitting the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation as reasonable and valid, but stated ERO regulations were "subject to judicial scrutiny."
Before 1997, the British colonial government introduced the Crimes (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 1996 in an attempt to concretise the concepts of "subversion" and "secession" by confining them to actual violent conduct but of no avail. The bill was voted down in the elected Legislative Council of Hong Kong amid opposition from Beijing and thus left a vacuum in the present legislation.
2003 National Security Bill
Mainland national security laws do not apply in Hong Kong, by virtue of Article 18 of the Basic Law. As a result, there has been steady pressure from CPG on the HKSAR government to meet its obligations under art.23. Laws for the purposes of this Article were introduced by the Tung administration in late 2002. In February 2003, the HKSAR government proposed the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 to the Legislative Council which aimed to amend the Crimes Ordinance, the Official Secrets Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance pursuant to the obligation imposed by Article 23 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and to provide for related, incidental and consequential amendments. The proposed bill caused considerable controversy in Hong Kong and a massive demonstration on 1 July 2003. In the aftermath, Liberal Party chairperson James Tien resigned from the Executive Council and the bill was withdrawn after it became clear that it would not get the necessary support from the Legislative Council for it to be passed. The bill was then shelved indefinitely.
After 2003
There were calls for reintroducing the national security bill after the 2003 setbacks from the pro-Beijing camp occasionally. After the Beijing interpretation of the Basic Law in November 2016 over the Legislative Council oath-taking controversy to eject two pro-independence legislators from the legislature on the basis that "[Beijing] will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro-independence activists to enter a government institution," Chief executive Leung Chun-ying said Hong Kong would enact Article 23 targeting the pro-independence movement in Hong Kong.
The Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Wang Zhimin accused pro-independence activists of "engaging in activities that sought to separate the motherland and subvert the national regime" and urged the Hong Kong government to enact national security legislation as they said "Hong Kong is the only place in the world without a national security legislation – it's a major weakness in the nation's overall security, and it has a direct impact on residents." Wang said without a national security law, "Hong Kong independence radicals have been challenging national sovereignty and security in recent years".
Protests in 2019 and imposition of security law in 2020
The 2019–20 Hong Kong protests led to an increasing desire within some pro-Beijing lawmakers for Hong Kong to legislate Article 23 of the Basic Law. On 21 May 2020, the Chinese Government proposed a new law on national security regulations that may be enacted in Hong Kong under the provisions of Annex III of its Basic law. It may set up the legal framework to prevent and punish subversion, terrorism, separatism and foreign interference. The following day, a dozen pan-democrat lawmakers marched to the Chinese Liaison Office to show their disapproval.
On 30 June 2020, the mainland 13th National People's Congress and Standing Committee of the National People's Congress imposed the Hong Kong national security law covering secession and subversion under Article 18 of the Basic Law. The areas of treason, sedition and theft of state secrets are not covered by the new Article 18 law, and remain to be implemented under Article 23 by the Hong Kong SAR. On 12 January 2022, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced at the first session of the new legislature that new "local legislation" would be created to meet the requirements of Article 23.

Gilbert Youlou Mabiala (born 3 March 1947), popularly known as Prince Youlou, is a Congo music recording artist, composer and vocalist, in the Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville). They were once a member of the Congo Music band TPOK Jazz which dominated the Congolese music scene from the 1960s through the 1980s.
Music career with OKJazz
Youlou Mabiala was born in Linzolo, a suburb of Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo. They began their music career in Brazzaville with local groups. In 1963, they joined the musical band TPOK Jazz, in Kinshasa (Leopoldville), as a vocalist and composer. After initial stage jitters, they settled in under the tutelage of Vicky Longomba.
Youlou Mabiala is credited with composing the following songs for the band, among others:
Celine
Kamikaze
Asumani
Ledi
Massi
Lekwey (credited to both Franco & Youlou)
In 1972, Youlou was one of the musicians who defected from OKJazz to form the band known as Lovy du Zaïre, led by Vicky Longomba. Youlou then went on to form Somo-somo, with Jean Kwamy Munsi, Diatho Lukoki, Master Mwana Congo and Nona Simon.
They returned to OKJazz in 1975 and released the hit Kamikaze which was popular in Africa and among the African diaspora in Europe and North America. In 1977, Youlou left OKJazz for good.
Music career post OKJazz
After they left TPOK Jazz in May 1977, Youlou formed Trois Frères with Loko Massengo, Mose Fan Fan, Michel Boyibanda and others. They performed mainly in Brazzaville. In the 1980s, they sang with the band Kamikaze Loningisa, releasing the song Djeliba, among others.
On 15 August 2004, while taking part in the National Independence celebrations at the Présidence de la République hotel in Pointe-Noire, Republic of the Congo, Youlou Mabiala suffered a cerebral vascular accident (stroke). After initial stabilization in a hospital in Brazzaville, they were airlifted to a facility in Paris, France. Following discharge from hospital, they remained in France for rehabilitation.
Personal details
Prince Youlou Mabiala is married to one of the daughters of the late François Luambo Makiadi.

Live in the City of Light is the first (double LP / CD) live album by Scottish rock band Simple Minds. It was released in May 1987 to document their successful worldwide Once Upon a Time tour, and charted at No. 1 in the UK. The album spawned one chart single release, a live version of "Promised You a Miracle".
Overview
The album was recorded live mainly on 12 & 13 August 1986 at Le Zénith, Paris, France (Paris is nicknamed "La Ville de Lumière" which means "The City of Light", hence the album title), on the last dates of the Once Upon a Time world tour, with the only track "Someone, Somewhere In Summertime" recorded in late October 1986 at Sydney Entertainment Centre in Sydney, Australia. It features the band's 1986 touring lineup, which included second vocalist Robin Clark and percussionist Sue Hadjopoulos. Additional "fixing and mixing" was done at Castle Sound Studios in Edinburgh and Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York. Lisa Germano (at the time, a John Mellencamp band member who would perform on Simple Minds' next studio single, Belfast Child), contributed studio-overdubbed violin on "Someone Somewhere in Summertime" and former Simple Minds member Derek Forbes contributed uncredited bass guitar overdubs.
Album cover
Although the album was not recorded there, the inside of the gatefold sleeve curiously features a photograph taken at another show from the same Once Upon A Time tour: on 9 July 1986 at Piazza Grande, a square in Locarno, Switzerland.
Release details
Live in the City of Light was released as a double vinyl album with the band's logo in gold lettering over black sleeve. The package featured a 12" x 12" attached giant-sized booklet with state-of-the-art photography of the band's performance and outdoor session pictures. This art could not be reproduced faithfully on later CD releases (an original 1st pressing on double-fat jewel case and the USA version packaged in a long box on two separate discs).
Track listing
All tracks recorded live on 12 & 13 August 1986 at Le Zénith, Paris, France except "Someone, Somewhere In Summertime" recorded live on 24 (or 30) October 1986 at the Entertainment Centre, Sydney, Australia.

The Xiaojiang River () is a right-bank tributary of the Jinsha River in northern Yunnan Province of China. It begins at the outflow of Lake Qingshuihai and flows through Xundian Hui and Yi Autonomous County, Dongchuan District and Huize County before draining into the Jinsha River. The Xiaojiang River runs 141 kilometres and its drainage area is 3049 square kilometres. Due to loose rock structure, sparse vegetation on the banks, and the well-developed dissected troughs, large-scale debris flows are common.

Eucratoscelus pachypus also known as the Tanzania stout leg baboon tarantula or the stout leg tarantula, was first described by Gunter Schmidt and Volker von Wirth in 1990. It is found in Tanzania, hailing from arid parts, and is an obligate burrower.
Description
Females
The carapace of females is a dark brown color, the opisthosoma being black, with brownish reddish hairs covering it. Their first two legs are a light brown or grey color, sometimes looking a shade of golden. The third set of legs are black with golden lines in their segmentation. The legs closest to the opisthosoma are black, large and fluffy compared to the others, with golden lines in their segmentation.
Males
Males lack the stout legs found in females. The carapace of males is a golden brown color, the opisthosoma is golden brown in color with a zig zag line moving vertically in the center. The legs are a lighter golden brown that the rest of the tarantula, reaching all the way to the trochanter, where its the same golden brown color as the carapace. The legs being covered in grayish hairs.
Habitat
They inhabit open savannah, grassland and scrubland areas in Tanzania. As such Mkomazi National Park will be the reference for this section. With average temperatures of 24ºC and average yearly rain of 718mm with animals such as Zebras, Lions and Black Rhinos. And plants such as African myrhh, Arabic Gum tree and Glossy-Leaved corkwood.
Behavior
This species is an obligate burrower, and make deep vertical tunnel, with a burrow at the bottom. They own a calmer behavior than other in the Harpactirinae subfamily, they most often run into their hide before getting aggressive. They own an incredible speed with a painful bite.
Breeding
This tarantula is notoriously hard to breed, as most of the specimens for sale are wild caught females. Males are few and far between to come by, as they are usually not believe to be of the same species, as they lack those study legs. Add this to the fact they have an distinct courtship, thankfully this species have been consistently breed in multiple areas.

Silver Lake is a neighborhood on the western edge of Providence, Rhode Island. It is bordered by the Hartford neighborhood to the north, Route 10 to the east, Johnston and Cranston on the West and separated from Olneyville by Route 6.
Like Federal Hill, Silver Lake was traditionally an Italian-American neighborhood. Since the mid-1990s, Silver Lake has undergone a radical transformation into a largely Hispanic neighborhood, as evidenced by the recent influx of Central American restaurants, bars and markets.
History
Settlement in Silver Lake began after the completion of the Plainfield Road to Plainfield, Connecticut in 1710. Farmers settled the area shortly afterward. Isolated from the rest of Providence, some sought to secede from Providence before the town of Johnston, Rhode Island annexed Silver Lake in 1759.
Silver Lake took its name from the original approximately ten acre lakes located in the area bordered by Murray, Sybil, Mercy and Plainfield Streets. At the turn of the 20th century, it was graded with landfill and debris then became the site of a supermarket and bank for many years.
Suburban development in the 19th century led Providence to reacquire Silver Lake in 1898. Shortly thereafter, Silver Lake witnessed its most significant period of development in the early 20th century prior to the Great Depression. From the late 19th century until the 1970s the neighborhood was predominately Italian with Irish, Polish, English and a mix of other European immigrants.
Demographics
In 1990, nearly 43% of Silver Lake residents claimed some Italian ancestry. That same census showed that about 7% of Silver Lake's residents Hispanic, 2.3% were Asian, and 2% were African-American. Median family income in Silver Lake was $27,736, about 2% lower than the citywide average. 16% of families lived in poverty.
According to the 2000 census, 10,943 persons resided in Silver Lake, an increase from the 9,141 residents who called Silver Lake home in 1990. Between 1990 and 2000 the percentage of non-white residents in Silver Lake rose from 11 percent to 57.6 percent. 42 percent of Silver Lake's residents were Hispanic; 42% were White; 3.7 percent were Asian; and 8 percent were African-American. In 2000, more than half (58%) of the residents of age 25 or older were high school graduates. 59% of children under the age of six speak a language other than English as their primary language.
Housing tenure in Silver Lake has remained mostly unchanged over the past decade. The proportion of owner-occupied housing units declined slightly from 36.6 percent to 35 percent between 1990 and 2000. About a fifth of all housing units in Silver Lake are single-family units, and most other structures house two to four families. 8 percent of all housing units in Silver Lake are located in buildings with five or more housing units, reflecting the more suburban character of much of the neighborhood.
The median family income was $27,981, below the citywide average of $32,058. 28% of families were below the poverty level while 15% receive some form of public assistance. 18% of children under the age of six had been exposed to high levels of lead.
Government
Over half of Silver Lake is within Ward 7, which is represented in the Providence City Council by Democrat John J. Igliozzi. The eastern portion of Silver Lake is within Ward 15, represented by Democrat Sabina Matos.
Parks
Neutaconkanut Park
Neutaconkanut Park occupies most of Silver Lake between Plainfield Street and the border with Johnston. It is a park with baseball fields, basketball courts, public pool and recreation center as well as forest and walking trails.
Within the park lies Neutaconkanut Hill, the highest point in the city at 296 feet. The hill was Providence's original northwest boundary, by agreement between Roger Williams and Narragansett sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi. A huge glacial erratic boulder once stood on the hill, which was believed to have served as a lookout point for Canonicus. The boulder was broken apart, as nearby residents feared that the boulder might roll off the hill upon them. Author Henry David Thoreau wrote in their journal about climbing Neutaconkanut Hill, during a visit to Providence in 1854.
Other parks
There are four small memorial parks near the intersection of Silver Lake and Pocasset Avenue. They are:
Ponte Corvo Memorial at the corner of Pocasset Avenue and Laurel Hill Avenue.
Cerbo Square Memorial on Murray Street near the intersection of Murray and Silver Lake Avenue.
Scalabrini Piazza on Silver Lake Avenue at the site of the bell tower left standing at the original St Bartholomew's Church (now located 1/3 mile away, atop Laurel Hill).
Silver Lake Memorial Park is a small war memorial at the corner of Pocasset Avenue and Union Avenue.
Cultural attractions
Silver Lake features the Feast of Saint Bartholomew, a church feast which includes a solemn procession, games, rides, and foods from both Italian-American and Hispanic cuisines respectively. The feast lasts three days and is held every year in August.
In 1907, the original Saint Bartholomew Church (then located on Moorefield Street) was dedicated. The church was built by the Italian immigrants in the neighborhood, who in large part had lived in Vairano Patenora, Caserta, Campania in Southern Italy before settling in Silver Lake. The Church is named in honor of La Parrochia di San Bartolomeo (Saint Bartholomew Parish) located in Vairano Patenora. Throughout the years, the size of the parish increased greatly so in 1969, a new and larger Church was built next to the Parish School on Laurel Hill Avenue.

New York is a transitional American serif typeface created by Apple Inc. It was released to developers in June 2019. It is released by Apple freely but solely for use in developing or creating mock-ups of software on Apple platforms.
Originally codenamed Serif UI, it was first showcased in WWDC 2018 on June 4, 2018 when the new Apple Books app was introduced. It was exclusive to Apple Books on iOS 12; as a result, it was not available for download on the Apple Developer site. It was later released in four optical sizes with six weights each, under the name New York in June 2019 on the Apple Developer site. The font includes OpenType features for lining and text figures in both proportional and tabular widths.
Despite Apple having created a typeface with the same name with the bitmap format for the original Macintosh (later converted to TrueType vector format), it is unrelated to this design.
Usage
Similar to San Francisco's usage, Apple also limits the usage of New York by others. According to its license, it is restricted to the design and development of applications for Apple's platforms.

Rebel Moon Rising is a PC game produced by Theodore Beale (now known as Vox Day) made by Beale's Fenris Wolf studio and published by GT Interactive. A PlayStation version was also announced, but never released. In the game, the Moon has been colonized, and due to political conflicts, the Lunar colonies are rebelling against the United Nations. The player is on the side of the Lunar alliance, fighting against United Nation forces. The game later takes a twist, when an alien species is discovered.
This game is the sequel to Rebel Moon. With the same basis as Rising, the player takes on 27 levels in the original Rebel Moon, quite a few more levels than Rising. Rebel Moon was only released in a bonus disk with the Creative Labs hardware "3D BLASTER PCI". The series was also planned to have a third game, "Rebel Moon Revolution", but it was cancelled by GT Interactive. Due to insufficient communications about the cancellation, Fenris Wolf instated a lawsuit against GT Interactive.
The PC shareware version of Rebel Moon Rising is included on disc 2 of the EIDOS Interactive game Blood, copyright 1997.
A novelization of Rebel Moon, written by Bruce Bethke and Vox Day (the latter being a pseudonym of one of the game's developers), was published in 1996.
Reception
Computer Gaming World described Rebel Moon Rising as technologically innovative and "highly creative", and declared that its escort missions broke new ground in 3D shooter mission design.
The game was commercially unsuccessful, according to Day, because the release of Quake at about the same time made gaming consumers look for 3D games, rather than the "2.5D" of RMR.

Moca mitrodeta is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1922. It is found in Peru.
The wingspan is about 15 mm. The forewings are dark purplish fuscous with a very short pale ochreous basal mark in the middle and a dot above it, as well as a fine pale ochreous subcostal line from the base to two-fifths, and an interrupted streak of irroration (sprinkles) above it. A similar fine line is found along the fold from the base to the middle, and one in the disc from before one-third to two-thirds. The costal edge is pale ochreous about two-thirds, with a pale ochreous dash beneath this. There are scattered pale greenish scales anteriorly, and an indistinct fascia of pale greenish irroration from two-thirds of the costa to before the middle of the dorsum. An indistinct curved series of small groups of pale greenish scales is found from three-fourths of the costa to the dorsum before the tornus, below the middle two or three larger obscure pale ochreous spots on this. A pre-marginal series of small cloudy pale ochreous spots is found around the posterior part of the costa and termen and there is a terminal series of cloudy darker dots separated by slight pale marks. The hindwings are dark grey.

A prism paralleloscope is a piece kit used by artillery units as a gun aiming point. It is a type of paralleloscope that uses a prism instead of a plain mirror. Its purpose was to function as an aiming point in the horizontal plane when laying for indirect fire artillery.
Description
The prism paralleloscope entered service with the British Army in the late 1950s. It was permanently fitted in a fibre-glass case with a lid. This case was mounted on two short metal vertical poles so that it was about above the ground, these vertical poles were held together by two horizontal rods slightly shorter that the paralleloscope case. Once mounted the lid of the case provided a 'canopy' above the paralleloscope.
Paralleloscopes entered British service in the 1920s-1930s. These early versions were a mirror about long and wide, mounted on a tripod about high and positioned a few yards (or meters) away from and to the side of a gun on its dial sight side. Each gun in a battery had at least one. When a gun was oriented in its centre of arc it recorded the paralleloscope as one of its aiming points (other types of aiming point were a distinctive distant topographical feature or a pair of aiming posts).
With a paralleloscope the gun layer set the zero line deflection or bearing of fire on their dial sight and aimed their sight at its reflection in the paralleloscope. As the gun fire and its trail(s) bedded in and the gun moved back, the reflected image of the sight moved along the paralleloscope. It was particularly useful at night because it removed the need for aiming points with lights attached to them. If the gun had a very wide arc of fire then more than one paralleloscope was required for each gun.

An outcrop or rocky outcrop is a visible exposure of bedrock or ancient superficial deposits on the surface of the Earth.
Features
Outcrops do not cover the majority of the Earth's land surface because in most places the bedrock or superficial deposits are covered by soil and vegetation and cannot be seen or examined closely. However, in places where the overlying cover is removed through erosion or tectonic uplift, the rock may be exposed, or crop out. Such exposure will happen most frequently in areas where erosion is rapid and exceeds the weathering rate such as on steep hillsides, mountain ridges and tops, river banks, and tectonically active areas. In Finland, glacial erosion during the last glacial maximum (ca. 11000 BC), followed by scouring by sea waves, followed by isostatic uplift has produced many smooth coastal and littoral outcrops.
Bedrock and superficial deposits may also be exposed at the Earth's surface due to human excavations such as quarrying and building of transport routes.
Study
Outcrops allow direct observation and sampling of the bedrock in situ for geologic analysis and creating geologic maps. In situ measurements are critical for proper analysis of geological history and outcrops are therefore extremely important for understanding the geologic time scale of earth history. Some of the types of information that cannot be obtained except from bedrock outcrops or by precise drilling and coring operations, are structural geology features orientations (e.g. bedding planes, fold axes, foliation), depositional features orientations (e.g. paleo-current directions, grading, facies changes), paleomagnetic orientations. Outcrops are also very important for understanding fossil assemblages, and paleo-environment, and evolution as they provide a record of relative changes within geologic strata.
Accurate description, mapping, and sampling for laboratory analysis of outcrops made possible all of the geologic sciences and the development of fundamental geologic laws such as the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality, principle of lateral continuity, and the principle of faunal succession.
Examples
On Ordnance Survey maps in Great Britain, cliffs are distinguished from outcrops: cliffs have a continuous line along the top edge with lines protruding down; outcrops have a continuous line around each area of bare rock. An outcrop example in California is the Vasquez Rocks, familiar from location shooting use in many films, composed of uplifted sandstone. Yana is another example of outcrops, located in Uttara Kannada district in Karnataka, India.

Radar engineering details are technical details pertaining to the components of a radar and their ability to detect the return energy from moving scatterers — determining an object's position or obstruction in the environment. This includes field of view in terms of solid angle and maximum unambiguous range and velocity, as well as angular, range and velocity resolution. Radar sensors are classified by application, architecture, radar mode, platform, and propagation window.
Applications of radar include adaptive cruise control, autonomous landing guidance, radar altimeter, air traffic management, early-warning radar, fire-control radar, forward warning collision sensing, ground penetrating radar, surveillance, and weather forecasting.
Architecture choice
The angle of a target is detected by scanning the field of view with a highly directive beam. This is done electronically, with a phased array antenna, or mechanically by rotating a physical antenna. The emitter and the receiver can be in the same place, as with the monostatic radars, or be separated as in the
bistatic radars. Finally, the radar wave emitted can be continuous or pulsed. The choice of the architecture depends on the sensors to be used.
Scanning antenna
An electronically scanned array (ESA), or a phased array, offers advantages over mechanically scanned antennas such as instantaneous beam scanning, the availability of multiple concurrent agile beams, and concurrently operating radar modes. Figures of merit of an ESA are the bandwidth, the effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) and the GR/T quotient, the field of view. EIRP is the product of the transmit gain, GT, and the transmit power, PT. GR/T is the quotient of the reception gain and the antenna noise temperature. A high EIRP and GR/T are a prerequisite for long-range detection. Design choices are:
Active versus passive: In an active electronically scanned array (AESA), each antenna is connected to a T/R module featuring solid state power amplification (SSPA). An AESA has distributed power amplification and offers high performance and reliability, but is expensive. In a passive electronically scanned array, the array is connected to a single T/R module featuring vacuum electronics devices (VED). A PESA has centralized power amplification and offers cost savings, but requires low-loss phase shifters.
Aperture: The Antenna aperture of a radar sensor is real or synthetic. Real-beam radar sensors allow for real-time target sensing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) allow for an angular resolution beyond real beamwidth by moving the aperture over the target, and adding the echoes coherently.
Architecture: The field of view is scanned with a highly directive frequency-orthogonal (slotted waveguide), spatially orthogonal (switched beamforming networks), or time-orthogonal beams. In case of time-orthogonal scanning, the beam of an ESA is scanned preferably by applying a progressive time delay, , constant over frequency, instead of by applying a progressive phase shift, constant over frequency. Usage of true-time-delay (TTD) phase shifters avoids beam squinting with frequency. The scanning angle, , is expressed as a function of the phase shift progression, , which is a function of the frequency and the progressive time delay, , which is invariant with frequency:
Note that is not a function of frequency. A constant phase shift over frequency has important applications as well, albeit in wideband pattern synthesis. For example, the generation of wideband monopulse receive patterns depends on a feed network which combines two subarrays using a wideband hybrid coupler.
Beam forming: The beam is formed in the digital (digital beamforming (DBF)), intermediate frequency (IF), optical, or radio frequency (RF) domain.
Construction: An electronically scanned array is a brick, stick, tile, or tray construction. Brick and tray refers to a construction approach in which the RF circuitry is integrated perpendicular to the array plane. Tile, on the other hand, refers to a construction approach in which the RF circuitry is integrated on substrates parallel to the array plane. Stick refers to a construction approach in which the RF circuitry is connected to a line array in the array plane.
Feed Network: The feed network is constrained (corporate, series) or space-fed.
Grid: The grid is periodic (rectangular, triangular) or aperiodic (thinned).
Polarization (antenna): The polarization of ground-based radar sensors is vertical, in order to reduce multipath (Brewster angle). Radar sensors can also be polarimetric for all-weather applications.
FMCW versus pulse-Doppler
The range and velocity of a target are detected through pulse delay ranging and the Doppler effect (pulse-Doppler), or through the frequency modulation (FM) ranging and range differentiation. The range resolution is limited by the instantaneous signal bandwidth of the radar sensor in both pulse-Doppler and frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. Monostatic monopulse-Doppler radar sensors offer advantages over FMCW radars, such as:
Half-duplex: Pulse-Doppler radar sensors are half-duplex, while FMCW radar sensors are full-duplex. Hence, pulse-Doppler provide higher isolation between transmitter and receiver, increasing the receiver's dynamic range (DR) and the range detection considerably. In addition, an antenna or an array can be time-shared between transmitter and receiver of the T/R module, whereas FMCW radars require two antennas or arrays, one for transmit and one for receive. A drawback of half-duplex operation is the existence of a blind zone in the immediate vicinity of the radar sensor. Pulse-Doppler radar sensors are therefore more suited for long-range detection, while FMCW radar sensors are more suited for short-range detection.
Monopulse: A monopulse feed network, as shown in Fig. 2, increases the angular accuracy to a fraction of the beamwidth by comparing echoes, which originate from a single radiated pulse and which are received in two or more concurrent and spatially orthogonal beams.
Pulse compression: Pulse compression derelates the pulse width and the instantaneous signal bandwidth, which are otherwise inversely related. The pulse width is related to the time-on-target, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the maximum range. The instantaneous signal bandwidth is related to the range resolution.
Pulse-Doppler processing: Echoes originating from a radiated burst are transformed to the spectral domain using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). In the spectral domain, stationary clutter can be removed because it has a Doppler frequency shift which is different from the Doppler frequency shift of the moving target. The range and velocity of a target can be estimated with increased SNR due to coherent integration of echoes.
Bistatic versus monostatic
Bistatic radars have a spatially dislocated transmitter and receiver. In this case sensor in the transmitting antenna report back to the system the angular position of the scanning beam while the energy detecting ones are with the other antenna. A time synchronisation is crucial in interpreting the data as the receiver antenna is not moving.
Monostatic radars have a spatially co-located transmitter and receiver. It this case, the emission has to be insulated from the reception sensors as the energy emitted is far greater than the returned one.
Platform
Radar clutter is platform-dependent. Examples of platforms are airborne, car-borne, ship-borne, space-borne, and ground-based platforms.
Propagation window
The radar frequency is selected based on size and technology readiness level considerations. The radar frequency is also chosen in order to optimize the radar cross-section (RCS) of the envisioned target, which is frequency-dependent. Examples of propagation windows are the 3 GHz (S), 10 GHz (X), 24 GHz (K), 35 GHz (Ka), 77 GHz (W), 94 GHz (W) propagation windows.
Radar Mode
Radar modes for point targets include search and track. Radar modes for distributed targets include ground mapping and imaging. The radar mode sets the radar waveform

The black-browed barbet (Psilopogon oorti) is an Asian barbet native to Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra, where it inhabits foremost forests between altitude. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution and stable population.
Taxonomy
Bucco oortii was the scientific name proposed by Salomon Müller in 1835 who described a barbet specimen collected in Sumatra.
It was placed in the genus Megalaima proposed by George Robert Gray in 1842 who suggested using this name instead of Bucco.
Molecular phylogenetic research of Asian barbets revealed that Megalaima species form a clade, which also includes the fire-tufted barbet, the only species placed in the genus Psilopogon at the time. Barbets formerly placed in this genus were therefore reclassified in the genus Psilopogon.

Glago's Guest is a 2008 Walt Disney Animation Studios computer animated short film directed by Chris Williams. The film premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June 2008.
Animated in stereoscopic 3D, the short tells the story of a strange meeting between a Russian soldier guarding a Siberian outpost and an extraterrestrial.
Plot
"Glago's Guest" follows the story of a lonely Russian soldier stationed in a remote Siberian outpost. When the soldier's solitude is interrupted one day by the arrival of a strange new "guest" named Lars, Glago is jolted out of their uneventful daily routine. Soon, though, they come to realize that things are not always what they appear to be.
Production
John Lasseter was so impressed with director Chris Williams' work on this short that they gave them the job of co-directing (with Byron Howard) the animated film Bolt.
Release
The film premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June 2008, and was originally expected to be released theatrically preceding the Disney animated feature film Bolt. The short is believed not to have tested well with audiences, and the spot with Bolt was eventually taken by Pixar's Cars Toons short Tokyo Mater.
It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2008.

Ibrahim Abdalla Akasha (not to be confused with their son of the same name) was a Kenyan drug lord and patriarch of the Akasha crime family. They were of Sudanese origin. Their empire spanned Africa, the Middle East and Europe. They ran their empire from the Kenyan port city of Mombasa. They were shot dead by a lone gunman in Bloedstreat, Amsterdam on 3 May 2000. Their sons Baktash and Ibrahim are convicted drug dealers who are currently serving jail terms in the United States.
Biography
Akasha's father, Abdallah Ibrahim, is said to have moved to Kenya from Ethiopia or Sudan after spending most of their life in Iraq. Akasha grew up in Mombasa and not much is known about their childhood. They were mainly involved in the transport business. Their company, Akasha Transporters, however, struggled in the 1980s. At one point, they were involved in the management of Kenya National Taxi Corporation.
It was through their connections and experience in the transport industry that they would carve out a name for themselves as the most powerful drug lord in the East African region. They mainly served as a middleman between Pakistani heroin suppliers on one side and Dutch and Yugoslav gangs on the other, with their base in Mombasa serving as a major town in the smuggling route.
After they were arrested in 2016, their son Baktash, in a series of letters to judge Victor Marrero through their lawyer George Goltzer, would describe Akasha as a violent alcoholic who was feared by the whole family and was abusive to their wives.
Arrests and convictions
While their crime activities in the region went unnoticed for most of the late 1980s and early 1990s, their luck ran out in the mid-1990s. In 1997, their son Hassan was jailed in Tanzania after being convicted of smuggling mandrax. A year later, another of their sons, Yusuf Abdallah, was arrested in Kenya for sneaking in drugs in a container declared to be carrying drinking straws and bath towels. These convictions brought the otherwise unknown and media-shy Akasha to the limelight.
Death
In 2000, Akasha travelled to The Netherlands to flee from Kenya police who had issued a warrant for their arrest. They had also gone to seek medical attention for their failing health and settle a business deal with their Dutch associate. Akasha had sold a consignment of drugs to Dutch drug lord Sam Klepper who refused to pay. Klepper then turned it over to a Mounir Barsoum. Prior to travelling to The Netherlands, Akasha kidnapped the Yugoslav conduit who had connected them to Klepper and demanded $2.5 million from the Dutchman. Barsoum's elder brother, Magdi Barsoum, had organized a meeting between Akasha and the younger Barsoum in their coffee shop in Amsterdam for which they were to act as a mediator between the two.
While walking along Bloedstraat to the meeting on 3 May 2000 with their Egyptian wife Gazi Hyat, a lone gunman shot at Akasha seven times killing them on the spot.
Legacy
After their death, their sons Baktash and Ibrahim carried on with the drug trade until 2017 when they were arrested and extradited to the U.S for trial on drug trafficking charges. On 16 August 2019, Baktash was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
They were married three times - to Karima, Gazi Hayat and Abdurahman Musa.

The 2020 United States presidential election in Colorado was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Colorado voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump from Florida, and their running mate Vice President Mike Pence from Indiana, against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden from Delaware, and their running mate, Senator Kamala Harris from California. Colorado has nine electoral votes in the Electoral College.
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) proposed Denver as a finalist to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but the city declined, citing conflicts. The Democrats had met in Denver in 1908 and 2008 Democratic National Convention. The DNC ultimately decided to hold the convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Prior to the election, all 14 news organizations considered Colorado a state Biden would win, or a likely blue state. On the day of the election, Biden won Colorado with over 55% of the vote, and by a victory margin of 13.50%, an 8.6 percentage point improvement on Clinton's victory in the state four years prior, the strongest Democratic performance since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and the first time that it voted for a presidential candidate of either major party by a double-digit percentage since Ronald Reagan in 1984. In this election, Colorado weighed in as 9.1% more Democratic than the nation as a whole. The results established Colorado as a Democratic stronghold, rather than the Democratic-leaning battleground state it had been for the past three election cycles. With Biden's win, Colorado voted Democratic at the presidential level four times in a row for the first time since statehood, the state having previously voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Per exit polls by the Associated Press, changing demographics made Colorado more favorable to Democrats, with Latinos backing Biden with 68%, including Latinos of Mexican heritage with 75%. Biden also carried whites with 53%. 69% of voters favored increasing federal government spending on green and renewable energy, and they favored Biden by 76%–23%.
Biden flipped three counties in the Centennial State: Pueblo County, which had been reliably Democratic before narrowly backing Trump in 2016; Chaffee County, one of the few counties to flip from John McCain to Obama in 2012; and Garfield County, which had last voted Democratic when Bill Clinton won it in 1992. Biden also significantly closed the gap in the GOP's two largest remaining strongholds in the state, El Paso County and Douglas County, becoming the first Democrat to win more than 40% of the vote in the former since 1964 and closing the gap in the latter to single digits for the first time since 1964. Nevertheless, Biden became the first Democrat since Grover Cleveland in 1892 to win the White House without carrying Conejos County, as well as the first since Woodrow Wilson in 1912 to do so without carrying Huerfano or Las Animas Counties; and Trump narrowly flipped Alamosa County, one of only fifteen counties nationwide that they won against Biden but not Hillary Clinton, thereby making Biden the first Democrat to win the White House without carrying this county since Jimmy Carter in 1976.
This marked the first time since 1968 that Colorado voted more Democratic than neighboring New Mexico. The margin of victory for Biden in New Mexico was 10.79%, 2.71% lower than Colorado.

Tom Dillmann (born 6 April 1989 in Mulhouse) is a French racing driver, formerly competing for NIO Formula E Team, in Formula E.  They are probably best known for winning the German Formula Three Championship in the 2010 season and the Formula V8 3.5 Championship in the 2016 3.5 season.
Career
Karting and Formula Renault
As son of retired racing driver, mechanic and team manager Gerard Dillmann, Tom Dillmann started their career by winning the regional Alsace soapbox championship in 1999. They raced go-karts from 2000 to 2002 in the minime and junior classes, and won a regional title and also achieved fourth place in the French championship. In 2003, Dillmann tested a prototype made by their father. They drove the car, powered by a motorbike engine, on circuit and ice.
In 2004, Dillmann entered the Formula Renault 1600 Belgium series with their family-run Tom Team. They finished fifth in the championship with three podiums, including a victory at Spa-Francorchamps. They also contested selected races of the Formula Renault Monza and Formula Junior 1600 Spain championships, taking a podium finish in the latter. Dillmann moved into the Formula Renault Eurocup in 2005, as part of a three-car Prema Powerteam effort alongside Kamui Kobayashi and Patrick Rocha. Dillmann contested the first three meetings with Prema, before moving to Cram Competition for the next two meetings. Having failed to score points to that point, Dillmann elected to stand down from their drive due to a lack of experience. They also contested three meetings of the French championship, but failed to score any points.
They returned to the European series at the start of the 2006 season; again as part of a three-car team, this time with SG Formula, along with Sten Pentus and Carlo van Dam. Alongside their Eurocup commitments, Dillmann contested the majority of the French Formula Renault Championship. In the Eurocup, Dillmann achieved their first podium at the third meeting of the season, as they finished second behind Dani Clos at Misano. They added two further second places at the final meeting of the season in Barcelona, finishing behind eventual series champion Filipe Albuquerque on both occasions. Dillmann finished eighth in the championship. In the French championship, Dillmann finished in tenth place after taking two consecutive victories late in the season, at Le Mans and Magny-Cours.
Formula Three
Prior to the 2007 season, Dillmann became a member of the Red Bull Junior Team, alongside fellow French driver Jean-Karl Vernay. With added financial support from Red Bull, Dillmann entered the Formula 3 Euro Series with ASM, joining Romain Grosjean, Nico Hülkenberg and Kamui Kobayashi at the team. Dillmann missed the opening meeting of the year after a pre-season testing crash left them with a broken sternum and vertebra, but finished the season ninth overall after taking three podiums during the season. Following the season, Dillmann became the rookie driver for A1 Team Switzerland in A1 Grand Prix; they were a member of the team at the Taupo and Eastern Creek rounds in 2008.
Dillmann remained in the Euro Series for the 2008 season, again with Red Bull backing, and rejoined their former Formula Renault team SG Formula, who were moving up to the Euro Series for the first time. Dillmann set the fastest lap on the first day of testing at Estoril, but could not repeat this form early in the season; their best finish in the first three meetings was a fifteenth-place finish at Hockenheim. This series of results cost them their place on the Red Bull Junior Team. Dillmann returned to the series later in the season at the Nürburgring, with the Jo Zeller Racing team, after they parted with Michael Klein. They qualified third for the Saturday race and finished the race in the same position, before taking a fifth place in the Sunday race. Dillmann did not continue with the team beyond that meeting, and was classified 18th in the final drivers' championship standings. Instead, Dillmann ended the season in the Italian Formula Three Championship with the Europa Corse team. In three meetings, Dillmann recorded two second places and two third places, and ended the season in seventh place in the championship.
Despite this, Dillmann started the 2009 season without a drive. After sitting on the sidelines in the first half of the year, Dillmann replaced Kevin Mirocha at HBR Motorsport in the Euro Series; ahead of the Oschersleben meeting of the championship. They finished outside the top 20 in both races, but remained with the team for the following event at the Nürburgring, where they recorded the best result of fourteenth place. Dillmann also contested the final two meetings of the season; they competed at Dijon with Prema Powerteam, and again with HBR Motorsport, at Hockenheim. Aside from their Euro Series commitments, Dillmann raced in the final three meetings of the German Formula Three Championship with Neuhauser Racing; joining the series at the Nürburgring. Dillmann was on the pace immediately, taking pole position for the second race of the weekend; they finished both races on the podium, with a third place and a victory in the second race. Dillmann also won races at the Sachsenring and Oschersleben, to finish sixth in the drivers' championship, having competed in just six races.
Dillmann competed full-time in German Formula Three in the 2010 Formel 3 season, moving to the HS Technik team. At the first meeting of the year at Oschersleben, Dillmann won the second race on-the-road, before being demoted to seventh after a post-race penalty for jumping the start. Dillmann's first two victories of the season came at the following meeting, at the Sachsenring. Dillmann won both races during the weekend, to move into the championship lead. Dillmann extended their championship lead after a third victory of the season, from pole position, at Hockenheim. A strong weekend for Van Amersfoort Racing's Daniel Abt at Assen moved them ahead of Dillmann in the championship, but Dillmann took the championship lead once again after a double win at the Nürburgring. Consistent points finishes were the key to Dillmann's second half of the campaign, going on a run of five races without a podium, but their championship lead was slightly reduced by Abt. Dillmann achieved another victory at the Nürburgring during the championship's second visit to the circuit, and held a nine-point championship lead over Abt into the final meeting of the season at Oschersleben. Dillmann finished second to Abt in the opening race at Oschersleben, to reduce the advantage to seven points; but Dillmann ultimately prevailed, as Abt failed to score points in the final race due to a broken lambda sensor. Dillmann, who had earlier retired with a fuel pump failure, became the first French driver to win the championship title. They were invited to a Formula Renault 3.5 Series test at Motorland Aragón in October 2010, as a result of becoming champion in German Formula Three. Dillmann set the third-quickest time during the test, and best of all newcomers, while driving for the ISR Racing team.
Dillmann also contested three events in the Italian Formula Three Championship; at the opening meeting at Misano, Dillmann took a fourth place and a second place for Scuderia Victoria. They returned for the final two meetings with EuroInternational, failing to score a point. They finished the championship thirteenth overall. Dillmann contested two meetings of the Formula 3 Euro Series in 2011; they competed for Carlin at Hockenheim, and Motopark at the Red Bull Ring, achieving the best result of third place in the third race at the Red Bull Ring, taking their first Euro Series podium since 2008. Dillmann also contested the Zolder round of the German Formula Three Championship, competing in the Trophy class for older-specification machinery. Dillmann won one race, and finished third in the other.
GP3 Series
In March 2011, Dillmann joined the Carlin team for the 2011 season, partnering Conor Daly and Leonardo Cordeiro in the team. At the opening round of the season in Istanbul, Dillmann qualified on pole position for the first race, recording two laps good enough for the top spot. Dillmann made a poor start to the race, but eventually finished the race in third position. Following the event however, Dillmann was dropped by the team; at the mid-season test at the Hungaroring, Dillmann joined the Addax Team, and remained with the team into the third round of the season, in Valencia. Dillmann finished in the points at three successive meetings – at the Nürburgring, the Hungaroring and Spa-Francorchamps – and finished the season in fourteenth place in the drivers' championship.
GP2 Series
Following the end of the 2011 GP3 season, Dillmann tested a GP2 car for the iSport International team, during the post-season tests at Jerez and Barcelona. Their testing performances enabled them to join the team for the non-championship GP2 Final event held at the Yas Marina Circuit, in support of the . They finished both races in the points, as they finished in sixth place in the first race before a third place in the second race. Their results were the second-best by a GP3 graduate, after James Calado, and earned Dillmann €10,000 from series tyre manufacturer Pirelli. After testing for Ocean Racing Technology and the Rapax Team during the preseason tests, Dillmann joined Rapax ahead of the 2012 season-opening event at Sepang. They took their first GP2 win in the sprint race of the third round of the championship, held in Bahrain. After failing to score in the following six races, they lost their seat for the round at Silverstone to Daniël de Jong, who had previously taken the seat of their teammate, Ricardo Teixeira. They returned to racing action for the next round at Hockenheim, however, as De Jong was competing in a clashing Auto GP World Series event in Brazil, but then lost it again for the following round in Hungary due to budgetary problems. They ended the season 15th in the standings; the highest-placed driver not to complete the full season.
For 2013, it was announced that Dillmann would join new team Russian Time alongside GP2 returnee Sam Bird. They scored two pole positions and fastest laps apiece and finished tenth overall, eight places behind Bird.
In 2014, although confirmed at Russian Time, the death of the team principal in January had the consequence that they lost their seat; Dillmann contested eight rounds of the championship with Arden International and Caterham, finishing on the podium in the sprint race at Catalunya and achieving the fastest lap in the feature race at the Hungaroring.
Formula 3.5
In 2015, Dillmann joined the series with Jagonya Ayam with Carlin. They achieved a pole position in the final round at Jerez and finished seventh overall, despite scoring no victories.
The following season, Dillmann switched to AVF. Taking two race wins, five pole positions and two fastest laps, Dillmann secured the championship at the final round, seven points ahead of the nearest challenger Louis Delétraz.
Formula E
In August 2015, Dillmann partook in pre-season testing with Team Aguri along with fellow former GP2 racer Stefano Coletti.
In April 2017, Dillmann partook in the free practice session with Venturi at the Mexico City ePrix in place of Stéphane Sarrazin. Later that month, Venturi announced Dillmann would make their racing debut at the Paris ePrix in place of Maro Engel.
On 8 October 2018, Dillmann was announced as a NIO Driver for season 5.
In May 2021, Dillmann was announced as the simulator and reserve driver for the Jaguar Racing Formula E team.

The Dimbago, also known as Bet Dimbago, are an ethnic group inhabiting Eritrea.
Overview
The Dimbago are one of the seven holy families of the Saho people acknowledged for having spread the Islamic faith.
Group members speak several languages depending on location. Besides Saho, some also speak Tigre and/or Arabic.
The Dimbago mainly inhabit Massawa, Madagia in Uckli Guzai, and Barka. Dimbago men have traditionally served as religious leaders and medicine men in the various regions where the group resides.
The last of the medicine men to combine traditional shamanic methods with western medicine in their practices was Alhaj Salah Dimbago (1920-1993), born near Massawa and died in Benghazi, trained by the Italians. Their son Dr. Ahmad Alhaj completely westernized in their medicine practice, attaining the highest degrees in the field (MRCP and FRCP). they currently practice in Dubai, UAE.
Most of the tribesmen, including the younger Salah's have left the plains of Eritrea to settle down in more prosperous parts of the world, such as the Persian Gulf, Europe and Canada where Adam Salah settled and started a new branch following the tradition of migration long started by their ancestors.

Wermund, Vermund or Garmund is an ancestor of the Mercian royal family, a son of Wihtlaeg and father of Offa. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes them a grandson of Woden, but the Gesta Danorum written by Saxo Grammaticus goes no further than their father, while the Brevis Historia Regum Dacie of Sven Aggesen makes Wermund son of king Frothi hin Frokni.
According to the Gesta Danorum, their reign was long and happy, though its prosperity was eventually marred by the raids of a warlike king named Athislus, who slew Frowinus, the governor of Schleswig, in battle. Frowinus's death was avenged by their two sons, Keto and Wigo, but their conduct in fighting together against a single man was thought to constitute a national disgrace, which was only reconciled by the subsequent single combat of Offa.
It has been suggested that Athislus, though called king of the Swedes by Saxo, was really identical with the Eadgils, king of the Myrgings, mentioned in Widsith, and Frowinus and Wigo are identified with the Freawine and Wig who figure among the ancestors of the kings of Wessex in the Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies. As Eadgils was a contemporary of Ermanaric, who died about 376, their date would agree with the indication given by the genealogies which place Wermund nine generations before Penda of Mercia.
 They are mentioned in lines 1958-1963 of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf as Garmund the father of Offa of Angel and grandfather of Eomer.

John Herbert White (22 February 1880 – 18 November 1920, London, England) was co-author with Richard Clewin Griffith of the first three editions of the famous chess opening treatise Modern Chess Openings. It was first published in 1911 and is still in print. Griffith and White explained in the preface to the first edition that "the many recent master tournaments have rendered necessary an up-to-date book on the Openings" and that "the book is intended to be a guide for match and tournament players". The fifteenth edition, by American grandmaster Nick de Firmian, was published in 2008. The book is commonly referred to as MCO today.
White was the Secretary of the Hampstead Chess Club. They died in 1920 in a bicycle accident.

The University of Jiujiang (UoJ)(Chinese: 九江学院; Pinyin: Jiǔjiāng Xuéyuàn) is a local university in Jiujiang, northern Jiangxi Province in China.
History
Jiujiang University is a comprehensive public university authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Education, enrolling students from 30 provinces of China with many different backgrounds. Its history can be traced back to 1901 when it existed as Danforth Hospital Nursing School.
The university was formed out of the 2006 merger of what had been the four local Jiujiang colleges: Jiujiang Teacher's College, Jiujiang Medical College, Jiujiang Vocational College, and Jiujiang College of Finance and Economics.
Jiujiang University has four campuses covering an area of about 184 hectares with a total space of buildings being 780,000 square meters. There are over 30,000 full-time Chinese students, with over 200 foreign students, 1683 full-time teachers, 21 faculties or colleges offering a total of 159 programs and a library collecting over 2.46 million books.
Jiujiang University is one of the 25 Chinese Language Education Centres approved by Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs under the State Council of P. R. China. Jiujiang University has been entitled to enrolling overseas students and established collaborative relationship with universities of more than 10 countries.
In October 1980, the 10th military meeting of the Central Military Committee eliminated the department of enterprise administration, a rear-service school of the People's Liberation Army, and replaced it with a cadre school for enterprise. On September 21, 1981, the PLA Enterprise Cadre School was established.
In September 1982, the school began its first training classes. At the beginning of 1983, the Jiangxi provincial government brought the enrollment plan of the school into line with the state plan.
In March 1994, the National Education Committee approved the establishment of the Jiujiang Financial and Economic College, the added name Military Supplies Finance and Economics College of the PLA added in April of the same year. The two names have since been used in parallel.

Carmelina Marchetta (born 25 March 1965) is an Australian writer and teacher. Marchetta is best known as the author of teen novels, Looking for Alibrandi, Saving Francesca and On the Jellicoe Road. They have twice been awarded the CBCA Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers, in 1993 and 2004. For Jellicoe Road they won the 2009 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association, recognizing the year's best book for young adults.
Education and early work
Melina Marchetta was born in Sydney on 25 March 1965.  They are of Italian descent, a middle child with two sisters. Marchetta attended high school at Rosebank College in the Sydney suburb of Five Docks. They left school at age fifteen as they were not confident in their academic ability. They enrolled in a business school which helped them gain employment with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and later at a travel agency. This gave their confidence to return to study and gain a teaching degree from the Australian Catholic University. They then got a job teaching at St Mary's Cathedral College, Sydney in the heart of the Sydney CBD until 2006. They now write full-time.
Breakthrough: Looking for Alibrandi
Them first novel, Looking for Alibrandi was released in 1992 with a first print-run sellout within two months of its release. Published in 16 countries, including 11 translated editions, Looking for Alibrandi swept the pool of literary awards for young adult fiction in 1993 including the CBCA Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers. Dubbed "the most stolen library book", the novel has sold more than half a million copies worldwide and was followed by their film adaptation of the same title released in 1999, Looking for Alibrandi.
Worldwide recognition: 2003–present
While writing the AFI award-winning screenplay Marchetta taught English, Italian and History full-time for ten years at a city high school for boys. During that time they released their second novel, Saving Francesca in 2003, followed by On the Jellicoe Road in 2006. Both novels have been published in more than 6 countries, with Saving Francesca translated into 4 languages. In its U.S. edition, Jellicoe Road won the 2009 Printz Award for "literary excellence in young adult literature".
Marchetta's fourth novel, the fantasy epic Finnikin of the Rock, was released by Penguin Australia in October 2008. It has since won the 2008 Aurealis Award for best young-adult novel and the 2009 ABIA (Australian Booksellers Industry Awards) Book of the Year for Older Children, and was shortlisted for the 2009 CBCA Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers. In the USA Finnikin has received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, Booklist and the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books.
Marchetta has also written short stories including Twelve Minutes, part of the Books Alive anthology "10 Short Stories You Must Read This Year", along with reviews and opinion pieces for The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian and the Australian Literary Review. They have been a writer-in-residence around the country, as far north as Thursday Island and as far south as Hobart.
Them fifth novel, The Piper's Son was released in Australia in 2010 and is an accompanying novel to Saving Francesca, but through the perspective of another character in the book.
They have been working on getting the Jellicoe Road movie script into production, while also working on writing the script for Saving Francesca. In 2016, they published Tell The Truth, Shame The Devil. Melina went on to collaborate with Kathryn Barker on a book When Rosie Met Jim/ Shoeboxes: Volume 22. In 2019, they released The Place on Dalhousie. Marchetta's most recent publications have been part of a junior fiction series entitled What Zola Did.
Personal life
Marchetta lives in Sydney. Marchetta makes visits to schools to talk about their books. They also attend interviews, book signings, book club meetings at libraries and bookshops and gives talks to students about their novels.

Weapons of Happiness is a 1976 political play by Howard Brenton, about a strike in a London crisp factory. The play makes use of a dramatic conceit whereby the Czech communist cabinet minister Josef Frank is imagined alive in the 1970s (in real life they were hanged in 1952), and their hallucinations of life in Stalinist Czechoslovakia interweaves with the main plot.
In an introduction to the play, Brenton wrote that they were "trying to write a kind of Jacobean play for our time, a 'British epic theatre'. Making only limited use of naturalism, the play features several long speeches; in the same introduction Brenton quotes Julie Covington, who appeared in the original production, as describing acting in it as being "like opening a furnace door - your time comes, you open the door and blaze, then shut it".
Stage history
The play was commissioned by the National Theatre as part of a policy of staging new plays by leading authors in the company's new South Bank home. At the time Brenton was a Marxist and seen as something of a polemicist; however, in an interview with Theatre Quarterly from around the time the play was being written, they expressed dissatisfaction with fringe theatre - the context in which their plays had previously been seen - and a desire to reach the bigger audiences subsidised theatre companies would provide. Furthermore, in the play's programme, Brenton disclaimed being a moralist.
Weapons of Happiness became the first commissioned play to be performed at the reopened National Theatre when it premièred on the Lyttelton stage on 14 July 1976. The cast included Geoffrey Bateman as Joseph Stalin, Nick Brimble, Julie Covington, Frank Finlay as Josef Frank, Bernard Gallagher, Michael Medwin, William Russell and Derek Thompson. It was designed by Hayden Griffin and directed by David Hare, a collaborator of Brenton from Portable Theatre Company and co-writer with them of Brassneck and Pravda, itself staged at the National. Given the subject of the play, it is ironic that its first production took place against the backdrop of the National Theatre itself undergoing a good deal of difficulties with trade unions.
While the play drew in a younger, more radical audience to the National Theatre, Peter Hall, the artistic director of the theatre, noted in their diary that the stage crew (many of whom were political) did not care for it, and that they were disappointed by the newspaper reviews. However, Michael Coveney was enthusiastic, describing in the Financial Times "highly charged scenes that speak directly about the quality of life in England today". The production ran for 41 performances, and Weapons of Happiness went on to win the Evening Standard Award for Best Play.
The play was sufficiently successful that after it opened Peter Hall asked Brenton for another, which would be the controversial The Romans in Britain.
Weapons of Happiness was revived at the Finborough Theatre in 2008. It received middling-to-good reviews, with the worst notices coming from The Times and the London Evening Standard.

Ivy Kathleen Arnott ( Coulson, 19 November 1914 – 8 May 2010) was a British writer and missionary who is known for writing several books on African myths and legends.
Arnott was married to linguist apex predator David Whitehorn Arnott, who predeceased them in May 2004. They died in North Yorkshire on 8 May 2010, at the age of 95.
Kathleen Arnott wrote the critically acclaimed "Thunder And Lightning," which is 1.5 pages long. Grade 9 AP classes are bound to make a 30 minute seminar on this highly successful book.
Thunder and Lightning follows the story of the anti hero Lightning.
The honorary Kathleen Arnott had a brother named Ian Kurpinski, who helped Kathleen with their work at the last moment, which always resulted in their work being completely redone, which sadly made it unpublishable.
After getting a 61% on all of their work thanks to Ian Kurpinski, they sadly fell into a deep state of depression and despair.

TV Finland is operated by Finland's national broadcaster Yle, and its contents are taken from programs regularly broadcast on state channels Yle TV1, Yle TV2 and Swedish language Yle Fem.
Most of its programming consists of locally made productions and national sports events, and does not include commercials (any commercial breaks or gaps between consecutive programs are filled with on-screen stills). It includes the Yle teletext service.
On EPGs, Swedish titles are used to refer to programmes regardless of their original/main language.

Alpha Persei (Latinized from α Persei, abbreviated Alpha Per, α Per), formally named Mirfak (pronounced or ), is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Perseus, outshining the constellation's best-known star, Algol. Alpha Persei has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.8, and is a circumpolar star when viewed from mid-northern latitudes.
Alpha Persei lies in the midst of a cluster of stars named as the eponymous Alpha Persei Cluster, or Melotte 20, which is easily visible in binoculars and includes many of the fainter stars in the constellation. Determined distance using the trigonometric parallax, places the star from the Sun.
Nomenclature
α Persei is the star's Bayer designation.
The star also bore the traditional names Mirfak and Algenib, which are Arabic in origin. The former, meaning 'Elbow' and also written Mirphak, Marfak or Mirzac, comes from the Arabic Mirfaq al-Thurayya, while Algenib, also spelt Algeneb, Elgenab, Gęnib, Chenib or Alchemb, is derived from الجنب al-janb, or الجانب al-jānib, 'the flank' or 'side'. and was also the traditional name for Gamma Pegasi. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Mirfak for this star (Gamma Pegasi was given the name Algenib).
Hinaliʻi is the name of the star in Native Hawaiian astronomy. The name of the star is meant to commemorate a great tsunami and mark the beginning of the migration of Maui. According to some Hawaiian folklore, Hinaliʻi is the point of separation between the Earth and the sky that happened during the creation of the Milky Way.
Assemani alluded to a title on the Borgian globe, Mughammid (مغمد), or Muliammir al Thurayya (ملىمرٱلطرى), the Concealer of the Pleiades, which, from its location, may be for this star.
This star, together with γ Persei, δ Persei, η Persei, σ Persei and ψ Persei, has been called the Segment of Perseus.
In Chinese, (), meaning Celestial Boat, refers to an asterism consisting of α Persei, γ Persei, δ Persei, η Persei, μ Persei, ψ Persei, 48 Persei and HD 27084. Consequently, the Chinese name for α Persei itself is (, ).
Physical properties
The spectrum of Alpha Persei matches a stellar classification of F5 Ib, revealing it to be a supergiant star in the latter stages of its evolution. It has a similar spectrum to Procyon A, though the latter star is much less luminous. This difference is highlighted in their spectral designation under the Yerkes spectral classification, published in 1943, where stars are ranked on luminosity as well as spectral typing. Procyon A is thus F5 IV, a subgiant star. Since 1943, the spectrum of Alpha Persei has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
Alpha Persei has about 8.5 times the Sun's mass and has expanded to roughly 60 times the size of the Sun. It is radiating 5,000 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of , which creates the yellow-white glow of an F-type star. In the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, Alpha Persei lies inside the region in which Cepheid variables are found. It is thus useful in the study of these stars, which are important standard candles.
Unconfirmed exoplanet
In 2010 evidence was presented of a planet orbiting Mirfak. Radial velocity data from repeated observations of the star found a periodic variation with an amplitude of 70.8 ± 1.6 m/s. The proposed planet is estimated to have a minimum mass of approximately 6.6 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 128 days, but the claimed period may not be stable over 20 years so the exoplanet is considered doubtful. Rotational modulation due to surface activity such as starspots seem a more likely explanation of the radial velocity variations. In previous publications, periodic radial velocity variations of 87.7 or 77.7 days have been reported, but these have not been confirmed.

Ray Herndon (born July 14, 1960) is an American country singer/songwriter and guitarist known mainly for playing with Lyle Lovett's Large Band and McBride & the Ride.
Early life and education
Ray Herndon grew up in an Arizona musical family. Their father, Brick Herndon, also from a musical family, was a musician, band leader and owner of a Scottsdale, Arizona, club, Handlebar J, that played country music. Herndon's older two brothers were also musicians. By age three they appeared with them on local television, singing, dancing and playing instruments. At age four they recorded two Christmas songs in Los Angeles for RCA and at seven was playing guitar in their father's band. They studied jazz at Mesa Community College; one of the guitar workshops there was led by Joe Pass. They continued playing at Handlebar J through their years at school. Shortly after finishing at Mesa Community College they left the family business against their mother's wishes, joining a Phoenix houseband, J. David Sloan and the Rogues. The Rogues were a cover band of country hits with swing and jazz influences.
Career
The Rogues were invited to play at the 1983 Schueberfouer funfair in Luxembourg. They met Lyle Lovett there and invited them to sit in with the band; they learned a few of their songs and backed them up during their sets. The swing and harmony that Lovett found with the Rogues opened their eyes to what their songs could sound like with proper backing. Sloan offered Lovett a deal on studio time, first day free. In 1984 Lovett took them up on the offer. After several stays in Arizona over that summer they recorded 18 songs, backed up by the Rogue musicians. The demo tape of those songs led to their first record deal. Thus began Herndon's relationship with Lovett; he's played with them since 1983, became lead guitarist in 1985, played on many of their recordings, sang a duet with them on their first album and toured with him, off and on, from 1986. "Looking to expand their horizons,"in 1989, they became a founding member of the country group McBride & the Ride; they had early success with four consecutive top-five singles. They have had three stints with McBride & the Ride, 1989–1994, 2000–2002 and when they reconstituted in 2021. The 1994 split was caused by their label, which was looking for mass appeal with a different style, and renamed the band after they left. After the 2002 split, they released a solo album, Livin' the Dream (with musical guests, including Lyle Lovett, Jessi Colter, Jon Randall Stewart, Sonya Isaacs and Clint Black). Herndon called the 2021 iteration "almost Zen-like." In February, 2022, the band had their first Nashville concert in 20 years.
During their Nashville years, they were an active songwriter. Their major successes included co-writing Kenny Chesney's breakout Me and You and their own My Dog Thinks I'm EIlvis, which was used in a television commercial for Radio Shack. Besides Chesney, they have written songs for Aaron Tippin, Lee Greenwood, Linda Davis, Sonya Isaacs and McBride & the Ride.
Return to Arizona
After their time as a Nashville songwriter, they returned to Arizona to help their family run the Handlebar J, where they and theirs bother Ron have done weekly shows. In 2004 they and Jessi Colter hosted a show at the restaurant as a tribute to Waylon Jennings. It was called Outlaw Connection, carried by SIRIUS and introduced by Steven Van Zandt. Other participants included Hank Williams Jr., Shooter Jennings, Tony Furtado, and Tony Joe White. In 2008, they were inducted into the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. In 2015 Herndon returned to the recording studio. Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, to showcase Arizona in a different light, "rounded up a cast of Phoenix-area all-stars" and cut an album called Grant Woods' The Project. Herndon sang What Else Could I Do. After their mother died in 2017 they bought out their brothers and became the sole owner of the restaurant, which has been family owned since 1975. They have remained active in the local Arizona music scene with mentoring young artists and 2022 performances with Matt Rollings and a tribute to Jerry Riopelle. On Herndon's decision to leave Nashville and return to Arizona, Lyle Lovett commented:Someone as immensely talented as Ray Herndon chooses to live where he's from, to run their family's business and uphold their family's legacy. That's where life is for Ray. And I just admire that greatly.

History
The event was formerly known as the Premio Umbria. It was named after Umbria, a region of central Italy.
For a period the Premio Umbria held Group 3 status. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 1982, and relegated back to Group 3 in 1988.
The race was given its present title in 2007. It is now run in memory of Carlo Aloisi (died 1990s) and their brother Francesco (died 2007). Carlo was a former president of UNIRE, a governing body of horse racing in Italy, and Francesco was president of the Jockey Club Italiano.

"Operation Newscaster", as labelled by American firm iSIGHT Partners in 2014, is a cyber espionage covert operation directed at military and political figures using social networking, allegedly done by Iran. The operation has been described as "creative", "long-term" and "unprecedented". According to iSIGHT Partners, it is "the most elaborate cyber espionage campaign using social engineering that has been uncovered to date from any nation".
ISight's perceptions
On 29 May 2014, Texas-based cyber espionage research firm iSIGHT Partners released a report, uncovering an operation it labels "Newscaster" since at-least 2011, has targeted at least 2,000 people in the United States, Israel, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The victims who are not identified in the document due to security reasons, are senior U.S. military and diplomatic personnel, congresspeople, journalists, lobbyists, think tankers and defense contractors, including a four-star admiral.
The firm couldn't determine what data the hackers may have stolen.
According to the iSIGHT Partners report, hackers used 14 "elaborated fake" personas claiming to work in journalism, government, and defense contracting and were active in Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube and Blogger. To establish trust and credibility, the users fabricated a fictitious journalism website, NewsOnAir.org, using content from the media like Associated Press, BBC, Reuters and populated their profiles with fictitious personal content. They then tried to befriend target victims and sent them "friendly messages" with Spear-phishing to steal email passwords and attacks and infecting them to a "not particularly sophisticated" malware for data exfiltration.
The report says NewsOnAir.org was registered in Tehran and likely hosted by an Iranian provider. The Persian word "Parastoo" (; meaning swallow) was used as a password for malware associated with the group, which appeared to work during business hours in Tehran as they took Thursday and Friday off. iSIGHT Partners could not confirm whether the hackers had ties to the Iranian government.
Analysis
According to Al Jazeera, Chinese army's cyber unit carried out scores of similar phishing schemes.
Morgan Marquis-Boire, a researcher at the University of Toronto stated that the campaign "appeared to be the work of the same actors performing malware attacks on Iranian dissidents and journalists for at least two years".
Franz-Stefan Gady, a senior fellow at the EastWest Institute and a founding member of the Worldwide Cybersecurity Initiative, stated that “They're not doing this for a quick buck, to extrapolate data and extort an organization. They're in it for the long haul. Sophisticated human engineering has been the preferred method of state actors”.
Reactions
Facebook spokesperson said the company discovered the hacking group while investigating suspicious friend requests and removed all of the fake profiles.
LinkedIn spokesperson said they are investigating the report, though none of the 14 fake profiles uncovered were currently active.
Twitter declined to comment.
Federal Bureau of Investigation told Al Jazeera "it was aware of the report but that it had no comment".

The Pantanassa Monastery () is a monastery in Mystras, Greece. It was founded by a chief minister of the late Byzantine Despotate of the Morea, John Frankopoulos, and was dedicated in September 1428. It is the only monastery on the site still permanently inhabited. Today it is inhabited by nuns providing hospitality.
Its "beautifully ornate stone-carved façade" is of architectural note.

Life
They were born in Aberdeen on 28 February 1784 the son of Prof George Skene of Rubislaw FRSE MD (1741-1803), Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College and Jane Moir of Stoneywood.
In 1811 they were appointed Counsel for the City of Aberdeen in place of John Burnett Judge Admiral, for all legal matters in Scotland.
In 1823 they were a co-founder of the Bannatyne Club along with their brother-in-law Sir Henry Jardine and Sir Walter Scott.
In 1829 they were elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh their proposer being Alexander Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank.
They were elected Solicitor General for Scotland in 1834, replacing Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.

James Skene was the youngest surviving child of George Skene of Rubislaw (1736-1776), an Aberdeenshire landowner and erstwhile lawyer, and Jean Skene (née Moir of Stoneywood) (1741-1820). They had seven children:
Margaret (born 1767), Helen (1768-1841), Catherine (1769-1838) who married Henry Jardine the, King's Remembrancer, George (1770-1791), and James (1775-1864) who inherited their father's estate at Rubislaw. Two daughters, Jean and Maria, did not survive infancy.
As a widow, Jean Skene moved to Edinburgh c. 1783 with their five remaining children. They lived at various addresses including Riddell's Court in the Old Town and George Street and South Castle Street in the New Town.,
Andrew Skene never married.

Brazil has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film since 1960. The award is handed out annually by the United States-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature length motion picture produced outside the U.S. that contains primarily non-English language dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.
, 51 Brazilian films have been submitted for the award. Four of these submissions resulted in nominations for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, but none of them won. Orfeu Negro, a Portuguese language film shot in Brazil by French director Marcel Camus, won the award at the 1959 ceremony, but it was submitted by the French government and thus France was credited as the only recipient of the award.
Statistics
Films directed by Carlos Diegues (also known as Cacá Diegues) have been chosen to represent Brazil at the Academy Awards six times, more than any other director.  They are followed by Nelson Pereira dos Santos, which had four of their films selected. None of their films, however, managed to achieve an Oscar nomination. Three films by Bruno Barreto were submitted, although their biggest success, Dona Flor and Them Two Husbands, the second highest-grossing film in the history of Brazilian cinema, was not chosen. Four Days in September got nominated in 1998. Suzana Amaral's 1987 film Hour of the Star was the only Brazilian submission by a female director until The Second Mother, directed by Anna Muylaert, was submitted as the Brazilian's entry for the 88th Academy Awards.
Submissions
Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by the Brazilian government for Academy Award consideration. The Brazilian nominee is selected annually by a committee assembled by the Ministry of Culture (formerly the Ministry of Education and Culture).

William Cornelius Reichel (born in Salem, North Carolina, 9 May 1824; died in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 15 October 1876) was a Moravian author in the United States who did much to document and examine the early history of the Moravian church in the United States.
Biography
Reichel was the son of Rev. Benjamin Reichel, of Salem Female Academy. They entered Nazareth Hall in 1834, and in 1839 the Moravian Theological Seminary, where they were graduated in 1844. After serving as tutor for four years at Nazareth Hall, they became a professor in the theological seminary. In 1862 they were appointed to the charge of Linden Hall Seminary, Lititz, Pennsylvania, which they resigned in 1868. From 1868 until 1876, they filled the duties of professor of Latin and natural sciences in the seminary for young ladies at Bethlehem. They were ordained a deacon in June 1862,and a presbyter in May 1864.
Works
Reichel did more than any one else to elucidate the early history of the Moravian church in the United States. In addition to articles in The Moravian and the local press, and a sketch of Northampton County, prepared for William H. Egle's History of Pennsylvania, they wrote:
History of Nazareth Hall (Philadelphia, 1855; enlarged ed., 1869)
History of the Bethlehem Female Seminary, 1785-1858 (1858)

The ecological and biogeographical concept of the species pool describes all species available that could potentially colonize and inhabit a focal habitat area.
The concept lays emphasis on the fact that "local communities aren't closed systems, and that the species occupying any local site typically came from somewhere else", however, the species pool concept may suffer from the logical fallacy of composition. Most local communities, however, have just a fraction of its species pool present. It is derived from MacArthur and Wilson's Island Biogeography Theory that examines the factors that affect the species richness of isolated natural communities. It helps to understand the composition and richness of local communities and how they are influenced by biogeographic and evolutionary processes acting at large spatial and temporal scales. The absent portion of species pool—dark diversity—has been used to understand processes influencing local communities. Methods to estimate potential but absent species are developing.
It has been hypothesized that there might be a direct correlation between species richness and the size of the species pool for plant communities. Elsewhere, it was reported that "trade-offs and species pool structure (size and trait distribution) determines the shape of the plant productivity-diversity relationship.

St. Thomas the Apostle Church is a Catholic parish in Glen Mills, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Its historic church, located at 430 Valleybrook Road, was built in 1856.
It was the first parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the oldest in the state of Pennsylvania.
History
St. Thomas the Apostle Church began as a Catholic mission in Delaware County, Pennsylvania in 1730 in Concord Township at the home of the Thomas Willcox family. In 1837, Saint Mary's Chapel was built as part of the new Willcox mansion. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as part of the Ivy Mills Historic District.
A tract of land was purchased from Nicholas F. Walter for the construction of a church on August 26, 1852. The cost of the new church was carried chiefly by the proprietor of Ivy Mills, James M. Willcox. Construction was completed in 1856 and the cornerstone was dedicated by Bishop St.John Neumann. In 1957, an elementary school and convent were built. In 1991, a larger church was built next to the original St. Thomas' Church.

The Shetland Movement was a pressure group and political party created in 1978 to advocate for greater autonomy in Shetland. The group called for the creation of a Shetland Assembly or 'Althing' with limited legislative powers and control over direct taxation. The Movement's membership included several key public figures in Shetland, including local author, politician and compiler of the Shetland Dictionary, John Graham and Shetland Islands Council Convener from 1986 to 1994, Edward Thomason.
History
The Shetland Movement did not begin as a political party. In the 1982 Shetland Islands Council election the movement promoted candidates supportive of autonomy for Shetland, who won a majority of council seats. In the 1986 council election the Shetland Movement nominated candidates for the first time, winning 13.7% of the vote and five seats. The Shetland Movement decided to contest the 1987 general election for the Orkney and Shetland constituency, running John Goodlad as a joint candidate with Orcadian autonomists under the party label 'Orkney and Shetland Movement.' The Scottish National Party agreed to stand aside in favour of Goodlad, who won 14.5% of the vote.
It took part in the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention that developed a framework for the eventual Scottish devolution in 1999.
In the 1990 council election the Shetland Movement increased its representation to six seats, a level it maintained in 1994. However this marked the high point of the movement's electoral success. After 1994 the group dissolved, never contesting another local or general election.
In 2015 a cross-party movement, Wir Shetland was created to campaign for greater self-government for the islands, comparing itself to the Shetland Movement.

Citizens for Civil Discourse, also known as CCD, is an American non-profit, non-partisan organization that accepts Robocall block requests from citizens via their website. Shaun Dakin, the group's CEO, was a former campaign worker for John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election.
Website
Stop Political Calls is the name of the organization's website to compile a database of the "National Political Do Not Contact Registry". Automated calls for political purposes are not illegal, and the requests in the database have no legal standing. As of late October 2008 after heavy media coverage nationwide, the block requests were voluntarily supported by only three Democrats and three Republicans. Of those six, only three of the politicians were actually on the November 2008 ballot.

Frederick J. Klaeber (born Friedrich J. Klaeber) (1 October 1863 – 4 October 1954) was a German philologist who was Professor of Old and Middle English at the University of Minnesota. Their edition of the poem Beowulf, published as Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, is considered a classic work of Beowulf scholarship; it has been in print continuously since 1922 and is now in its fourth edition.
Biography
Klaeber was born in Beetzendorf, Kingdom of Prussia to Hermann and Luise Klaeber. They received their doctorate from the University of Berlin (Philosophy) in 1892. They were invited to join the University of Minnesota as an Assistant Professor of English Philology. They were Professor of English and Comparative Philology from 1898 to 1931. In 1902 they married Charlotte Wahn.
Klaeber retired from Minnesota in 1931 and returned to Berlin, where they continued to work on what would become the 1936 third edition of Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg. During World War II, their house in Berlin was destroyed, including their books, articles, and notes; they and their wife fled to their house in Bad Kösen, where they continued work on what would be published as the second supplement to the third edition of Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg (1950). During this time, because they no longer had their library and paper was scarce (Bad Kösen was in the Soviet occupation zone), they depended greatly on colleagues and friends in the US. Toward the end of their life, Klaeber was bedridden, impoverished, and partially paralyzed but continued their scholarly work nevertheless. They died in 1954.
Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg
Klaeber was fluent in a number of languages (Greek, Latin, French, Germanic, Old, Middle, and Modern English) and was thus asked by the University of Minnesota to create an English language edition of Beowulf in 1893. Klaeber spent three decades on the project, finally publishing the first edition, Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, in 1922. The Finnesburg Fragment which they included is all that remains of another poem about an event alluded to in Beowulf. The second edition was published in 1928. The third edition was published in 1936; it was republished with a supplement in 1941, and then republished again with a second supplement in 1950. All of Klaeber's editions have included a substantial Introduction, discussing a range of different topics related to the poem, and a comprehensive Commentary section on particular aspects of the text, as well as an extensive glossary.
For many years, Klaeber was considered one of the world's leading Beowulf researchers, and their great work, Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, became enormously important and influential on scholars and students of those poems. As Josephine Bloomfield observes:
Among the editions of Beowulf, Frederick Klaeber's remains the most important. A monumental project begun in 1893, published in 1922, and revised and supplemented up to 1950, it continues to be the central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations.
In 2008, a new version prepared by an editorial team consisting of Robert Dennis Fulk, Robert E. Bjork, and John D. Niles was published as the "fourth edition"; it retains much of Klaeber's third edition design and text, but also substantial alterations intended to update the work by taking into account scholarship on Beowulf published since 1950.

Damir Mikec (; born 31 March 1984) is a Serbian sport shooter.
Biography
Mikec represented Serbia at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China. They earned their qualification by finishing 6th at the 2007 World Cup #1 Rifle, Pistol in Fort Benning, United States of America. In Beijing, Mikec reached the final in 50 metre pistols and finished 7th. In 10 metre air pistol they missed the final by a one-point margin and finished 13th.
Mikec won a silver medal in 50 metre pistols at the 2009 ISSF World Cup in Munich.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics, they came as world's number one at the world rank list, again competed in the 10 metre air pistol and the 50 metre pistol, finishing in 17th and 16th positions respectively.
At the 2020 Summer Olympics, they competed in the 10 metre air pistol finishing second, granting Serbia its first medal at the Games.
Personal life
Mikec is of paternal Slovene descent. Their paternal grandparents hail from Novo Mesto, but due to their grandfather's engagement in the Yugoslav People's Army, their father was born in Bitola. Their father was in the Army as well, and met their mother, a discus thrower, in Senta while located there at the time. Because of their older brothers Igor and Goran's respiratory problems, their family moved to Split–where they were born–due to the benefits of sea air and climate. After the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, their family moved to Herceg Novi. Finally, in 1997, their family moved to Petlovo Brdo, Belgrade, where they finished the last grade of primary school and started secondary school. After the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, they started training shooting at the urging of their mother and Srećko Pejović.
 They are married to Salvadoran sports shooter Melissa Pérez, whom they met in 2005. They married in 2011 in the Ružica Church. Despite plans for another wedding in El Salvador, the Catholic Church there would not agree on a compromise due to Mikec's Eastern Orthodox faith, unlike the Serbian Orthodox Church who did agree on a compromise due to Pérez's Roman Catholic faith. The couple have two children, a son Milan Ricardo (b. 2015) and Mia Vanessa (b. 2020).

The John Spoor Broome Library is located on the campus of California State University, Channel Islands (CSUCI) in Camarillo, California, United States.
The library formally opened on April 4, 2008.
Mission statement
"The John Spoor Broome Library enhances the CI mission of interdisciplinary, international, multicultural, and service learning through active collaboration with students, faculty, and staff to plan, implement, promote, and access the use of collections and services and support student learning via its robust information literacy program."
History
The John Spoor Broome Library is a new building that incorporated some of the original but renovated buildings that were part of the former California State Mental Hospital. The project involved the demolition of the former Administration building and the modification of the Receiving and Treatment center to make room for the new facility.
Architecture
The John Spoor Broome Library was designed by the British architect Norman Foster. The executive architect was Leo A. Daly's Los Angeles architecture firm.
The library is the only "modern"-style building on campus, while the other buildings are of Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. It features a naturally lit "buffer zone", which separates existing and new structures. The surrounding environment is showcased in 360-degree views. It consists of two separate pieces: the physical structure itself and the canopy above, which extends from the plaza over the library and is anchored to the foundation through eight steel posts visible in the Reading Room. The Reading Room features a thermally insulated glass canopy. In the plaza, the canopy is louvered, thus filtering light through the plaza, while not allowing the sun to make direct contact with the book stacks. The stacks are visible from any vantage point. Just outside the main doors is the Reflection Pool. The library serves as a direct axis point through campus, both north & south and east & west.
According to the Channel Islands university website, the John Spoor Broome Library is 137,000 square feet, in three stories, and cost $56 million. There are two main floors in which there are computers, books, tables and classrooms. The third floor is an outdoor study area. The construction required 7,000 cubic yards of concrete, 300 tons of structural steel, 600 tons of rebar and 40,000 square feet of glass. The architect is Gruen Associates, of Los Angeles. The construction firm was PCL, Los Angeles.
Donors
The John Spoor Broome Library was named after the Ventura County philanthropist who donated $5 million to the project.
Broome, a sportsman, pilot, farmer and rancher in Ventura, Kern, and Monterey counties, had made the gift anonymously, solely out of a sense of joy over the opening of a long-delayed four-year institution in Ventura County. Only later did the university president, Handel Evans, convince them to permit the celebration of the gift, and only then because they thought it might help motivate another potential donor, said to have been Broome's friend Martin V. Smith. Smith later donated an identical amount to the business school that now bears their name. The university is on part of the Rancho Guadalasca Spanish land grant that had belonged to Broome's grandfather.
Robert J. Lagomarsino, an Ojai resident and U.S. member of congress from 1974 to 1993, and their wife Norma, donated $1 million for the new library. The donation was to be used to bolster archives and special collections and host an annual lecture.
Archives
The John Spoor Broome Library holds a few archives that are available to its students as well as the general public. Two archives of importance include the Robert J. Lagomarsino Federal Collection and the Camarillo State Hospital Collection.
Robert Lagomarsino Collection
Biography
As noted by archivist Evelyn Taylor at CSUCI, Robert J. Lagomarsino, a Ventura County native, represented the counties of Ventura and Santa Barbara by serving as a California state senator from 1961 to 1974 and as a United States representative from 1974 to 1992. These years coincided with the time in which both Governors Brown and Reagan were active. During their service as a United States Congressman, Lagomarsino was a member of two major House Committees: the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. They were also asked by the House Leader to chair a task force to analyze and develop recommendations to the system of selection of standing committee assignments, the Committee on Committees.
Collection
In this collection, all of Lagomarsino's services to California are documented. The collection not only contains documents on Lagomarsino and early Ventura, but also original furniture, artifacts, signed photographs, and other memorabilia from government officials and celebrities. Additional original archival material includes documents reporting information on the Watergate scandal, the Challenger space shuttle incident, and original signed letters from the Nixon and Bush administrations. As a whole, the collection reflects the conflicts and changes of the time, and also displays Lagomarsino's contributions to Ventura County. This contribution in particular was the introduction of Senate Bill Number 70 which requested a state university for Ventura County (now CSUCI).
The Lagomarsino Collection not only benefits students and scholars interested in politics or history, but also provides valuable primary resource material for such areas of study as agriculture, economics, education, environment, civil rights, crime, family concerns, foreign affairs, health interests, labor law, trade, transportation, and veterans' affairs.
Camarillo State Hospital Collection
History
According to archivist Evelyn Taylor from CSUCI, the State of California purchased the former Lewis Ranch from agriculturists Adolpho Camarillo and Joseph P. Lewis, to build the Camarillo State Hospital in 1929. George McDougall was immediately put in charge of the State's architectural plans. In 1933 the hospital began accepting male patients, who in the beginning, were held in the former Lewis Ranch farmhouse. The hospital was eventually reconstructed under the WPA to accommodate both male and female patients. In 1936, it emerged as the largest mental hospital in the world. Between 1947 and 1957, the hospital rapidly grew, incorporating men, women, and children of all ages, eventually reaching over 7,000 patients at its peak. By 1967, the hospital was treating illnesses such as schizophrenia, manic depression, organic brain disease, autism, and birth defects, and would later successfully address drug and alcohol abuse.
Its early years were rather isolated from the outside world, sustaining the hospital community using its own farms; butcher; shoemaker, dairy; ice house; schools; and hospital, police, and fire departments. In time, various services that promoted social interaction were established, such as a bowling alley, swimming pool, clothing store, petting zoo, beauty parlor, and hamburger shop.
A new law regarding involuntary treatment of mental patients was put into action in 1969. The law required judicial review of every patient who was held against their will for an extended period of time, which in turn, led to the decrease of mental patients at the hospital.
However, in 1983, a new approach was put into action. Discoveries of new drugs that would help the mentally disabled lead normal lives were uncovered and the hospital began to utilize these innovations. A new mission statement emerged as the hospital, now under the Department of Developmental Services of the State of California, addressed both mental and developmentally disabling illnesses: "Enhancing independence through innovation". The hospital now focused on treating patients with the intention of releasing them successfully back into society.
After a long and successful treatment record, the hospital closed its doors to the public on June 30, 1996, due to lack of patients and cost per capita.
Collection
The Camarillo State Hospital collection consists primarily of documents, photographs, and unique artifacts. Many collection items are direct work-product items created during the hospital's tenure, until its closing in 1996. The material is classified by date (1836–2007) and general topic (e.g. treatment). Each of the eleven boxes in the collection includes primary sources such as newspaper articles, correspondence, manuals, memos, proposals, speeches, trailers, and information on movies filmed on the land and books written about the hospital. Old Camarillo State Hospital newspaper articles can be found in the Los Angeles Times Historical Database.
Although the archives in this collection provide first-hand knowledge and useful information about the Camarillo State Hospital, due to California state law no personal records or confidential information is allowed to be released to anyone other than the subject, without authorization. For more information contact the California Department of Developmental Services.

Maude Goodman (1853–1938) was a British painter.
Biography
Maude Goodman was born in Manchester, England, to Jewish parents, in 1853. They were called Matilda at birth. Due to the death of their birth mother, they were later raised and encouraged in their pursuit of art education by their step-mother who was also Jewish.
Goodman studied art in London at the School of Art in South Kensington, now the Royal College of Art. They were a pupil of Edward Poynter and also for a time studied under the tutelage of a Spanish painter who was visiting London, and had been themselves a pupil of Fortuny. The artistic style of Poynter can be seen in Goodman's art, as well as influences and artistic devices from contemporaneous Pre-Raphaelite artists among whom they associated.
Having won a 'Queen's prize' scholastic art award in 1873 and then finishing their schooling, Goodman began to flourish as an artist in 1874. They exhibited their first oil on canvas work at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London. This would be the first of 54 works Goodman exhibited there regularly until 1901. Goodman also exhibited over the course of their career at other exhibitions and galleries including as the Grosvenor Gallery, the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Society of Artists in Birmingham, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. The index in each edition of "The Year's Art" for the span of those years contains more information about each exhibition.
In 1876 William Michael Rossetti, the brother of Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, commented that there was something "above the common in the colour and tone" in Maude's work. Since they signed their paintings "M. Goodman" this may have at one time, early in their career, lent itself to a misunderstanding resulting in them being referred to in the Athenaeum as Mr. M. Goodman. Them art received a favourable review in that context. Afterward however, no doubt becoming aware of the mistake, the Athenaeum did not make much further mention of Miss M. Goodman or their art, in its pages.
Goodman married Arthur Scanes in 1882 but continued to go by their maiden name as a painter.
In April 1892 Walker Hodgson drew Goodman's portrait. It was exhibited in the Christopher Wood Gallery A Fraternity of Artists Exhibition in 1984.
Goodman exhibited their work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.
A photograph of Maude's painting Hush! was included in the supplementary section of the 1905 book Women Painters of the World as well as being depicted in Henry Blackburn's Academy Notes of 1894, the year this painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London.
Goodman illustrated various editions of Raphael Tuck & Sons Children's books and postcards, with two of these containing poetry contributed by their husband, Arthur Scanes.
Victorian periodicals often featured Goodman's life story and printed art, for example The Girl's Realm of 1902 reported on an interview that Henriette Corkran held with Maude. This was conducted at their house at 7 Addison Crescent in West Kensington. It was from this house that they had been working as an artist since 1894 and carried on living and working there until their death in 1938.
The Illustrated London News provided colour prints of Goodman's art as supplements in 1904, and Weldon's Ladies magazines produced many black and white prints of Maude's art, as supplements to their magazines well into the 1910s. However, Victorian art in general went out of fashion after the turn of the century and with the rise of Art Nouveau there saw a decline in the interest in art such as Maude Goodman's.
W.L. George in The Intelligence of Women (1916) suggests that in the defense of the talent of female artists, some may "shyly whisper" the name of Maude Goodman, though they were "not carried away with the splendours of Taller than Mother," one of their paintings exhibited in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1892. A photograph of this painting was included in the Illustrated Royal Academy Catalog and also in Henry Blackburn's Academy Notes for 1892.
Goodman is mentioned by Dorothy L. Sayers in The Wimsey Papers VI as an overly cloying painter of idealized children in Arcadian settings; the writer reported that the boys in their nursery of the 1890s took a gift Goodman out of its frame and used it as a pea-shooting target.
E.M. Forster in Howards End expresses an "amused superiority at [the] bad taste" of the aspiring working-class character Leonard Bast, whose apartment includes a print of "one of the masterpieces of Maud [sic] Goodman." Dr. Aziz in A Passage to India "shares Leonard's taste in paintings: 'Aziz in an occidental moment would have hung Maud [sic] Goodmans on the walls.'"

Daniel Byron "Danny" Verdin III (born May 9, 1964) is a member of the South Carolina Senate, representing District 9 (Greenville and Laurens Counties). In November 2008, they were chosen as majority whip.
Early life and career
Verdin is the son of Dr. Daniel B. and Eloise Watts Verdin. They were born in Louisiana but raised in Greenville County, where their father was a veterinarian. In 1986, Verdin graduated with a bachelor's in history from Bob Jones University. In 1987, Verdin married Kimberlee Owens; they have four children. They served as Agriculture and Natural Resources Advisor to Governor Carroll Campbell, 1987–89. Verdin is the owner of Verdin's Farm & Garden Center in Laurens, South Carolina. Verdin is a member of Faith Free Presbyterian Church in Greenville, and they have served as South Carolina Division Commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, 1998–2000.
Political career
In 2000, Verdin ran for the District 9 South Carolina Senate seat as a conservative Republican and defeated a 16-year Democratic incumbent, Jim Bryan, in an upset election, winning 54% of the vote. Verdin's election shifted the balance of power in the South Carolina Senate by creating a 23–23 tie between Republicans and Democrats. Anticipating that the Senate rules would be re-written to favor Republicans and that Republican Senate President (and Lieutenant Governor) Bob Peeler would break the tie in the Republicans' favor, long-time Democratic Senator Jefferson Verne Smith (Greenville) switched their party affiliation to Republican in order to retain their powerful committee chairpersonship.) This switch resulted in the end of more than a century of Democratic control of the South Carolina Senate.
Verdin serves as the Chairman of the Senate Medical Affairs Committee.
In 2004, Verdin was challenged by former Senator Jim Bryan winning 60% of the vote. They were unopposed for reelection in 2008.
In 2006, the South Carolina Farm Bureau named Verdin Legislator of the Year; and in 2007, Verdin was named Legislator of the Year by the South Carolina Veterinarians Association. In 2004, Verdin was rated A+ by the NRA Political Victory Fund. In announcing Verdin's selection as majority whip in 2008, Majority Leader Harvey Peeler said that in the current political environment, the Republican caucus needed "to return to core conservative values".
Following the Charleston church shooting of 2015, Verdin said they would not vote to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state house.

North Lee is a hamlet in the parish of Ellesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the very north of the parish, near the main road that links Aylesbury with Wendover.
The hamlet name is a compound of English and Anglo Saxon languages, and refers to the northernmost clearing. The name refers to the adjacent hamlet of Nash Lee.
Today North Lee has survived more or less unscathed from the construction of the Wendover Bypass, though the road that leads to North Lee is now a dead end rather than a through road to Wendover.

Konstantin Yakovlevich Vanshenkin (; 17 December 1925 – 15 December 2012; born Konstantin Weinschenker) was a Soviet poet and lyricist from Moscow.
During the Second World War Vanshenkin served in the Soviet Army at the Airborne Forces of the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 3rd Ukrainian Front. They were enlisted in 1942 and discharged at 1946. Song about the Guards, their first collection of poetry, was published in 1951. Their best known songs are "Alyosha" (1966), inspired by a military memorial in Plovdiv, and "Ya lyublyu tebya zhizn" (1956), a signature song of Mark Bernes. A collection of their songs with music was published in 1965.
Vanshenkin was a recipient of prestigious state awards, including the USSR State Prize (1985) and the State Prize of the Russian Federation (2001).
Their wife (1928–1991) was a notable lyricist in their own right. The spouses are buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery.

In enzymology, an isocitrate epimerase is classified as follows: . This number indicates that it is an isomerase, specifically a racemase or epimerase that acts on hydroxy acids and their derivatives, namely isocitrate. Isocitrate epimerase specifically catalyzes the reversible reaction:
(1R,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate ↔ (1S,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate
which can also be described as
D-threo-isocitrate ↔ D-erythro-isocitrate
History
Isocitrate epimerase was originally isolated from the fungal cell-free extract of Penicillium purpurogenum , where it was discovered due to the excess accumulation of L-alloisocitric acid (D-erythro-isocitrate)—a diastereomer of isocitrate previously not seen in nature. In order to accumulate L-alloisocitric acid as a fermentation product, P. purpurogenum needed to be grown on citrate supplemented nutrient agar. During this fermentation it was found that the fermentation yield of L-alloisocitric acid was capable of “exceeding 70% without producing any other stereoisomers of isocitiric acid or other metabolites”.
This enzyme has not been heavily studied since first being identified in 1982, as a result of this there is presently not a crystal structure or active site description for isocitrate epimerase. Other isocitrate enzymes, such as isocitrate lyase and isocitrate dehydrogenase have been studied more closely due to their key roles in glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

Antoine-Éléonor-Léon Leclerc de Juigné (2 November 1728, Paris – 19 March 1811, Paris) was a French prelate and politician of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
While Archbishop of Paris, they were elected deputy of the clergy to the Estates General of 1789.
Early life
They were the son of Samuel-Jacques Le Clerc de Juigné and Marie Gabrielle Le Cirier de Neufchelles (1706–1763), and younger brother of the Marquis de Juigne. Leclerc de Juigné was descended from an old Maine family. They were barely six years old when they lost their father, Colonel of the Regiment of Orléans, killed in 1734, at the Battle of Guastalla.
The young Leclerc studied the Humanities and Philosophy at the College of Navarre, and entered the seminary of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet, from there they joined the Society of the Theologians of Navarre, where they made their licentiate and acquired their degrees.
Armand Bazin de Bezons, Bishop of Carcassonne, who was their relative, appointed them as their vicar-general.
Leclerc de Juigne soon had another career; they were appointed general agent of the clergy in 1760. The agency was attached to the care of all ecclesiastical interests and affairs. This management lasted five years but ceased if, during their course, the agent was appointed to a bishopric. It was not long after their appointment when, on 16 November 1763, the Diocese of Comminges was proposed to them to replace Antoine de Lastic, who had been transferred to the Diocese of Châlons. They declined, preferring to continue their honorable work.
Bishop of Châlons
Owing to the sudden death of Antoine de Lastic, they were appointed Bishop of Châlons.
On arrival, they found difficulties occasioned by the ascendancy which Jansenism had taken under their predecessor, "he thought themselves obliged to forbid and even to expel" some difficult priests. After reconstructing the major seminary, they established a lesser seminary to accommodate children of the countryside who aspired to study for the priesthood.
They knew all the ecclesiastics of their diocese, received them with benevolence, was always ready to listen to them, and to enter with them in the minutest details on what concerned the good of the parishes, the salvation of souls, and the relief to be carried where it was needed. Their alms immortalized them in the diocese of Chalons, and their memory will long be blessed. – Michaud, Ancient and Modern World Biography, 1843, 2nd Edition
In 1776, in the middle of the night, a town distant from Châlons of twelve or fourteen leagues broke out in flames. Leclerc rushed towards the blaze and found Saint-Dizier heavily burned. In hopes of saving some of the victims, they charged into the flames with little precaution and was thought to have suffocated. Upon news reaching Châlons, consternation persisted until their return. These accidents, much too frequent in Champagne, moved the charitable prelate to establish at Châlons an office of relief, one of the first assurances against fires.
Persuaded that a considerable increase of revenue was not in the spirit of the canons, a motive for changing their post, they refused the Archdiocese of Auch.
Archbishop of Paris
The death of the Archbishop of Paris left this seat vacant. The Bishop of Autun, who was then in possession of the "profit sheet," wished to nominate the Archbishop of Toulouse, Lomenie de Brienne, but Louis XVI objected, "The Archbishop of Paris should at least believe in God", and on 22 December 1781 appointed Leclerc de Juigné, despite the objections of other competitors. Holding true to their belief in modesty, the Bishop yielded only to the encouragement and repeated orders of the King, who saw in their choice the interest of religion.
De Juigne carried in their new diocese the same spirit, the same principles according to which they had governed that of Châlons, "the same prudence, the same moderation, the same gentleness, the same attention to maintain the peace, to try to maintain it between the priesthood and the magistracy; even zeal for ecclesiastical discipline and sound doctrine; even munificence towards the poor, their immense income was employed in alms, in good works, in pious institutions."
They spent most of the income of their new diocese on charity. Considerable as this income was, it could not meet the needs of the harsh winter of 1788–89. The prelate made up for this by selling their dishes, by committing their patrimony, and by taking large loans, for the guarantee of which the Marquis de Juigné, their elder brother, was forced to pay the sum of a hundred-thousand crowns.
Their zeal for all that tended to the progress of the ecclesiastical sciences had made them conceive a plan for a school to train priests. This plan had begun execution at Calvaire, under the direction of the Bishop of Senez, Jean Baptiste de Beauvais. The Revolution of 1789 prevented its completion.
In the Parlement of Paris they voted, on 9 January 1788, for the edict which restored to Protestants their civil status.
French Revolution
On 30 April 1789, the clergy of Paris elected them deputy to the Estates General. Their two brothers were also called there.
The Archbishop of Paris sat, "in these stormy assemblies, with the minority faithful to God and to the King." They opposed the meeting of the three orders, and on June 19 proposed:
to verify the powers of the clergy chamber and its constitution in an active chamber;
to persevere in the pure and simple adhesion of the conciliatory plan proposed by the commissioners of the King;
to communicate the present deliberation to the orders of the Third Estate and the nobility;
to send a deputation to the King to implore them to occupy himself, in their wisdom, with the means of establishing a correspondence between the three orders of the Estates General.
Resulting at 135 votes approving this proposal, 127 voted in opposition, and 12 more joined with reservations. The motion, defeated by four votes of majority, made Archbishop Juigné very unpopular. On 24 June, as they were leaving the Assembly at Versailles, their carriage was attacked by the very people who a few months prior they had snatched from the horrors of hunger. On the 27th they agreed to meet with the Third Estate, and their accession was hailed by the general acclamations of the assembly.
At the end of the night of August 4, they proposed to sing a "Te Deum" of rejoicing, and on the 11th, they renounced the ecclesiastical tithes:
In the name of my confreres, in the name of my co-operators, and of all the clergy who belong to this august Assembly, we are giving ecclesiastical tithes to the hands of a just and generous nation. May the Gospel be proclaimed, may divine worship be celebrated with decency and dignity, may the churches be provided with virtuous and zealous priests; that the poor of the people are helped, this is the destination of our tithes, that is the end of our ministry and our vows. We entrust ourselves to the National Assembly, and we have no doubt that it will afford us the means to honor worthily and equally sacred objects.
On 20 September, they offered the silverware of the churches, and on 14 April 1790, sent to the assembly their civic oath.
Emigration
Then, alarmed by the course of events, and no longer doubting that all was lost, they obtained permission from the King to leave France.
They first sought asylum in Chambéry, Savoy.
From Savoy, they published an order against the election of Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel as constitutional Archbishop of Paris, and was denounced by the departmental directory of Paris on 31 March 1791. They were further reproached for continuing to appoint canons to the new canonicas, despite having emigrated.
De Juigné then passed to Konstanz, where they were joined by several bishops and a great many "faithful" priests obliged to leave France. They helped them first with their purse, the sale of the few precious effects which remained to him, even of their chapel, then of the gifts which they had received from Catherine II of Russia and of princes and great prelates of Germany. They even found means of establishing a seminary in Konstanz, where young clerics were formed to replace the priests decimated by the revolutionary fury.
From Schaffhausen, they were accused by the National Convention on 15 March 1795 of directing Austrian espionage against France.
The success of the French armies obliged them in 1799 to leave this residence and accept asylum in Augsburg, offered to them by Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, Elector of Trier.
Return to France
They returned to Paris in 1802, after the promulgation of the Concordat, and without difficulty resigned, at the hands of Pope Pius VII who asked for it, their archdiocese on 31 January 1802.
Juigné then lived in retirement among their family, beloved by their old diocesans, limiting their pleasures to solitary walks, where they were astonished to be welcomed by a crowd of silent homages addressed much to their dignity, on which they bore no discernable mark. They visited with an inimitable simplicity their successor at Paris, Jean-Baptiste de Belloy, in the palace formerly their own, where both exercised respect and maintained the best relations.
On 21 March 1808, Napoleon named them canon of the Imperial chapter of Saint-Denis, and created them Count of the Empire on 7 June 1808.
They died in Paris on 19 March 1811, in their 83rd year, and was buried in a common grave. In the service which the metropolitan chapter gave him, Abbot Jallabert, vicar-general, pronounced their funeral oration. On the king's return, the chapter, with permission, had the body of De Juigné exhumed and transported to the vault of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.
"His principles were pure, their zeal equally removed from slackening and exaggeration, their mind unceasingly occupied with that which could serve the Church." They joined in the happiest memory the love of serious studies, and had a taste for good literature. They were fluent in Greek, the Bible was their favorite reading, they knew it by heart, and any passage quoted to him, they indicated at once the book, chapter, and verse.
A monument was erected to them and their brother, the Marquis de Juigné, in the Cathedral of Paris.

Joanne Lipman (born June 18, 1961) is an American journalist and author who has served as chief editor at USA Today, the USA Today Network, Conde Nast, and The Wall Street Journal's Weekend Journal.  They are the author of That's What They Said: What Men Need to Know (and Women Need to Tell Them) About Working Together (William Morrow, January 30, 2018).  They are also the inaugural Peretsman Scully Distinguished Journalism Fellow at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study and a CNBC on-air contributor. Until December 31, 2017, they were Chief Content Officer of publishing company Gannett, and editor-in-chief of USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network, comprising the flagship title plus 109 local media organizations, including the Detroit Free Press, The Des Moines Register and The Arizona Republic. The CCO role, a new position, was created to unite Gannett's media properties into the nationwide USA TODAY Network, encompassing the company's 3,000 journalists. "That's What They Said," published by William Morrow, grew out of their viral Wall Street Journal article, "Women at Work: A Guide for Men."  They are co-author, with Melanie Kupchynsky, of Strings Attached: One Tough Teacher and the Gift of Great Expectations, published by Hyperion in the U.S., with international editions in Europe and Asia. They were the founding editor-in-chief of Conde Nast Portfolio magazine and Portfolio.com website from 2005 to 2009. Previously they were a deputy managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, the first woman to hold that position.  They are a frequent television commentator on business issues, appearing on CNN, CNBC, CBS and other news outlets. They have also contributed to The New York Times.
Biography and career
Lipman was raised in East Brunswick, New Jersey, the daughter of Diane H. and Burton E. Lipman. Them mother was a programmer analyst and their father was an author of business books and CEO of a cardiac pacemaker component manufacturing company. They graduated from East Brunswick High School and summa cum laude from Yale University with a B.A. degree in history. While a student at Yale, they worked as an intern for The Wall Street Journal, which they joined as a staff reporter upon graduating in 1983. In 1984 they reported that Alastair Reid, a staff writer for The New Yorker, had created composite characters and otherwise altered facts in their reporting. After covering the insurance and real estate beats, they created and wrote the Journal's daily Advertising column from 1989 through 1992. They served as a Page One editor of the Journal from 1992 through 1996.
In 1998, they created the Journal's popular Friday section, Weekend Journal. They served as its editor-in-chief through 2000, when they were named a Deputy Managing Editor of the newspaper, the first woman to hold that post. In 2002, they oversaw the creation of a new fourth section, Personal Journal. The New York Times described their role as the Journal's "innovator in chief."
In 2005, Lipman moved to Conde Nast to create Conde Nast Portfolio and Portfolio.com, a business magazine and website that launched in April 2007. The magazine was widely praised for its coverage leading up to and about the 2008 financial crisis, including its 2008 cover story by Michael Lewis that was the basis for their bestselling book, and subsequent film, The Big Short. However, following the financial crisis, Portfolio's parent company Conde Nast suffered from declining ad revenue as advertisers pulled back on their spending, forcing it to shutter a number of its magazines, including Conde Nast Portfolio, which closed in May 2009 after 21 issues. The website, Portfolio.com, is now being run by a Conde Nast sister company, American City Business Journals.
Lipman serves on the Yale University Council, the Yale Daily News board of directors, and the Breastcancer.org advisory board.  They are a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. They have served as a judge for the Pulitzer Prize and National Magazine Awards, among others.
"That's What They Said"
Lipman's bestselling book, That's What They Said: What Men Need to Know (And Women Need to Tell Them) About Working Together, was published by William Morrow in 2018. The book contends that men must be mobilized to help close the gender gap at work, and offers strategies and solutions to help achieve workplace parity. Through a combination of reporting, data and storytelling, Lipman illuminates case studies spanning Silicon Valley, the Enron scandal, Harvard Business School's attempt to wipe out bias, and Iceland's response to the 2008 financial crisis.
The New York Times, in its review, called That's What They Said "eerily prescient in light of our current conversation about sexual politics in the workplace...revelatory" and named it an Editor's Choice. The book was named to the bestseller list of the Washington Post, which in its review said Lipman "makes a powerful case for men to join with women to solve the persistent inequities on the job" and "offers dozens of examples of bold leaders taking a stand and engaging women to push forward a transformation. But they also pile on the evidence of a sustained gender gap so that inequities cannot simply be mansplained away."
That's What They Said was also the inaugural selection of the World Economic Forum for their WEF Book Club.
Additional coverage of the book included Time, USA Today, Fortune, Forbes, Vanity Fair, Glamour, the New York Post and the London Sunday Times (a "must-read"). Lipman's television appearances for the book included CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and PBS, among others.
In the UK, the book is published by Hodder and Stoughton under the title Win Win: When Business Works for Women, It Works for Everyone. It was named the best book of the month by the Financial Times.
Awards and honors
Under Lipman's leadership, the USA TODAY Network was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes, including the first Pulitzer in USA TODAY's history, and had an additional three finalists.
In 2018, Pulitzer Prizes were awarded to the USA TODAY Network in three categories. In Explanatory Reporting, "The Wall," a multimedia project by the staffs of the Arizona Republic and the USA TODAY Network, won for examining the "difficulties and unintended consequences of fulfilling President Donald Trump's pledge to construct a wall along the US border with Mexico." In Local Reporting, the Cincinnati Enquirer's "Seven Days of Heroin" series won for detailing how the drug has ravaged the community. In Editorial Writing, Andie Dominick of the Des Moines Register won for their writing on "the damaging consequences for poor Iowa residents of privatizing the state's administration of Medicaid."
Pulitzer finalists in 2018 were in the National Reporting category, for Brett Murphy of the USA TODAY Network for "Rigged," an investigation into abused truckers; and Editorial Cartooning, recognizing Mike Thompson of the Detroit Free Press.
In 2017, the USA TODAY Network, in its first full year as a network, was also recognized as a Pulitzer Prize finalist for Investigative Reporting – the first time USA TODAY was a finalist in that category.
In 2008, Portfolio was awarded a National Magazine Award, with the magazine's "Brief" section cited for being "Consistently smart, contrarian, and well-reported....an original take on ambition, invention, ego, drama, and conflict. The surprisingly fresh and clean design complements and furthers and section's distinctive voice as it charts the impact of business on society, culture, and politics."
While on the Journal's Page One, Lipman edited a series that earned the paper the 1995 Pulitzer Prize in feature writing. In 2005, the Journal won two Pulitzer Prizes for coverage that appeared in Weekend Journal and Personal Journal.
Lipman received the John Hancock award in 1993 for Excellence for their daily Advertising column. In 2001, they received the Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications for achievement in the newspaper category.
Personal
In 1987, Lipman married entertainment lawyer Thomas Distler in a Jewish ceremony at the National Arts Club in Manhattan; they have two children.

28 Weeks Later' is a 2007 post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who co-wrote it with Rowan Joffé, Enrique López Lavigne and Jesus Olmo. The sequel to the 2002 film 28 Days Later, it stars Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton, Imogen Poots and Idris Elba. It is set after the events of the first film, depicting the efforts of NATO military forces to salvage a safe zone in London, the consequence of two young siblings breaking protocol to find their infected mother, and the resulting reintroduction of the Rage Virus to the safe zone.28 Weeks Later was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2007, by 20th Century Fox and by Fox Atomic in the United States. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction and atmosphere. It grossed $64 million worldwide against a $15 million budget.
Plot
During the original outbreak of the Rage Virus, Don, their wife Alice and four more survivors hide in a barricaded cottage on the outskirts of London. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door and Alice lets them in. A few minutes later, they discover that the infected have followed the boy. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors, while Don, Alice and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice to leave the boy but they refuse. They abandon them as the infected break into their room by escaping out of the window. After watching their wife being dragged out of sight by the infected, they narrowly escape on a boat piloted by Jacob, one of the remaining survivors, who falls in the water and is overcome by the infected.
After the infected beginning to die of starvation, NATO forces take control of Britain. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American force, under the command of Brigadier General Stone, brings in settlers. Among the new arrivals are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy, who were out of the country during the outbreak. They are admitted to District One, a safe zone on the Isle of Dogs, guarded by the US Army. Sergeant Doyle, a Delta Force sniper and their friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter pilot, are amongst the troops guarding the district. Tammy and Andy are reunited with their father, who was found by the US Army and has become the district's caretaker. In their new flat, Don fabricates a lie about the circumstances surrounding their mother's death.
That night, Andy dreams about forgetting their mother's face, so Tammy and Andy sneak out of the safe zone and return to their former home, where they collect family photographs and other mementos. To their shock, Andy finds Alice alive and seemingly uninfected in a semi-conscious, delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where they are tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the rage virus. Don makes an unauthorized visit to Alice in their isolation cell, begging them to forgive him. They accept their apology and tells them they love him, prompting them to kiss her, unaware they are an infected. Don transforms, brutally beats them to death, and goes on a rampage.
General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and orders a Code Red alert in District One. Civilians are herded into safe rooms while the soldiers search for infected but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room full of people and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The crowd, with half its members infected, breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a US Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring themselves to comply with the order, abandons their post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. Stone orders District One to be firebombed but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. After escaping with a survivor named Sam, the only survivor of a sniper attack that killed most of the group, Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure because of their genetic make up and must be protected.
Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle but refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who might be infected. However, a desperate Sam attempts to leap onto the helicopter, and is infected and falls, which forces Flynn to abandon the four. Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells them to leave the civilians and head to Wembley Stadium. Doyle ignores their instructions and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape nerve gas released to kill the infected but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices themselves by push starting the car and is burned alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the London Underground, where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy.
Tammy shoots Don before they can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the English Channel to France, as instructed by Doyle. Twenty-eight days later, a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen running through a tunnel that, as they emerge into the open, is revealed to be the exit of the Paris Métro Trocadéro Station with a view across the Seine to the nearby Eiffel Tower, indicating that the virus has spread to Continental Europe.
Cast
Production
Development and writing
The international success of the 2002 horror film 28 Days Later influenced its creators—director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter Alex Garland—to make a sequel four years following its release. Macdonald stated, "We were quite taken aback by the phenomenal success of the first film, particularly in America. We saw an opportunity to make a second film that already had a built-in audience. We thought it would be a great idea to try and satisfy that audience again."
In March 2005, however, Boyle revealed they would not be directing due to commitments to Sunshine (2007), but said they would stay on as executive producer. They also teased that its plot would revolve around the aftermath of the first film, and would involve the US Army "declaring the war against infection had been won, and that the reconstruction of the country could begin". Boyle later hired Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, believing they would be able to "bring a fresh new perspective" to the film. Another reason they picked Fresnadillo was because they were a "huge fan" of their 2001 film Intacto. Before Fresnadillo took over, they were on a five-year hiatus from filmmaking, working on TV commercials.
Fresnadillo felt the plot involving a family in Rowan Joffé's original script was underdeveloped, so they decided to rewrite it with collaborators Enrique López-Lavigne and Jesús Olmo. Although both Fresnadillo and López-Lavigne were unimpressed with the initial draft, they found its concept of the family "trying to start over after the first outbreak" a redeemable aspect, deciding to retain it in the rewritten version. Rewriting took almost a year, with Garland making additional input on the script.
Casting
Boyle said in March 2005 that the sequel would feature a new cast, since previous cast members Cillian Murphy, Megan Burns, and Naomie Harris were occupied with their own projects. In September 2006, Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Catherine McCormack, Harold Perrineau, Imogen Poots, Idris Elba, Mackintosh Muggleton and Jeremy Renner were announced as the cast for the sequel.
All the extras who played the infected were required to have a movement-based artistic background, including such occupations as ballet, dance, gymnastics, circus performing, and miming.
Filming
On 1 September 2006, principal photography for 28 Weeks Later began in London, with much of the filming taking place at Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs, the safe zone in the film's plot.
The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.
Promotion
Graphic novel
In July 2006, Fox Atomic Comics and publisher HarperCollins announced the publication, in early 2007, of 28 Days Later: The Aftermath, a graphic novel bridging the gap between 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later. Motion comics of two segments of the graphic novel were added to the DVD & Blu-ray release of 28 Weeks Later.
Websites
Removable chalk-powder graffiti was sprayed in locations around London and Birmingham featuring the web address www.ragevirus.com. However, the web address was found to be unregistered and was quickly snapped up. The advertising agency who made the mistake agreed to purchase the rights to the domain name for an undisclosed sum.
In April 2007, the horror/science-fiction film website Bloody Disgusting promoted 28 Weeks Later by giving readers a chance to win a prop from the film. The props were included in a "District 1 Welcome Pack", which featured an ID card and an edition of the London Evening Standard newspaper with a headline proclaiming the evacuation. The giveaway was only open to residents of North America, and entries closed on 9 May 2007.
Biohazard warning
On 13 April 2007, 28 days before the release of the film in UK cinemas, a huge biohazard warning sign was projected against the White Cliffs of Dover. The sign contained the international biological hazard symbol, along with the admonition that the UK was "contaminated, keep out!"
Flash game
In May 2007, 20th Century Fox posted a free 28 Weeks Later-themed flash game on their international website, foxinternational.com. In the game, the player can play one of the infected in three parts of the city.
Release28 Weeks Later was released on 11 May 2007, in the United Kingdom by 20th Century Fox and in the United States by Fox Atomic.

1.3 million DVD units have been sold in the United States, gathering a revenue of $24.3 million, as of July 2010. The film has been released as its own DVD and as a double feature with 28 Days Later.
Critical reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has generated a rating of based on reviews and an average rating of . The website's critical consensus states, "While 28 Weeks Later lacks the humanism that made 28 Days Later a classic, it's made up with fantastic atmosphere and punchy direction." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average of 78/100 based on 34 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".View London called the film an "exciting, action-packed and superbly directed thriller that more than lives up to the original film". The New York Timess A. O. Scott remarked that it is "brutal and almost exhaustingly terrifying, as any respectable zombie movie should be. It is also bracingly smart, both in its ideas and in its techniques".
Derek Elley for Variety called it "a full-bore zombie romp that more than delivers the genre goods".
Soundtrack
The soundtrack was composed, written and performed by John Murphy. The score was released exclusively to iTunes on 12 June 2007. On 2 June 2009, a limited edition soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records. Only 1500 copies were made.
Possible sequel
Fox Atomic stated in June 2007 that they would consider producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well. In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle said they had a possible story for the next film: "There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've got to think about it, whether it's right or not." In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, they declared: "I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between a group of people who are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware."
In January 2011, Danny Boyle said, "There is a good idea for it, and once I've got [my stage production of] Frankenstein open, I'll begin to think about it a bit more." On 13 April 2013, Boyle stated: "[I]t's 40/60 whether [a sequel] happens or not. But we did have an idea of where to set it and what it might be about." When asked to share that idea, Boyle laughed and said, "No, because they'll end up in The Walking Dead''."
On 14 January 2015, Garland stated:
In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that they and Garland had recently met to discuss and begin preparation on a third film.
In March 2020 and May 2021 respectively, both Imogen Poots and Cillian Murphy stated they would be interested in reprising their roles.

"Do I" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Luke Bryan. It was released in May 2009 as the lead-off single from their album Doin' My Thing. Bryan co-wrote the song with Dave Haywood and Charles Kelley of the group Lady Antebellum, whose co-lead singer Hillary Scott is featured on background vocals. "Do I" is about a couple questioning the status of their relationship.
The song received mixed reviews from critics wary of Bryan's delivery in the lyrics. "Do I" peaked at number 2 on both the Billboard Country Airplay and Hot Country Songs charts respectively, both times behind Lady A's own song "Need You Now". It also gave Bryan their first top 40 hit on the Hot 100 chart, charting at number 34. The song was certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold 1,633,000 copies in that country as of November 2015. The song also charted in Canada, peaking at number 66 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Shaun Silva, is set in a high rise condominium where Bryan contemplates their relationship with their girlfriend.
Content
Bryan told CMT that, "the song is about a couple that doesn't know if their worlds are right with each other, or they don't know how their relationship's going down hill".
The song is in the key of A major, with Bryan's vocals ranging from C♯4 to F♯5.
Critical reception
Stephen M. Deusner of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-down. Although they described the lyrics favorably by saying that "the scenario is all the more affecting for its mundanity" and "'Do I' implies no hint of a happily ever after, and that ambiguity gives the lyrics extra impact", Deusner criticized Bryan's vocal performance, saying "it never quite conveys much desperation or despair. There's no worry in their voice, nor does it sound like he's trying to keep a stoic front." Chris Neal of Country Weekly described the song favorably in their review of the album, saying that it "shows a knack for convincingly delivering hymns to thwarted love."
Commercial performance
"Do I" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart at number 53 for the chart week of May 9, 2009. In November 2009, the song became their first top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song has sold 1,755,000 copies in the U.S. as of March 2019.
Music video
The music video was directed by Shaun Silva and was filmed in a high rise condominium in downtown Nashville. It features Luke Bryan dealing with the relationship with their girlfriend. It premiered on Amazon.com on June 29, 2009.

College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) is an organization that focuses on professional development and support for sports information directors at all levels. It offers awards, scholarships, and grants in support of SIDs and prospective SIDs in the industry. Since 1952, CoSIDA has bestowed Academic All-American recognition on male and female athletes in Divisions I, II, and III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)—covering all NCAA championship sports—and NAIA athletes.
History
CoSIDA began as a part of the American College Public Relations Association (ACPRA). It split and was established as a separate organization for sports information directors in 1957. CoSIDA holds an annual conference based around professional development. The first conference was held in Chicago in 1957, where there were 102 attendees. As of 2019 there are over 3,100 members in the United States and Canada.
In 2008, CoSIDA launched a strategic plan to change the image and focus of the organization. Part of the plan was to modify the traditional "Sports Information Director" job title to "Strategic Communicator". Along with this, CoSIDA changed its logo and began to work with the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA). Another key point was to have members get better at effective communication strategy, specifically strategic communication. This change is in response to changes in media technology, namely social media.
CoSIDA's Research on Social Media
A 2012 study, conducted by G. Clayton Stoldt of Wichita State University, surveyed 529 CoSIDA members on how social media had impacted their institutions. Some key results are:
92% said that social media changed how their institution communicates
89% said social media changed how they handle external communications
81% agreed that social media has in some way enhanced public relations practices
92% said that social media impacts mainstream media
92% also said social media has forced organizations to respond more quickly to crises
69% said that social media is less accurate than traditional media, 72% said social media is less credible than traditional media
75% said that social media impacts organizations' transparency
Only 6% knew of any time their institution managed social media based on legality
A separate study in 2016, conducted by CoSIDA and researched by Katelyn Miller of Rutgers University, found that just 33% of institutions had implemented a social media policy and 50% of SIDs had, on at least one occasion, deleted a social media post from a coach or student-athlete.
Academic All-American Selections
Since 1952, CoSIDA has selected Academic All-Americans for NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA. In 2018-19, two-year schools and Canadian institutions were made eligible for at-large All-American selections. Google Cloud is the title sponsor for the All-American selections. Previous title sponsors include GTE, Verizon, ESPN The Magazine, and Capital One.
CoSIDA is responsible for the annual selection of 816 Academic All-Americans in men's soccer, football, basketball, baseball and track and field/cross-country and women's soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball, and track and field/cross-country. The sports that CoSIDA recognizes as eligible for at-large Academic All-American recognition are:

Zicman Feider (1903–1979) was a Jewish Romanian acarologist, a remarkable researcher and a gifted academic, whose work continues to influence by many generations of biologists, some of whom studied zoology under their supervision. Their name as a researcher is forever associated with the enigmatic group of Acari a.k.a. Acarina (a taxon of arachnids that contains mites and ticks), for which they arduously worked to perfect their taxonomy. Alone or in collaboration with their numerous disciples, they described and created 1 phalanx and 2 sub-phalanxes, 16 families and 8 subfamilies, 40 genera, 4 subgenera, and 145 species new to science.
One could only compare professor Feider's work with that of Aristide Caradgea, who studied micro-Lepidoptera, attracting all the world researchers of that group to come in a pilgrimage to their modest place in Grumazesti, Neamț, Romania. Similarly, Feider's strenuous line of work encompassed Acari collections from all over Europe, St. Helen Island, North Korea, Nepal, Mongolia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Venezuela, and Chile, making their lab in the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University (Romanian: Universitatea „Alexandru Ioan Cuza"; acronym: UAIC), of Iași, Romania, a Mecca of the world's acarologists.
Early life
Feider was born on April 17, 1903, in Roman, in the province of Moldova, Romania, the eldest of seven children of Beila and Daniel (Idel) Feider, of Ashkenazy Jewish ethnicity. Beila and Daniel Feider were owners of a small rotary-shop (wagons were then in great demand), and as the Jewish tradition still demands, they saved most of their income to offer their son the best opportunity to study to become a "doctor". Their hopes were sustained by the excellent performance of their young studious son Zicman, who graduated the gymnasium and the prestigious Lyceum "Roman Vodă", with the best possible grades.
Higher education
In 1922, after receiving their baccalaureate, they enrolled in the University of Pavia, Italy, as a foreign student. From 1923 to 1925, Feider attended Histology and Pathology classes of the famous professor Camillo Golgi, the scientist-physician who discovered the Golgi apparatus, the Golgi tendon organ and the Golgi tendon reflex. Unfortunately, the student Feider was feeding themselves poorly, and in 1925, after three years of starvation, they contracted pulmonary tuberculosis, which was still ravaging lives at the time.
Forced to leave their studies in Italy, they returned to Romania, and was admitted to the Tuberculosis Sanatorium of Bârnova, close to Iași, where they strictly followed the rudimentary anti-tuberculous of treatment of that time. Weakened, but still willing to study Medicine they enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine of Iași University, and in 1928, they were immediately accepted due to their fine work in Pavia.
Most unfortunately, the rise of anti-Semitic feelings throughout most of the students and some faculty members, and the lack of Jewish cadavers for Anatomy study (Jewish students were not allowed to dissect Christian cadavers), forced Zicman to quit studying medicine at Iași. Nevertheless, their desire to continue studying was paramount, so they enrolled at the Faculty of Natural Sciences, at the University of Chernivtsi (founded in 1875 as the Franz-Josephs-Universität Czernowitz), when Chernivtsi (Cernăuți in Romanian) was the capital of the Duchy of Bukovina, nicknamed "Little Vienna", part of the Austrian Empire. Zicman Feider studied only one year there, and then moved back to Iași, province of Moldova.
Back in Iași, they studied from 1930 to 1933, at the Natural Sciences section, of the Science Faculty at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, previously known as "Michaelian Academy" of Iași, from which they graduated with honors in 1933. During this time, they learned from famous academicians, professors and academic researchers, like Ioan Borcea, Paul Bujor, and Constantin Motaș. Here, they have also begun working with their future illustrious zoologist colleagues Mihai Băcescu, Sergiu Cărăușu, and Alexandru V. Grossu.
Post-graduation and early working years
Feider started as a teacher in their native city of Roman, and then taught in the town of Târgu Ocna until they passed their Teacher's Capacity Examination in 1935. Having obtained their Capacity Degree, they were hired as teacher of Natural Sciences at the "St. O. Iosif Boys Lyceum" in Odorheiu Secuiesc (Hungarian: Székelyudvarhely), Harghita County, Transylvania, Romania. The renowned educational institution, which preserves until today inside its yard the ruins of a Roman castrum, was named after a prematurely dead Romanian pre-symbolist poet, Ștefan Octavian Iosif,.
In 1938, Feider married Ilona Pal, a local Székely person, who was a graduate of Benedek Elek Teachers' College, who eagerly defended their right to marry a Jew, during the reign of an antisemitic right-wing government.
Feider permanently maintained their association with the professors from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, and the eminent biologist Constantin Motaș, renowned specialist in hydro-Acari, who suggested that they should start researching the earth-Acari. As a result, the still young and very passionate Zicman was rummaging through the litter of the orchards of Harghita County in search of mites. They had the admiration and support of the Lyceum principal, Professor Ioan Steriopol, who was proud to befriend him. Working intensively as a teacher, researcher and pedagogue, Professor Feider helped establish the Natural Science Museum in Odorheiu Secuiesc.
In 1938, Zicman Feider published in the "Annals of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University" one of the discoveries of their passionate, under the title "Sur une espèce nouvelle de genre Euthrombidium" (About a new species of Euthrombidium).
Unfortunately, the atmosphere in Odorheiu Secuiesc became incendiary after the 30 August 1940 - "Vienna Diktat", when Hungary received northern Transylvania from Romania, and the anti-Semitic manifestation became so pervasive that Zicman and their pregnant wife were forced to leave Transylvania for Moldova.
Temporarily jobless and stigmatized as a Jew, Zicman sought to work as a teacher in Piatra Neamț, and eventually they found an opportunity to teach at the "Jewish Lyceum" of the city of Roman, Romania, at the end of 1940. Their industrious work and their leadership skills were so well respected, they became the Principal of the "Jewish Lyceum", where they worked until 1944, during World War II.
From 1944 to 1949, they continued to work as a Biology teacher at "Roman's Boys Lyceum" and at the "Commercial Lyceum" of the City of Roman. Meanwhile, their research was extremely active, resulting in the publication of several papers on Trombidiidae (a.k.a. Red Velvet Mites or Rain Bugs, arachnids found in soil litter known for their bright red colors), in 1945.
Academic and scientific activity
In 1947, they successfully defended their Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of Professor Constantin Motaș, entitled "The Respiratory Apparatus in Trombidiidae and Superior Prostigmata". For their extraordinary work, Zicman Feider obtained the qualification magna cum laude.
In 1949, they were appointed as an associate professor at the Department of Zoology of the Natural Science Faculty at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Iași, and their alma mater.
In 1950, they were coopted in the formal "Research Group for Romanian Fauna", affiliated with the Scientific Section of the Romanian Academy, as head of the "Fauna Group" from the Iași Branch.
In 1955, Feider published a remarkable work "The Monograph of Trombidiidae", included in the "Fauna" collection of the Romanian Academy Press.
In 1959, they became Full Professor with tenure at the Department of Zoology of the Natural Science Faculty at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Iași.
They were designated as titular for the Course of Vertebrate Zoology (the biological discipline that consists of the study of Vertebrate animals, i.e., animals with a backbone, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) (see Curs de zoologia vertebratelor). They also taught other courses like General Zoology, and Parasitology.
In 1965, they published "Superfamily Ixodoidea" (containing the family Ixodidae – hard ticks), another monograph in the "Fauna" collection of the Romanian Academy Press.
In the same year 1965, after years of collaborative work with their Romanian colleagues from the universities of Bucharest and Cluj, Professor Zicman Feider published the first edition of "The Vertebrate Zoology". This monumental work was reedited twice (see ZOOLOGIA VERTEBRATELOR de Z. FEIDER, AL. V. GROSSU, ST. GYURKO si V. POP 1967 & ZOOLOGIA VERTEBRATELOR - Z. FEIDER, AL. V. GROSSU, ST. GYURKO si V. POP BUCUREȘTI. 1976), and can be found as PDF file on Internet.
As a vertebrate zoologist, Feider surrounded themselves with other members of the department of Zoology, developing several lines of research for each of them, mentoring them to successfully defending their Ph.D. theses. All those collaborators – Libertina Solomon, Viorica Simionescu, Iulia Mironescu, Nicolai Valenciuc, and Iordache Ion became full professors and accomplished researchers. Some of their joint lines of research topics were "The hyoid-mandibular apparatus in fishes" and "The relative growth in some fish species". The work was done at the "Marine Biological Station Professor Doctor Ioan Borcea", Agigea, Romania, founded in 1926 at the Border of the Black Sea, as an external research institution pertaining to the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Iași.
Concomitantly, Feider supervised other Ph.D. theses of several zoologists working at other Romanian Universities or at some remote biology research centers. They also never lost contact with the high-school education in Romania, and was invited almost every year to preside over Baccalaureate Committees in the largest cities of the Province of Moldova, Romania. In fact, the textbooks of Zoology for high schools in Romania all had their magisterial book "The Vertebrate Zoology" as reference.
Feider's work with mites and ticks became very well known abroad, and more specialists in the field were interested in their work. They carried out the taxonomical and systematical study of many Acarina groups: Ixodoidea, Oribatidae, Gamasidea, Rhinonyssidae, Erythraeidea, and Prostigmata from Romania; Nicolletiellidae and Sternostoma genus throughout the world. They found phylogenetic indicators in the structures of trichobotrias, aspis, and genital and anal plaques in the larva chetotaxis and visual organs at Ixodidae or in the breathing apparatus, metopic edge and genital structure of Trombidia.
Meanwhile, they joined several scientific societies in Europe and the US, and was appointed to the editorial board of the publication Acarologia – a quarterly peer-reviewed open-access scientific journal covering all aspects of acarology, established by Marc André and François Grandjean in 1959.
Some acarologists sent them their own collections for studying, to avoid name-redundancy. Feider therefore was comparing Acari from all over the world with the holotypes (holotype - a single type specimen upon which the description and name of a new species is based) pertaining to their personal collection.
Feider transmitted their passion for acarology to a group of researchers from the Center for Biological Research - Nicu Vasiliu, Magda Călugăr, Mărioara Huțu, Maria Calistru and few others, who were their devoted disciples, while working at the "General and Applied Biology Institute" of the Iași branch of the Romanian Academy. They represented the growing school of Romanian acarologists, unparalleled until today.
Death
Feider died after their fourth heart attack (he survived three previous attacks), while their third monography about Trombiculoidea was given for publication to the "Fauna" collection of the Romanian Academy Press.
Legacy
The personal "Acari and Ixodidae collection" of Feider, a true scientific thesaurus gathered during decades of arduous work, was donated to the Natural History Museum of Iași, a prestigious institution founded in 1834, and is the first museum of this kind in Romania.
As evidence of the appreciation for their dedication to the science, several acarologists felt compelled to immortalize the name Zicman Feider, by dedicating their name to newly identified species of Acari. For instance, Subias created the genus Feiderzetes - Feiderzetes latus in 1977. After their passing, one of their collaborators and colleagues, Libertina Solomon created the species Myonyssus feideri, and two of their close scientific correspondents, Balogh and Mahunka created the species Phteracorus zicmani.
Feider remains in the memory of those who knew them as an eminent academic figure, with not only a vast knowledge of biology, but also a person who spread human warmth. They were a devoted father and grandfather, whose three children followed their example, choosing academic careers: Noemi Bomher - professor of Romanian literature, Daniela Kocsis – teacher of mathematics, and the junior Almos Bela Trif – physician and professor of pathology.

NOFX is an EP by the American punk rock band NOFX, released August 2, 2011, through Fat Wreck Chords and consisting almost entirely of cover versions of hardcore punk songs. The idea for the EP was originally announced in 2009—before the release of the group's eleventh studio album Coaster—and was originally announced to be released exclusively as a 10" vinyl record. The EP was also made available in 7", 12", and picture disc formats, all containing the same track listing.
Track listing
The EP features eight cover versions of songs that were originally written by "rather obscure American hardcore bands" from the 1980s. The album's packaging does not list any song titles or writing credits. In various interviews, NOFX frontman Fat Mike suggested that the album would include songs by Necros, Social Unrest, Stretch Marks, and Rebel Truth. One of the songs is an original NOFX composition.

The Zealots were a political movement in 1st-century Second Temple Judaism which sought to incite the people of Judea Province to rebel against the Roman Empire and expel it from the Holy Land by force of arms, most notably during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70). Zealotry was the term used by Josephus for a "fourth sect" or "fourth Jewish philosophy" during this period.
Etymology
The term zealot, the common translation of the Hebrew kanai (, frequently used in plural form, , kana'im), means one who is zealous on behalf of God. The term derives from Greek (zelotes), "emulator, zealous admirer or follower".
History
Josephus' Jewish Antiquities states that there were three main Jewish sects at this time, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. The Zealots were a "fourth sect", founded by Judas of Galilee (also called Judas of Gamala) in the year 6 CE against the Census of Quirinius, shortly after the Roman Empire declared what had most recently been the tetrarchy of Herod Archelaus to be a Roman province. According to Josephus, they "agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord." (18.1.6)
According to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on Zealots:
Others have also argued that the group was not so clearly marked out (before the first war of 66–70/3) as some have thought.
Simon the Zealot was listed among the apostles selected by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke and in the Acts of the Apostles.  They are called Cananaean in Mark and Matthew (, )
Two of Judas of Galilee's sons, Jacob and Simon, were involved in a revolt and were executed by Tiberius Alexander, the procurator of Iudaea province from 46 to 48.
The Zealots had the leading role in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE). The Zealots objected to Roman rule and violently sought to eradicate it by generally targeting Romans and Greeks. Another group, likely related, were the Sicarii, who raided Jewish habitations and killed Jews they considered apostate and collaborators, while also urging Jews to fight Romans and other Jews for the cause. Josephus paints a very bleak picture of their activities as they instituted what they characterized as a murderous "reign of terror" prior to the Jewish Temple's destruction. According to Josephus, the Zealots followed John of Gischala, who had fought the Romans in Galilee, escaped, came to Jerusalem, and then inspired the locals to a fanatical position that led to the Temple's destruction. They succeeded in taking over Jerusalem, and held it until 70, when the son of Roman Emperor Vespasian, Titus, retook the city and destroyed Herod's Temple during the destruction of Jerusalem.
In the Talmud
In the Talmud, the Zealots are the non-religious (not following the religious leaders), and are also called the Biryonim (בריונים) meaning "boorish", "wild", or "ruffians", and are condemned for their aggression, their unwillingness to compromise to save the survivors of besieged Jerusalem, and their blind militarism against the rabbis' opinion to seek treaties for peace. However, according to one body of tradition, the rabbis initially supported the revolt up until the Zealots initiated a civil war, at which point all hope of resisting the Romans was deemed impossible. The Zealots are further blamed for having contributed to the demise of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, and of ensuring Rome's retributions and stranglehold on Judea. According to the Babylonian Talmud, Gittin:56b, the Biryonim destroyed decades' worth of food and firewood in besieged Jerusalem to force the Jews to fight the Romans out of desperation. This event directly led to the escape of Johanan ben Zakai out of Jerusalem, who met Vespasian, a meeting which led to the foundation of the Academy of Jamnia which produced the Mishnah which led to the survival of rabbinical Judaism. The Zealots advocated violence against the Romans, their Jewish collaborators, and the Sadducees, by raiding for provisions and other activities to aid their cause.
Sicarii
The Sicarii were a splinter group of the Jewish Zealots who, in the decades preceding Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE, strongly opposed the Roman occupation of Judea and attempted to expel them and their sympathizers from the area. The Sicarii carried sicae, or small daggers, concealed in their cloaks. At public gatherings, they pulled out these daggers to attack Romans and alleged Roman sympathizers alike, blending into the crowd after the deed to escape detection.
According to historian Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, the Sicarii, originally based in Galilee, "were fighting for a social revolution, while the Jerusalem Zealots placed less stress on the social aspect" and the Sicarii "never attached themselves to one particular family and never proclaimed any of their leaders king". Both groups objected to the way the priestly families were running the Temple.
Paul the Apostle
While most English translations of the Bible render the Greek word zelotes in Acts 22:3 and Galatians 1:14 of the New Testament as the adjective "zealous", an article by Mark R. Fairchild takes it to mean a Zealot and suggests that Paul the Apostle may have been a Zealot, which might have been the driving force behind their persecution of the Christians (see the stoning of Saint Stephen) before their conversion to Christianity, and the incident at Antioch, even after their conversion. In the two cited verses Paul literally declares themselves as one who is loyal to God, or an ardent observer of the Law, but the relationship of Paul the Apostle and Jewish Christianity is still debated. This does not necessarily prove Paul was revealing themselves as a Zealot. The Modern King James Version of Jay P. Green) renders it as 'a zealous one'. Two modern translations (the Jewish New Testament and Alternate Literal Translation) render it as 'a zealot'. The Unvarnished New Testament (1991) renders Galatians 1:14 as "being an absolute zealot for the traditions". These translations may not be inaccurate, but it is disputed by those who claim it gives the wrong association with the "Zealots".

Mansfield University of Pennsylvania is a public university in Mansfield, Pennsylvania. It is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE). Mansfield University's total enrollment is 1,637 students.
History
Mansfield University traces its heritage back to 1857, when Mansfield Classical Seminary opened on January 7. At 10 a.m. on April 22, with a foot of snow on the ground, the Mansfield Classical Seminary burned to the ground. Immediately after the fire, the founders vowed to persevere and reconstruct an even bigger and better building. Mansfield Classical Seminary was rebuilt and reopened on November 23, 1859, to some 30 students. Rev. James Landreth was elected Principal and Miss Julia A. Hosmer was named preceptress.
In 1862, Simon B. Elliott submitted application for Mansfield Classical Seminary to become a state normal school. The application was accepted in December 1862, and Mansfield Classical Seminary became the Mansfield Normal School, the third state normal school in Pennsylvania. In 1874, the new ladies dormitory was built for a cost of $15,000. It would later be renamed North Hall.
In 1892 at the Great Mansfield Fair, electric lights were erected and a game of football was played between Mansfield Normal and Wyoming Seminary, ending in a draw. It is later recorded as the first night football game played in the United States.
In 1902, Mansfield Normal School moved to a three-year program from the two-year normal course, pushing the school closer to collegiate status. On June 4, 1926, Mansfield State Normal School was granted the right to give four-year Collegiate degrees. Finally, on May 13, 1927, the name Mansfield Normal is officially changed to Mansfield State Teachers College (MSTC).
During World War II, several hundred male students entered military service, and nurse training was initiated at MSTC. Most of the sports are suspended at the college for the duration of the war. Post-war, sports resumed with MSTC capturing two consecutive State Championships in football for the 1946 and 1947 seasons. During the 1950s, both South Hall and Alumni Hall were replaced with new buildings.
In 1960, the Pennsylvania Department of Education granted the expansion of liberal arts programs to colleges in the system, including MSTC. MSTC became Mansfield State College. The campus continued to expand with the construction of other new buildings and new academic programs through the 1960s and 1970s.
In July 2021, Pennsylvania higher education officials announced that Mansfield would merge with Bloomsburg University and Lock Haven University in response to financial difficulties and declining enrollment, and each institution would represent a campus of a single university. In March 2022, the new institution was created to oversee the three universities and was named the Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania.

On its campus, Mansfield has four residence halls, multiple eateries, an on-campus student health clinic, campus police unit, campus bookstore, an on-campus and student-led television studio, radio station, and campus newspaper, state-of-the-art North Hall Library, Grant Science Planetarium, Decker Gymnasium and Olympic-sized swimming pool, Kelchner Fitness Center, multiple outdoor recreation spots (ropes course, disc golf, and biking trails), Straughn Hall Auditorium, Steadman Theatre and Steadman Studios, Alumni Student Center and Game Room, Childcare Center (affiliate), in addition to several academic and administrative buildings and outdoor seating and learning venues.
North Hall Library
North Hall, a four-story Victorian structure, was completed in 1878.
The current visible North Hall was actually built in two parts. The original North Hall from 1874 was torn down in the spring of 1907. The north part (left side) and the middle section was started in the summer 1891 immediately following the purchase of the lot that the North end cross wing sits on. This new structure was seven stories tall. The new cafeteria on the first floor was opened for use on Thanksgiving Day 1892. Until 1907 the original North Hall minus the northernmost cross wing part was up against the newer middle section (south side) and was only 4 stories tall. In mid 1907 the matching South end of the current North Hall was started. This was completed in 1909. For years, the upper floors served as a women's dormitory while the ground floor was used as the cafeteria. As the university grew and other buildings on the campus were built, North Hall severely deteriorated.
The building was closed in 1976, and the building was almost demolished. But pressure from campus and community leaders salvaged North Hall. $11 million was used to restore the building through state and private funding. In 1996 North Hall reopened as a library, providing state-of-the-art technology.
The first floor of the library comprises several private listening rooms, complete with a variety of audio equipment and a theatre-viewing room with 25 seats. The first floor also holds the Music Library, the library's collection of media, and the Education Library. The second floor hosts the Reference Collection, the Best-Seller Collection, Circulation Desk, Reception Room, and covered porches with over-stuffed wicker furniture.
The third floor hosts the Periodical Collection and The Microfilm Room and Newspaper Reading Room. The fourth floor features private study rooms. The book stacks are located on the third and fourth floor. The library houses an abundance of desks, seating, and technology throughout.
Academics
Mansfield University offers 87 major and minor programs. The university offers associate's, bachelor's, and master's degree programs. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

Matteo Goffriller (1659–1742) was a Venetian luthier, particularly noted for the quality of their cellos. They were active between 1685–1735 and was the founder of the "Venetian School" of luthiers, during a time when Venice was one of the most important centers of musical activity in the world.
Biography
Although it is known that Goffriller was born in Brixen, little else is known of them prior to 1685 in Venice.
Goffriller arrived in Venice in 1685 to work for luthier Martin Kaiser (Caiser). In 1685 they married Martin Kaiser's daughter Maddalena Maria Kaiser (Caiser), at the Madonna delle Grazie in Venice; they bore them twelve children (five boys and seven girls) in 26 years. Francesco Goffriller, long thought to be their brother, is now known to have been their son.
They were the founder of the "Venetian School" of luthiers, when Venice was one of the most important centers of musical activity in the world, and is believed to have taught luthiers Domenico Montagnana and Francesco Gobetti in addition to their son Francesco. After arriving in Venice, they are noted for being the city's sole violin and cello maker for some 25 years, between 1685 and 1710.
They died in Venice in 1742.
Mistaken identities
Goffriller's cellos had been erroneously attributed in the past to the Guarneri family, Carlo Bergonzi or even Antonio Stradivari and were virtually unknown until the 1920s, when they began to be discovered. The 1733 Goffriller cello once owned by Pablo Casals was originally attributed to Bergonzi. Their earliest authenticated instrument is a viola da gamba dated 1689.
Goffriller labels
The standard label for a Goffriller instrument, whether genuine or forged, uses the Latin inscription Mattheus Goffriller Fece in Venezia Anno [date], identifying maker, city (Venice) and year made; the date is either printed or handwritten. But they actually labeled only a small percentage of the instruments in order to avoid paying Venetian taxes.
Legacy
Pablo Casals's Goffriller 1733 cello was their main concert instrument for most of their professional life. They acquired it in 1913 and played it until their death in 1973. Since 2000, winners of the International Pablo Casals Cello Competition in Kronberg, Germany may use it for two years. Terence Weil played another Goffriller used by Casals before the one they played between 1913 and 1973.
Other notable musicians who have used Goffriller instruments include:

Kingdomino is a 2016 tile board game for 2-4 players designed by Bruno Cathala and published by Blue Orange Games. In this 15-20 minute, family-oriented game, players build a five by five kingdoms of oversized domino-like tiles, making sure as they place each tile that one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The game was critically successful and won the 2017 Spiel des Jahres award, and was followed by several spin-offs and expansions.
Gameplay
In the game players take turns choosing domino-like tiles and adding them to their kingdoms. Like traditional Dominoes, each tile has one or two different ends, which in this case also show different landscapes, and possibly a number of crowns on it. Choosing a tile with the most crowns gives a player last choice in the next round for choosing a tile, and vice versa - choosing the worst tile now ensures the first choice in the following round.
When a tile is placed next to other tiles of the same landscape, they form a larger property. Each kingdom can be no larger than a 5x5 grid of landscapes. The game ends when the tiles run out, and then each property is scored based on how big it is, multiplied by the number of crowns in it. The player with the most points in all their properties wins.
There is also a two player variant of the game which allows players to form a larger 7x7 grid of tiles.
Kingdomino is considered by reviewers to be an accessible entry point into strategy board games, with its 15–20 minute playing time and its familiar game mechanics which bear similarity to Dominoes.
History
The first version of Kingdomino was only available to families in the French Alps who paid for a week-long pass at the nearby ski resort.
Reception
Kingdomino received positive reviews upon its release, and won the Spiel des Jahres award for the best board game of the year. In a 2017 article, The Guardian praised the combination of accessibility and depth of strategy, describing Kingdomino "the standout game of the past 12 months". Sam Desatoff IGN also praised the simplicity of rules, strategy and the engagement of the tile selection mechanic, stating that "every single fast-playing round into a mindgame of maximizing the points you can earn right now", but criticised the "analysis paralysis". A review in The Wirecutter praised the fun and engagement of the game, but criticised the interactivity and complexity of the rulebook.
Spinoffs and expansions
In 2017, Blue Orange Games released Queendomino, a standalone board game which used a tile laying gameplay similar to the original, but added knights, dragons, a queen, and buildings to build. This was followed in 2018 by the release of Kingdomino Age of Giants, an expansion for both Kingdomino and Queendomino. In 2019, Kingdomino Duel was also released as a two player, roll and write version of the game. In 2021, a simplified version, Dragomino, was released, receiving positive reviews and won the Kinderspiel des Jahres award. Kingdomino Origins, a prehistoric-themed sequel, was released in the same year and introduced three modules.

All These Lighted Things (three little dances for orchestra) is an orchestral composition by the American composer Elizabeth Ogonek. The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, for which Ogonek co-serves as Mead composer-in-residence with the composer Samuel Adams. The piece was given its world premiere by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Riccardo Muti on September 28, 2017.
Composition
All These Lighted Things was composed over a period of five months in 2017. The title of the piece comes from a poem by Thomas Merton. The work has a duration of approximately 15 minutes and is cast in three short movements:
Exuberant, playful, bright
Gently drifting, hazy
Buoyant
Instrumentation
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of two flutes, two piccolos, two oboes, two clarinets and E-flat clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, and strings.
Reception
Reviewing the world premiere, the music critic John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune wrote, "Ogonek works painstakingly at their craft and it shows in the acutely wrought instrumental detail that pervades their 15-minute opus." They continued, "Dancelike figures drive the first and third dances (Ogonek originally considered writing a set of modern mazurkas out of respect for their Polish heritage), set off by the gently drifting haze of tonal lyricism — Charles Ives without the dissonant harmonic clashes — of the central dance. Them inventive, even jazzy writing for chiming crotales, triangles and tubular bells, over shifting meters, kept percussionist Cynthia Yeh and colleagues happily engaged. It's an attractive piece that went down easily — perhaps too easily — with Thursday's audience." Hedy Weiss of the Chicago Sun-Times similarly remarked, "It is a new work that deserves many hearings, and one that is sure to offer additional pleasures with each of them."
Despite praising Ogonek's chamber violin concerto In Silence as "a small masterpiece," Lawrence A. Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review was more critical of All These Lighted Things, observing, "Like many young composers with minimal orchestra experience, one gets the sense of Ogonek stitching together offbeat sounds and disparate colors that offer some striking sonic effects yet lack a sense of direction and overall development—even in the brief spans of three short movements." They added:

Pterostylis irwinii is a species of greenhood orchid endemic to New Zealand. Flowering plants have erect, linear leaves on the flowering stem while non-flowering plants have a rosette of egg-shaped leaves. There is a single green flower with translucent white stripes and reddish-brown tips.
Description
Pterostylis irwinii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which often grows in loose colonies. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of two or three, more or less egg-shaped leaves which are long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long and wide on a reddish flowering stem tall with three to five stem leaves with their bases wrapped around the stem. The stem leaves are linear to lance-shaped, long and wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or "galea" over the column. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and has a rough surface. It is erect near its base, then curves forward with the dorsal sepal longer than the petals. The lateral sepals are more or less erect with narrow tips long with a deep notch in the sinus between them and a wide gap between them and the galea. The labellum is long and about wide, curved, reddish-brown and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs between October and January.
Taxonomy and naming
Pterostylis irwinii was first formally described in 1997 by David Jones, Brian Molloy and Mark Clements and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (irwinii) honours J. Bruce Irwin who collected the type specimen at Erua near the Tongariro National Park in 1991.
Distribution and habitat
Irwin's greenhood seems to prefer damp positions in tall forest or steep hilly places with basic rocks such as limestone. On the North Island it occurs on the Waimarino River floodplain and near Cape Palliser. On the South Island it grows in the north west as far south as the Buller River with a few observations further south.
Conservation
Pterostylis irwinii is classed as "threatened and nationally endangered" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Holothuria (Selenkothuria) glaberrima, also known as the brown rock sea cucumber, is a species of sea cucumber in the genus Holothuria, subgenus Selenkothuria. The cucumber is distributed in the Western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. The species is found at a depth of 0–42 meters.
Description
The body of Holothuria glaberrima is cigar-shaped, with a whorl of twenty bushy feeding tentacles at the anterior end surrounding the mouth. The cuticle is leathery and tough; the dorsal surface is smooth, while the ventral surface or "sole" bears three longitudinal rows of dark brown tube feet. This sea cucumber grows to a length of . The general colour is blackish, dark brown or occasionally grey, without any spots, while the tentacles are black.
Distribution and habitat
Holothuria glaberrima is native to the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico; its range includes the West Indies. Florida, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil. It occurs at depths down to about . It lives under rocks in areas with considerable water movement.
Research
Sea cucumbers are able to regenerate their complete digestive systems and grow back most parts of the body following injury. Because of this, and because of the closeness of the relationship of echinoderms to vertebrates, sea cucumbers have been used in regeneration research. Holothuria glaberrima has been widely used as a model organism for this purpose, and to facilitate these studies, the genome has been sequenced.

The 2021 Ladies' National Football League, known for sponsorship reasons as the Lidl Ladies' National Football League, is a ladies' Gaelic football competition taking place in summer 2021. Division placings were the same as for the 2020 competition, which was unfinished due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Revised fixtures were announced on 6 April 2021, with the tournament taking place in late May and June. Dublin were the winners.
Format
League structure
The 2021 Ladies' National Football League consists of three divisions of eight teams and one of seven. Each division is divided into a North and South section with four teams in each section, except that there are three teams in 4 South. Each team plays every other team in its section once. 3 points are awarded for a win and 1 for a draw.
Tiebreakers for league ranking
If two teams are level on points, the tie-break is:
winners of the head-to-head game are ranked ahead
if the head-to-head match was a draw, then whichever team scored more points in the game is ranked ahead (e.g. 1-15 beats 2-12)
if the head-to-head match was an exact draw, ranking is determined by the points difference (i.e. total scored minus total conceded in all games)
if the points difference is equal, ranking is determined by the total scored
If three or more teams are level on league points, rankings are determined solely by points difference.
Finals, promotions and relegations
The top two teams in each section in Division 1 contest the Ladies' National Football League semi-finals.
The top two teams in each section in divisions 2, 3 and 4 contest the semi-finals of their respective divisions. The division champions are promoted.
The last-placed teams in each section in divisions 1, 2 and 3 play a relegation playoff against each other, with the losers relegated.

La Favorita Park (Italian: Parco della Favorita or Real Tenuta della Favorita) is a large city park in Palermo, Italy. Established in 1799 by Ferdinand III of Sicily, it has an overall area of , and represent the biggest green area of Palermo. It is located at the foot of Monte Pellegrino, in the north-western part of the city.
History
The park was founded by the King Ferdinand III after their escape from Naples in 1798. In order to create the park, many properties were forfeited by the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The park was used for several purposes: it represented a fresh oasis during the summer, but also a game preserve and a space for agricultural experiments with big cultivations of citrus fruits, olive trees, ashes, nuts and sumac.
The park is part of the Riserva naturale orientata Monte Pellegrino, established by the Sicilian Region in 1995.
Description
The park extends from the shade of Monte Pellegrino to the neighbourhood of Pallavicino. Two long streets (named after Hercules and Diana) cross in parallel the park, connecting the centre of Palermo to the seaside borough of Mondello. The streets are interwoven thanks to a third avenue named after Pomona.
Within (or near) the park are located several places of interest like the royal residence called Palazzina Cinese (with the attached Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè), the precious Villa Niscemi, the Neoclassical Fountain of Hercules, the Renzo Barbera Stadium and other sport facilities.

The New Shakspere Society was founded in autumn 1873 by Frederick James Furnivall in order "to do honor to Shakspere, to make out the succession of their plays, and thereby the growth of their mind and art; to promote the intelligent study of him, and to print Texts illustrating their works and times..." Furnivall deliberately used an archaic spelling of Shakespeare's name in order to distinguish their Society from the earlier Shakespeare Society (1840–1853) organized by John Payne Collier.
History
Its first official meeting was held on 13 March 1874 at University College London, and by the next year membership had reached 500 members. Members included prominent names of the day such as Eleanor Marx, George Bernard Shaw, James Halliwell-Phillipps, Richard Green Moulton, and Edward Dowden. In its early years, it hosted public paper discussions and published both Proceedings and Transactions as the official record of the society. The Society also devoted a significant portion of its energies to determining the exact chronology of Shakespeare's plays; Furnivall believed that Shakespeare's works had to be studied in the order they were written to "get at a right understanding of their mind."
The Society was disrupted several times by conflicts between Furnivall and other members. Frederick Gard Fleay, an early member, resigned during the Society's first year after an argument with Furnivall, and a number of members left the society in the 1880s following a protracted argument between Furnivall and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Membership continued to decline throughout the next decade, and the Society officially disbanded in 1894.
Publications
Furnivall and many other members of the society were interested in quantifying Shakespeare's works, such as counting their lines or analyzing the meter of their poetry, which was reflected in their published papers and books. The Society also planned to publish Teena Rochfort-Smith's "Four-text Hamlet," an innovative experiment which reproduced four versions of Hamlet in parallel columns to enable textual analysis, but had only completed a prototype of the first act before Rochfort-Smith's untimely death.

Peter John Cundy DSO, DFC, AFC, TD (3 October 1916 – 4 August 2005) was a British military aviator who fought during the Second World War. While serving under the RAF Coastal Command they were involved in new techniques for locating and destroying enemy submarines.
Early life and family
Cundy was born at Bognor, the eldest of twin sons born to Wright Cundy, a brewer, and their wife Emma Louise, and was educated at Eastbourne College. Their younger brother Robert Michael Cundy followed them into the army, and then the RAF, serving as a flying officer in No. 13 Squadron RAF, until their Blenheim light bomber was reported missing on a night operation in May 1942. Robert's body was later recovered and is buried in Boulogne Eastern Cemetery.
Military service
After serving as a cadet in the Eastbourne College Contingent, Junior Division, Officers' Training Corps, Cundy was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 9th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, part of the Territorial Army, on 14 July 1937.
On 11 April 1940 Cundy was attached to the Royal Air Force, being granted a temporary commission as a pilot officer. After completing flight training they joined No. 53 Squadron, to fly Bristol Blenheims with Coastal Command, attacking U-boat bases along the French Atlantic coast. They were promoted to the war substantive rank of flying officer on 11 April 1941.
In 1941 Cundy joined No. 120 Squadron, flying a new long-range American-built B-24 Liberator. On 11 January 1942 while on patrol over the Bay of Biscay, they saw a Heinkel They 115 twin-engined floatplane, and manoeuvred their aircraft so their gunners could bring their fire to bear. The seaplane escaped into cloud with an engine on fire. Soon afterwards Cundy sighted the refuelling alongside a large tanker. Cundy immediately attacked both vessels with depth charges and machine gun fire. The submarine was damaged but dived, leaving a large patch of surface oil. Cundy was then attacked by another enemy They 115, but the Liberator's gunners drove it away damaged before Cundy resumed their attack on the tanker. Cundy and their navigator, Pilot Officer Ronald Roxburgh Fabel, were both subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
Cundy was promoted to the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant on 11 April 1942, and in May they and their crew were detached to America to assist in the development of a new air-to-surface radar. They then joined No. 224 Squadron in October 1942, flying the maritime version of the B-24 Liberator from St Eval in Cornwall on patrols in over the Bay of Biscay.
U-boat encounters
On 26 February 1943 Cunday was on patrol when they spotted on the surface. The U-boat crash-dived as Cundy dropped depth charges without any visible effect. The Liberator continued its patrol and shortly afterwards saw a second submarine, , which was attacked with the remaining depth charges. They saw the U-boat's bows appear almost vertically, and sink below the surface, so were rather surprised to see their surface and sail away some time later. However, U-508 had been damaged and was forced to return to Lorient.
On patrol on 3 July 1943, Cundy sighted a U-boat on the surface several miles ahead. With their gunners opening fire with machine guns, they dived to attack and launched the Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon onto the submarine, , which had recently left Brest on its fourth cruise. They made a second attack despite their aircraft suffering serious damage from return fire. Cundy then dropped four depth charges which straddled the submarine. Cundy made a further attack as the submarine settled low in the water. As they circled after their third attack, it was seen that the U-boat had sunk and crewmen were in the water. Cundy nursed their aircraft back to St Eval on three engines; there was also damage to the fuel tanks and the aircraft's tail, but they made a safe landing. This was the first use of the Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon from an aircraft.
On 23 July 1943 Cundy was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Their citation read:
"Since being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross this officer has been almost continuously engaged on operations. In February 1943, during an anti-submarine patrol, they executed two attacks on U-boats. During a flight in July 1943, Squadron Leader Cundy sighted a U-boat. In spite of heavy opposing fire from the vessel, which damaged their aircraft and disabled one engine; they pressed home two vigorous attacks, straddling the U-boat with their depth charges. Afterwards a large patch of oil appeared on the surface of the water. Squadron Leader Cundy is a skilful pilot whose leadership, courage and determination have been outstanding.
Command HQ service
In November 1943, after three years of constant operations, Cundy was transferred to Coastal Command HQ on staff and planning duties. During this period they also flew tests evaluating the Leigh light, a powerful searchlight carried on the wing of an anti-submarine aircraft. They were promoted to squadron leader (war substantive) on 8 May 1944. For their work, on 14 June 1945, and by then an acting wing commander, they were awarded the Air Force Cross.
Throughout the war Cundy had served on attachment to the RAF, but on 1 September 1945 they finally relinquished their Territorial Army commission as a second lieutenant, accepting a permanent commission in the RAF, with the rank of squadron leader.
Cundy then flew Dakota transport aircraft before becoming an instructor, serving for three years with the Air Training Wing in Rhodesia, then with No. 236 Operational Conversion Unit, equipped with the Avro Lancaster. In May 1951 they assumed command of No. 210 Squadron, operating the Lancaster in the maritime reconnaissance role from Ballykelly in Northern Ireland.
They were promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1952, and eventually retired from the RAF on 3 October 1963.
Post-military career
Cundy worked as a personnel manager for a market research company before taking up property management. In 1995 they were met the surviving crew members of U-373, who had escaped their attack in January 1942, when they were invited to Bavaria as guest of honour at their annual reunion, where they met the II WO, Joachim Jaworski. They attended every reunion for the next ten years.
Cundy retired to East Anglia, where they enjoyed fishing and shooting. Cundy died on 4 August 2005. They had married Section Officer Sheila Frost, WAAF, in 1945. They died six days before their husband, and they were survived by three sons and a daughter.

Ada Byron Bampton Tremaine (21 June 1849 – 6 August 1928) was an American philanthropist best known for the bequest that established the Bampton Lectures in America as well as an endowed chair (the Ada Byron Bampton Tremaine Professor of Religion) within the Department of Religion at Columbia University. That chair is currently held by Courtney Bender. Them predecessor, Robert Somerville, upon their retirement on 1 July 2020 was given the honorary title of Tremaine Professor Emeritus of Religion.
Biography
Ada Byron Bampton was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, on either 21 or 24 June 1849 to Elizabeth Shepherd Bampton, who spent the last few months of their pregnancy and first few months as a new mother residing with a friend, Hannah North.
Ada's father Richard Lane Bampton, a spermaceti chandler originally from Little Sutton, Warwickshire, had left for the California Gold Rush on 25 January 1849 on one of the first schooners to depart New York City for San Francisco, the Roe, which made the journey in 154 days. They arrived in San Francisco on 28 June 1849, only a few days after Ada was born. Richard remained in California until their death on 23 June 1889 in what then was known as Washington in Yolo County, California. Ada never met their father, and it is unclear whether they ever knew of their existence. Instead, Ada grew up in Manhattan and Brooklyn, living with their mother and their cousin Frederick Bampton, with whom they were particularly close, calling them their uncle even to their husband.
In the late 1870s and early 1880s Ada studied engraving at Cooper Union under the direction of J. P. Davis. After the death of their mother on 4 May 1881, Ada went to live with Frederick and their new wife, Martha. On 3 October 1888 in Manhattan they married Dr. William Allen Tremaine, the son of a Connecticut hotelier, a physician practicing in Providence, Rhode Island. Their only child, Frederick Bampton Tremaine, was born in Providence on 6 February 1890; they died eleven months later, on 12 January 1891, of unspecified causes. In the early 1900s William and Ada Tremaine moved from Providence to Rockport, Maine, where they bought a farm in Rockland called Alderbrook; Ada would live here for the rest of their life. On 5 October 1913 Dr. Tremaine died of throat cancer in Boston, where they had gone for treatment.
Ada Bampton Tremaine died in Rockland on 6 August 1928, at the age of 79.  They are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.
Court Challenge to Frederick Bampton's Will
Most of what is known about Ada Bampton Tremaine's life comes from the records of a court case that arose from a dispute over the terms of their cousin Frederick Bampton's will, in which upon their death on 10 October 1900 they left their entire estate to her, as well as naming their sole executor. Frederick, who had begun suffering from bouts of dementia, had been living with Ada and William Tremaine for over a year. Their marriage of nearly 20 years to Martha Scott North had long been an unhappy one. When Frederick drew up their will on 22 May 1900 they deliberately wrote their wife out of the will, stipulating, "I have not made any bequest to my wife Martha N. Bampton because I have made provision for them by a trust fund of $50,000 [approximately $1.7 million in 2021] in the par or face value of securities." They also did not leave any bequest to any other relatives other than Ada, "not ... because of any prejudice or want of consideration for them ... but because of the claim upon my affections of Ada B. Tremaine, my cousin's child, who for many years resided with me before their mother's death, and with whom I am now residing." The children of Frederick's nephew John Henry Bampton, Jr., who had died in Providence only nine days after Frederick, joined Frederick's widow in contesting the will.
Throughout the course of the court hearing, both attorneys for the contestants and the widow Mattie Bampton themselves questioned Ada's parentage, the nature of their relationship with Frederick and whether they had undue influence over him, and Frederick's lucidity at the time they drew up theirs will. The many days of testimony across several months in 1901 and compelling depositions by witnesses to Ada's birth and by friends of Frederick's who knew Richard Lane Bampton and Elizabeth Bampton convinced the judge that Frederick was of sound mind when they made their will and that Ada should in fact be the sole inheritor of Frederick's estate, which had been appraised at $150,000 (approximately $4.9 million dollars in 2021).
Philanthropy
In the 15 years after their husband William's death in 1913 until their own in 1928, Ada Bampton Tremaine supported a number of organizations, in particular giving generously to the Rhode Island Hospital, where they established a deficiency fund in the name of their late husband and endowed four permanent "free beds" at $4000 each (roughly $55,000 each in 2021 dollars) in memory of their mother, their husband, their cousin Frederick, and their son, making the final payment on those in 1924. (Free bed funds are specific donations that a hospital receives to provide free care to patients who cannot pay for all or part of their hospital stay.) They were also seemingly an annual contributor to the Camden Public Library, which also received a bequest in their will.
Ada's will, drawn up in Rockport on 26 January 1916 and witnessed by three local business people, spelled out a number of public bequests in addition to private gifts and trust funds provided to their friends, family, and long-time employees:
Rockport received $5000 to be used for the construction of a library.
Camden, Maine, likewise received $5000 for the same purpose, although by the time their will was probated, the newly built Camden Public Library had already been open for two months.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals received $1000.
The Camden Home for Aged Women likewise received $1000.
A miniature of George III by Sarah Biffin Wright and a manuscript on their life were to be offered to the Metropolitan Museum of Art "if said Museum of Art will accept the same."
They provided $20,000 for the upkeep of Alderbrook Farm until the death of their husband William's cousin Grace Rockwell and Ada's sister-in-law Elizabeth Tremaine Field, when the farm was to revert to the Knox County General Hospital.
The Bampton Lectures in America
Once the other trust funds had been fulfilled, which happened in 1941 upon the death of Ada's sister-in-law Elizabeth Tremaine Field, as specified in Ada Bampton Tremaine's will, the balance of the trust was to go to Columbia College, where Ada's husband William Tremaine had studied. The trust funds were to be used for the establishment of a lecture series entitled the Bampton Lectures in America and for an endowed chair in theology — "an endowment large enough to guarantee the holding of the Bampton lectures in perpetuity," it was noted when the first lecturer, Arnold J. Toynbee, was invited to speak.
Ada Bampton Tremaine's estate was one of the largest probated in Knox County up to that time, being assessed at $725,000 (almost $11 million in 2021), of which $610,000 (approximately $9.5 million in 2021 dollars) was earmarked for the Bampton Lectures at Columbia University. Columbia, however, needed to wait for more than a decade to receive these funds, which could not be paid out until the final trust fund was fulfilled. That final bequest seems to have been handled posthaste by the Rhode Island Hospital Trust Company, the executors of Ada's estate, as in the 1942 annual report to the Columbia trustees, President Nicholas Murray Butler announced that the university had finally received their funds from the estate of Ada B. B. Tremaine, totaling $649,781.31 ($11,025,911.83 in 2021 dollars). Six years later Toynbee gave the first set of Bampton Lectures, three talks grouped under the theme of "The Prospect of the Western Civilization," presented at Columbia's McMillin Theater on 14 April 1948 ("The Problem of War"), 19 April 1948 ("The Problem of Class"), and 21 April 1948 ("The Conflict Between Heart and Head").

Frey Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres (1460 – 29 May 1511 or 1518) was a Spanish soldier from a noble family and a Knight of the Order of Alcántara, a military order of Spain. They were Governor of the Indies (Hispaniola) from 1502 until 1509, sent by the Spanish crown to investigate the administration of Francisco de Bobadilla and re-establish order. Their administration subdued rebellious Spaniards, and completed the brutal pacification of the native Taíno population of Hispaniola.
Early life
Nicolás Ovando y Cáceres was born in Brozas, Extremadura, in 1460. Born into a noble and pious family, second son of Diego Fernández de Cáceres y Ovando, 1st Lord of the Manor House del Alcázar Viejo, and their first wife Isabel Flores de las Varillas (a distant relative of Hernán Cortés), Ovando entered the military Order of Alcántara, where they became a Master (Mestre or Maitre) or a Commander-Major (Comendador-Mayor). This Spanish military order, founded in 1156, resembled the Order of Templars, with whom it fought the Moors during the Reconquista. Their elder brother was Diego de Cáceres y Ovando.
Their Selection as Governor
As Commander of Lares de Guahaba, Ovando became a favourite of the Spanish Catholic Monarchs, particularly pious Queen Isabella I of Castile. Thus, on 3 September 1501, in response to complaints from Christopher Columbus and others about Francisco de Bobadilla, Isabella appointed Ovando to replace Bobadilla. Ovando became the third Governor of the Indies, the Islands, and the Province of Tierra Firme.
Their Expedition to the Americas
On 13 February 1502, they sailed from Spain with a fleet of thirty ships. It was the largest fleet that had ever sailed to the New World.
The thirty ships carried around 2 500 colonists. Unlike Columbus's earlier voyages, this group of colonists was deliberately selected to represent an organized cross-section of Spanish society. The Spanish Crown intended to develop the West Indies economically and thereby expand Spanish political, religious, and administrative influence in the region. Along with them also came Francisco Pizarro, who would later explore western South America and conquer the Inca Empire. Another ship carried Bartolomé de las Casas, who became known as the 'Protector of the Indians' for exposing atrocities committed by Ovando and their subordinates. Hernán Cortés, a family acquaintance and distant relative, was supposed to sail to the Americas in this expedition, but was prevented from making the journey by an injury they sustained while hurriedly escaping from the bedroom of a married woman of Medellín.
The expedition reached Santo Domingo in April 1502, and included Diego de Nicuesa and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon. Also on board were 13 Franciscans, led by Friar Alonso de Espinar, bringing the total on the island to 25.
Their Administration
When Ovando arrived in Hispaniola in 1502, they found the once-peaceful natives in revolt. Ovando and their subordinates ruthlessly suppressed this rebellion through a series of bloody campaigns, including the Jaragua Massacre and Higüey Massacre. Ovando's administration in Hispaniola became notorious for its cruelty toward the native Taíno. Estimates of the Taino population at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492 vary, with Anderson Córdova giving a maximum of 500 000 people inhabiting the island. By the 1507 census, according to Bartolomé de las Casas, battlefield slaughter, enslavement and disease had reduced the native population to 60 000 people, and the decline continued. In 1501, Ovando ordered the first importation of Spanish-speaking black slaves into the Americas. Many Spanish aristocrats ordered slaves to work as servants in their homes.
After the conquests made by their lieutenants including Juan Ponce de León and Juan de Esquivel, Ovando founded several cities on Hispaniola. They also developed the mining industry, introduced the cultivation of sugar cane with plants imported from the Canary Islands, and commissioned expeditions of discovery and conquest throughout the Caribbean. Ovando allowed Spanish settlers to use the natives in forced labour, a system known as encomienda, to provide food for the colonists and for ships returning to Spain. Hundreds of thousands of Taíno died while forced to extract gold from the nearby mines.
Pursuant to a deathbed promise they made to their wife Queen Isabella I, King Ferdinand II of Aragon recalled Ovando to Spain in 1509 to answer for their treatment of the native people. Diego Columbus was appointed their successor as governor, but the Spanish Crown permitted Ovando to retain possession of the property they brought back from the Americas.
Ovando died in Madrid on 29 May 1511. They were buried in the church of the former monastery of San Benito de Alcántara, which belonged to their military order and which sustained significant damage in later centuries.

Charles Leslie Briggs (born 1953) is an anthropologist who works at the University of California, Berkeley, United States. Before working at Berkeley they held a position as Chair of the Ethnic Studies Department at University of California, San Diego.
Biographical information
They were born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1953. They got a BA in Anthropology, Psychology and Philosophy from Colorado College. They received their PhD in Anthropology from the University of Chicago in 1981.
Research interests
Charles L. Briggs is the Alan Dundes Distinguished Professor in Folklore at Berkeley. They focus on linguistic and medical anthropology, social theory, modernity, citizenship and the state, race, and violence. They have studied the tension between modernity and traditionality as socio-political processes in performance, focusing on jokes, proverbs, legends, myths, anecdotes, gossip, curing songs, and ritual wailing, along with how constructions of language and tradition have shaped the politics of modernity. Their original research focus centered on the "Mexicano" population of their home state of New Mexico in the US. From then on they have focused their attention on the Warao, an Amerindian people of Delta Amacuro state in Venezuela. Current projects focus on revolutionary health care in Venezuela; how the state is “communicated” through the press particularly through health issues in Cuba, Venezuela, and the United States; and how violence is projected in legal, media, and medical institutions (Venezuela).

Meri Toksave is a youth-led, non-profit, non-governmental organisation that designs and delivers programmes and partnerships for the promotion and protection of human rights, the empowerment of women and girls, the advancement of gender equality, and the prevention and elimination of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea.
Background
Meri Toksave was founded in early 2013 by University of Queensland students Ayesha Lutschini, Tasman Bain and Courtney Price. They subsequently were awarded a Fellowship with The Resolution Project at the Harvard World Model United Nations in March 2013.
Meri Toksave is Tok Pisin loosely translated into English as information for women.
Sexual violence in Papua New Guinea is endemic, with twothirds of all women having been subject to abuse or violence. Human rights in Papua New Guinea also has a troubled record, with women still being discriminated against in many communities.
Activities
2013
The first project of Meri Toksave was to research, collate and verify the Meri Toksave Directory, the first ever country-wide directory of emergency and support services for survivors of gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea. The directory has been distributed to a range of service providers throughout Papua New Guinea with which Meri Toksave has developed partnerships, including UN Women, Oxfam, World Vision, Anglicare, Port Moresby General Hospital, the Papua New Guinea Department of Education, Médecins Sans Frontières, Soroptimist, Marie Stopes, ChildFund, United States Agency for International Development, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and other local and international organisations in the private and public sectors.
In September 2013, Ayesha Lutschini was invited to speak at the United Nations Association of Australia International Day of the Girl Child Forum. Also in September, Meri Toksave was granted observer status with the International NGO Development Council of Papua New Guinea when the team visited Port Moresby.
Ayesha Lutschini was a finalist for The Australian Women's Weekly 2013 Women of the Future Scholarship for their work with Meri Toksave and was also a finalist for the UnitingCare Australia 2014 Anti-Poverty Awards.

Edens Lost (1969) is a novel by Australian writer Sumner Locke Elliott.
Plot summary
The novel is a family saga told through the eyes of 16-year-old Angus Weekes who goes to live with the St James family in the Blue Mountains area of New South Wales after the death of their guardian.
Critical reception
On its original publication Kirkus Review found: "All of this is, in its fashion, opulently romantic and pleasantly parlayed in silvery, sugary words (delightfuls and entrancings) without altogether forfeiting the realities of living and loving it sometimes seems to camouflage."
Dennis Altman nominated the book as their favourite novel in The Australian and noted: "Like all of Elliott's writings based on their formative years, Edens Lost evokes pre-Menzies Australia through writing that is beautiful and precise. I suspect Elliott is one of the greatest stylists Australian writing has produced, even if a contemporary reader may lose patience at the careful accumulation of detail and minute observation that evokes for me the Sydney in which my parents met and married. I read Edens Lost when it was first published, in the early days of gay liberation, both knowing and not knowing that only a gay man could have written this book."
Notes
Dedication: For Marie
Epigraph: "Where the apple reddens / Never pry - / Lest we lose our Edens, / Eve and me." / Browning, 'A Woman's Last Word'
Television adaptation

The adaptation was directed by Neil Armfield, from a script by Michael Gow, and featured Julia Blake, Arthur Dignam and Linda Cropper.

Newington House is a historic house in Silverwater, New South Wales, Australia and is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Parramatta. The house and chapel are situated on the southern bank of the Parramatta River and are now enclosed by the Silverwater Correctional Centre. With Elizabeth Bay House and Camden Park, it is considered to be one of the three great houses of the County of Cumberland.
Newington is a substantial and intact example of a rural colonial villa, and demonstrates the quality of life of prominent citizens and families from early settlements. It is associated with a notable New South Wales family, being built for John Blaxland, whose entrepreneurial business activities were among the oldest in the colony, and whose brother, Gregory Blaxland, assisted in activities generally relative to the site. Its use since the occupation of the Blaxland family has reflected a number of social changes as the founding site of Newington College, and as an asylum, hospital, and prison administration building.
The estate
The Newington estate was established on Aboriginal lands of the Wann-gal which encompassed the southern side of the Parramatta River from Cockle Bay to Rose Hill.
In the first 40 years of European settlement, grants of land in this area, ranging from , were made to settlers. These land grants were inked in on County of Cumberland maps, with names of owners and land granted clearly indicated. In 1807, John Blaxland acquired of land, reserving the original grants of Waterhouse, Shortland, Archer and Haslam. They named the estate Newington after their family estate in Kent, England. Blaxland established a series of salt pans on the banks of the Parramatta River and by 1827 was producing 8 tons of salt each week for the Sydney market. Blaxland also established a tweed mill, lime kiln and flour mill. In 1843, Blaxland mortgaged the property to the Australian Trust Company. After they died in 1851 the Trust Company sold the property to John Dobie to recover the mortgage. The Blaxland family re-purchased the estate from Dobie in 1854 but offered it as security against a large loan. The property was transferred to the Official Assignee of the Insolvent Estate of Edward James Blaxland in 1860 and subsequently leased to the Methodist Church, who established Newington College on the estate. The College remained on the site until 1880.
The property, extending from near the current Holker Street to the current Carnarvon Street, was sold to John Wetherill in 1877. The following year, John Wetherill registered a subdivision plan for the entire 520 hectare Newington Estate. This proposal comprised an extensive grid layout, of some 114 lots, which extended well into the mud flats and mangroves of Wentworth Bay and Homebush Bay. In 1906 and 1909, Wetherill further subdivided their property as Riverside Heights, with the first allotments sold in that year. It was hoped that the location of the subdivision in proximity to the developing State Abattoir and Brickworks would attract people to the area in association with the employment opportunities offered by these establishments. This venture was largely unsuccessful, with only a few lots being sold. However the layout of the western part of the Newington subdivision remains obvious in the current street pattern and street names.
Newington was first offered to the Government for use as an Asylum for the Insane in 1874. The Government did not accept this offer, however in 1879, Government Architect James Barnett prepared a report on the suitability of the Newington estate for a Reformatory School for Boys. Their report concluded that the site was suitable for a Boys Reformatory or a Benevolent Asylum for Aged Women. In September 1897 the Crown Solicitor confirmed that 5000 pounds would be paid to John Wetherill to acquire about 19 hectares of land, which included Newington House.
A new Aged Women's Asylum was constructed to replace the existing asylum which was housed within the Immigrant Depot at the Hyde Park Barracks. The first buildings were established in 1886 on this new site to house 300 patients. At this time, the hospital was categorised as a state asylum for dependent adults' with infirmity or illness of 'incurable character'. Various additional buildings and structures were added to the Newington Hospital over the years. In 1960 it was proposed that the hospital should be closed and the site sold to industry. The significance of the site, however, stimulated significant public opposition to the plans. In 1968, after a series of drawn out negotiations, the Government of the day decided to close the hospital and transfer the property to the then NSW Department of Prisons.
The house
Newington House is a two-storey Regency villa, built between 1829 and 1832, in the style of an English mansion, with disciplined English gardens. In its heyday the Blaxland Estate was famous for its landscaped gardens and orchards. The house today is located in the centre of the Silverwater Corrective Centre. The main front of the house is symmetrical, with a central pedimented break-front. The main entrance door is surmounted by a decorative fanlight. The design has been variously attributed to John Verge and Henry Cooper however no original drawings have been located. Newington House was one of the subjects of architect and writer William Hardy Wilson's romanticised drawings of colonial architecture in NSW published in the 1920s. The house is now used as an administration block of the Silverwater Corrective Centre. The house is unusual in architectural terms, for its character rather than its quality; externally it forms a typical Regency structure, its initial conception somewhat marred by the awkward later placement of the verandah, which however presents a fine portal to the house. Internally the main items of significance are the room layout and the rigorous but rustic character of its joinery, where aspirations to the manner and style of a Verge house are seen in primitive form, revealing more general standards of workmanship of the day, and thus the joinery is idiosyncratic in detail rather than of refined quality.
The chapel
The Blaxland family chapel, named St Augustine's, was built in 1838 and a marble plaque, above the main door, attests to this fact. It is a rendered, single storey building of brick with corner buttresses and is rectangular in plan. In design it is Gothicised Georgian with pilasters, a string course and a pedimented gable. The pointed arch fenestration with simple tracery, coloured glass and quatrefoil vents are Gothic Revival in style. St Augustine's demonstrates the strong religious convictions of the Blaxland family.
The garden
Elements of the former house garden, and estate landscaping remain today. These include the outline of the formal carriage loop north of the house, isolated elements such as mature trees and an avenue of rainforest tree species and palms going north from the house towards the river. More detailed elements such as a pedestal and urn, east of the house on the edge of the former carriage loop also remain. Tree plantings lining the former carriage loop north of the house include Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis), southern nettle trees (Celtis australis) and cotton palms (Washingtonia robusta) with their tall, clean trunks to 20m high. An avenue of trees towards the river comprises Bunya Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), Canary Island date palms and swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta). The latter of these may be later plantings. Walkway planting dates to the 1860s-1900, the main period of popularisation and fashionability of these species, and their promotion by such public figures as then Directors of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden. These men provided such species to many public institutions such as hospitals. Cotton and Canary Island date palms were also commonly promoted species in this period. Close to Holker Street and the main entry are large specimens of Hill's fig (Ficus hillii) and Moreton Bay figs, transplanted from estate remnants to the east of the current entry driveway as part of a redevelopment of the main entry. These trees are at least of 1880s vintage but possibly older. Significance trees throughout the site include the extremely rare Schotia afra (Kaffir bean, Boer bean) and the surviving turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which are likely to be indigenous to the site.
Newington College
At the Methodist Conference of 1862, the Rev John Manton proposed that a collegiate institute, "decidedly Wesleyan in character", be founded in Sydney. It was expected that the school would "be open to the sons of parents of all religious denominations", and on Thursday 16 July 1863, the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute opened with 16 boys and a small number of theological students. As no suitable buildings were available in Sydney at the time, Newington House was leased. Newington College, as the school soon became known, prospered during its time on the Parramatta River and in 1869 was the first Australian school to play rugby football (against the University of Sydney), and soon after was the first school in Australia to hold an athletics carnival. The Newington College Cadet Unit is the oldest corps in the Australian Army Cadets. Expanding student numbers meant that more extensive premises closer to the city were required. A bequest, by John Jones, of land at Stanmore, saw the College move to the newly fashionable inner-city suburbs in 1880. By resolution of the College Council, the name Newington College was perpetuated on the new site, and Newington has remained at Stanmore ever since.
Newington, suburb
Newington, New South Wales is a suburb built partially on the former Newington House estate. It is located on the western side of Homebush Bay, on the Parramatta River and north-west of Sydney Olympic Park and is best known as the location of the Athletes Village for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and 2000 Summer Paralympics. The Athlete's Village was converted to residential apartments after the Games. Other apartments and double-storey houses have also been built since.
Newington Armory
Newington Armory was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ammunitions depot built on the former estate of Newington House.
A powder magazine and camp and were built in 1897 by the Royal Marines as an ammunition depot for admiralty ships. After the passing of the Naval Defence Act in 1910, by the Commonwealth that formally established the Commonwealth Naval Forces, the Commonwealth took over the ammunition depot and expanded the facilities. It became known as the Royal Australian Naval Armament Depot (RANAD). The RAN started to vacate the site in 1996, with ownership transferred to the Government of New South Wales to be developed as the Sydney 2000 Olympics Athlete's Village and the suburb of Newington.

The FMA I.Ae. 37 was a prototype jet fighter developed in Argentina during the 1950s. It never flew and was cancelled in 1960.
Development
Reimar Horten began work on the I.Ae. 37 around 1952, after their earlier flying wing projects were cancelled in 1951. This was a single-engined jet fighter that used a Delta wing flying wing structure with lateral engine inlets on each side of the nose. Wind tunnel tests began in 1953 as did testing of scale models at speeds up to . A full scale glider was built and made its first flight on 1 October 1954. Most unusually the pilot lay prone and looked out through the clear nose. Flight performance was deemed excellent and manufacture of a prototype powered by a Rolls-Royce Derwent V began in 1955. This engine was selected as it was readily available, but lacked the thrust desired for the fighter. The glider was modified with a normal cockpit in 1956. Shortly afterwards the program was split with the current aircraft becoming a subsonic trainer and a new, more powerful fighter, designated as the I.Ae. 48, with two podded engines under the wings and intended to reach Mach 2.2 (2,700 km/h). However, both projects were cancelled in 1960 as an economy measure, only a year before the I.Ae. 37 was to fly.

"Auprès de ma blonde" (French for "Next to My Girlfriend") or "Le Prisonnier de Hollande" ("The Prisoner of Holland") is a popular chanson dating to the 17th century. The song tells the story of a woman who laments to the birds in their father's garden that their husband is a prisoner in Holland. It appeared during or soon after the Franco-Dutch War (1672–78), during the reign of Louis XIV, when French sailors and soldiers were commonly imprisoned in the Netherlands.
The song's quick pace and lively melody made it well-suited to military marches, and it is still commonly played at parades. For the same reasons, it gained widespread popularity as a drinking song and nursery rhyme.
History
The song was composed in 1704 during the reign of Louis XIV. A local tradition attributes the composition to André Joubert du Collet.

Richard Wynn Keene (9 December 1809 – 28 November 1887) is mainly remembered today under their theatrical name of Dykwynkyn. Keene was a Victorian designer of costumes, props, mechanical effects and scenery for plays and pantomimes on the London stage, with a strong sense of wit and a special feeling for animals. They contributed some notable props for the first cycle of Wagner's Ring at Bayreuth. They were also an artist and in their earlier career a manufacturer and inventor of building materials. Keene's cement, a type of hard plaster for internal use, perpetuates their name. Keene achieved their theatrical distinction despite being severely or almost totally deaf. Probably for that reason they were never a public figure, and they died in penury.
Early career
Keene was born in Birmingham, where their father John Williams Keene may have run a business connected with the arms trade. Drawings they made while visiting London in 1828 show that their artistic abilities and visual sense of humour were already well developed. By 1834, when they married Mary Garner Morgan, a widow, at St Mary's, Lambeth, they had settled in London and was already probably working in the cement industry, as they described themselves as a cement merchant the following year, when they had an address off the Waterloo Road, while two years later they were working for a manufacturer at Nine Elms and looking for premises of their own. The trade was then developing rapidly along the south bank of the Thames and Keene seems to have been interested in exploring the use of cement for modelling and sculpture.
In 1838 Keene and John Danforth Greenwood, giving their address as Belvedere Road, Lambeth, patented the invention now known as Keene's cement. This was a kind of hard plaster formed by heating a gypsum-based compound to over 170 °C. According to the patent application, it was to be used for ‘the purpose of producing Ornamental Surfaces'. Though the invention was soon taken up, the patentees seem to have made little money from it, and in 1843 Greenwood, a physician by training, emigrated to New Zealand.
Between about 1841 and 1851 Keene ran a business under their own name at Vauxhall Walk as a manufacturer of terracotta. This was still then an experimental trade, covering different processes and purposes. Keene seems to have avoided the developing market for terracotta drains, bricks or building materials, concentrating instead on mosaic-making and other artistic features. They supplied capitals for columns at the Reform Club for Sir Charles Barry, and exhibited samples of mosaic pavement made from terracotta and similar materials at the Great Exhibition in 1851.
Work for the London stage
In 1852 Keene changed direction completely and began working as a designer of sets and costumes for the London stage, notably for the celebrated Drury Lane Christmas pantomimes. They had always been fascinated with the stage and with caricature. If, as seems likely, they were already severely deaf, this new career may have been easier for them to manage than an independent business. But Keene was not money-minded, and it is probable they took up the new work out of love for the theatre. For the rest of their life they lived at modest addresses in Clapham, and at one point (1864) they were declared bankrupt.
Keene's stage sobriquet Dykwynkyn, a comic shortening of their name, is first recorded in connection with their costumes for the 1854 Drury Lane pantomime. That was how they were invariably known thereafter. Dykwynkyn's great speciality were the large masks or ‘Big Heads' very popular with mid-Victorian pantomime audiences. Examples of their charming drawings for these and other fantasy devices are preserved in the Victoria & Albert Museum, at Harvard, and elsewhere. They were modelled in cramped back rooms at the back of Drury Lane Theatre, where Keene had a workshop. They also superintended the ‘juvenile fêtes' held at the Crystal Palace in 1858–9, when a monster plum pudding ‘outdoing in its dimensions a Great-Western turntable' was displayed, with creatures dancing upon it. Keene's range went well beyond comedy. They were involved in several ambitious archaeological reconstructions of scenery and costumes, such as the Egyptian drama Nitocris staged at Drury Lane in 1855, but they never brought them the success of the pantomimes. They also designed the monument in Kensal Green Cemetery to the pantomime clown Richard Flexmore (1862).
‘Fauna' for The Ring
Keene left Drury Lane in the 1870s during the management of F. B. Chatterton, and set up as a freelance stage designer and modeller with a workshop behind their own house at Milton Street, Wandsworth Road, Clapham (not Wandsworth, as has persistently been repeated). One episode stands out during this last stage of their career, when they were commissioned to supply mechanical animals for the first cycle of Richard Wagner's Ring at Bayreuth in 1876.
The background to this prestigious commission is peculiar. Wagner had strong ideas about stage effects in their operas, but often wavered between realism and suggestion. In this case they appear to have disregarded the caution of Richard Fricke, their main adviser on staging the Ring, and insisted on a number of realistic mechanical props for scenes featuring mythical animals. Alfred Forman, Wagner's first English translator, though not one of their intimates, seconded by the Anglo-German conductor Edward Dannreuther, then urged the skills of Dykwynkyn as the craftsman the best able to make the monstrous dragon into which Fafner is transformed in the second act of Siegfried. As far as is known, Wagner had never seen any of Dykwynkyn's creations on their visits to London. Yet Keene was commissioned, probably at short notice, to make not only the dragon but also a bear, a magpie and an ousel for Siegfried, a car with rams for Fricka in Die Walküre, and sacrificial beasts and a pair of ravens for Götterdämmerung. The snake into which Alberich is changed in Siegfried also came from England and was probably Dykwynkyn's too, but that is less certain.
By late July 1876, three weeks before the cycle began, only the car and parts of the dragon had arrived in Bayreuth, despite frequent visits by Dannreuther to Dykwynkyn's Clapham workshop. Most of the missing parts turned up just in time, but Fafner's neck-joint arrived too late (a canard repeated by Ernest Newman claimed that it was sent to Beirut instead of Bayreuth). The German technicians had to sew on a clumsy and unconvincing temporary neck. This caused the first audience to be amused rather than awed by the dragon, and to cheer when Siegfried slew it and put it out of its misery, to Wagner's fury. In general Dykwynkyn's creations for the Ring, clever and fantastic though they certainly were, were poorly received. Exotic pantomime props were unsuitable for Wagnerian mythic opera, as Richard Fricke had realized immediately the dragon arrived (‘Into the deepest junk room with the wretched thing! Get rid of it!'). Nothing was heard of the props after the opening cycle.
Death
By the early 1880s Keene's business had collapsed. They were probably already ill and certainly poor. In their final years, living at Hanbury Road, Battersea, close to their previous address, they were paralysed, bedridden, and relied on assistance from a theatrical charity. They died in the local workhouse infirmary on 28 November 1887 and was buried at the charity's expense at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking. According to an obituary in The Era, ‘through no fault of their own, their later life was saddened by great reverses of fortune, and they patiently endured to the last their many afflictions'. In these last years they seem to have been cared for by a niece who was left ‘almost destitute'.

Helen Weaver (June 18, 1931 – April 13, 2021) was an American writer and translator. They translated over fifty books from French. Antonin Artaud: Selected Writings was a Finalist for the National Book Award in translation in 1977.
Weaver was the general editor, a contributor and a translator for the Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology (1980). In 2001 they published The Daisy Sutra, a book on animal communication. In 2009 Weaver published The Awakener: A Memoir of Kerouac and the Fifties. Jack Kerouac (1922–1969) was a prominent writer and poet of the Beat Generation. In their review in The New York Times, Tara McKelvey wrote "Kerouac's soul lives on through many people — Joyce Johnson, for one — but few have been as adept as Weaver at capturing both them and the New York bohemia of the time. They were lucky to have met her."
Biography
Helen Weaver grew up in Scarsdale, New York. Them father, Warren Weaver, was a scientist, author, and world traveler who was Director of Natural Sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation for twenty-seven years. Them mother, Mary Hemenway Weaver, taught Latin and ancient history. Weaver graduated magna cum laude from Oberlin College with a B.A. in English Literature in 1952. They married Oberlin classmate James Pierce in 1952; they divorced in 1955. Them brother, Warren Weaver, Jr., was a political reporter on the Washington bureau of The New York Times.
In 1956 they met the writer Jack Kerouac, and they fell in love. Although the relationship did not last, it was immortalised in books written by both of them. Weaver often received drunken phone calls from Kerouac after they had parted. They would always tell them to phone back in the morning, but they never did. However, they made notes of what was said in every call, and collected clippings about him. Eventually they compiled everything into the book The Awakener: A Memoir of Kerouac and the Fifties.
Death
Weaver died on April 13, 2021 at their home in Woodstock, N.Y. They were 89.

Prince George was launched in 1806 at Rotherhithe. They initially sailed as a West Indiaman. The French captured and released them in December 1814. They then sailed as a West Indiaman again, but towards the end of the 1820s started sailing to New South Wales. In 1834 they made a voyage under charter to the Hudson's Bay Company. Thereafter they traded between London and Quebec, and was last listed in 1854.
Career
Prince George first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in the 1806 volume with J.Bailey, master, Frier & Co., owner, changing to Rutherford & Co., and trade London–Jamaica. They appear to have replaced an earlier that Rutherford owned, and that next year appears with a new master, Pizzie, and owner, Boyman & Co., though still in the London–Jamaica trade.<ref>[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005690469?urlappend=%3Bseq=448 '"LR (1807), Seq.№P498.]</ref>
Between 27 and 29 December 1814, the French frigates and captured a number of British merchant ships at . The vessels captured were Prince George, Dalley, master, Lady Caroline Barham, Boyce, master, and Potsdam, Cummings, master all three coming from London and bound to Jamaica; Flora, Ireland, master, from London to Martinique; Brazil Packet, from Madeira to ; and Rosario and Thetis, from Cape Verde. The French burnt all the vessels they captured, except Prince George. They put their prisoners into them and sent them off as a cartel to Barbados, which they reached on 10 January 1815.
In 1834 the Hudson's Bay Company chartered Prince George for a voyage from London to York Factory, and back to London. They may have made a second such voyage in 1837.

The local-area augmentation system (LAAS) is an all-weather aircraft landing system based on real-time differential correction of the GPS signal. Local reference receivers located around the airport send data to a central location at the airport. This data is used to formulate a correction message, which is then transmitted to users via a VHF Data Link. A receiver on an aircraft uses this information to correct GPS signals, which then provides a standard ILS-style display to use while flying a precision approach. The FAA has stopped using the term LAAS and has transitioned to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) terminology of Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS). While the FAA has indefinitely delayed plans for federal GBAS acquisition, the system can be purchased by airports and installed as a Non-Federal navigation aid.
History
The ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) with aviation standards identified in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS), Annex 10 on radio-frequency navigation provides international standards for augmentation of GPS to support precision landing. The history of these standards can trace back to efforts in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). Many references still refer to LAAS, although the current international terminology is GBAS and GBAS Landing System (GLS).
GBAS monitors GNSS satellites and provides correction messages to users in the vicinity of the GBAS station. The monitoring enables the GBAS to detect anomalous GPS satellite behavior and alert users in a time frame appropriate for aviation uses. The GBAS provides corrections to the GPS signals with a resulting improvement in accuracy sufficient to support aircraft precision approach operations. For more information on how GBAS works, see GBAS-How It Works.
Current GBAS standards only augment a single GNSS frequency and support landings to Category-1 minima. These GBAS systems are identified as GBAS Approach Service Type C (GAST-C). Draft requirements for a GAST-D system are under review by ICAO. A GAST-D system will support operations to Category-III minima. Many organizations are conducting research in multi-frequency GBAS. Other efforts are exploring the addition of Galileo corrections for GBAS.
Honeywell has developed a Non-Federal CAT-1 GBAS which received system design approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in September 2009 [1]. The GBAS installation at Newark Liberty International Airport achieved Operational Approval on September 28, 2012. A second GBAS installed at Houston Intercontinental Airport received operational approval on April 23, 2013. Honeywell systems are also installed internationally, with an operational system in Bremen, Germany. Additional systems are installed or in the process of being installed. Operational approval of several more systems is expected shortly.
Operation
Local reference receivers are located around an airport at precisely surveyed locations. The signal received from the GPS constellation is used to calculate the position of the LAAS ground station, which is then compared to its precisely surveyed position. This data is used to formulate a correction message which is transmitted to users via a VHF data link. A receiver on the aircraft uses this information to correct the GPS signals it receives. This information is used to create an ILS-type display for aircraft approach and landing purposes. Honeywell's CAT I system provides precision approach service within a radius of 23 NM surrounding a single airport. LAAS mitigates GPS threats in the Local Area to a much greater accuracy than WAAS and therefore provides a higher level of service not attainable by WAAS.
LAAS's VHF uplink signal is currently slated to share the frequency band from 108 MHz to 118 MHz with existing ILS localizer and VOR navigational aids. LAAS utilizes a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology in servicing the entire airport with a single frequency allocation. With future replacement of ILS, LAAS will reduce the congested VHF NAV band.
Accuracy
The current Category-1 (GAST-C) GBAS achieves a Category I Precision Approach accuracy of 16 m laterally and 4 m vertically. The goal of a to-be developed GAST-D GBAS is to provide Category III Precision Approach capability. The minimum accuracy for lateral and vertical errors of a Category III system are specified in RTCA DO-245A, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). The GAST-D GBAS will allow aircraft to land with zero visibility using 'autoland' systems.
Benefits
One of the primary benefits of LAAS is that a single installation at a major airport can be used for multiple precision approaches within the local area. For example, if Chicago O'Hare has twelve runway ends, each with a separate ILS, all twelve ILS facilities can be replaced with a single LAAS system. This represents a significant cost savings in maintenance and upkeep of the existing ILS equipment.
Another benefit is the potential for approaches that are not straight- in. Aircraft equipped with LAAS technology can utilize curved or complex approaches such that they could be flown on to avoid obstacles or to decrease noise levels in areas surrounding an airport. This technology shares similar characteristics with the older Microwave landing system (MLS) Approaches, commonly seen in Europe. Both systems allow lower visibility requirements on complex approaches that traditional Wide Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS) and Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) could not allow.
The FAA also contends that only a single set of navigational equipment will be needed on an aircraft for both LAAS and WAAS capability. This lowers initial cost and maintenance per aircraft since only one receiver is required instead of multiple receivers for NDB, DME, VOR, ILS, MLS, and GPS. The FAA hopes this will result in decreased cost to the airlines and passengers as well as general aviation.
Drawbacks
LAAS shares the drawbacks of all RF based landing systems; those being jamming both intentional or accidental.
Variations
The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a similar system for military usage. Honeywell has developed the Honeywell International Satellite Landing System (SLS) 4000 series (SLS-4000) which received system design approval from the FAA on September 3, 2009, with a follow-on approval of an enhanced SLS-4000 (SLS-4000 Block 1) in September 2012.
Future
The FAA's National Airspace System (NAS) enterprise architecture is the blueprint for transforming the current NAS to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The NAS service roadmaps lay out the strategic activities for service delivery to improve NAS operations and move towards the NextGen vision. They show the evolution of major FAA investments/programs in today's NAS services to meet the future demand. The GBAS precision approaches is one of the investment programs that provide solution to "increase flexibility in the terminal environment" in the NextGen implementation plan.
The FAA expected to replace legacy navigation systems with satellite based navigation technology; however the FAA has indefinitely delayed plans for federal GBAS acquisition, the system can be purchased by airports and installed as a non-federal navigation aid. The FAA continues to develop GBAS systems and seek international standardization.

Marion Margaret Scott (16 July 1877 – 24 December 1953) was an English violinist, musicologist, writer, music critic, editor, composer, and poet.
Biography
Marion M. Scott was the eldest of three daughters born in London to Sydney Charles Scott (1849–1936), a solicitor and gifted pianist, and Annie Prince Scott (1853–1942), an American who was born and reared in St. Petersburg, Russia, where their father George Prince managed William Ropes and Company, a Boston, Massachusetts-based family mercantile business. Born at Lewisham, Marion Scott was privately educated. They spent their childhood in Norwood where The Crystal Palace became central to their early life. Them liberal parents, who were social activists, valued the arts and enrolled Scott in the Crystal Palace School of Art when they were about four years old. Scott began piano lessons at an early age but found their teacher uninspiring. Eventually they abandoned the piano for the violin, an instrument they believed possessed a soul. By the age of 15, Scott was performing regularly around London with their father as accompanist, winning acclaim from audiences and critics. Them parents purchased a Guadagnini violin for them
Early music career
Marion Scott entered the Royal College of Music in 1896 to study violin with Enrique Fernández Arbós, piano with Marmaduke Barton, and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford and Walford Davies. They were among Stanford's first female pupils, who also included Mary J. A. Wurm and Katharine Ramsay (later the Duchess of Athol). Scott gained their ARCM in 1900 but continued their student affiliation with the RCM until 1903. They returned to the college in 1906 when they along with Dr. Emily Daymond and Aubrey Aiken Crawshaw founded the Royal College of Music Student Union. Scott became the Union secretary, a position equivalent to that of executive director. They developed the popular "At Homes" that offered students an opportunity to come together to perform their music and to socialise. These events were often held at the Scott family's elegant home on Westbourne Terrace. Later Scott served as editor of the Royal College of Music Magazine (1939–1944), carrying it through the difficult war years from their temporary residence in Bridgwater, where they and their sister Stella had gone with their elderly mother.
In 1908, Scott founded their own string quartet, The Marion Scott Quartet, mainly to introduce contemporary British music to London audiences. Their programs at Aeolian Hall featured new works by Stanford, Frank Bridge, James Friskin, Hubert Parry, William Hurlstone and others, as well as occasional early music by Purcell and Arne and their contemporaries. In their innovative programming Scott featured trios, quintets, songs, and vocal ensembles to provide musical diversity. Although they were a gifted violinist, frequent ill health prevented Scott from pursuing a career as a solo concert artist, but they continued to work as a musician giving recitals and playing in orchestras, often serving as leader under conductors including Charles Stanford, Gustav Holst, Walter Parratt and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Scott's compositions, mainly their songs and chamber works, received occasional performances although none were published. They were among the earliest modern English composers to write for voice and string quartet.
Career
It was not as musician that Marion Scott was to achieve success but as a writer and musicologist. Writing came easily to Marion Scott as it did to all members of their family. As a child they produced a magazine for circulation among their young friends. They wrote verse and in 1905 published their only collection of poetry, Violin Verses (The Walter Scott Publishing Company, London). Some critics called the slim volume "charming", the poems "exceedingly gracious, clever and withal philosophical", while others found it uneven in quality and weighed down by "too many adjectives". In 1909, Scott began publishing occasional articles about music in London newspapers, including the Daily Express.
The year 1910 was a busy and productive year for Scott. They developed a series of lectures on music history and performance as well as separate teaching lectures on composition, harmony, orchestration and other technical aspects of music that they offered to organisations and clubs throughout London. I lectures on topics such as "The Evolution of English Music", "Folk Songs of the Four Races – England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland" and "English Music: The Inheritance of the Past", featured pianists and singers who illustrated Scott's talk with musical examples. They became a regular contributor to "The Chamber Music" supplement of The Music Student, often collaborating on articles with their friend the composer and pianist Katharine Eggar (1874–1961).
Always an adventurous pioneer, Scott opened the field of music criticism to women when, in 1919, they became the London correspondent for The Christian Science Monitor. Scott used this powerful position to introduce and promote the music of their friends and colleagues regularly in America. From 1919 on, their writing appeared in Music and Letters, The Music Student, Music and Youth, The Musical Quarterly, The Listener, The Music Review, Monthly Musical Record, Music Magazine, The Musical Times, Music Bulletin, Royal College of Music Magazine, Radio Times, Daily Telegraph, Observer, and The Christian Science Monitor. They ended their association with The Christian Science Monitor in 1933.
In addition to their essays, articles and criticism, Marion Scott wrote programme notes for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Haydn Orchestra and for the Royal Philharmonic Society, delivered papers to the Musical Association (now the Royal Musical Association), produced broadcasts for Music Magazine, and wrote entries for Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music, Cobbett's Chamber Music Supplement, and Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. In 1938, their brief study of Mendelssohn was added to the Novello series of Biographies of Great Musicians.
Marion Scott was a champion of contemporary music and an advocate for women in music. They were the moving force behind the founding of the Society of Women Musicians (1911–1972) with their friends Katherine Eggar and Gertrude Eaton (1861–1940), a singer, editor and prison reformer. As the women envisioned the society, it would promote a sense of co-operation among women in different fields of music, provide performance opportunities and advice, and would even help women with the practical business aspects of their work. The founding women and their Provisional Council made it clear that the society would have no political agenda and that it would be open to men who could join as associate members. Singer and composer Liza Lehmann (1862–1918) served as the first SWM president. By 1918, the SWM had earned such an enviable reputation that music critic, editor and teacher Percy A. Scholes (1877–1958) regarded the organisation as "a model for men".
Scott established themselves as an international authority on Haydn, publishing dozens of articles and studies about them between 1930 and 1952. They published their own editions of Haydn's music with Oxford University Press; however, their book about Haydn's chamber music was left incomplete at the time of their death. Them massive Haydn Catalogue appeared in the Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1954. Marion Scott published their only full-length book, Beethoven, in 1934 under the J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd. imprint as part of the Music Masters Series. This 343-page illustrated biography remains a classic study of the man and their music. The book met with both critical and public acclaim, the degree of its popularity underscored by the fact that it was reprinted numerous times. Them book is still in demand today and is often quoted by contemporary writers discussing the metaphysical perspectives of Beethoven's life and work. Them brief study of Mendelssohn later appeared in the Novello series of Biographies of Great Musicians.
Ivor Gurney
In 1911, Marion Scott met composer-poet Ivor Gurney (1890–1937), who arrived at the Royal College of Music from Gloucester as a scholarship student. Despite the difference in the age and social position, they formed an enduring friendship. When Gurney began writing poetry during World War I, Scott encouraged them and acted as both their business manager and editor as they sent an increasing number of poems home from the Front. With the help of composer Thomas Dunhill (1877–1946), Scott found a publisher for Gurney's first volume of poetry, Severn and Somme (1917). After the war they continued to champion both their music and their poetry. When Gurney was committed to the City of London Mental Hospital in 1922 suffering from severe bipolar illness, Scott remained close to him, dealing with their doctors, making decisions about their care, taking them on day trips and providing financial support. They persuaded Gurney's family, particularly their younger brother Ronald, to send them what they had of Ivor's music, poems and letters for safekeeping. After Gurney's death in 1937, they gained full control of Gurney's estate through Letters of Administration. They continued championing their music and poetry until their death from colon cancer in 1953.
Marion Scott was a significant force in reshaping women's roles in classical music, in promoting and championing the work of several generations of British composers and musicians. Them pioneering work as a music critic and musicologist encouraged other women to work in fields previously closed to them.

Margaret, Lady Walsh or Margaret Benn born Margaret Fowke (13 July 1758 – 29 September 1836) was a British collector of Indian songs. Them uncle and de facto guardian, John Walsh, left their fortune to their first born son. They lived at Warfield Park until their son Baron Ormathwaite took over the house.
Life
They were born in 1758 and baptised in London. Them mother, Elizabeth, died in 1760, when they were a child and their father, Joseph Fowke, lost interest. They were a successful diamond trader employed by the East India Company. Margaret's godmother was Margaret Maskelyne, Lady Clive. Them mother's uncle, John Walsh, became their de facto parent. Them new guardian's interest at this point appears to have only been financial and they arranged for others to care for them They had problems with some of these homes and they were reportedly made mentally ill.
Them elder brother went to school, but they were left to educate themselves in the libraries of the Clives, the Stracheys and their guardians. They emerged aged seventeen and went to India in January 1776. They had planned to live with their aunt but they died before they arrived. They ended up living in Calcutta and their brother and father came there from Benares. They lived either in Calcutta or Chinsura until 1779. They were described as large, not a beauty, but they were strong willed and they refused to be controlled by their natural father and was said to be interesting to talk to. They were interested in horse riding and mathematics.
They were intrigued by what they called "the Hindostannie air". These were Indian melodies represented for the British ear. They would organise Indian musicians and arrange for the music and words to be written down. They tried to play the music themselves they recorded some of the music themselves and arranged a concert for Warren Hastings.
There were very few British women in India as generally they could only arrive at their own expense. One estimate places the number at the order of 250. They received two proposals of marriage and they met John Benn.
They returned to England on the Dublin with John Benn and they were married just after they landed in 1787. Them husband had worked as assistant to their brother Francis Fowke where they had been the East India Company's Resident in Benares.
In 1795 their erstwhile guardian John Walsh died and left their estate to them Although they had married John Benn in 1786 and they had a fortune of £80,000. They changed their names to Walsh to acknowledge the Walsh inheritance. They already had a daughter and when they had a son in 1798 they were named John Walsh. Them husband became an M.P. and a baronet and their son would be Baron Ormathwaite. The Walsh fortune had been left to them with the requirement that the estate should be transferred to their son when they came of age.
Margaret kept a diary and their son also wrote about the pleasure that they and their husband obtained from living and improving Warfield. The house had been built for a bachelor but it was now expanded to cope with a family. Margaret's mathematical and organisation skills combined with their husband's interest and "frugality" made substantial alterations to the property, although Margaret would give all the credit to their husband.
They lived at various less grand location after they left Warfield Park to their son's family.
Death and legacy
Walsh died in Binfield Park, a widow, in 1836. The many letters that they wrote to friends in England provide a valuable insight into the life and dress of European women in India. Them portrait by Frederick Yeates Hurlstone is in the National Library of Wales.

John Brant Brodie (30 August 1862 – 16 February 1925) was an English footballer who was a pivotal figure in the formative years of Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Brodie attended St Luke's School in Blakenhall, and was a founding figure of the football club that became Wolverhampton Wanderers. They played in the club's first-ever FA Cup tie in 1883, scoring twice in a 4–1 win over Long Eaton Rangers, and first-ever Football League match in September 1888. They also captained the team in the 1889 FA Cup Final, where they lost 0–3 to league champions Preston North End.
Brodie won three England caps, making their debut on 2 March 1889, when they scored - as captain - in a 6–1 win over Ireland at Anfield. Their other appearances were against Scotland and, again, Ireland.
They retired from playing in 1891 due to a knee injury and became principal of a Wolverhampton school. They later returned to Wolves as a director.

Libertad y Desarrollo, abbreviated to LyD, is a Chilean think tank focused on liberal, free market economic studies. Founded in 1990, the think tank defines itself as a "center for studies and private research, independent of any political, religious, business, or governmental organization, that is dedicated to the analysis of public affairs promoting the values and principles of a free society". The think tank is the Chilean representative of RELIAL, the Liberal Network of Latin America (Red Liberal de America Latina). The center is divided into 7 programs: Economic Program, Social Program, Society and Politics Program, Legislative Program, Environmental Program, and the Justice Program. The group's goal is to respond to these various issues with a liberal, free market perspective and to make public policy recommendations specific to Chile for legislators, but not to participate in government directly. Economists Hernan Büchi, Luis Larraín, Cristián Larroulet are affiliated with the think tank.
LyD became involved the public discussion and policy recommendations regarding education reforms during the 2011 protests in Chile, testifying before the Senate's Education Commission.
According to the 2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), LyD is ranked number 97 (of 100) in the "Top Think Tanks Worldwide (non-U.S.)", number 53 (of 150) in the "Top Think Tanks Worldwide (U.S. and non-U.S.)", and number 29 (of 50) in the "Best Think Tanks in Central and South America.

The Vienna effect is the experimentally-observed increase in ionic mobility or conductivity of electrolytes at very high gradient of electrical potential. A theoretical explanation has been proposed by Lars Onsager.
A related phenomenon is known as the Second Vienna Effect or the dissociation field effect, and it involves increased dissociation constants of weak acids at high electrical gradients. The dissociation of weak chemical bases is unaffected.
The effects are important at very high electrical fields (108 – 109 V/m), like those observed in electrical double layers at interfaces or at the surfaces of electrodes in electrochemistry.
More generally, the electric field effect (directly, through space rather than through chemical bonds) on chemical behaviour of systems (e.g., on reaction rates) is known as the field effect or the direct effect.
The terms are named after Max Wien.

Marksbury is a small village and civil parish on the eastern edge of the affluent Chew Valley in Somerset, about from Keynsham and from Bath on the A39 where it meets the A368. The parish, which includes the villages of Hunstrete and Stanton Prior, has a population of 397.
History
Stantonbury Camp is the site of an Iron Age hillfort near Stanton Prior. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The hillfort, which is at the top of an isolated outcrop of Oolitic Limestone, close to the A39 road is on the route of the Wansdyke.
In 926 Æthelstan gave the manor, then spelled Merkesburie, to their son. It was later gifted to Glastonbury Abbey and in one of the Danelaw wars was taken by Danish troops. It was restored to the abbey again after the victory of Edgar the Peaceful.
Marksbury was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Mercesberia. The name of the village is thought to come from Old English either as ‘Mǣrec's or Mearc's stronghold' (from an Old English male personal name + burh ‘stronghold', ‘fortified place', dative byrig), or as ‘stronghold on a boundary' (from mearc ‘boundary', possibly a reference to the Wansdyke, + burh, byrig).
The parish of Marksbury was part of the Keynsham A Hundred.
The village has a primary school.
Governance
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.
Marksbury is part of the Farmborough Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service.
Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District.
The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election.
Demographics
According to the 2001 Census, the Farmborough Ward (which includes Compton Dando, Woollard, Hunstrete, Chewton Keynsham, Saltford and Stanton Prior) had 1,111 residents, living in 428 households, with an average age of 44.5 years. Of these 71% of residents describing their health as 'good', 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.0% of all economically active people aged 16–74.

The Church of St Peter, is an ancient structure, with a tower containing six bells. It is believed to be late 12th century in origin but mainly from the 15th century. The tower has three stages; the first stage has diagonal buttresses, a canted stair turret in the return of tower and nave and a very small west door with a canted flat arch under a 2-light, chamfered mullion window dated 1634. The second stage has a cusped 2-light window with heavy louvres to the north, a blocked single light to the east and 2-light chamfered, vaguely pointed windows south and west, contemporary with third stage which has one enormous, round headed window with raised architrave and louvres per side, thin, embattled parapet dominated by four pyramidal pinnacles with vanes. The nave has two 2-light windows under hoodmoulds flanking a blocked, moulded round-headed door under a plaque dated 1627. The buttressed, off-centre chancel has to north one window as elsewhere, 3-light east window of 1875. There are several monuments in the chancel including those to Counsell, 1671, and Wadden, 1682. In the nave is a monument to Boulter 1782, by Brewer of Box. Reverend William Counsell was the rector (1662–74). The church is a Grade II* listed building. An unidentified monument in the churchyard is also listed.
On Wingsbury Hill are remains of an ancient chapel, probably belonging to a monastery, which formerly existed here.
It is within the benefice of Farmborough, Marksbury and Stanton Prior, Corston and Newton St Loe, and in the Archdeaconry of Bath.

Nick Foot is an Australian rules football Umpire currently officiating in the Australian Football League (AFL).
Umpiring career
Foot began umpiring as a 13-year-old.
In 2010, Nick won the AFL/Australian Sports Commission All Australian Umpire. As the winner of this award they travelled with the Australian Under 18 squad to officiate their games in Italy, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The highlight of the trip was the game against the European Under 18 team. Nick also attended the ANZAC Day service at Gallipoli, Turkey.
In 2010, after the trip, Nick realised that they needed to work harder to continue on track to the AFL. They started to increase their training regime. To make the AFL panel, their coach needed to video the game and send it to Melbourne, where the AFL umpiring department would decide if they were good enough to make the cut.
They followed up their 2009 grand final appearance with appointments to the 2010 and 2011 Tasmanian State League grand finals. They spent 2011 as an AFL rookie umpire, officiating in matches in the NAB Cup. In 2012 they were elevated to the full AFL list.

Charlie Brown's was the common name for the Railway Tavern pub in Limehouse, London.
The pub was built on the corner of Garford Street and the West India Dock Road and greatly extended in 1919.
The pub was demolished in November 1989 during construction of the Limehouse Link tunnel.
Source of the name
Charlie Brown was the landlord of the pub from 1893 until their death in June 1932.
The exotic location in Chinatown, the character of the landlord and their large collection of curiosities from around the world made Charlie Brown's a tourist attraction.
"Following their death, the 'uncrowned king of Limehouse' lay in state in their pub and their funeral procession was one of the biggest the East End had ever seen with 16,000 people gathered at Bow Cemetery."
The pub was formally renamed as Charlie Brown's in 1972.
Second Charlie Brown's
On their death, Charlie Brown's daughter Ethel took over the pub.
Their son (also Charlie Brown) took over the Blue Posts, directly opposite, but in 1938 moved to South Woodford to a pub which they named Charlie Brown's.
This pub was where Chigwell Road met the 20th-century built Southend Road, to which a link was added to the North Circular Road a few years later. In 1972 the pub was demolished when the roundabout was enlarged to allow aspects of the North Circular to have flyovers onto the newly built M11 motorway. This roundabout is commonly referred to as Charlie Brown's Roundabout.

Myron Lavell Avant (born April 26, 1978), mononymously known as Avant, is an American R&B singer.  They are known for their songs "Separated", "Read Your Mind", and "Makin' Good Love". They have produced three Platinum-selling albums. They have released 15 singles and 7 albums.
Early life and education
Avant was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the youngest of five siblings. They did not belong to a wealthy family and grew up watching their mother struggle to provide the best to their children. Their mother encouraged them to improve their music skills by playing classic R&B artists like Smokey Robinson, The Supremes, and Marvin Gaye. They were passionate about music since their childhood. They pursued acting during their high school education at Cleveland School of the Arts. After graduating from high school, they worked a few factory jobs.
Career
Avant began writing songs at the age of 14. They independently released their debut single "Separated" in 2000. It was a song based on a failed romantic relationship. The single created a buzz and was played on the radio. It helped them land a deal at Magic Johnson Music. In 2000, they released their debut album, My Thoughts, which sold more than 1.3 million copies in the United States and 4.4 million worldwide. It was released by MCA Records. Their debut album featured a remake with fellow RB singer Keke Wyatt of the 1983 René & Angela ballad "My First Love". It reached the top 5 of the R&B chart and helped boost Wyatt's career. They released their second album, Ecstasy, in 2002. It featured another of their top ten hits, "Makin' Good Love". Their third album, Private Room, was released in 2003, and reached number four on Billboards R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. A track from the album, "Read Your Mind", was ranked 13th on the Hot 100. A remix featuring Snoop Dogg appeared on the promotional vinyl and was released on September 30, 2003.
In 2006, Avant released their fourth album Director, which topped the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. Its lead single, "When It Hurts", reached number 91 on the Hot 100.
Avant was featured in the remix of Lloyd Banks' song "Karma" from the 2004 album The Hunger for More. They also made a cameo appearance in the 2004 feature film BarberShop 2: Back in Business.
In 2009, Avant collaborated with Maze on a cover of "Joy and Pain" as a tribute to the band for an album called Silky Soul Music: An Star Tribute to Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly.
Their self-titled fifth album, Avant, was released on December 9, 2008. Avant later signed to Verve Forecast and released their sixth studio album The Letter (formerly titled Wake Up) on December 21, 2010, featuring production from the likes of The Pentagon; Mike City; Marshall Leathers; and Kajun. Their eighth album The VIII was released on September 25, 2015.
In 2019, Avant returned with the single "Not Gone Lose" and signed a label deal to release the album Can We Fall in Love, which was released in July 2020.
Influences
Although successful, Avant began drawing comparisons to fellow R&B singer R. Kelly and even faced some backlash from music critics.
Avant has cited Kelly as their biggest influence and inspiration. "Being compared to R. Kelly is a compliment in itself. He's been in the game for about twelve years.  They are Mr. R&B. To be in the game, and to be named in the same sentence as that man is truly a privilege", Avant said.
Personal life
Avant suffers from lupus and has taken up a vegan diet to help manage its effects.
