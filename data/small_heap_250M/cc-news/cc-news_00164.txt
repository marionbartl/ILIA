A senior DUP figure has queried what the point of a new election would be since Sinn Fein are showing little interest in actually governing.
However, Jeffrey Donaldson added that direct rule seems more likely than another ballot, as the Province awaits the post-Easter resumption of political negotiations.
This view was echoed by Tom Elliott of the UUP, who said other parties had “no enthusiam” for the idea of sending the public back to the polls only around two months after the last Assembly election.
Mr Donaldson, DUP MP for Lagan Valley, said: “We can't rule out the possibility of another election and if there is one the DUP will engage and we will be out to win.
“The reality is an election won't resolve any of the issues.
“They can only be resolved through negotiation and if Sinn Fein aren't prepared to negotiate, then most people will conclude ‘what is the point in having another election?'
“I think the more likely outcome is direct rule, but clearly that's a decision for the government.”
There has been a break in talks between the Stormont parties over the Easter period.
Negotiations to try to resolve the deadlock are set to resume on Wednesday.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has said he will either trigger an election or move to a return to Westminster decision-making if there is no deal by “early May”.
He said the rhetoric of Sinn Fein in recent days does not bode well for the restoration of the devolved institutions.
On Sunday, Sinn Fein's leader in the north, Michelle O'Neill, told her party's Easter Rising commemoration in Dublin that Brexit has placed Irish unity back on the political agenda.
And party president Gerry Adams told an Easter Rising commemoration in Co Tyrone that direct rule was not an option and that another snap Assembly election was the only way to proceed if negotiations do not deliver agreement.
Mr Donaldson said: “We have made it clear, we're ready to form a government today without preconditions. But Sinn Fein evidently are not.
“If we do return to direct rule, Sinn Fein will have to explain to their voters why they would prefer to be ruled from Westminster than to have a government.”
Mr Elliott, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said: “I see no enthusiasm for an election from anyone except Sinn Fein, not from any of the parties or government.
“Most people are saying they see no point in one, except Sinn Fein. I expect we will probably see direct rule by stealth.”
He expects to see legislation shortly to facilitate rates collection, the setting of a budget, and to allow the Stormont departments to take decisions necessary to their continued running.

CALOUNDRA'S Allan 'Alfie' Langer is officially the next in line for a statue outside Suncorp Stadium.
The Queensland Rugby League has written to the State Government requesting the 'Little General' be immortalised in bronze.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said cabinet had discussed the idea and thought it appropriate.
"We will be in further discussions with the QRL about making that a reality," she said.
"It might happen in time for (next week's) State of Origin."
He would join greats of the game Wally Lewis, Darren Lockyer, Mal Meninga and Arthur Beetson.
Langer played 258 games for the Broncos between 1988-99 and 2002, and was one of the best halfbacks of the 1990s.
In a decade of dominance he won four premierships with the all-conquering Broncos.
It comes after several weeks of campaigning by the Daily.
An average 16.5 million people watched the game - the biggest TV audience in 2018 so far.
England's World Cup win over Colombia was watched by an average 16.5 million people, with the audience peaking at 24.4 million, ITV has said.
The figures are the highest for any World Cup match so far this year.
England's previous games attracted an average audience of 13.7 million (against Tunisia), 9.9 million (Panama) and 13.0 million (Belgium).
ITV's coverage of the Colombia match is now the most-watched TV programme of 2018.
The audience peak of 24.2 million came at 9.52pm, when Eric Dier scored England's winning penalty.
At this point roughly four in five people watching TV in the UK (81%) were tuned to ITV.
When the full ratings are published – which will include those who recorded and watched up to seven days later – the overall average is likely to rank as one of the top 10 TV audiences for an England World Cup game.
The biggest-ever audience is 25.2 million, for England's semi-final against West Germany in 1990.

Emmerdale actor hits back after trolls accuse him of 'looking homeless'
By Emma Gritt
James Moore plays Charity Dingle's long lost son Ryan in Emmerdale - but people don't like his hair.
Emmerdale newcomer James Moore has told fans to focus on his acting, not his hair.
The actor, who plays Ryan Stocks, joined the ITV soap at the end of May as Charity Dingle's long lost son and is a key player in one of the most hard hitting storylines in the history of the show.
Viewers have discovered that Charity gave birth to him after being raped at the age of 14 by a corrupt policeman, but had spent the last 27 years believing that he had died.

However, it seems some people are more preoccupied with the star's hair than his on screen presence - and he's not impressed.
He tweeted: "To everyone who has commented about my hair, or my style- I think someone said I looked homeless - maybe you should be focusing more on the plot and less on superficialities. Acting isn't a beauty contest."

Fans were quick to show their support, with one replying: "Well said. The world would be a very boring place if we all looked and dressed the same. You look great. Jealous and shallow people out there. Love your attitude."
Another added: "Seriously?! Firstly your hair is amazing anyway (talk about goals), and secondly it's completely irrelevant to the incredible work you're doing on screen. If people have an issue with that it's their problem!"

BERLIN (AP) — Germany's foreign minister says Poland can rely on his country to condemn distortions of history such as descriptions of Nazi camps in occupied Poland as "Polish concentration camps."
A proposed new law in Poland would outlaw publicly and falsely attributing Nazi Germany's crimes in World War II to the Polish nation. The U.S. has joined Israel in criticizing it, saying it would impact free expression.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Saturday: "This organized mass murder was carried out by our country and no one else. Individual collaborators change nothing about that."
Gabriel added: "We are convinced that only carefully appraising our own history can bring reconciliation. That includes people who had to experience the intolerable suffering of the Holocaust being able to speak unrestrictedly about this suffering."

Shock has been expressed at the lenient sentence given to a woman with 100 previous convictions responsibile for the horrific death of a Co Antrim pensioner.
Margaret Henderson-McCarroll, 31, was sentenced to six years – three of which will be served in prison – after she pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 67-year-old Eddie Girvan who was stabbed, gagged and bound at his Greenisland home in January 2016.
The prosecution accepted her guilty plea to the manslaughter on the grounds of “diminished responsibilty” with the defence arguing that at the time of the killing she was high on drugs.
Roy Beggs, MLA for East Antrim, said he was shocked at the short sentence handed down after such a brutal death.
He said: “It strikes me as being a lenient sentence and I will be reviewing to see what action I can take to encourage a reassessment of the sentence. An appeal would most definitely be welcomed.
“Given her large number of previous convictions and the horrendous way in which Eddie died I don't feel a sufficient sentence has been awarded.”
When asked to justify the sentence made yesterday by Mr Justice Treacy, the Office of the Lord Chief Justice responded: “In calculating the appropriate sentence for the offence, the judge will have considered a range of factors which depend on the specific circumstances of each case.
“These include the seriousness of the offence, the offender's previous convictions, aggravating and mitigating factors, whether the offender pleaded guilty and at what stage in the process, the relevant law including the maximum sentence which the court can impose and any sentencing guidelines relevant to the offence committed.”
The PPS confirmed it “may consider if there is a basis to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that it may be unduly lenient”.

Aston Viilla chairman Tony Xia has admitted that Aston Villa need to make widespread changes after failing to win promotion back to the Premier League.
The owner issued a statement this evening to explain that there will be a different approach next season as Villa embark on a third season in the Championship.
This is what he said in full:
"I know that all the Villa fans experienced a very frustrating and disappointing Play-Off Final last Saturday.
"After seeing many Villa supporters on Twitter hoping that I can publish a statement as soon as possible, I feel like it would be best for me to write the following words when I am relatively calm.
"I care as much about this club as anyone.
"Even though I am back in Beijing, I still can't recover from our game at Wembley.
"The emotion needs time to heal.
"However, I know that all our management staff, coaches, players and myself need to get back on our feet and prepare to fight again.
"Like everyone else, I'm delighted to see that under Steve's management this season, we demonstrated character and unity.
"We fought like a team.
"Indeed, the loss is a pity, but we know how much effort and hard work our coaching staff and players put in this season.
"I want to thank Steve from the bottom of my heart, particularly for his remarkable level of professional focus despite losing his parents this year.
"With that, I would like to say thank you to Steve and his coaching staff once again for leading the team forward wholeheartedly throughout the season.
"We are all aware that we will face severe FFP challenges next season.
"I am an Aston Villa fan. But I am also a businessman. Under the current circumstances, I think the club needs to rethink not only the past two years but also the past ten years.
"Villa needs to be a sustainable football club. People join. People leave.
"That is the cycle of football.
"But the football club always remains through it all.
"This is the ultimate reality that cannot be changed, but I can assure you that everyone behind the scenes is working tirelessly towards achieving our ultimate goal.
"We have been heavily investing for the past two seasons.
"However, the loss on Saturday means that we need to change a lot of things.
"No one wanted to see the club have to go through this, but I believe that only changes can help the club to progress towards the positive direction and this requires the joint efforts of everyone associated with this great football club.
"No matter what the changes will be, I sincerely hope that everyone can unite and overcome the challenges together.
"Our goal has not changed and as long as we believe, regardless of how tough the process will be, I am sure we will succeed in the end.
"Thank you very much once again for all your support.
Chairman Dr Tony Xia "
Black hole
Aston Villa will need to find around £40m-£45m from player sales and wage cuts to fall in line with Financial Fair Play, Birmingham Live understands.
A football finance expert has explained how Villa's failure to win promotion back to the Premier League this term has left them seriously counting the cost this summer.
The claret and blues may have to sell prized asset Jack Grealish to cover costs and there's no chance of turning any of the loan signings into permanent deals.
"The FFP black hole is between £40m and £45m," a source told us.
"Villa have gambled with expensive players on big wages but there will need to be a reality check this summer."
Boss Steve Bruce admitted that cuts will need to be made.
When asked if players would be sold, Bruce replied:
"Yes.
"This season has been difficult, financially.
“We understand, or I have understood, about Financial Fair Play.
"But the discussions will need to be held above me to say what we have or haven't got."
The powers-that-be are in the process of holding those talks.
Saturday's defeat against Fulham in the play-off final is still very raw but the club are starting to moving forward.
These things take time, of course, and more will be revealed in the times ahead as Villa come to terms with another season in the Championship.
Elsewhere, a report was also published today by Swiss Ramble - a business & football blog- which highlighted some of the problems Villa are facing up to.
Meanwhile another expert says Aston Villa's predicament is ‘really severe' and has predicted sales this summer.
Villa were resigned to a third successive season of Championship football with defeat at Wembley.
Bruce's expensively-assembled squad is now expected to be broken up this summer as the club desperately attempt to stay within Financial Fair Play restrictions.
The club's most valuable asset, Grealish, is already being linked with a host of Premier League sides with Villa likely to sell at least one of their top players.
Kieran Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, discussed Villa's problems at length with the BBC.
Cash cuts
“It's really severe for Villa because this is the second year they've had parachute payments. They got around £35million from the Premier League to cushion the blow of relegation.
“Those payments get cut back severely next year so they're going to have £20million less coming in. I think the problem for Villa is that the owner has gambled in the last couple of years on recruiting players on big wages.
Aston Villa shunned by midfielder as promotion failure sees club 'lose some appeal' - reports
Colossal wage bill
“The average wage at Villa is nearly £30,000 a week and it's simply not sustainable in the Championship.
“It's going to be a very big summer. They're going to have to sell the crown jewels, I suspect. The problem that they're going to have is that other clubs know they're in a financial pickle and they'll be trying to get them on the cheap.
“If you take a look at their first season in the Championship, they were losing around £800,000 a week, and that was on parachute payments of around £40million.
“Next season it's down to around about £15million so there's got to be severe cutbacks. I'd be very surprised if John Terry stays because he would have been on a decent wage.
“Scott Hogan has been disappointing and I've seen his contract, and that's eye-watering. Ross McCormack has been a disaster since day one.
“The problem is that no other clubs will go near these players. They might manage to get them out on loan and Villa will probably still have to pay 80 per cent of the wages just to get them away from the club.
Aston Villa transfer 'compulsory' regardless of division - says club chief
Decision time
"Then you have the owner, who's based in China – he's going to have to work out whether he continues to bankroll the club to the same extent.
“There are a lot of alarm bells going round and that's when the vultures start to crowd and pick off things on the cheap, and that will be the big shame for Villa because they do have some good players.
“If they want to play in the Premier League then fair play to them, but I think it's whether or not they'll be able to get a fair price for them which will be the big worry for Villa fans.”
Assessing the summer
Aston Villa's worst nightmare has become a reality and testing times lie ahead.
The books were balanced, to an extent, last summer by manager Steve Bruce as several players departed to boost the coffers.
Ex-England and Chelsea captain John Terry, Glenn Whelan, Ahmed Elmohamady and Chris Samba were all handed lucrative contracts with the funds raised and Bruce utilised his contacts book to snap up three players on loan.
With five players out of contract, five loanees to return to their parent clubs, six players set to return from loan spells away and lots more to be decided, this is the most important summer transfer window in Aston Villa's 144-year history.
Dr Tony Xia cut a glum figure as Sky Sports' cameras zoned in on him during the latter stages of Villa's play-off final defeat to Fulham.
It hasn't panned out the way the Chinese businessman planned after buying out Randy Lerner two years ago.
Xia and his trusted Villa Park colleagues face some big decisions this summer.
Who leads Villa?
The first big decision Xia, chief executive Keith Wyness and director of football Steve Round have to make centres around manager Steve Bruce.
By his own admission Bruce has failed to achieve what was asked of him this term.
The manager has previously hinted that he ‘won't be here next year' if promotion wasn't achieved.
Meanwhile, during a meeting with Villa supporters' groups, neither Wyness nor Round committed to keeping Bruce on as manager in the event of Wembley failure.
With four Championship promotions on his CV and an enviable queue of Premier League managers willing to do him favours, Bruce has all the skills Villa require.
“I will roll my sleeves up and get stuck into it again next season as long as the people above me see that I'm fit to do it,” Bruce said of his future in the immediate aftermath of Villa's Wembley woe. “I will carry on.
“I've been doing it for a long time and I'm in charge of a great club with a big history and tradition.”
With Bruce apparently intent on giving promotion another crack, the ball is firmly in the Villa hierarchy's court.
CNRP set to make gains during recounts
The Cambodia National Rescue Party looks set to gain two communes, one in Battambang and another Kampong Thom, after a recount of ballots at the National Election Committee (NEC) yesterday.
The NEC counted ballots in nine out of 16 polling stations from Battambang's Boeung Pram commune, as well as ballots from a station from Kampong Thom's Kleng commune. While the ruling CPP had asked for a recount in the former, the opposition filed the request contesting the Kleng result.
The day started with Boeung Pram commune, with proceedings decidedly less hostile than the recount for Svay Rieng's Doung commune, which took place on Monday. Observers from both parties and election officials crowded around tables in two separate rooms as the counting officer proceeded to tally the ballots.
While preliminary election results leaned in the CPP's favour, 631 votes to the CNRP's 608, a recount at the provincial level reversed the results putting the CNRP ahead with 771 to 704 ballots.
Yesterday's recount ended with the CNRP ahead at 776 and CPP at 707, handing the commune chief position to the CNRP.
The CPP proceeded to ask the nine-member NEC to deliberate on the validity of 10 disputed ballots, but CNRP official Suon Chamreoun said the 10 ballots would not affect the final results.
Following the Boeung Pram count, officials and party members shifted focus to the one polling station up for recount in Kleng commune. While the recount proceeded smoothly, things quickly got contentious as the tally started to narrow.
The initial count on June 4 gave the CPP a slim one-ballot lead – 832-831 – the result remained unchanged when challenged by the CNRP at the provincial level.
The polling station recounted by the NEC yesterday, however, brought the total commune tally to 837 to 835 in the CNRP's favour. Upon hearing the result, CPP officials started to file complaints over the validity of votes, leading to the CNRP filing its own complaints.
However, NEC spokesman Hang Puthea said the body had decided on all the complaints and the result stood as is. “The result is final that the CNRP has won both of the communes,” he said last evening.
Puthea said the NEC had dealt with 26 of the 49 complaints it had received. “But not all are recounts, and some complaints have been rejected,” he said.
Meng Sopheary, the CNRP's head of election affairs, said the body needed to reform the procedures for deeming a ballot invalid, saying the will of the voter should be respected.
While the CNRP had filed 32 complaints, Sopheary said the election body should investigate Phnom Penh's Orussey 4 commune, where there were more ballots in the boxes than actual voters, and a village chief had been assigned as election observer.
Best Fish Sandwiches In MinnesotaA breaded, deep fried rectangular patty made from white meat fish such as cod or pollock, the fish sandwich, or fishwich, came into its own as a burger when introduced at McDonald's in 1962. Since then, the fish sandwich has become a lunch and dinner favorite. If you favor the local catch, try a walleye fish sandwich.
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Shares of Eli Lilly and Co. climbed early Tuesday after the drugmaker hiked its 2018 forecast and reported first-quarter earnings that beat expectations.
The insulin maker said it now expects adjusted earnings to range from $5.10 to $5.20 per share, with revenue coming in between $23.7 billion and $24.2 billion. That's up from the company's previous forecast for adjusted earnings of $4.81 to $4.91 per share on revenue of $23 billion to $23.5 billion.
Analysts forecast, on average, earnings of $4.88 per share on $23.43 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.
Lilly reported first-quarter net income of $1.22 billion, after booking a $110.8 million loss in last year's quarter.

On a per-share basis, the Indianapolis-based company said earnings, adjusted for asset impairment costs, came to $1.34 per share.
Those results also exceeded the average expectation on Wall Street, which was $1.13 per share, according to Zacks Investment Research.
The drugmaker posted revenue of $5.7 billion in the period, also beating Street forecasts. Four analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $5.53 billion.
Lilly shares gained $1.35 to $81.55 before markets opened Tuesday. The stock had fallen 5 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has stayed nearly flat.

I fully support building a much-needed track and improving the field at Freeport High School, but will vote against the current version of the project. I've researched the costs and health and safety concerns. I've met with some of the track and turf project members, and a member of the high school renovation advisory committee.
Synthetic turf companies promote the costs on a “per-use” basis as a way to hide the true costs. Installing natural grass instead of synthetic turf could save at least $350,000.
Maintenance costs of synthetic turf are also often understated. Nike Grind will be excellent for the running track around the infield, but it is expensive when used as field infill and is reported to be similar in composition to crumb rubber.
The replacement cost of synthetic turf after 10 years is about $600,000. The need to dispose of 40,000 pounds of old polypropylene turf and 400,000 pounds of infill is environmentally irresponsible.
Concussions, torn ACLs, turf burns and infections are a problem. Mainly due to player concerns over injuries, the Baltimore Ravens football team recently ripped up their synthetic turf field and replaced it with natural grass.
Fireworks and sparklers burn at 2000 degrees and could easily damage synthetic turf.
The high school renovation money is not really “extra” money, but is a contingency fund for the school renovation, and may be needed for furniture.
Recommendation: Immediately consult sports field design engineers to change to natural grass, and vote on the change before the end of January.

Telecommunications provider Two Degrees Mobile lifted net profit 33 per cent in 2017, with revenue gains outpacing costs and the bottom line boosted by tax credits.
Net profit rose to $19 million in the year ended December 31, from $14.3m in 2016, on a 4.3 per cent revenue gain to $732.7m. Expenses excluding finance costs rose 4.1 per cent to $665.4m, while the company cut finance costs 10.5 per cent to $25.8m in the year.
Two Degrees benefited from a $1.5m income tax credit in 2017, compared to a $4m credit a year earlier when it posted its first profit.
Between establishment in 2009 and the end of 2015, the company clocked up accumulated losses of $396.8m as it invested heavily in a national mobile network and moved into fixed line telephone and broadband services to allow it to compete across the full range of telecommunications services.

By the end of 2017, its 4G coverage reached 96 per cent of the population, up from 79 per cent in the prior year, the company said.
"The results for 2017 were impacted by the introduction of a new business support system in February 2017," a spokesperson said.
"This created service challenges that impacted sales activity and subsequent revenue growth. The situation has since been resolved."
The company reported a $2.3m gain on foreign exchange rate movements in the year, up from $862,000 in 2016.
Major shareholder Trilogy International Partners, a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed company which owns 73.2 per cent of Two Degrees, said in a first-quarter release published on May 5 that the business added 5,100 net postpaid subscribers as at March 31, lifting numbers to 401,200.
It dropped a net 42,500 prepaid subscribers in the quarter, bringing that number to 982,600.
However, its postpaid customers are more valuable, bringing in an average of US$36.32 ($52.01) per user per month compared to US$7.98 for prepaid customers.
Trilogy also said Two Degrees' revenue rose 14 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, driven by advertising to sell more handsets and higher-priced, new models.
A crowdfunding appeal has been launched by an award-winning chef to complete a unique new restaurant.
Matt Gillan, former Michelin-starred chef at The Pass restaurant at South Lodge Hotel, Lower Beeding, aims to open the new restaurant in Brighton within weeks.
The unique restaurant will be open by day as the Red Roaster cafe - a top coffee venue - and, by night, as high-end restaurant Pike & Pine.
Four months of refurbishment work have been taking place and Matt has now launched an £80,000 crowdfunding appeal to help finance the renovation of a garden area.
He said: “We set out with an ambitious goal but we certainly didn't go in to this project financially unprepared. We had a generous contingency fund and were certain we could complete the project on budget. There are certain things you just can't prepare for and we weren't prepared for them.”

Police say 28-year-old Wesley Flores pulled out a gun and shot himself in the jaw after four hours of unsuccessful negotiations. He's since been sent to a hospital in Lubbock.
Authorities say Flores was originally taken into custody on a warrant for failing to show up to a scheduled court appearance.
MOSCOW (AP) — Russian athletes whose doping bans were lifted deserve to be treated as "clean and honest" at the Pyeongchang Olympics, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said Friday.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Thursday reinstated 28 Russians who had been disqualified from the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and lifted their life bans from the games. Other 11 Russians remained disqualified.
Mutko told The Associated Press the 28 athletes cleared by CAS "are clean and honest, so give them the chance to compete at the Olympics."
Russia wants to send 15 of the 28 athletes to Pyeongchang but the International Olympic Committee has yet to issue invitations. Some other athletes are already retired.

The 28 include gold medal-winning skeleton slider Alexander Tretiakov and cross-country ski gold medalist Alexander Legkov, as well as silver medalist speedskater Olga Fatkulina.
Mutko added that despite years of doping scandals and the requirement to compete under the Olympic flag as "Olympic Athletes from Russia," Russia's eligible athletes are in a positive mood.
"All of the athletes have gone (to Pyeongchang) fired up to compete," he said.
Mutko said the CAS verdicts were proof that Russia was unfairly victimized and that evidence from former Sochi doping lab director Grigory Rodchenkov — who said he tampered with samples on orders from the Sports Ministry then headed by Mutko — was worthless.
"Discrediting Russia was fashionable," Mutko said, but "as soon as they got to a cross-examination, some elementary basis in law, it all fell apart immediately."
Russia is considering whether it could yet overturn the bans for the remaining 11 athletes, Mutko said. However, the next battle is likely to be over the IOC's decision to exclude certain top Russians from an invite list it says should contain only those who are most likely to be clean.
With only a week to go until the Pyeongchang Olympics, time is fast running out.
Mutko hinted the invitation process, headed by former French Sports Minister Valerie Fourneyron, was an attempt to hurt Russia's medal chances.
"It seems like someone's picked up a pencil and gone through all the sports and removed or, let's say, reduced the Russian national team's competitiveness at the Olympics," he said. "We're going to support our athletes to the end in their attempts to get an invitation to the Olympics."
WADA vice president Linda Hofstad Helleland said Friday "the situation, (in) which we now find ourselves, is very chaotic."
"Clean athletes and sport fans around the world have lost confidence in the system," Helleland wrote in an email to the AP. "It's time to stand up and clearly say: This has to stop. This situation can't be accepted any longer."
Mutko himself is barred from the Olympics for life by the IOC, which ruled last month his Sports Ministry failed to ensure the anti-doping program in Sochi worked as it should. He says that wasn't his responsibility and says he's filed an appeal, though it won't be heard until after the Pyeongchang Games.
Some Russian sports fans have lashed out at athletes who choose to compete in Pyeongchang in IOC-imposed neutral uniforms, sometimes flooding social media pages with abusive comments and accusing them of being traitors. Mutko said he disagreed with that sentiment but refused to condemn it.
"I don't condemn anything. That opinion exists and a large percentage of our citizens believe exactly that," he said. "We had to give the athletes a choice, not put them under pressure. Every athlete's story is a short career and they had to make that decision."
It's been over three years since accusations of widespread doping in Russian track and field led to the first World Anti-Doping Agency investigation. That then led to Rodchenkov's decision to testify and further probes into the Sochi Olympics.
Mutko suggested doping allegations were all an attempt to show Russia as a Soviet-style autocracy.
"These accusations of victory at any price ... to strengthen (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, it's all a made-up fairy tale, some kind of view of Russia from the past. We have long since stopped politicizing the results of the Olympics," he said.
Vast government spending on athletes' pay, sport facilities and equipment in recent decades dwarfed the effect any drugs would have had, he suggested.
"If you've invested tens of billions of dollars in all that, then why do you need that little medal linked to doping?"
“I didn't want to buy a house,” says the owner of Kildarick, gesturing towards the building that changed his mind. All the while the family's exuberant dog is bouncing around while we explore the grounds. “I wanted a site. I had never even been up this road before, but we turned in the gates, and the cherry blossom was out, and I thought: we have to buy it . . . ”
His wife takes up the story, she had seen the five-bedroom contemporary pad in the 2007 issue of the glossy style bible that was the Book of Interiors. The feature on the house, noting that it was for sale, also described its brave design by architect Kilian Skay: “in these pastoral surroundings, suffice to say, that when Kildarick emerged, standing brazenly tall [. . .] with one wall entirely glazed, it prompted some discussion amongst the locals”. It also prompted a certain young couple to visit, and opened the next chapter in the house's history.
Kildarick's new owners had big plans. “I took a year off work to do it,” the owner, who is in the auto business, says. “We took the roof off, added a glass box extension, reinsulated, changed the windows. We basically just left the walls standing,” he concludes. “I thought we were just adding a new kitchen,” his wife adds, though it's clear they're both absolutely delighted with what they've created.
“I think I have a disorder – let's call it relentless perfectionism,” the owner says. He spent a period of intensive research to ensure everything was exactly right: from the zinc roof, to the sandstone window surrounds which came from the nearby Murphy Stone quarry in Sandyford. The window design, which brings the eye around the different faces of the house, was borrowed from a style seen by the couple in Stockholm.
Permanent holiday
“We had been planning to buy a holiday home, perhaps in Portugal,” the owner says. “But then we thought, why do that? We feel as if we're on holidays here.” And there is something fun and escapist about the house. Outside there's a dramatic patio, complete with built-in barbecue and bar area, and lots of fancy colourful lighting. Astroturf and blue glass chip strips have been cut in at diagonals to break up the grey stone surface.
“It's irrigated, so they could be filled with water too,” the owner says, though he begins to worry about how that might collect fallen leaves. It's that perfectionism again, which means, at €2.75 million with Knight Frank, you're buying a house where nothing has been left to chance. There's even a clever system of brushes to prevent the hidden guttering from clogging up.
Still outside, there's a European Tour putting green with its own sand bunker. “They did McIlroy and Garcia's,” says the owner, as the dog decides the space would be better used by us for throwing tennis balls at this particular moment. In all, the gardens stretch to 1.13 acres, landscaped by Hugh Ryan, and bounded on one side by a small stream, and on another by a field where deer graze.
Inside the front door – designed by Urban Front, with solid steel behind that nice timber exterior – is just as exciting. A hallway leads to a series of spaces that are bright, fun and funky. A lime-green wall accents one space, while another is picked out by a hot pink fire surround. The 320sq m (3,500 sq ft) of space is taken up with a living room, dining area, lounge/entertainment space, and vast open-plan kitchen on the ground floor, plus five bedrooms leading off an internal balcony above. The master has a balcony, dressing room and en suite with mosaic detailing by Laura O'Hagan.
Blackout blinds
There are lots of surprises along the way: lights in the downstairs loo that come on with a wave of the hand; hidden blackout blinds; the kind of kitchen in which you could imagine indulging in molecular gastronomy for breakfast, and all sorts of ambient lighting to back up the integrated sound system.
So why leave all this? “I know what I can do now,” says the owner. “So we're going to go for it again. We put around €1.6 million into this place,but I could draw you the new place in a second,” he adds, with a distant look in his eyes. “Even the things you can't see. They make such a difference.” To the delight of the dog, who has been concerned we may spend all afternoon chatting in the kitchen, we go back outside. “See these little points? They're to anchor a marquee. We can convert this whole space into a party room in moments.”

With or without the parties, there's no doubt that living here would be pretty entertaining, even on the dullest of days. Rathmichael is handy for the M50 and Luas, and is in the foothills of some seriously stunning countryside. This house, full of light, playfulness and adventurous touches, would be a very nice base from which to make the most of it all.

A woman suffered life-changing injuries when a banned driver ploughed a stolen £21,000 Audi into her as she parked her car.
Craig Davis was jailed for four years over the crash, which happened as he tried to escape from police.
He drove the wrong way down a street, ignoring a no entry sign, and hit the victim's car before the Audi overturned.
The injured woman needed surgery for fractures to her left leg.
She also suffered suspected ligament damage to her right knee, was still in pain and had to rely on friends and family for helping to get around, Birmingham Crown Court heard.
She had only just started a job and so was not entitled to sick pay and was reliant on benefits.
The court was told Davis had a “truly appalling record” which included previous offences for reckless driving.
The 48-year-old, of South Road, Hockley, was jailed for four years, having previously admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and handling stolen goods.
He was also banned from the roads for nine years.
Nigel Stelling, prosecuting, said Davis was seen by police driving the Audi in the city centre on January 14 this year.
It had had been stolen from a car showroom last August.
Police tried to stop him and he briefly stopped before accelerating away.
Davis ignored a no entry sign and drove the wrong way down South Road before the crash happened.
Passing sentence, Judge Melbourne Inman QC told Davis: “You wholly ignored all the rules of the road and you drove at very dangerously high speeds, driving into a one way street and then colliding with a young lady who was doing no more than parking her motor car.”
He said the victim's injuries also included bruising to her face when her airbag “exploded” and she was no longer able to go to the gym.
And he told Davis: “You have no regard whatsoever for road traffic laws.”
Lee Masters, defending, said Davis bitterly regretted the injuries he had caused and he had panicked.
“The police chase took just 60 seconds before it was tragically brought to an end,” he said.

Traditional opinion might expect middle-aged women to swap knitting patterns when they congregate but at a recent gathering I was asked what name I give my vagina. The session, Perfecting Your Orgasm, which would get many a knitting project in a twist, was part of a broader conference on celebrating magnificence in mid-life.What was interesting was not just the array of cute to crude names, but also the number of women who didn't have one (a name that is, not a vagina). The woman who struck me most said, rather sadly, “I've never had any cause to address it.”
For many women, exploring, discovering and pursuing their own sexual pleasure was not something we were ever taught or encouraged to do. That seems to be changing, and the good news is that it's never too late to learn.
As a mother of three young girls, I have already written about woeful sex education for our children, but what I'm realising is that many adults are also in the dark about playing in the dark. Like me, many middle-aged women are either embarking on the dating scene again, or want to revamp their existing relationship now that the breeding years are over.
Better understanding of their sexuality
But many are either talking themselves celibate or, like me, haven't dated since last century. Sex education was non-existent. So when I learned something interesting in the talk – like the exact location of the G-spot – I was shocked.
I was brought up to believe the G-spot was a mystical thing, something akin to pot luck for those of us lucky enough to “find” it. But at the age of 46, I was told that it is in exactly the same place for all women. It's as real and as tangible as our arms. Why are we (and men) not being taught this?
ADVERTISEMENT
A varied array of websites aimed at teaching women how to find their sexual mojo, whatever their age, show a growing awareness for women that after children we can claim back our vaginas for ourselves. We might just need an instruction manual.
Recently I met Sasha Cagen, a writer and coach who works with mid-aged women on finding or reclaiming their sexuality. “Many women are coming out of divorce and looking for a better understanding of their sexuality, or maybe they are still in a relationship but need to revive it. Whether they are single or married, have kids or not, the ones who are bold and courageous are the ones who will get the best from their own bodies.”
Sensually fit
Although she sees a minority of women who want to reclaim or discover their sexuality in their 40s and 50s, she sees more who are resigned and think it's all over. They fear rejection because they believe in the strong storyline, often reinforced in the media, that only young women are attractive. Thankfully the media are finally starting to highlight strong, sexual mid-aged women proving that we are not desexualised after a certain age. As a mid-ager embarking on the second half of life, I'm discovering I not only need to be mentally, emotionally, and physically fit, but sensually fit as well.
“It's a virtual cycle,” says Calgen. “Getting in touch with your sexuality affects every aspect of your life. I meet women who want to learn about their sexuality to find the power and confidence to animate their whole life.”
So how do we become bold and courageous? We need to let go of the conditioning that we are sluts if we pursue our own pleasure, or that we are not attractive in our 40s and beyond. We must invest in our connection with our sexuality, which can include a partner but not necessarily. The emphasis is on feeling good rather than looking good, the latter often a consequence of the former. It can be as simple as mentally connecting to that part of your body and realising it's not just for babies but for you, your whole life.
Did you know the clitoris is bigger than the penis? Nope, I didn't either until recently. “Use it or lose it,” we were told at the conference. As Calgen put it, “We are in bodies and we should enjoy them.” It's time to be bold and courageous women.
NEW YORK (AP) — The New Yorker magazine says it has cut ties with its well-known political reporter Ryan Lizza for alleged sexual misconduct.
A New Yorker spokeswoman said Monday that the magazine recently learned Lizza had "engaged in what we believe was improper sexual conduct." A CNN spokeswoman says Lizza will not appear on the cable news network, where he is a contributor, while it looks into the matter.
Lizza says in an emailed statement that the magazine's decision was a "terrible mistake" and that he is "dismayed" that it was characterizing a "respectful relationship with a woman I dated as somehow inappropriate."
Lizza is known for a memorable interview with Anthony Scaramucci , in which the former White House communications director bashed colleagues in vulgar language. Scaramucci was ousted shortly afterward.

Report: Uber Paid Off Hacker To Destroy Stolen User Data
Uber paid $100,000 to a 20-year-old Florida man responsible for the recently disclosed data breach that compromised the personal information of 57 million riders and drivers in 2016, multiple sources told Reuters.
Three people familiar with the incident said an unidentified Florida man contacted Uber after breaching a server in October and stealing information including the names and email addresses of ride-share users in the U.S. and abroad, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The culprit's message was forwarded to Uber's "bug bounty" team and ultimately made its way to HackerOne, a third party company that awards researchers for revealing security flaws in clients' products.
HackerOne subsequently paid the person $100,000 in exchange for erasing the stole Uber data, the sources told Reuters.
Uber announced Nov. 21 that hackers breached a third-party server last year and stole the names and email addresses of 57 million users, among other personal information.
"At the time of the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the data and shut down further unauthorized access by the individuals," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in the announcement. "We subsequently identified the individuals and obtained assurances that the downloaded data had been destroyed. We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts."
Mr. Khosrowshahi learned of the incident after becoming Uber's chief executive in August, and he's since terminated two employees implicated in its response,Joe Sullivan, Uber's former head of security, and a deputy, attorney Craig Clark.
Another three members of Uber's security subsequently resigned from their roles last week.
Reuters didn't identify the Florida hacker by name, but a source described him as "living with his mom in a small home trying to help pay the bills."
Uber declined to pursue criminal charges after determining that the person didn't pose an additional threat and eventually paid the hacker after confirming their identity and making them sign a nondisclosure agreement, Reuters reported.
"In all cases when a bug bounty award is processed through HackerOne, we receive identifying information of the recipient in the form of an IRS W-9 or W-8BEN form before payment of the award can be made," HackerOne CEO Marten Mickos told Reuters.
Uber spokesman Matt Kallman declined to comment, the report said.
Uber has come under fire since disclosing the data breach last month more than a year after the fact, and the incident is currently being reviewed by state and federal regulators in the U.S. and abroad.
Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida Democrat, cited Uber's delayed admission while reintroducing legislation last week that carries prison time for corporate executives caught deliberately concealing data breaches such as the October 2016 incident.
"We need a strong federal law in place to hold companies truly accountable for failing to safeguard data or inform consumers when that information has been stolen by hackers," Mr. Nelson said in a statement. "Congress can either take action now to pass this long overdue bill or continue to kowtow to special interests who stand in the way of this commonsense proposal. When it comes to doing what's best for consumers, the choice is clear."

*urges IGP to stop inauguration of corps members
By Davies Iheamnachor
PORT HARCOURT – Youths of the Progressives Congress, APC in Rivers State Monday said they have compiled petitions which they would submit to President Muhammadu Buhari when he visits the state.
The youths under the umbrella of Buhari Campaign Organization, BCO, noted that their complaints if attended to by the president would improve the security of the state.
The president's campaign group also urged the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, not to allow the Governor Nyesom Wike to inaugurate the officials of the corps, adding that the formation of the security body runs fowl of the law.
The leader of the group, Chimidi Owhorji, who spoke in Port Harcourt on the planned visit of the president to the state, noted that the group has compiled activities of the state government that are not in tandem with the 1999 Constitution (amended) to be handed to Buhari.
Owhorji said that the group would officially forward its concerns about the Neighbourhood Watch Corps bill assented to by Governor Wike, the criminal activities and environmental pollution (soot) to the president.
Owhorji said: “When the president visits the state, we will officially forward our petitions and complaints about the state to him. We know that when he comes he will take a closer assessment of the security structure in the state and to improve it.
“He loves the people of Rivers State that is why he has brought meaningful projects in the state. So, we are earnestly and anxiously waiting to receive you, Mr. President. Rivers people want to tell you thank you in a big way for appointing their sons and daughters into privileged position in your government.
“They are ready to host you in big ways to tell you how they are being maltreated by the man who is supposed to be the Chief Security Officer of the state.
“We are calling on the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, not to allow the state to inaugurate the Neighbourhood Watch Corps. He should do everything within his constitutional right to ensure that they do not operate.”

Swedish furniture retailer Ikea has announced that one of its gas hobs sold in the UK must be repaired because its carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are above EU-allowed limits.
Ikea urged customers to stop using the rapid burner in the upper right corner of any version of the Eldslaga hob bought before January 1 this year.
It described the recall for repair as a "precautionary measure" and said there was no elevated risk of fire or explosion and there had been no reported incidents.
(Image: PA)
The retailer has asked customers to contact its customer service team to book a home visit by a technician to repair the fault, saying a receipt is not needed and it would do its "utmost" to minimise the waiting time.
It said the fault was due to human error which resulted in the wrong gas injector installed, leading to CO emissions above EU limits.
The recall follows an investigation by the Belgian market surveillance authorities.
The model was sold in 22 European countries.
Ikea apologised for "any inconvenience this may cause".

He was the senior national sports writer in Seattle for The Associated Press from 2005-10, covering the Seahawks in their first Super Bowl season and beyond. He's also been The Sacramento Bee's beat writer on the Oakland Athletics and Raiders.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Newspaper publisher Tronc has named CEO Justin Dearborn as its chairman of the board, replacing Michael Ferro, who is retiring.
The change announced Monday shortly before Fortune magazine published a story about two women who allege that Ferro made unwanted sexual advances during 2013 and 2016 before he become Tronc's chairman.
"Michael Ferro has had no claims filed against him while leading Tronc as chairman," Tronc said in a statement. "Further, we are aware of no claims filed against Mr. Ferro throughout his career. As Mr. Ferro has retired after leading a financial turnaround of Tronc, we wish him well in his private life and will have no further comment."
Ferro struck it rich as an entrepreneur involved in two startups that were sold for more than $1 billion. In 2016, he bought a stake in the Tribune Co, which was subsequently renamed as Tronc.

Chicago-based Tronc Inc., which operates newspapers including the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and The Baltimore Sun, announced last month it had sold the Los Angeles Times and other papers for $500 million and an additional $90 million in pension benefits.
"Michael retires having created considerable shareholder value for the company in just two years as chairman of the board," Dearborn said, adding that the company had tripled its market capitalization, quadrupled its cash holdings and reduced its debt under Ferro's leadership.
Dearborn was appointed CEO of Tronc in February 2016. He previously led Merge Healthcare until its acquisition by IBM for $1 billion in October 2015.
Bill English is a safe pair of hands. A Conservative with a Conscience. A good Kiwi Bloke. Reasonable, rational, progressive.
Anyway, that's the recurring view among supporters of the leader of the National Party.
It's a lot to lose. Which is why Bill English should quit. Sooner rather than later.
English this week denied reports that he's planning on quitting before the next election. But I'd wager he won't be there in 2020. He's smarter than that.
Advertisement
Every day that he hangs on in the job of National leader is a day that chips away at the solid reputation he's managed to carve out over nine years as a careful Finance Minister and a safe-as-houses Prime Minister.
English did a remarkable thing coming back from that horrible 2002 election defeat. No one should underestimate the courage it would've taken to run in last year's election. No one should underestimate the work it took to win an impressive 44 per cent of voters.
It's equally remarkable that those voters are sticking by him. They're refusing to budge despite all the charm, sweet talking and impressiveness of the new Labour Government. That 44 per cent has gone nowhere. In this week's Newshub-Reid research poll, that 44 per cent declared they were standing by their man.
But it won't last. Nothing lasts forever. At some point, National supporters may get over their anger at the sense their election victory was stolen from them. They may come to accept a new Government. They may even like Jacinda Ardern and go goey over her greatest political weapon: baby Gayford. The chances of English holding 44 per cent of voters through to the next election are slim.
For English, it's better to leave when those voters still love him. It's better to go out while it still looks like it's his choice. Because, when the polls dip, the hungry and ambitious younger MPs — who this week declared their undying support for English — will be the first to knife him. They're ambitious. They see their chances slipping away with time. They probably tell themselves at night that they can take English's 44 per cent and claim the victory in 2020.
Plus, every day that English hangs around is a day where the veneer of being a Conservative with a Conscience slowly rubs off. It started during the election campaign. There was the bootcamps for young offenders policy. Then this week the whole caucus voted against Green MP Chloe Swarbrick's liberal marijuana bill. The whole caucus. Even those like Chris Bishop who publicly said that they would support it. Were those MPs guided towards changing a conscience vote? Did that happen under the apparently progressive Bill English's watch? And then the final clanger this past week. A bill, promoted by new MP Andrew Falloon, that aims to lock away recidivist offenders for longer. This, when research tells us prisons fix nothing. This under the watch of the man who once described prisons as "a moral and fiscal failure".
There are rumours that the business world wants English. Rumours of job offers on boards. That would surely be a happier place than the frustration and insecurity of Opposition.
Make no mistake though, National is likely in for a tough time when English does pull the pin. The party's support will probably drop. Few other National MPs convey the same steadiness and old-slipper comfort that English does. Ambition and greed could take over. It could be an ugly sight as MPs clamour to fill his spot and tear down any replacement who doesn't deliver.
But, if the party does fall to bits when he quits, that won't be a bad thing for English personally. It'll just prove he was all the things his supporters think he is. At least, what they think at the moment.

There was a time when Chenai Mathabire read Vogue, watched beauty pageants on TV and fantasized about being a supermodel. Today she helps the sick and injured as a nurse and epidemiologist.
Last month, the 35-year-old Zimbabwean received an International AIDS Society prize for showing that a faster tuberculosis test could be implemented at health centers in southeast Africa. Her work will help save the lives of HIV-positive patients who contract TB.
"Nursing is often looked down upon and people just think you are there to be the maid of the doctor or do the dirty work. But teachers made me realize that nurses have a big role to play," says Mathabire.
In Zimbabwe's bustling capital, Harare, Mathabire earned high enough points in her studies to pursue a degree in physiotherapy, occupational therapy or nursing at university. She chose to become a nurse — the first nurse in her family. In 2008, she was between jobs and Zimbabwe was facing economic problems. Mathabire decided to apply for a job at Doctors Without Borders.
The work took her into some of Africa's grimmest situations. She helped diagnose malnourished children with HIV, tuberculosis, pneumonia and malaria in Zimbabwe. Then she supervised workers who were teaching HIV-positive pregnant women how to protect their children from the virus. After that, she worked in a mobile hospital in South Sudan, treating gunshot wounds during a tribal war.
In 2015, she was recruited for her first research assignment at Doctors Without Borders, work that would eventually earn her an International AIDS Society prize. She knew that TB was the No. 1 killer of HIV-positive patients from her previous work, but she didn't know about the rapid tuberculosis test until she read the study's protocol. She was eager to get started on the project.
For two years, Mathabire and a team explored how easily health clinics and hospitals in the Chiradzulu District of Malawi and the Chamanculo District of Mozambique could implement the tuberculosis test for HIV patients, who are more susceptible to the infection.
In Malawi and Mozambique, HIV is the leading cause of death. It is often spread through unprotected sex, and it has wiped out 27 percent of Malawi's and 24 percent of Mozambique's populations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Finding out whether an HIV-positive person has tuberculosis is a matter of life and death. Mathabire remembers a Malawi man in his early 30s who left a clinic untreated. The rapid test, which analyzes a molecule in the patient's urine with a paper strip, had shown that he had TB. A coughing test didn't. But doctors weren't referring patients for the rapid test in their assessment of the man. It hadn't yet been approved by the Ministry of Health which was awaiting the World Health Organization's policy guidance. The man died before he could go back to get help.
His story wasn't unique, Mathabire says. "It's very sad but then you realize why you are doing the study — to prevent this from happening," she says. "You start to realize the urgency of what you are doing."
Under normal circumstances, patients are given cough tests or chest X-rays to test for TB. Mathabire's team found that it takes an average of two to four days for results, but the wait could drag on for months.
Though the government of Malawi pays for certain medical care, including tuberculosis treatment, patients might not have the money to pay for a bus ride to the hospital or clinic for follow-up visits. And more remote clinics don't always have the resources to transport samples to hospitals.
With the rapid TB test, sick patients could begin treatment the same day. Mathabire's data showed that the test provided results in less than an hour. Staff in Malawi and Mozambique could be trained to administer the test in just a few hours. And doctors, nurses and clinical officers said it was easy to interpret the bands on the test strips.
Mathabire also found that patients weren't skeptical of a new method. They really wanted to take the high-tech test. Mainly peasant farmers, they took the words of the health workers seriously. "Everybody basically knew somebody that had died of HIV [and opportunistic infections] in a terrible way," she says. It was like that in Zimbabwe too.
The team's findings, published by Doctors Without Borders this year, has led some of the health centers where the aid group works to embrace rapid TB testing. It could pave the way for more facilities to incorporate the test it into their health systems, meaning faster care for the sickest of HIV patients.
In a statement, International AIDS Society president Linda-Gail Bekker said that Mathabire's research will "support the next generation of investigators whose work can help to change the course of this epidemic."
Mathabire still works for Doctors Without Borders and is considering conducting more research on HIV and tuberculosis. But her award-winning research isn't the only major event of her summer.
She moved to Falun, central Sweden, to marry an infectious disease specialist whom she worked with in Zimbabwe. True to her early love of fashion, she's sewing her own wedding dress, with glass beads, silk and lace.

A rogue trader has been fined more than £4,000 for failing to provide customers with the required 14-day cancellation notice, following an investigation by Northamptonshire County Council Trading Standards.
Trading Standards received a complaint from a concerned customer in his 60s whose wife had been at home alone when she received a cold call from Simon Maziak of Acorn Roofing and Property Maintenance Service Ltd, stating that the tiles on her roof needed repairing.
As she trusted that the trader was telling her the truth, she agreed to work taking place which began straight away.
The trader then stated further work needed to be done and vastly increased the price of the job.
As part of the investigation, it was confirmed by a surveyor that no immediate work was required on the roof.
Before the work started, the householder should have been given notice of their right to a 14-day cooling-off period.
This protects customers from the element of surprise inherent in doorstep selling - as customers can feel pressured into making a decision which they would not have made if they had an opportunity to think about it without the trader being present.
Maziak pleaded guilty to an offence under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 and was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay legal costs and a victim surcharge, totalling £1270.00.
Maziak had previously signed formal undertakings to comply with the requirement to provide such cancellation rights to customers.
Cllr Andre Gonzalez de Savage, county council cabinet member for strategic infrastructure, economic growth and public protection said: “It's great to see another successful prosecution by Trading Standards, helping to bring unscrupulous traders to account.
“Our advice is never to agree to work on the doorstep, but if you do need work done to your property, get quotes from two or three reputable traders and compare them.
“Ask for recommendations from friends or family and always check the trader out thoroughly.
“Trading Standards operates Buy With Confidence, a trader approval scheme where all members have been stringently vetted to check for legal compliance.
“Details of members can be found by visiting: www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/approvedtraders or telephone 0300 1261000.
“If you do agree to work on the doorstep, the trader must give you a written notice of your right to cancel the contract and failure to do this is a criminal offence.
“The vast majority of businesses out there are honest and reputable, but if you have concerns, always report them to Trading Standards by calling the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 04 05 06.
“Customers should always remember that ‘If you're not sure, don't open the door'.”

A Derby man who works at Rolls-Royce is appearing on Blind Date tonight.
Chris Wells, 24, of The Crescent, Chaddesden, only found out what he had signed up for part way through an interview to find out if producers thought he was right for the show.
That's because he put his name forward on a website asking for people to take part in reality TV.
He said the advert had asked only for single men who look after the way they look.
Chris, who was brought up in Heanor and went to Aldercar High School said he had a great time on the show - even forging a lasting friendship with one of the other contestants.
The technical support engineer said filming was carried out on July 1 last year.
He said: "It was from 10am to 10pm so it was a full day and quite an experience.
"It really is completely blind. You are in a room and, if you want to go to the toilet, you almost get escorted because that's how much they don't want you to cross paths.
"We had a few beers before going on. We were given one but then asked different people for more."
The show is presented by Paul O'Grady who Chris said was a "really, really nice guy".
It airs at 8pm this evening on Channel 5.

JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Moody's Investors Service has assigned Glencore a ‘Baa2' long-term issuer rating with a positive outlook.
Moody's says Glencore's improved credit profile was driven by higher commodity prices and consistently low production costs.

It adds that Glencore's improved earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), reduced leverage and higher funds from operations, supported by the group's adjusted dividend policy, enables Glencore to better withstand volatility in the commodity markets.
“[Our decision] reflects material operating profit growth in 2017, which, together with continued conservative management of the balance sheet structure and leverage profile, positions Glencore strongly in the ‘Baa2' rating category,” says Moody's senior VP Sven Reinke, adding that the rating could be upgraded if Glencore continues to demonstrate prudent balance sheet management.

Based on the high point of the range for commodity price assumptions for copper, zinc and thermal coal, Moody's expects Glencore's Ebitda to improve to around $16.1-billion this year, compared with $13.4-billion in 2017.
PHOENIX (AP) — The state's largest utility is fiercely opposing a push to mandate increased use of renewable energy in sun-drenched Arizona.
Clean Energy for a Healthy Arizona aims to ask voters whether they want the state Constitution to require half of Arizona's electricity come from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2030.
The group plans to file more than 225,000 signatures Thursday gets the question on the November ballot.
California billionaire Tom Steyer is financing the initiative through his NextGen Climate Action group, which supported similar efforts in Nevada and Michigan. Only the Arizona measure spawned a political fight.

Arizona Public Service Co. says the proposed constitutional amendment will cause customers' utility rates to skyrocket and harm reliability.
Its parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., spent $1.18 million to oppose the initiative in the first three months of the year.
Hundreds of HP Laptops, Tablets Found with Pre-Installed Keylogger
A security researcher has found that hundreds of different models of HP notebooks, tablets and other devices include a keylogger that could track and record every keystroke a user makes. Linked to touchpad drivers made by Synaptics, the keylogger is disabled by default and can be fixed with security patches released by HP last month.
The keylogger was discovered by security researcher Michael Myng, who publicly disclosed his findings in a blog post Thursday. In his post, Myng said that he messaged HP about his discovery and the company responded quickly by confirming the issue and releasing a software update to resolve the problem.
HP said neither it nor Synaptics "has access to customer data as a result of this issue." However, after a registry change, the keylogger could enable a malicious actor to monitor a user's keyboard activity.
More than 450 Affected Devices
Writing under the handle "ZwClose," Myng said he discovered the keylogger after an associate asked whether he could find a way to control the keyboard backlighting on an HP laptop. When he opened the keyboard driver SynTP.sys, Myng said he noticed "a few interesting strings," in particular, one that looked like a format string for a keylogger.
"I messaged HP about the finding," Myng said. "They replied terrificly [sic] fast, confirmed the presence of the keylogger (which actually was a debug trace) and released an update that removes the trace."
In a Nov. 7 security update, HP provided links to software patches for more than 450 products, including multiple models of the HP Notebook, HP EliteBook, HP Mobile Thin Client, HP ProBook, HP Spectre Pro and HP ZBook Mobile Workstation. The company said that affected users should install the appropriate update for their devices as soon as possible.
Second Keylogger Issue this Year
"A potential security vulnerability has been identified with certain versions of Synaptics touchpad drivers that impacts all Synaptics OEM partners," HP said in last month's security bulletin. "A party would need administrative privileges in order to take advantage of the vulnerability."
This isn't the first time such an issue has affected HP devices. In May, researchers with Switzerland-based security company Modzero reported finding a keylogging vulnerability in the Conexant audio drivers in HP laptops.
That problem, like the one reported by Myng, was blamed on debugging code that had been inadvertently left by developers. It also affected numerous models, including HP EliteBooks, ProBooks, and ZBooks.
In a statement acknowledging the May keylogger discovery, HP said it had "no access to customer data as a result of this issue. Our supplier partner developed software to test audio functionality prior to product launch and it should not have been included in the final shipped version."

MIAMI (AP) — A four-run deficit no longer looms so large for the Miami Marlins.
Marcell Ozuna homered to start a comeback Wednesday afternoon, and Miami beat the Oakland Athletics 11-6 to complete a two-game sweep.
Ozuna hit his 17th home run in the second inning after the Marlins fell behind 4-0. He added a double and finished with three RBIs to help overcome a wobbly outing by Edinson Volquez, who had a no-hitter in his most recent home start.
“Today I got lucky,” Volquez said. “They picked me up.”
Rallies were rare for the Marlins during their 14-27 start. But they've won 13 of their past 19 games, largely because the bats came alive.
“There were times last month when it felt like if the other team scored first, we were in trouble,” manager Don Mattingly said. “Now you don't have the same feeling.”
Tyler Moore hit his fifth homer and scored three times. Christian Yelich and Dee Gordon each had two hits and two RBIs.
“It has all been clicking for us the last couple of weeks,” Yelich said. “We got some guys hot at the same time and are putting a lot of pressure on teams. We can score runs a lot of different ways — manufacturing, or guys leaving the ballpark.”
Ryon Healy hit a three-run homer for the Athletics (27-38), who fell to 11 games below .500 for the first time. They went 1-5 on their trip and lost their ninth consecutive road series, their longest such streak since 1986.
Oakland lost after leading by three or more runs three times on the trip. Daniel Gossett (0-1) couldn't hold the early lead in his major league debut after being called up from Triple-A Nashville, and allowed seven runs, six earned, in 3 1-3 innings.
“It was not exactly the way I drew it up, but I'm so fortunate to get the opportunity to play in the big leagues,” Gossett said. “It was everything you dream of, minus the outcome.”
Volquez lasted only four innings and gave up four hits, four walks and five runs, four earned. Kyle Barraclough (2-1), the first of six Miami relievers, pitched a scoreless fifth.
INTERLEAGUE RECORD
Miami's Ichiro Suzuki had a pinch-hit infield single in the fifth for his 365th interleague hit, breaking Derek Jeter's major league record.
“Amazing,” Mattingly said. “A lot of games, a lot of hits. You're talking about him and Derek, obviously two Halls of Fame guys. The length of their careers — that's really greatness, the guys that can be good for long periods of time.”
PITCHER HITTING
Gossett reached in the fourth on an infield single, his first major league hit and the first by Athletics pitchers in their past 27 at-bats over two seasons.
“You can close your eyes and swing, and sometimes it works,” Gossett said.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Oakland: RF Matt Joyce left in the third, one inning after he cut his chin colliding with first baseman Yonder Alonso pursuing a popup, which Alonso caught. Joyce received three stitches but said the injury wasn't serious.
Miami: LHP Braxton Garrett, the Marlins' top prospect, will receive a second opinion on his sore left elbow next week from specialist Dr. James Andrews. Garrett has been diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament and could require Tommy John surgery.
ROSTER MOVE
To make room on the roster for Gossett, 1B-OF Matt Olson was optioned to Nashville.
DRAFT PICK
The Marlins took the brother of Chicago Bears tight end Dion Sims in the 14th round of the draft. Demetrius Sims is a shortstop at Bethune-Cookman.
UP NEXT
Miami: The Marlins hit the road after winning for the 10th time in their past 12 home games. They visit the new ballpark in Atlanta for the first time to begin a three-game series Friday, when RHP Dan Straily (4-4, 3.89) will pitch against LHP Sean Newcomb (0-1, 0.00).
Oakland: The's return home for a four-game series against the Yankees beginning Thursday, when RHP Sonny Gray (2-2, 4.37) will face LHP Jordan Montgomery (4-4, 3.55).

Yet another former Facebook executive has come forward to confess that he helped create a monster.
Chamath Palihapitiya, who joined Facebook in 2007 and later became its vice president for user growth, said that he and the company's founders “have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.”
The engineer-turned-investor added that he feels “tremendous guilt” for the impact Facebook has had on the world, and said that his kids don't have profiles on the social network.
“They're not allowed to use this s–t,” he said.
Palihapitiya is the latest Facebook alum to admit regrets about their role building the company. Last month, Facebook's first president, Sean Parker, admitted he was “something of a conscientious objector” to the social networking giant.
Parker said Facebook is designed to exploit “a vulnerability in human psychology” to get its users addicted.
Facebook “literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,” Parker told Axios in early November. “God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.”
The bashing from Palihapitiya came at a talk given at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Palihapitiya admitted to the audience that he has been off Facebook and other social networks “for years.”
He said that the way people interact on social networks — through likes and retweets and shares — have become a plague on the way people communicate with each other.
Palihapitiya added that he resents that Facebook programs its users behaviors, and makes them “give up … intellectual independence.” He said it has become a platform “where bad actors can now manipulate large swathes of people to do anything [they] want.”
From fake news stories flooding feeds in the US, to dictatorial regimes in the Philippines, Turkey and Kenya using Facebook to target dissent, Facebook is lately catching heat for its role in politics worldwide.
“We are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion. It is eroding the core foundation of how people behave by and between each other,” he said. “And I don't have a good solution. My solution is I just don't use these tools anymore.”
Palihaitiya said that when Facebook was still in its early stages, there were discussions about the sort of impact the platform could have.
“I think in the back, deep, deep recesses [of our minds], we kind of knew something bad could happen,” Palihapitiya said. “But I think the way we defined it was not like this.”
“The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops we've created are destroying how society works,” he continued. “No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. And it's not an American problem—this is not about Russians ads. This is a global problem.”
The British government was under pressure Wednesday night to review fire safety measures in residential tower blocks following the fire at Grenfell Tower in west London.
Policing and fire minister Nick Hurd acknowledged that the fire raised important questions about safety which must be answered but insisted that the immediate priority must be to take care of those affected by the tragedy.
“I hope people will understand that the priority of the government at the moment is to manage the emergency response, to deal with the security, to deal with lives to be saved, lives to be rebuilt, and to make sure that we have got the support in place for this emergency response,” he said.
“That will then move into recovery phase and then we will move into a phase where we seek to answer the questions that people quite understandably have, so we really understand what happened here, what went wrong, so we don't find ourselves in this situation, because I don't think that anybody wants to go through another night like last night.”
Grenfell Tower was part of Lancaster West Estate, a social housing complex of 1,000 homes in West Kensington, and was home to between 400 and 600 people, many of whom were still unaccounted for last night.
Resident Mickey Paramasivan, who was woken in his seventh-floor flat by a smell of burning plastic, said he had witnessed awful scenes as he escaped with his girlfriend and daughter.
“I opened the front door, there's smoke everywhere, there are all neighbours running out. ‘Get down the stairs' they're shouting,” he said.
“If we had stayed in that flat we'd have perished. It spread like wildfire because it was covered in cladding. The smoke alarm was useless. I could only hear it in the hallway, not in the flat. It was horrendous.
“There were people who were lost, people who can't find their families. There was one woman on the 12th floor, she's left with her six kids, when she's got to the ground floor there's only four of them with her.”
Screams
Paul Munakr, who lived on the seventh floor, told Sky News that no fire alarm sounded and he was only alerted to the fire by the screams of residents pleading for help and others telling them not to jump. He said he had never witnessed a fire alarm test at the block.
“They only do these fire alarms in the day when the majority of people are working,” he said.
Residential tower blocks are supposed to be designed in a way that will compartmentalise the blaze to stop it spreading and, by slowing down the spread of a fire, allow the emergency services to deal with any incident quickly.
London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, remarked on the speed with which the fire spread and the warnings about safety from residents over recent months.
“All of these are questions which must be answered, if for no other reason than because there are many, many other tower blocks across London and across the country,” he said.
Grenfell Action Group, which advocates for residents in the block, claimed in a blog last November that Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation was ignoring their fears about fire safety.
“All our warnings fell on deaf ears and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time,” the group said.
The management organisation said yesterday it was too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread.
“We are aware that concerns have been raised historically by residents. We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations,” it said.

The West Ada School district is proposing a $95 million bond and a $14 million school levy for the March 13 ballot. The bond, which would help the district build new schools and remodel old ones, requires a super majority of 66.6 percent to pass. The levy, which helps with the district's operations costs and would help fund teaching positions lost during the recession, needs a simple majority of 50 percent plus one vote to pass.

The people of Magogwe in Mahikeng have always been generous with pet names. Some of these names were belittling, to say the least. Like “Tonight” for a dark-skinned person and “Gongkgang” for the one with a big nose. The list was endless. Jonas, aka Cassette, was one such victim. His front teeth were missing and they said the space left was big enough to insert a cassette; just like the slot in a music player.
From an early age, the young boy displayed streaks of aggressiveness. When he played soccer with his peers, it always ended up in fisticuffs. It was partly because he was less talented. The FC Mawete players were crafty and given to showboating. Cassette didn't tolerate that kind of grandstanding where people put the ball between his legs and made a fool of him.
But there was a weak spot to the young man. When Ziphora arrived in Magogwe, he took it upon himself to make the girl comfortable. Her family had relocated from Zeerust to settle in the neighbourhood. Cassette and his cousin, Brutus, always took the walk to Barolong High with the dark beauty. She was an immediate hit with the school community as she was an ardent singer and dancer in the Setswana tradition. The school had a dance group and whenever she stayed behind to rehearse, Cassette would make an excuse to float around the school until the practice was done.
When Ziphora danced on stage at school functions, he made sure to take the front row. Her costume enhanced her true African splendour: waist like a Coca-Cola bottle and toned thighs, which were due to the fitness that came from years of dancing. She always danced a duet with Tiro. The two also belonged to the same community dance group. Amid the rapturous applause of the audience, the pair's rapport told stories of African pride, love and eternal influence. When they looked into each other's eyes as they smiled and gyrated, they seemed to break all barriers. It was so real. A tinge of jealousy always crawled down Cassette's spine.
After one such performance, Tiro was walking Zipho home. Cassette and Brutus were following.
Cassette said, “I don't like that boy.
“I know,” Brutus responded. Cassette was shocked.
“How do you know?”
His cousin shifted the backpack of books from one shoulder to the other. In his characteristic, poised manner he said, “Cassette, I know these things. If you love a girl; and you get butterflies in your stomach every time you see her – you must tell her. And failure to do so, my friend – that is a sausage factory for disaster!”
Brutus was always the expert. People called him “pastor”. He was passionate about the church and there were verses he could readily recite from the heart. Even teachers sometimes trusted him to lead assembly.
“Jonas,” the soft-spoken Brutus was matter-of-fact. “Jonas, love is a lamp. Mathew 5:15 says: ‘Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a clay pot, but on a lamp stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house'.”
“Parables.”
“It's not a parable. Put the light on the lamp stand, Cassette. Not under, on TOP!”
When they caught up with the pair ahead, Cassette sandwiched himself in between them. Tiro resisted. He was the same height as the assailant and certainly not a pushover.
“I think it's time for you to get lost,” Cassette told him.
Tiro laughed. “I don't take instructions from you.”
They stood neck to neck, like two bulls squaring up against each other. This was not the first confrontation. Once in the village, Cassette had closed Tiro's windpipe after the latter had missed him with a fist. The situation could have become worse had Brutus not diffused it.
And now Cassette pointed an ugly finger.
“Sonny, your days are numbered.”
Tiro continued to laugh derisively, “Owaai, Cassette, you're a dreamer.”
“Hey, sonny, you have no right to call me Cassette. My name is Jonas.”
“I don't care!” said Tiro, and left.
Brutus also gave Jonas and Ziphora space.
As they walked towards her home, he apologised: “Sorry about that.”
But Ziphora had a question. “Why are you so nasty to each other? I mean, the two of you are just my friends. What's wrong?”
“There's nothing wrong.”
“Are you sure?” she demanded.
He wished he had the courage to cough out the truth. But all that came out was:
“Yes … No …Yee … Eish …”
“Cassette, come on. What's happening? You sound like a radio that's not properly on the station. I can't hear you.”
He stammered: “The thi- thi- thing is tomorrow I'm going to town. Will you come with me?”
“Sorry. We have a rehearsal around 9 am. Then later we are performing at MmeMotlalepula's stokvel. So I will take a rain check.”
He was disappointed. “I'll bring you something nice from town.”
“Thanks.”
Back home, Brutus was not surprised that his cousin had once again fluffed the opportunity.
“You know she even told me that I sound like a radio that's not on the station.”
“Eish, sorry, brother. The fact that you can't face her and spell it out probably means that you are not meant to be. Perhaps someone like me must take over.”
“You? Hey, sonny. Don't cross that line!”
“Just joking!”

Police in a number of Norwegian districts will be given electroshock weapons as part of a trial from next year.
The weapons will be used in the Oslo, Øst, Sørvest and Troms police districts, NRK reports.
The National Police Directorate began looking into the possibility of using the weapon type last year and has now decided to implement the trial in the four districts from January 1st, 2019, according to the report.
Similar weapons are already used by police in the United States, United Kingdom and Finland.
“We consider this a resource police in other countries have made use of with good results. It results in less injury than the weapons police traditionally use,” National Police Directorate response director Knut Smedsrud told NRK.
“One way in which this could be used is as an alternative in the many instances in which police currently use firearms. That happens thousands of times per year, so it is absolutely interesting for us to look at electroshock weapons as an alternative. It could also be an alternative to batons or gas weapons in certain instances,” Smedsrud added.
Concern over the weapon type, which can fire a charge of 50,000 volts, has been raised by NGO Amnesty International, which said that it should be treated as potentially lethal implement.
“It is important to be aware that electroshock weapons can leave inflict very serious injuries. They can even cause death. They should be managed in the exact same way as firearms, and only be used in the same situations as firearms – and nothing more,” Amnesty International political advisor Gerald Folkvord told NRK.

With the number of sleeps until Christmas Day swiftly dwindling (shrieks), it's time to write a list, check it twice, fight the crowds and buy some gifts, whether it be for you or someone special! But with the beauty world being an overwhelming place at the best of times, the festive season means there's a million and one products all fighting for your attention – and money. I've gathered up the products I think would make some wonderful gifts to unwrap under the tree, no matter what your price range is. From the budget beauty junkies, to to pamper queens, to the high-end heroes, there's a little something for every beauty lover in this year's gift guide! If you enjoy this post, please give it a “like” so I know, and let's get into the gift giving!
RELATED: 2016 Affordable Gift Guide | 2016 High-end Gift Guide
ColourPop Cosmetics
With their constantly growing collection of products, amazing quality and ridiculously affordable price points, it's no surprise the entire brand of ColourPop is at the top of my beauty wish list! I can't recommend ColourPop enough, but since they have heaps of products, here are my top picks!
Super Shock Shadows ($5 each) – These shadows are little cream pots and they're outrageously pigmented, one swipe is all you need for a stunning eyeshadow look! There are heaps of colours to choose from too, but the ones I've pictured above are (from the top) Moonwalk, Kathleen Lights and Fluffy.
Double Entendre Eyeshadow Palette ($16) – If traditional pressed eyeshadows in a palette is more your style, ColourPop has your back. They've recently been releasing a tone of eyeshadow palettes and I couldn't be more excited. I own a few of their pressed single shadows (which are $4 each) in a little empty Z Palette and adore their quality. They have heaps of palettes in a tone of different colour selections. I've featured the Double Entendre palette above, but that's only because I've bought it for myself for Christmas!
Supernova Shadows ($7 each) – In order to qualify for free shipping, I threw a couple of the new liquid Supernova eyeshadows in my cart because I've heard such good things about them, and that they're a dupe for the expensive Stila Magnificent Metals Liquid Eyeshadows. I swatched them lightly on the back of my hand and they're crazily pigmented, metallic and shimmery and they dried down in an instant! While I haven't tried them on my eyes yet, I've heard wonderful reviews, so I think they're the perfect little gift as they're quite special, and perfect for New Years Eve! Picture above is one of the shades I bought called Walk of Fame.
Zoeva
Zoeva Eyeshadow Palettes ($38) – We're entering a higher price category, but I think these Zoeva palettes are such good value for money. I've featured above the Cocoa Blend palette (the top on the top, and I own it) and the Caramel Melange palette (which I eventually want). Zoeva is such a high quality brand and their brushes are sensational. When I saw they had palettes, I automatically assumed they would be around the $70 mark. How wrong was I! Their 10 pan palettes are $38 and they're amazing quality. I always rave on about how much I love their Cocoa Blend palette, so I can't recommend them enough.
Kylie Cosmetics
Velvet Lipsticks ($16/$27) – I've tried a lot of products from Kylie Cosmetics and can confirm her Velvets and Glosses are amazing. The Velvets, which bought without the lip liner are $16 and with are $27, are amazing! They are so comfortable to wear on the lips (not at all dry like her matte shades), she has heaps of colours that all look really flattering, they wear off really evenly so you don't get a weird line around your lips, and I also think they make my lips look really plush and nice! Above I've featured the terracotta shade Dazzle. If you're a lipstick junkie and haven't tried them yet, I highly recommend them!
Glosses ($15) – I own a couple Kylie Glosses and I think they're incredible too. My favourite shade, which I've featured above, is Damn Gina as it's a pinky peachy shimmer shade that looks so gorgeous on the lips and would suit heaps of skin tones. Her glosses are so smooth, pigmented, comfortable and have really good wear time! Plus, the KoKo Kollection packaging is so gorgeous being all gold.
Zoella Beauty
Winter Wonderhand Hand Cream ($10) – If you're more into pampering yourself, then there are an abundance of products out for the festive season! I think the Zoella Beauty brand is great for either yourself or someone else, especially if that person is a fan of Zoe! She has an entire Christmas range out which includes every kind of product from shower gels, bath fizzers, bath milks, moisturisers, exfoliators, and more! I bought her original WonderHand Hand Cream and really love it, so that's why I've featured her 2017 Christmas one above! If you live in Australia, you can find her products in Target.
Lush Cosmetics
Gift Sets – It wouldn't be a beauty/skincare gift guide without featuring Lush! Along with their expensive range of skin care, they have heaps and heaps (and heaps) of gift sets for the Christmas season, all at different prices and all beautifully wrapped for you. I also think their gift sets make wonderful Secret Santa gifts as you get heaps of different products at any price point. The set I've featured above is the $34.95 Deck the Halls gift set which features a small bottle of The Comforter shower gel (which is one of my favourites and they're discontinuing it – cries), the Plum Snow bath bomb and the Shooting Star bath bomb.
GlamGlow
Let It Glow! Supermud Set ($98) – This GlamGlow set launches us straight into the High-end section of this gift guide! The price is wild, but I've included it because it's actually great value. GlamGlow is a super high-end skincare brand that specialises in face masks. While you can buy their 15g face mask tubs for $27, their 50g tubs are $98! This gift set, however, is also $98 and you get one full sized product and three mini's, all for the price of one full sized item. Inside you get: 1 full-size Supermud Clearing Treatment, 1 mini Youthmud Tinglexfoliate Treatment, 1 mini Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment and 1 mini GravityMud Firming Treatment. Even though the price is high, you can't deny the value! It's perfect gift if you want to try out heaps of GlamGlow products.
Stila Studded Eight Stays All Day Liquid Lipstick Set ($66) – Now onto some high-end gifts! Stila always comes out with gift sets that are great value for money, so I highly recommend looking into them if you want to try out heaps of products from the brand. One of the sets that's still in stock is this 8 piece liquid lipstick set which any beauty junkie would love. These are mini versions of their full sized liquid lipsticks that literally stay on all day! They have heaps of colours, so it's a great addition to your collection! They also have sets like this featuring three shades for $29, but I think they're all sold out.
Stila Magnificent Metals Glitter & Glow Liquid Eye Shadow ($35) – If I wasn't saving for a trip to Europe soon I would have instantly bought the Magnificent Metals mini three piece set that came out this year for $36! However, they sold out super fast because it was great value for money. Even though I have not tried them, and literally just bought and recommended the ColourPop dupe, I didn't want to leave the full sized Magnificent Liquid Eyeshadows off this gift guide! I have not heard one bad thing about these liquid eyeshadows. They're incredibly pigmented, shimmery, don't have any fall out and just take every look to the next level and beyond. Plus, they have some serious unique shades, like the one I've featured above, which is called Sunset Cove.
Too Faced Under The Kissletoe The Ultimate Liquified Lipstick Set ($36) – If you're thinking of trying out some Too Faced lipsticks or love their formulas and shade ranges, I think this gift set is amazing value! Most full sized Too Faced liquid lipsticks are $35 each, so this set for one more dollar gives you a mini lipstick in four different formulas! It includes a Melted lipstick, a Melted Chocolate liquid lipstick, a Melted Matte liquid lipstick and one of their new Melted Latex liquid lipsticks.
Hourglass Ambient Lighting Edit Palette Vol. 3 ($117) – One year I will buy the annual Hourglass Ambient Lighting Edit Palettes they bring out, but 2017 is not that year. Like I mentioned before, I'm saving, so while I won't be dropping $117 on this palette full of blushes, powders, bronzers and highlighters, it doesn't mean I can't recommend it! So many people adore these palettes and they're quite good value, as if you were to buy all these products individually, it would cost a lot more. Plus, this year's palette is in stunning rose gold packaging.
Zoeva Rose Golden Luxury Set ($126) – I absolutely adore my Zoeva brushes as I asked for this set for my 18th, and I'm nearly 20 (screams) and they are just as good as the day I got them, and I used them every single day! The price you pay is well and truly justified in their performance. The brushes are so soft, perfectly made, stunning to look at and just make applying makeup so effortless and fun. It's really obvious and annoying when a brush is hard or spikey, but these Zoeva brushes, which are made in Italy by the way, are super soft, so I recommend them even more if you're looking for eyeshadow brushes.
So that wraps up (get it) my affordable and high-end gift guide! What items are on your Christmas wish list? Leave me a comment below, I'd love to know and get some more gift ideas!
I really hope you find this post useful, so if you did enjoy it, please give it a “like” so I know!

The battle against climate change starts in your psyche
Film | by Jorge Ignacio Castillo
Metamorphosis
Roxy Theatre
Opens July 13
Environmental documentaries are a tough sell. Our planet is collapsing in so many areas it's hard for a single film to cover the crises. On top of that, given that the news is immensely bad there's an inherent doom-and-gloom sentiment that's not particularly appealing.
The plucky NFB-backed doc Metamorphosis doesn't quite clear the hurdles but it stays more focused than most of its kind. Filmmakers Velcrow Ripper (ScaredSacred) and Nova Ami pick a metaphor and stick to it: the resilient monarch butterfly as a hopeful stand-in for mankind.
Like monarch larvae, humanity faces an inevitable metamorphosis. Climate change is putting people from around the world in critical situations, from Venice's population dwindling due to high tides, to California dealing water scarcity and wildfires, to Vanuatu getting decimated by a hurricane. A transformation is coming, and it's up to us to decide into what. Metamorphosis suggests that climate change plays in our minds as grief over the planet's mortality, often leading to denial. To overcome it, a psychological adjustment may be in order.
While the documentary hits some perfunctory notes (like the unavoidable hopeful ending), Metamorphosis remains grounded by linking factoids to human testimonies. The images of the planet in distress are stunning. Overall, it's a worthy effort that stops short of being preachy. It could've used a bit more flavour, though.

In India, Infectious Disease are the major causes of Deaths, which account for more than half of all deaths in children. An important contributing factor to the enormous burden of ill health is the lack of access to good quality diagnostic testing. Diagnostic lab is an important component in healthcare.
Most critical treatment decisions are based on diagnostic lab results and with the advent of Information Technology and Computer, people are becoming more and more health conscious. So it became very important to choose your diagnostic centre wisely. The Most Desirable characteristics of the best diagnostic labs are as follows-
Reliability – Reliability is considered to be one of the most important factor while choosing up of the best diagnostic lab, as your doctor will provide you the medication based on these test only. Keeping the reliability factor is mind, one of the leading chains of diagnostic centre, 3HCare, provide the detail accreditation of the diagnostic labs available on this online portal which ensure transparency too. After the advent of 3HCare, it has been observed that there has been an increase in the number of people coming forward for their preventive health checkups.
Accessibility – Easy accessibility for all has proved to be a boon especially for elderly people who find it difficult to visit the diagnostic centre early morning, empty stomach. The advancement of technology eradicates the need of going to lab for appointments and collection of report , as the report is mailed to you. 3HCare maintain the complete data base of the patient for easy access as well as future consultations.
Get tested at convenient Time- Busy working professionals does not get enough time to go for the health checkups at desired location. The online technology helps in scheduling their test as per their time availability. The price transparency at 3HCare portal helps in creating awareness of the best prices and offers available at all the diagnostic labs.
CA (Dr) Ruchi Gupta, Founder and CEO, 3hcare.in says ‘Early diagnosis and treatment not only reduces the risk of patient developing long term complications but for disease such as TB, HIV and many more reduces the chances of transmission of disease to other members of community'. So while opting for a diagnostic lab the following things should be kept in mind kept in mind
Expertise – Experience and skill are the two most important aspects that should be kept in mind while choosing the diagnostic labs. Both these aspects ensure accurate results. The pathologist and lab technicians should be skilled and experienced.
Accuracy of Report- There is no space for human error when it comes to diagnostic test. It is essential that the test reports should be accurate without any error as, the wrong treatment will cost serious consequences
Latest Technology – The test should be done using the latest technology as it will help in providing high quality diagnostic services. At the same time the pathologists and lab technicians should be given proper knowledge on how to operate these latest technology and heavy machinery.
Patient diagnosed early can and learn strategies and tips to better cope and manage with the symptoms and the disease. Early diagnosis is the key to live higher quality of life for the person afflicted, less stress for family and more time to treasure the present and prepare for the future.
Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council has backed a motion to allow a circus which uses animals for entertainment to set up in the borough next month.
At last night's meeting of the local authority, members discussed an application from Tom Duffy's Circus to set up at Jordanstown Lough Shore Park.
It is understood horses and dogs are to be used during performances at the local beauty spot.
During the debate, Alliance representative, Cllr John Blair voiced his opposition to the proposal, however, the majority of members backed the recommendation to allow the circus to use the site on June 6 and 10.
Speaking to the Newtownabbey Times after the meeting, Cllr Blair said: “I am opposed to the use of council property being used in this way and I am opposed to animals being used for entertainment in principle.
“I am flabbergasted at the stance taken by SDLP and Sinn Fein representatives in supporting the motion.
“Some unionist members continued to back this type of entertainment, but I am pleased other unionist councillors from the UUP, DUP and TUV opposed it along with my colleague Cllr Billy Webb.
“Hundreds of constituents have voiced concerns about this issue in the past and although animals will be at this circus, I will keep opposing their use as entertainment for humans.”
His party colleague, Cllr Neil Kelly was unable to attend the meeting at Antrim Civic Centre. Taking to Facebook, Cllr Kelly said: “As you know I oppose animal circus acts and have protested outside Duffy's Circus on many occasions with fellow activists from Northern Ireland Says No To Animal Cruelty (NISNTAC).
“Well done to my party colleague John Blair for raising this issue last night. We fell short on the vote, but will continue the fight.”
In a statement, a council spokesman said: “Council approved the request by Tom Duffy's circus on May 29 to use the facilities at Lough Shore Park, Jordanstown with the normal arrangements to be met.
“Council doesn't hold any information on the impact on the local economy. No complaints have been received.”

Over the weekend, we were treated to a UFC event light on pretense and heavy on action. The best fought the best, or at least the best available. Hardly anybody beefed. Demetrious “Mighty Mouse” Johnson fought a perfect fight. Refreshing as the event was, however, it felt like an island surrounded by bullshit-strewn waters.

I haven't written about MMA in a bit. Reason being, the UFC's early-year dry spell transformed into a full-on drought, and it's been a while since I've felt compelled to say much beyond, “That sure was a fight” and “Hell yeah, Derrick Lewis.” But at the end of UFC on Fox 24 (UFC events are ostensibly named by the same person who comes up with Kingdom Hearts titles), I came away thinking, “That actually mattered.” And not just because Demetrious “Mighty Mouse” Johnson made actual history, becoming the first fighter to ever tie Anderson Silva's record of ten consecutive title defenses.
I came away thinking, “That actually mattered.”
For brevity's sake, I'm gonna focus on the last three fights on the card. First, we had relentless submission machine Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza vs Robert “Jackhammer Hands” Whittaker. Before the fight, Jacare, having dismantled a who's-who of UFC middleweights, was in a place where he really could've just sat on the sidelines and waited for a title shot to come to him, but he decided he wanted to stay busy. Whittaker wasn't being positioned as a sacrificial lamb, exactly, but most people figured Jacare would tear off one of Whittaker's arms, beat him to death with it, and then autograph the arm and hurl it into the crowd.
Instead, Whittaker took Jacare apart, surgically dissecting him on the feet and spending just enough time on the ground to take away Jacare's safety net. Jacare never looked lost or like he was incapable of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, but it was clear that momentum was on Whittaker's side. He ended the fight with a sneaky head-kick and follow-up punches, sending the middleweight heir apparent tumbling back down the ladder. Don't get me wrong: I love Jacare, but seeing a young fighter like Whittaker put his whole game together and smartly dispatch one of the sport's most consistent killers is a heck of a treat. It was a rare “young gun beats aging vet” moment that didn't leave me feeling gross afterward. Jacare's not done yet. He looked like a world-beater in other recent fights. He just met somebody who'll probably end up champion at some point, a kid who saw an opportunity to prove that and pushed himself from “good” to “great,” or perhaps even “downright scary.”
After that, Rose Namajunas, a strawweight whose entire fight career has pretty much occurred with UFC cameras on her, took on a woman who made her name before the UFC's strawweight division even existed in Michelle “The Karate Hottie” Waterson. Despite veteran status, however, Waterson is still pretty young and has plenty of fight left in her. Namajunas, on the other hand, has repeatedly fallen just short of greatness, losing an early career title fight because she was just too raw and dropping a recent fight to recent title challenger Karolina Kowalkiewicz because she just couldn't quite find her rhythm. People started to worry that maybe Namajunas was a habitual choker, that she could compete with the best, but would forever fall short because she couldn't keep her head on straight in the cage.
This time, though, a focused, magnificently slick Namajunas showed up. She gamely navigated Waterson's labyrinth of rangy strikes and locked in an absolutely brutal rear-naked choke on the ground. Waterson struggled valiantly to muscle her way out of it, but had to tap when she started to turn colors that don't technically exist on the visible light spectrum. Much like Whittaker in the previous fight, Namajunas had her breakthrough moment. To hear UFC president Dana White tell it, her next fight will be a title shot.
Mighty Mouse took angle after angle every time Reis tried to engage, to the point that Reis stopped fully throwing his punches because, fuck it, it's not like they were gonna land anyway.
The best performance of the night, though, undoubtedly belonged to flyweight champion Demetrious “Mighty Mouse” Johnson, who looked almost entirely untouchable against a very talented grappler in Wilson Reis. Words don't really do the fight justice. Mighty Mouse's preposterous speed was on full display, and he took angle after angle every time Reis tried to engage, to the point that Reis stopped fully throwing his punches because, fuck it, it's not like they were gonna land anyway. At times, Mighty Mouse ended up behind Reis, such was the speed disparity between them. By the third round, a visibly busted-up Reis got taken down by a Mighty Mouse who looked like he just woke up from a perfect Sunday afternoon nap. Once derided for not finishing fights, Mighty Mouse quickly worked to full mount and rained down punches and elbows until Reis haphazardly tossed up an arm. Mighty Mouse locked in an arm bar, and that was that. Reis, the feared ground fighter, tapped, and Mighty Mouse beat yet another challenger at their own game while hardly breaking a sweat.
It was a sublime performance, one of the finest I've ever seen. Mighty Mouse might not be the number one best striker, wrestler, or grappler ever, but he's second-to-none in the way he puts it all together. His transitions are a thing of obscene beauty. There are no seams. He just flows. Bruce Lee once said to be as water. Mighty Mouse is a tidal wave, and no matter how hard his opponents fight, they all drown in the end.

In a post-fight speech just as rapid fire as the fight itself, Mighty Mouse—typically a humble dude, or at least measured in his self-aggrandization—declared himself the GOAT. “GSP and Anderson Silva were great champions, but I'm the best to ever step foot in this Octagon,” he said.
It was an amazing moment, history in the making. Silva was a godly striker in his prime, and GSP could blast people's torsos off their legs with his takedowns, but neither exemplified the sport of MMA the way Mighty Mouse does. In my mind, that makes him the best ever. No question.

UFC on Fox 24 (lol) was filled with good, consequential fights and, for the most part, what happened in the octagon stayed in the octagon. It was an event centered around an incredible champ cementing his legacy and hard-working contenders finally breaking through. It felt like a blast from the past in that respect, a card from a time before money fights and spectacle were the main order of the day, as opposed to a relative (but fun) rarity. That's not to say it's an intrinsically bad thing that the UFC is moving in a more entertainment-focused direction. It's just nice to occasionally see a card that's purely about sport.
And yet, this was still very much a “UFC in the year 2017" event. Case in point: Robert Whittaker ain't getting a title shot any time soon, deserving though he might be. Middleweight, undoubtedly one of the UFC's deepest divisions right now, has been transformed into a staging ground for circus fights. First, miracle champ Michael Bisping battled Dan “A Fossilized Slab Of Beef Jerky” Henderson to a predictable decision, and now he's set to tango with a fresh-out-of-retirement George St-Pierre, despite the fact that GSP 1) is old, and 2) has never fought at middleweight. So while Whittaker picked up a huge win on Saturday, he's stuck waiting and will probably have to fight Yoel “Literally The Incredible Hulk” Romero before getting a title shot. Right now, everyone in the middleweight top five is treading water, all for the sake of one “fun” fight. It's a weird, frustrating logjam that makes multiple fights feel like they don't matter. And sure, I imagine GSP-Bisping will be a fun fight that does decent numbers, but when the dust finally settles, will it have been worth it?
Then there's the continually depressing matter of Mighty Mouse, a once-in-a-lifetime champ the UFC's never been able to figure out. And sure, we can run down a checklist of hypothetical reasons for that—he's too dominant, he's too respectful, he's too smol, etc—but that's mostly horseshit. Mighty Mouse is a character. He's managed to attract a big audience to his Twitch video game streams, and yet the UFC only just figured out that they could use that to promote him. That's nutting to me. Twitch is one of the things young people watch now. You want to attract new people to the sport of MMA? Look no further.

Much has been written this year about the UFC's dearth of star power. Ronda Rousey seems to have flown the coop for good, and Conor McGregor is off chasing Floyd Mayweather around the world on a magic carpet made of cash. The two golden children are gone. What's the UFC to do? How can a massive corporation with a multi-million dollar marketing budget possibly recover?
In my eyes, though, the real issue is that the UFC only knows how to promote a few types of personalities and fights, even though their organization is overflowing with bizarre and interesting characters. Especially under the new management of WMG-IME, the UFC repeatedly goes for low-hanging fruits—the cocky trash talker, the “scary” knockout artist, the long-passed-their-prime big name, the hometown hero—instead of pushing into unexplored territory. And yeah, I know, it's not really reasonable to expect a big corporation to go very far outside the box, but the UFC's in the midst of desperate times, and desperate times call for something that's not the exact approach that got you here in the first place.
The UFC continues to walk this precarious line between sport and entertainment—with the balance shifting ever further in the latter direction—but they're not good at it yet.
Could somebody like Mighty Mouse become a bigger star off the back of a history-making title run and Twitch pseudo-stardom? I honestly don't know. What bothers me, though, is that the UFC doesn't really seem to care enough to find out. The UFC continues to walk this precarious line between sport and entertainment—with the balance shifting ever further in the latter direction—but they're not good at it yet. Mighty Mouse might represent what the UFC used to be about—a champion who fights for the sake of pure achievement—but he also represents what it could become: an entertainment-sport hybrid that does more than rehash the characters and storylines that worked for boxing and pro wrestling. Instead of pursuing that, though, the UFC has mostly been alternating between confusing and boring lately, and I don't think any type of fan wants to watch that.

Andre Green has revealed his next two objectives after signing a new deal at Aston Villa.
The talented teenager agreed fresh terms on a two-year contract and revealed his delight in an interview with the Birmingham Mail.
But the driven winger isn't resting on his laurels and explained how this season will not be complete without a return to full fitness and promotion back to the Premier League.
Green wants to be back in action by the start of next month after finally shaking off a hamstring injury.
And he's desperate to showcase his skills back in the top-flight next season.
“I've only played two games in the Premier League but it's where everyone wants to be,” he said.
“It's the biggest league in the world and I want to be there performing on the main stage.
“For us to be back there, it will be great for the club.
“Winning promotion is massive. Everyone knows we've got the squad capable to get up and we're all confident.
“We're in good form.
“We've got the belief there which is important.
“We belong in the Premier League so that's our target now.”
Green made his debut in the top-flight during Villa's fatal 2015/16 season.
Substitute appearances against Tottenham Hotspur and Swansea City kickstarted a career that has since blossomed, making him one of the stand-out youngsters at the club.
The Solihull-born star has all the attributes to succeed - he's quick, powerful, skilful and has found a way to set up and score goals for the first-team.
It's why Villa have rewarded him with a new deal and are excited to see what the future holds.
“I'm delighted that it's sorted and is all done,” he said.
“I've always wanted to play for Villa so to sign another contract and be here for longer is a big thing for me and my family.
“Hopefully with a few more years on my contract, I can get my head down and play many more games and score and set up goals again.”
Green started the season in the team and scored his first senior goal in the 4-2 win against Norwich City.
But successive hamstring injuries (on each leg) thwarted his early progress and he hasn't featured in the league for six months.
Good news for the 19-year-old is that he's not far away from a return, though.
“I'm getting there, I'm back in training now,” he said.
“It was only a little hamstring, no where near as bad as the last one.
“Hopefully I'll play a game (behind closed doors) in the international break and then I can kick on from that.
“I'm just a couple of weeks away now.
“In two or three weeks I want to be back in the team again and available for selection.
“That's my goal.”
Asked how it has felt to be watching on from the sidelines during the winter months, he replied:
“It's been frustrating.

“My goal was to get as many games, goals and assists this season but for that to be stopped through injury was frustrating.
“I went out to America to do my rehab (with kit manufacturer Under Armour).
“They were great. They offered it to me as part of a freshening-up process.
“I agreed that it would be good to change the environment, to get away from the same building, because it was a stressful time.
“It helped me to get away from it all.
“They had great facilities, just as good as here, so it was good to do some rehab because it can wear you down when you're injured doing the same thing every day.
“Now I'm feeling a lot better and I'm focusing on getting back to action.”
New contract
Andre Green has extended his contract at Aston Villa as he bids to return to action before the end of the season.
The 19-year-old today agreed new terms and extended his current deal until 2020.

Family man
Andre Green has extra motivation to succeed at Aston Villa as his grandad hasn't missed a game since he was four-years-old!
Earlier this season he said:
“When I got my first senior start – I felt I did well and made my family proud,” he said.
“My grandad hasn't missed a game since I was four years old.
“Before my first start league against Preston I had a dream about scoring a header and I had that chance.
“I couldn't believe it!
“If I'd scored in front of the Holte End, it would've been amazing.
“Hearing the Holte End sing my name gave me goose bumps - it was a strange feeling, I loved it!
“I used to sit in the Trinity Road and hear them sing.
“For me to receive that standing ovation was amazing.”
Green has since gone on to get his first goal and admitted it was another proud moment.

LOS ANGELES (AP) " E3, the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, has opened in Los Angeles with thousands of video game enthusiasts, analysts and industry representatives in attendance to play and show off the latest technology that will soon be hitting store shelves.
The show, which opened Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, has typically only been open to those in the industry and media that cover it. But this year organizers allowed 15,000 members of the general public onto the show floor.
Analysts say one of the biggest announcements this year came from Microsoft with the release of its Xbox One X, claimed to be the most powerful gaming console ever made. It's intended to push the boundaries of gaming to make even more realistic visuals, said Ian Sherr, executive editor at CNET News.
Wellingborough's Tingdene Homes and Leisuredays joined forces for their annual Charity Golf Event at Kenilworth Golf Club, raising £510 for the Alzheimer's Society.
A total of 21 golfers hit the green for an enjoyable afternoon, with six all looking to be the winners.
Hot buffet was served in the club house afterwards, where prizes were awarded to the winners, those ‘nearest the pin' and various other categories.
Steve Ekins, business development manager for Tingdene Homes and Gareth Walker, head of Leisuredays development said they were thrilled to hand over such a substantial cheque to Lloyd Butcher, community fundraiser for Alzheimer's Society.
The cat's in the bag.
A woman walked out of a Harlem animal shelter with a rare Persian kitten in her purse after she found out she could not legally have the cat because it had already been adopted.
The thief was one of several people trying to adopt Snow, a 1.5-year-old white Persian, from the Animal Care Centers of NYC shelter at 326 E. 110th Street on Saturday.
Officials told her the cat was spoken for, but the cat-napper was able to pinch the puss around 1:15 p.m., because there were so many people perusing the shelter that afternoon, a spokeswoman told DNA Info.
“A lot of people were arguing trying to adopt the animal,” ACC rep Katy Hansen told the web site. “That kind of cat… is really sought after.”
Snow was still in the shelter because he was waiting to be neutered, which is required by state law before adoption.
ACC gets about 100 such cats each year, Hansen told DNAInfo.
The pricey cats are sometimes sold for $500 and up.
The thief could make money breeding Snow since he was not fixed, according to Hansen.
According to Maiko, excavations were carried out in the Ust-Alminsk necropolis near the village of Peschanoe in the Bakhchsarai district.
“These are findings which — in their class and quality — are similar to those currently kept by the Netherlands…. This is primarily jewelry, also from yellow metal,” Maiko said.
In early February, the collection of Scythian gold was loaned from four Crimean museums by Allard Pearson's museum in Amsterdam. The artefacts were exhibited in the Netherlands when the Crimean crisis erupted.
The row over the valuable collection totaling 2,000 pieces sparked off after Crimea voted in a March 2014 referendum to leave Ukraine and reunite with Russia. Kiev and its allies see the region “as an occupied territory.”
Following these events, the Russian and Ukrainian sides both claimed the collection as belonging to them, so that a Dutch court had to decide whom the artifacts should be returned to: the Crimean museums or Ukraine.
An Amsterdam district court ruled last month to send the treasures, contributed by Crimea's four lending museums, to Kiev, but the Crimean side filed an appeal. A new court hearing is expected to be held in October 2017.
The collection is worth over $1.5 million.

Researchers have created tiny, resealable synthetic packets similar to Ziploc bags that can release their contents on cue—in this case, when exposed to light of a particular wavelength. Such technology could be useful for medicine or other applications, the researchers say.
“One could imagine making these to custom-deliver medicine to specific parts of the body, or to release fertilizer or cleanup chemicals in the soil, for example,” says Juan de Pablo, a professor at the University of Chicago's Institute for Molecular Engineering.
The team designed a hollow synthetic packet that is just tens to hundreds of nanometers across—so tiny that thousands could sit side by side in the period at the end of this sentence.
The packet's skin is made up of a double layer of two long molecules called polymers: The outer rind is water-soluble, while the inner layer is a glassy material that forms a rigid wall. The two polymers are linked by a single molecule that responds to light by changing its shape.
When researchers shine light on the packet, the linking molecules change shape, softening the glassy material that sits below and allowing the contents of the packet to slip out. Once the light turns off, the glass solidifies again and the packet is resealed.
The researchers imagine applications such as targeted medical treatments: Fill the packets with medicine, wait until they're circulating in the body, then shine a light on the specific part of the body and watch the packets release the medicine.
Both parts of the molecule are biocompatible and already used in implants and medical treatments: The outside is polyethylene oxide, a polymer used in cosmetics, toothpaste and medications today; and the interior lining is polylactic acid, which can be derived from corn starch and degrades to lactic acid, a natural compound in the body.
The collaboration is expanding to explore more molecules that could be designed to react to different triggers, such as light, pressure, or chemical cues, which could expand the range of potential uses.
“The surprise was this insight that a single light-sensitive layer, measuring less than one nanometer but lying on top of otherwise very long molecules tightly packed onto a thick glass, can create a perturbation in the entire material,” de Pablo says.
A deeper understanding of such mechanisms could provide the foundations for more new materials with useful properties. De Pablo and his collaborators are using sophisticated molecular simulations to decipher those mechanisms, he says.
The research appears in Nature Chemistry. The research team also included researchers from the University of Massachusetts. The US Army Research Office funded the research.

The global composite industry has been expanding significantly in terms of production, technological advancements, and developments. Thermoset resin plays a vital role in the composite industry. Thermoset resins are used extensively in the manufacture of composites; these resins are employed in the fabrication of products for end-use industries such as aerospace, automotive, sporting goods, construction, electronics, and wind energy. The thermoset resin market can be segmented into six resin types: polyester resin, epoxy resin, vinyl ester resin, phenolic, polyurethane, and high temperature resins (such as cyanate ester).
Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/thermoset-resins-market.html
Thermoset resins exhibit characteristics such as mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and low weight. These resins are used widely in various applications. Thermoset resins form long polymer chains and can be easily customized as per the requirements of end products. Thermoset resins offer many advantages. These include balance of numerous properties such as mechanical & chemical stability and dimensional stability; low cost; and easy processing, and handling. The vinyl ester resin segment accounts for significant share of the thermoset resin market. Vinyl ester resins are less susceptible to damage caused by hydrolysis. Therefore, these resins are used in the manufacture of corrosion-resistant containers such as fiberglass tanks and FRP pipes. Vinyl ester resins are also employed in grating applications.
The epoxy resin segment also holds key share of the thermoset resin market. Epoxy resins are used in various applications; for instance, they are employed in coatings, adhesives & composite materials, and fiberglass reinforcements. Epoxy coating dries quickly; hence, it provides a strong and durable protective coating with excellent abrasion resistance. It can also be applied for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings, which are employed in the hydrocarbon industry. Phenolic resins emit less amount of smoke and have lower toxicity levels as compared to other thermoset resins.

Hun Sen fears my presence
Letter to the editor
Your article titled Rainsy, 2 others get five years (the Phnom Penh Post, December 28) exposes a serious inconsistency of the Hun Sen government when it comes to repression on its critics.
By having me sentenced to an increasing number of years in prison and after having issued an arrest warrant against me, the government should logically try to extradite me from any countries I am travelling through so as to force me to serve in a prison in Cambodia the many jail sentences handed down on me. But instead, they have officially and illegally exiled me and banned me from coming back to Cambodia through a warning issued last October to all airline companies that any planes carrying me will not be allowed to land in Cambodia.
This blatant contradiction in the government's political and judicial gesticulation shows that the sentences handed down on me were politically motivated. It is crystal clear that Hun Sen just wants to discard me from the electoral process, meaning that he fears my presence.
Due to Cambodia's Westminster-style parliamentary system, my absence as opposition leader from the national elections in 2018 would leave Hun Sen unchallenged in his bid to retain the role of prime minister, thus making any government stemming from such ridiculous elections illegitimate and unstable.

The impact of China's ban on taking many of New Zealand's recyclable materials has spurred the government to set up a taskforce to deal with the impact.
Source: istock.com
Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage said today in a statement that China's ban had a greater than expected impact.
"We need a coordinated response from central and local government, together with the waste and business sectors," she said.
Fifteen million kilograms of waste materials including mixed recyclables had been sent to China from New Zealand each year, prior to the ban.
"The ban has had deeper impacts than anticipated and the recycling sector is facing rising pressure from the significant drop in global commodity prices," Ms Sage said.
"It is clear that this situation is not sustainable."
"Several small stockpiles of recyclable materials have been building around the country, where smaller operators don't have ready access to alternative markets," Ms Sage said.
She said the government is currently using funds from the waste levy to invest in projects such as onshore recycling plants.
The industry pertaining to solar energy is prospering on the back of increased emphasis on renewable energy across the world, and consequently, the specialized cables that are required by the solar panels in a photovoltaic system is cultivating a market that is simultaneously gaining traction.
According to a recent business and commerce study by Transparency Market Research, a number of companies operating in related fields have noticed the lucrativeness of the solar cable market and are making a foray into it to make the competitive landscape highly fragmented. The analysts of the report have identified Huber+Suhner AG, General Cable Corporation, Havells, Atkore International Group, Inc., Lumberg Connect GmbH, ReneSola Ltd, Ram Ratna Wires Ltd., Taiyo Cable Tech Co., Ltd., Prysmian Group, Allied Wire & Cable, and Lapp Group as some of the most prominent companies who are currently ahead of the curve in the global solar cable market.
As per the evaluations of the TMR report, the global solar cable market was worth US$465.71 mn in 2015. The analysts have projected the demand to expand at an impressive CAGR of 14.1% during the forecast period of 2017 to 2025, by the end of which the opportunities will translate into a revenue of US$1,641.92 mn. For the market leaders to maintain their shares, or even to add onto it, they will have to price their products appropriately for them to be affordable for larger masses.
While they indulge into the research and development of efficient and low-cost products, the leaders of the solar cable market cannot ignore the ground they can gain via mergers and acquisitions. Strategic partnerships will not only help them expand their geographical presence but also strengthen their distribution network.
Get brochure for latest technological advancements https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=36419
Improving the longevity of the cables is another route of innovation for the market leaders. For instance, Havells offers solar cables that can last up to 30 years under tough external conditions, withstand fire and UV radiations, and are flexible as well as fully recyclable. On the other hand, General Cable, one of the highly reputed names in this market, offers its SunGen® PV Wire that are easy to be installed and are durable for a long time.
Based on product type, the TMR report segments the solar cable market into aluminum alloy and copper, whereas on the basis of cable type, the market has been bifurcated into solid and stranded. Application-wise, the analysts have evaluated the opportunities that can be expected from solar panels wiring, underground service entrances, and service terminal connections. End-user classification of the market has been done into commercial, residential, and industrial. Geographically, Asia Pacific has been highlighted as the most profitable region, projected to provide for a revenue of US$1047.73 mn by 2025.

Growing awareness regarding the dangers posed by greenhouse gas emission and limitations of fossil fuel reserves, which has escalated the urge to harness renewable energy resources, is the primary driver of the global solar cable market. Solar panel installations are also incrementing on the back of government support for ecofriendly measures.
In addition to that, decreasing cost of production and thereby the products, growing inclination of consumers to make their contribution for the environment, and lowering operating and maintenance costs are some of the other factors favoring the global solar cable market. On the other hand, strong need to enhance durability and higher cost of installation are obstructing the market in a moderate way.

That's for you, nan!
Jack Grealish's grandma was the inspiration for the Aston Villa star's first goal of the season.
Grealish scored Villa's final goal in the 3-2 Villa Park victory that keeps their Championship promotion charge rolling.
Having been booked (harshly) for an alleged dive in the penalty area, and clipped the crossbar with a curling shot, Grealish finally got the goal he deserved on 88 minutes.
The 22-year-old was in the right place at the right time to clinically volley home an Ahmed Elmohamady cross as Villa made hard work of seeing off the struggling Brewers.
Grealish has been in sparkling form recently, but the goal opened his account for the campaign and was his first since he scored on the final day of last season.
His dad Kevin predicted ahead of the match that Grealish would score because it was his nan's birthday - and Super Jack did not disappoint.
Kevin took to social media after the match to say
"Happy b'day, Maggie G. And a goal from. Jackie G. For you. Happy Birthday mom. Upthevilla."
The Grealishs had an executive box in the Trinity Road stand to mark the occasion and Grealish ran towards there to celebrate his goal.
MINI MATCH REPORT
Aston Villa continue to pile pressure on Derby County with a 3-2 victory over Burton Albion at Villa Park - but it was more tense than it needed to be.
Scott Hogan opened the scoring for Villa on 33 minutes, rounding off a flowing moved which included a delightful throughball from Robert Snodgrass.
Albert Adomah doubled the lead on 65 minutes when he squeezed in a header at the back post after Snodgrass floated a measured cross from the right.
The Brewers made the Villa Park faithful nervous by pulling one back through an Ahmed Elmohamady own goal on 71 minutes.
Moments earlier Jack Grealish was booked for an alleged dive when it looked like a penalty and the Brummie midfielder later hit the bar with a curling effort.
But Grealish got the goal he deserved in the 88th when he volleyed in emphatically after Elomhamady crossed from the right.
The scoring was not over yet as Brewers substitute Liam Boyce wriggled through to make it 3-2 in stoppage time.
Steve Bruce kept faith with the XI who started the midweek victory at Sheffield United and it paid off as Villa made it six wins on the spin for the first time since 1990.
Axel Tuanzebe was given his first run out as a Villa player with the Manhcester United loanee coming on as a substitute midway through the second-half.
The latest victory, in front of a crowd of 33,022 at Villa Park, leaves Villa in third, a point behind second-placed Derby.
PLAYER RATINGS
Sam Johnstone - 6
Aside Burton's two goals, Johnstone had a very quiet afternoon. A few decent stops which you'd expect him to make but nothing overly testing. Judging by his usual high standards, Johnstone might feel he could have done better with the second goal.
Ahmed Elmohamady - 6
An early lapse in concentration allowed Lloyd Dyer to break down the left but Elmohamady recovered to force his man wide, allowing Johnstone to make a comfortable stop at his near post.
The Egyptian grabbed an assist for Grealish's goal after being credited with Burton's first following a scrappy corner.
James Chester - 7
Chester was comfortable at the back for the most part but he and Terry will be disappointed with how Boyce got in to reduce the arrears late on.
John Terry - 6
Another solid outing from Villa's skipper and he even got involved going forward at one point in the second half, breaking out of defence and racing into the box. Unfortunately, the ball back to Terry wasn't perfect and he had to play it back into midfield.
Alan Hutton - 7
Hutton continued his fine run of form with a composed performance at left-back. The 33-year-old got forward when he could and provided a useful foil for Adomah.
Robert Snodgrass - 8*
Snodgrass enjoyed a wonderful January and he kicked off February in the same fashion. He instigated Hogan's opener by drifting inside from the right, exchanging passes with Grealish and Hourihane before sliding in Adomah to tee up Villa's No.9.
The Scot's second moment of magic created Villa's second goal. He delivered a delightful ball to Adomah at the far post midway through the second half and Villa's top scorer made no mistake.
Birkir Bjarnason - 7
Bjarnason's rasping drive from distance appeared to be heading for goal before it was superbly blocked en route. The Icelandic seems to have a knack for sniffing out danger which served him well, particularly during the first half.
The 29-year-old was extremely tidy and offered Terry and Chester vital protection.
Conor Hourihane - 7
The Irishman linked up well with Snodgrass and Grealish on occasions and looked to get in on the act but saw his best effort saved comfortably by Bywater.
Albert Adomah - 8
Adomah dropped a little below his incredibly high standards at Sheffield United in midweek but he was back on song today. He grabbed the assist for the opener with a beautifully timed cutback for Hogan and his performance went from strength to strength.
Given his remarkable goalscoring form, Adomah has been on a bit of a drought. Before his second half header doubled Villa's advantage the winger had gone more than a month without a goal.
That run is over, though, and he now has his 13th of the season which makes this his best ever goalscoring campaign.
Jack Grealish - 8
Villa's playmaker came within a whisker of his first goal of the season with a curling effort from distance which clipped the bar late on.
Grealish wasn't to be denied, though, and fired home late on with a well-taken volley.
Scott Hogan - 7
A simple tap-in gave Hogan his fifth goal in as many matches but his all-round play will have impressed Bruce today. His hold up play against two big central defenders in Ben Turner and Kyle McFadzean was excellent and he ran the channels well.
SUBS
Axel Tuanzebe (for Snodgrass, 67) - 7
A brief but effective debut at right-back for the on-loan Manchester United man. He teed up Elmohamady to cross for Grealish's strike, which proved to be decisive.
Josh Onomah (for Adomah, 67) - 6
Onomah struggled to make an impact on the game as Villa looked to see it out.
Mile Jedinak (for Hourihane, 83) - 6
Did the job that was asked of him as Villa secured three points.
Villa (4-4-1-1): J ohnstone; Elmohamady, Chester, Terry, Hutton; Snodgrass (Tuanzebe, 67), Bjarnason, Hourihane (Jedinak, 83), Adomah (Onomah, 67); Grealish; Hogan. Unused subs: Bunn, Taylor, Whelan, Davis
Burton (4-5-1): Bywater; Brayford, McFadzean, Turner (Boyce, 72), Flanagan (Murphy, 28 (Allen, 46)); Akins, Akpan, Naylor, Davenport, Dyer; Sordell. Unused subs: Campbell, Buxton, Barker, Sbarra
Attendance: 33,022
Next up: Birmingham City (h), Sunday 11 February, 12pm.
Primary school awarded £10,000 National Lottery grant
Caythorpe Primary School has received a £10,000 grant from The National Lottery Awards for All Scheme, which will enable it to install new play equipment in the reception classroom outdoor area.
The current outdoor area for the early year's children contains play equipment that is old and worn and has become unsafe. The school has also been unable to use the equipment in the winter months or when it is wet.
It plans to install a challenging play tower to encourage climbing and exercise, surrounded by all-weather rubber surfacing, so that children can play outdoors in all weather. Plans are also in place to provide interactive sensory play boards for children with special and additional needs.
Chair of governors for Caythorpe Primary School Simon Linforth said: “We are fortunate to have good sized play space areas at Caythorpe School, but now thanks to the Big Lottery funding, the variety of play equipment that has been proposed will give our reception pupils a fun, imaginative and educational experience on a daily basis. This will complement the input and effort of our dedicated teachers and the new play space will help to raise standards of teaching and learning to an even higher level, giving our new pupils the best possible start in their school lives.”
BIG Awards for All England offers grants of between £300 and £10,000 for projects that improve communities, and the lives of people within them.
AGRICULTURE Secretary Emmanuel Piñol on Monday said he had ordered the culling of fighting roosters and hens in six game farms affected by the H5 avian flu outbreak in Pampanga.
“All fowls will be culled,” Piñol told The Manila Times in a text message.
The agriculture chief, however, did not give an exact figure of the number of chickens that would be slaughtered.
The Department of Agriculture (DA) last week ordered strict quarantines and checkpoints as well as the culling of 400,000 chickens after declaring a bird flu outbreak in Pampanga, the country's first.
Six poultry farms in Pampanga province were affected and about 37,000 chicken layers have died because of the virus.
The Agriculture chief on Monday clarified that the country's importation of chicks, hatching eggs and other fowls would not be affected, as long as stringent quarantine protocols were observed.
At risk of infection
No animal-to-human transmissions have so far been reported, authorities said.
Assistant Secretary Enrique Tayag of the Department of Health (DoH) on Monday urged the public to observe precautions to avoid getting infected by avian flu.
“Those at risk of catching bird flu from affected fowls are the following: those handling the farms or those who took care of fowls that died due to bird flu, and those who cleaned the pens of affected chickens or chickens that died [because of bird flu], because you have to clean [the chickens],” he said.
“The virus may possibly be transmitted through the nose, mouth, the eyes. You might inhale it,” he said, but clarified the virus is not airborne.
There is still no report of virus transmission through the consumption of poultry products such as fried chicken or other chicken-based meals.
“There are no reports of people getting sick due to bird flu from eating chicken. That's because nobody eats raw chicken. They found out that if you cook the chicken, the virus will also be killed, so it is safe to eat because it is cooked,” he said.
The DoH recommends cooking chicken at 70 degrees Celcius and to make sure the chicken is well-done and without any red or pinkish parts.
The Health department also released guidelines on the proper preparation of poultry products.
It said raw food products should be separated from ready-to-eat meals. Cooks should use different chopping boards for raw meat and other food items, and regularly wash their hands and kitchen items used for food preparation.
Avian flu may cause diseases such as mild conjunctivitis or swelling of the eyes, severe pneumonia, and even death. Interaction with humans infected with the flu, however, does not result in “efficient transmission” between people.
The avian flu strains that have been known to jump to humans are the H5N1 and H5N7 subtypes, said Celia Carlos, director of the Health department's Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.
In the event of a human case, hospitals will follow the protocol used for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome – Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which means anyone who has flu-like symptoms must report to their local government unit so he or she can be taken to regional hospitals for isolation and monitoring.
Avoid migratory birds
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) also urged the public to avoid any contact with migratory birds amid the outbreak of the avian flu in Pampanga.
DENR Biodiversity Management Bureau Director Theresa Mundita Lim said close contact with wild birds risked transmission of the avian influenza virus.
Migratory birds stop briefly on wetlands such as swamps, marshes, intertidal and coastal areas, rivers, ponds, lakes and forests throughout the country, to rest and refuel for their journey.
Lim however discouraged the public from killing or poaching migratory birds “because this could only worsen the situation.”
The Philippines is a part of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, which is essential in providing areas for the temporary refuge of migratory birds.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Health on Monday called on the Agriculture and Health departments to continue monitoring areas where cases of bird flu have been reported and make sure the virus would not spread to other areas.
Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito said he had no plans to call for a Senate inquiry on the matter and would rather allow the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture to focus on containing the spread of bird flu.
He noted, however, reports that bird flu cases began as early as April in two poultry farms in Pampanga, but the owners did not report it.
“I think the DA and the DOH should investigate whether the owners of the said poultry farms were negligent in reporting,” Ejercito said.

Unique School rewards excellence, awards brilliant students
Motivation, they say, is an elixir for greater success as it encourages hardwork.
This, according to the principal, Unique Height School, Mrs. Oluwakemi Onochie, explains why the school management usually sets aside a day annually to honour its brilliant students referred to as Unique Scholars.
At the honour roll award/prefects inauguration held at the school premises in Isheri Magodo, Lagos, the principal explained further that the day is a special day adorned with the garment of success and festooned with the colour of distinction and a day of excellent fete stressing that it is a unique occasion for the unique students.
“Honour roll award in Unique Height is in its 7th edition this year. It is put together to reward students who cumulatively scored ‘A' grades in not less than 10 subjects including English and Mathematics at the Junior Secondary School level and ‘A' grades in not less than seven subjects including Mathematics and English at the Senior Secondary School level”, she said.
Such scholars, according to her, are distinguished from other students with their Blue ties different from the conventional wine-coloured tie worn by other students.
Chief Executive of Unique Height School, Mrs. Ebun Ayere-Alatise, said the honour roll award has encouraged healthy competition among the students as it encouraged them to work harder.
“When we started seven years ago, there were only 13 scholars but today we have 33 which means students are now striving to also wear the Blue-Tie as a mark of honour and Distinction, so what this has achieved for the school is that we are raising brilliant future leaders and parents are also reaping the fruits of their labour,” she said.
Chairman, Parents/Teachers Association, Mr. Adeniran Omoya, said the event helps students to compete favourably as it serves as a source of motivation for them.
“My son who is in primary school has been telling me that he will be attending Unique Height Secondary School and has vowed to win the Blue Tie, so the event encourages healthy competition among students and builds the spirit of excellence in them. I want to advise parents to always come together and cooperate with the school and not derail from its policy because it is what we get from the children that is our own value and reward for our labour on these children”, he said.

An estimated 100,000 spectators crowded the sidewalks along State Street on Saturday to take in the kaleidoscopic explosion of Santa Barbara's annual Summer Solstice Celebration.
This year's parade theme was “Creatures” so — naturally — floats, costumes and masks celebrated the wild things with horns, hooves, feathers and wings.
Barnyard animals, underwater organisms and even a Chinese-style dragon made the trek up State Street to Alameda Park but some of the most stunning costumes belonged to the feather-adorned dancers.
Lorna Kohler and her daughter, Zoe Carlson, have participated in the parade for four and five years, respectively, as part of the Brazilian Cultural Arts Center of Santa Barbara.
“I still have gold paint on my fingernails from helping paint the float, and my daughter's room is a costume shop right now,” Kohler said.
Their group went by the name “Capoeira Barizado” and featured drummers accompanying a plethora of dancers with Capoeira masters.
“Every year we bring in people from around the world,” Carlson said.
Kohler said most of them are of Brazillian descent, and stay in a house that was rented for them just for Solstice week.
The Santa Barbara Solstice Celebration attracts people from great distances but it's not lost on locals either.
Santa Barbara native Lola Rosales couldn't even recall how many Solstice Parades she's attended over the years, but she made sure to stake a claim to prime parade-viewing real estate in a shady area near Paseo Nuevo.
“I used to tell my daughter, whose birthday is the 21st, that I arranged a parade for her every year,” Rosales said.
Even though her daughter is grown now and has known the truth about “her parade,” they still made a point to watch the parade together this year.
Claudia Bratton, executive director of the Solstice Celebration, said it's incredibly rewarding to make “the greatest event of the year” in Santa Barbara free to the public.
“The parade is almost entirely funded by private donations and the participant fees,” she said.

Following the truck's recent reveal, Instagram user roymilloy managed to capture footage of the Tesla Semi cruising around the company's headquarters. Neither the truck nor the man behind the camera move through the parking lot at anything more than 15 mph, it seems, if the cameraman's heads-up display is any indication. But the footage does show that Tesla has at least one working prototype, and the video shows us a few other interesting details.Toward the end of the video, we see the left-hand door open up, revealing that the Tesla Semi uses rear-hinged "suicide" doors rather than conventional front-hinged versions. We're not sure if there's a real benefit to this design, or if it's a case of Tesla being different for different's sake. Along those same lines are the tires at the back of the truck. While many semi-trucks use a dually tire configuration on the rear axles, this prototype seems to have a single tire on each side of the rear axles.The video also reveals that, as our resident trucking expert Jonathan Ramsey feared, both side windows don't roll down. Instead, they just pop out slightly, like on old minivans As Ramsey mentioned in his analysis of the Tesla Semi , this could be a major issue when having to hand over documents or cash at drive-thru windows for borders, tolls, and such, or to police officers during a highway stop.

Araji visited Tehran on Saturday after making a similar trip to Saudi Arabia in July [AP File].
The government of Saudi Arabia has sought the help of Iraq's prime minister to mend relations between Riyadh and Tehran, according to news reports.
Citing Qasim al-Araji, Iraq's interior minister, the Iraqi satellite channel Alghadeer reported that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, has asked Haider al-Abadi to lead the mediation with Iran, Aljazeera wrote.
"During our visit to Saudi Arabia, they also asked us to do so, and we said that to [the] Iranian side. The Iranian side looked at this demand positively," Araji was quoted saying by Alghadeer on Sunday.
"After the victories that Iraq has achieved, it [Saudi Arabia] began looking to Iraq, at its true size and leading role.
"The calm and stability and the return of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have positive repercussions on the region as a whole."
Araji visited the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Saturday to discuss "several issues" with top Iranian officials, according to reports. He also visited Saudi Arabia in July.
The Iranian news agency ISNA quoted Araji in Persian as saying that Mohammed bin Salman wanted to "ease tensions" with Iran.
Separately, Muqtada al-Sadr, the influential Iraqi Shia leader, announced on his website that he would be visiting the UAE on Sunday.
In July, Sadr made a rare visit to Saudi Arabia, where he met Mohammed bin Salman and other officials.
Sadr commands a large following among the urban poor of Baghdad and the southern cities, including Saraya al-Salam, or Peace Brigades armed group.
The visits by the Iraqis come as the Persian Gulf region remains embroiled in its worst crisis in years — a dispute between Qatar and a Saudi-led bloc comprising the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt.
Speaking to Al Jazeera on Sunday, Saad Jawad, a political science professor at the London School of Economics, termed the Saudi-Iraqi diplomatic moves "odd".
"If Saudi Arabia is [in a dispute] with Qatar about Qatar's relationship with Iran ... how could they ask the Iraqis to amend their relations with Iran?
Jawad said Saudi Arabia could have asked a more neutral broker like Kuwait or Oman, both of which have "good relations" with Iran.
For Reza Khaasteh, a journalist for the Tehran-based Iran Front Page website, the offer is a "sincere move" by Riyadh given the recent "signals exchanged between the two sides".
Khaasteh pointed out that ahead of the announcement on Sunday, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir held brief talks with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif at the sideline of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Istanbul on August 1.
"So one we can interpret the Saudi crown prince's call for mediation as a continuation of all those positive developments and the few words exchanged between Jubeir and Zarif. Yes, the two are seeking better ties, but no one knows what will happen in the future," he said.
Shia-majority Iraq lies on the fault-line between Shia Iran and Sunni-ruled Arab monarchies including Saudi Arabia. In 2016 Iraq offered to mediate between the two countries.
In January 2016, Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Iran after an attack by protesters on its embassy in Tehran.
Protesters were angrily reacting to Saudi Arabia's decision to execute Shia religious leader Nimr al-Nimr, who was put to death along with 46 mostly Sunni Muslims convicted on terrorism charges.
At that point, the rival regional powers had been engaged in a war of words following the death of Iranian Hajj pilgrims outside Mecca in 2015.
Iran said at least 460 Iranians were killed in the incident, but Saudi Arabia officially reported only 131 Iranians dead.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have also accused each other of backing proxies in the war in Yemen and Syria.
Sunday's news report by ISNA quoted Araji as saying that Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had earlier made the same request to him.
Araji reportedly told Salman saying that Riyadh "should show the best behavior towards Iranian pilgrims", by allowing them to visit Janna al-Baqi cemetery, an important site for Shia Muslims located in Medina.
"The Saudi side has made certain promises in this regard, and the doors to the cemetery is already open to Iranian pilgrims," Araji was quoted as saying, according to an English translation by Iran Front Page of the ISNA report.
In the same report, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, Iran's interior minister, is quoted saying that it is important to respect and maintain the "dignity" of Iranian Hajj pilgrims, adding that Iran has "always sought cordial relations" with Saudi Arabia.
"Iran's policy is to have effective cooperation with regional states, and Tehran has never been the first to sever its relations with others," he said.
Celtic's chances of signing Patrick Roberts ahead of their final Champions League qualifier suffered a major blow when the winger was included in Manchester City's travelling party for a training camp in Catalonia.
Celtic are hoping to re-sign the 20-year-old on loan following a successful 18-month spell in Glasgow and Roberts is believed to be keen on a return.
One of the player's representatives, former St Johnstone and Hearts player Allan Preston, had admitted he expected his immediate future to be resolved last week but City listed Roberts in a 25-man party which landed in Girona on Monday. Nice and Southampton have also been linked with loan bids for the former Fulham player.
Celtic can add one new player to their Champions League squad for Wednesday's play-off first leg against Astana if the signing is registered before 11pm on Tuesday.
Hoops manager Brendan Rodgers revealed on Friday he had also been working on signing a new striker amid fitness issues for Leigh Griffiths and Moussa Dembele.
The latter will miss Wednesday's Parkhead clash with a hamstring injury while Griffiths was only handed a substitute's role in Friday's 1-0 victory over Partick Thistle amid an ongoing calf problem.
Celtic also have a shortage of central defenders. Erik Sviatchenko and Dedryck Boyata are missing with knee injuries and midfielder Nir Bitton was fortunate not to concede a late penalty at Firhill while playing at the back alongside Jozo Simunovic.
GREEN RIVER—After an interesting and very rewarding 39 years working for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Rock Springs Game Warden Dave Hays is now ready to retire.
Hays, an Iowa native, graduated from University of Wyoming in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Zoology and Wildlife Management. Hays began his career with the WGFD in 1978 as a temporary laborer at Horse Creek Feedgrounds. He transferred to the Laramie Game and Fish Regional Office, working various temporary appointments as a check station technician, biologist aid, district biologist, and eventually, a game warden trainee in Glenrock in 1982. In 1983, after graduating from the Wyoming Law Enforcement Academy, Hays was assigned to Alcova to work as a watercraft enforcement officer and, later that year, to work in the Cheyenne Game and Fish Headquarters. In 1984, Hays was assigned to Douglas and served as the district game warden in Converse County for 10 years. Hays transferred to Green River in 1994 and to Rock Springs in 1997, where he has been district game warden for the past 20 years.
In 1993, Hays received the statewide WGFD Peer Recognition Award and was also named Wildlife Officer of the Year by the Wyoming Game Warden Association.
“We are all grateful for Dave's service to our state and its wildlife for over three decades,” said Game and Fish Chief Game Warden Brian Nesvik. ”He served dutifully to fulfill all of his responsibilities in protecting and managing Wyoming wildlife resources. He is known to be a straight forward game warden always willing to provide his input into how Wyoming's wildlife can be managed best.”
“Dave has been around long enough that there aren't many situations that he hasn't dealt with before,” added Green River Game Warden Andy Roosa. ”He is definitely one of the guys that I and other game wardens call when we need some advice on how to handle difficult cases and situations. He is always willing to help out when needed and still puts in as many hours as anyone during the busy seasons, even after 39 years. It will be a big loss to the Department and the Green River Region not having his knowledge and experience to call on.”
“Dave was a great neighboring warden; always there when I needed assistance and always ready to help,” said Baggs Game Warden Kim Olson.”Dave was always full of good advice and looked at the whole problem. He was also a great firearms instructor. He will be missed, but he is due for some fun and free time!”
“From the first day I started this career I would often think to myself, I can't believe I'm getting paid to do this,” Hays said. “After almost four decades, I still have a few of those same reflective moments.”
Hays shares his life with his two sons, David and Evan, and is moving to Nebraska with a fishing pole in one hand and a rifle in the other.
Television viewers were outraged after the BBC accidentally broadcast a man making an insensitive comment about the death of Keith Chegwin.
The TV presenter died on Monday at the age of 60 after battling a progressive lung condition.
The BBC News Channel was set to talk to Chegwin's former colleague John Craven, but then cut to the weather instead.
A man's voice was then heard saying: “Too much smoking probably.”
Some of the people watching went online to express their disgust at the blunder.
“Too much smoking probably…. what a gaffe. typical bbc @keithchegwin rip,” posted one person on Twitter.

Following a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, in which a GOP congressional baseball team was targeted, the gun control debate is in full swing.
A gunman targeted GOP members of congress and opened fire at a Republican congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, Wednesday morning, leaving four people injured.
The shooter has since been identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson, who was shot by police and later died from his wounds.
Casual gun violence and mass shootings are nothing new in America. In fact, they've almost become normalized in our society. Typically, after one of these tragedies occurs, the gun control debate takes the spotlight as Democrats call for stronger gun control reforms while Republicans evoke the Second Amendment to keep the laws as lax as they are.
However, now that some of their own have been targeted, the question arises whether Republicans will change their tune and be more open to gun control reforms.
One of the victims of Wednesday's attack, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, has been a steadfast gun advocate and even touts an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, The Los Angeles Times reports. But, now that he's experienced senseless gun violence firsthand, his perspective may shift.
Thus far, however, the reaction from each party has stuck to the status quo with Democrats calling for gun control reforms and Republicans pushing back.
Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, responded to the incident that occurred in his state by making a case for gun control reform while simultaneously maintaining that what happened is not about gun control — presumably, to quell any speculation that this stunt was somehow orchestrated by Democrats to push their gun control agenda.
“I have long advocated — this is not what today is about — but there are too many guns on the streets,” McAuliffe told reporters. He added, "I have long talked about this —background checks and shutting down gun show loopholes. And that's not for today's discussion, but it's not just about politicians. We worry about this every day for all of our citizens.”
On the flip side, Rep. Chris Collins (R-New York) called for Democrats to “tone down the rhetoric” in an interview with WBEN radio.
"The rhetoric has been outrageous — the finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters. Really, then, you know, some people react to things like that. They get angry as well. And then you fuel the fires."
He then vowed to start keeping his handgun on his person at public events.
“On a rare occasion I'd have my gun in the glove box or something, but it's going to be in my pocket from this day forward,” he said.
It should be noted, however, that once you're already struck with a bullet that you didn't see coming, having your handgun in your pocket probably wouldn't do you much good. This exact point is why you don't often hear about armed civilians thwarting an active shooter in many of these situations.
Oftentimes, when a shooter is stopped by a gun, it's at the hands of a member of law enforcement, which is exactly what occurred in Alexandria.
In any case, below are some other conservative thoughts shared on Twitter about gun control in connection to the shooting, which range from absurd to downright idiotic.
VA Gov Terry McAuliffe talking about gun control. "Too many guns," he says.

As it appears, many Republicans believe that the answer to curbing gun violence in this country is not to do away with guns, but to get rid of Democrats. So much for coming to their senses.
DEVON, Pa. (AP) — A horse has broken free at a Pennsylvania horse show, sending people running for cover as it galloped toward the stables.
WPVI-TV reports the horse got loose and jumped over a fence at the Devon Horse Show Tuesday night. Cellphone video shows the horse making a run for it as onlookers scream in the stands.
The horse was caught in the stable area. It suffered minor scrapes.
Officials say the rider was able to dismount from the carriage before the horse ran away and was uninjured.

The horse show is expected to continue through the week as planned.

Aston Villa's squad is well-stocked with no fewer than five first team regulars regularly omitted from Steve Bruce's 18-man mission of a weekend.
The manager felt forced to let players leave in January to stop first team training sessions being so overcrowded.
Four more players left the club in the winter while a further three players have been enjoying season-long stints away from Villa Park.
Here's how Villa's eight loanees are getting on away from B6.
Pierluigi Gollini
Italian goalkeeper Gollini has taken over the club's forgotten man mantle in recent times. The 22-year-old headed home for Atalanta last January on an 18-month loan deal.
The reasoning behind Villa's decision to let Gollini return to Italy was so he could secure first team football, but he's barely played.
Gollini has made just six appearances in all competitions this season with Etrit Berisha firmly Atalanta's No.1.
Gollini's most recent outing came in a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina last month.
Gary Gardner
In terms of playing time Gardner's loan spell has been highly successful, despite a couple of niggling injuries preventing him from taking to the Oakwell turf regularly to begin with.
Since November Gardner has been a mainstay in the Tykes' line-up and helped them to a 1-0 win over relegation rivals Sunderland on New Year's Day.
Gardner starred in Barnsley's recent 2-0 win at Birmingham City but that and Sunderland are the only wins the 25-year-old has managed during his 22 outings.
Carles Gil
The Spaniard is enjoying his second consecutive season-long loan at La Liga side Deportivo La Coruna but it's hoped it will be made permanent this summer.
Gil's latest stint with Deportivo has been disrupted by injury. The midfielder underwent an operation in Portugal earlier this season to cure a longstanding hernia problem.
After returning to action in November Gil made 11 appearances without finding the net. His last start saw Real Sociedad thrash Deportivo 5-0 in early February and Depor's manager paid the price.
Dutch great Clarence Seedorf has since come in to replace Fernando Vasquez in the hotseat but he has only picked Gil once, introducing him in the dying embers at the weekend. The creative schemer's future at the Estadio Riazor appears to be in doubt under Seedorf.
Tommy Elphick
Elphick's full debut for Reading ended disastrously as the Villa defender was struck down by injury.
The 30-year-old joined the Royals on loan with a view to a permanent transfer and made his debut as a substitute in their 3-1 win at Burton Albion.
Jaap Stam handed Elphick his first start against Millwall but he had to be withdrawn after just 32 minutes due to a knee injury.
Elphick was replaced by Tyler Blackett who also succumbed to injury before the end of Reading's 2-0 to the Lions.
The defender underwent a minor operation and has since been back at Bodymoor Heath to continue his rehabilitation. Elphick hopes to play again for the Royals before the season ends.

Ritchie De Laet
Villa allowed Belgian right-back De Laet to make an emotional return to his first club Royal Antwerp and he's played seven times since.
De Laet helped Antwerp to his only victory thus far against KAS Eupen at the beginning of this month. The 29-year-old is a regular pick for Antwerp and that will delight everyone at Villa Park.
Aaron Tshibola
Tshibola's latest loan spell began positively as he stepped off the bench for Kilmarnock to help his new club to a famous victory over Celtic.
After two poor stints at Nottingham Forest and MK Dons, Tshibola is beginning to recapture his best form up in Scotland. He's made nine appearances and is yet to taste defeat with Killie.
The 23-year-old started Kilmarnock's impressive 1-0 win over Rangers at the weekend and is becoming a popular figure up in Scotland.
Tshibola's spell at Rugby Park is his third loan stint away from Villa since his £5million move from Reading in 2016.
Harry McKirdy
McKirdy made a goalscoring start to life at Crewe Alexandra in League Two.
The 20-year-old scored on his debut against Wycombe before starting the following week's match with Swindon Town, but he has since been used as an impact substitute.
He made another 20-minute cameo for Crewe at the weekend and started an under-23s match against Birmingham City in midweek as he searches for match sharpness.
McKirdy is jostling for position with former Villa striker Jordan Bowery at Gresty Road.
Easah Suliman
Suliman's options became limited towards the end of the January transfer window with all of his earlier suitors having secured defensive reinforcements.
The England under-20 international joined Grimsby Town on Deadline Day and made his debut in their 1-1 draw with Port Vale a couple of weeks back.
The Civil Aviation Authority and Maritime New Zealand are gathering information after an aircraft crashed into the Lakeland Queen while taxiing on Lake Rotorua.
A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said the incident happened yesterday afternoon and involved a Volcanic Air Safaris aircraft about 300m from the port and starboard marker buoys.
He said no further information was available while situational information was being gathered.
A spokesman for Maritime New Zealand confirmed the plane crashed into the Lakeland Queen.

"We are sending someone to investigate but our understanding is there was minor damage and no injuries."
Volcanic Air Safaris director Phil Barclay said the directors were too busy to comment today.
On a Wednesday afternoon in May 1978, Capt Ken Kelly was minding his own business and getting on with his work as a cavalry instructor at the Defence Forces training school in the Curragh. But then everything changed.
“I got a call from my boss to say you are replacing a man who has withdrawn,” recalls the now retired Kelly. “I thought I was replacing someone in the training school, but I was being sent to Lebanon. ”
On the Thursday morning, the then 35-year-old Kelly, a veteran of earlier peacekeeping missions to the Congo and Cyprus, had a medical fitness examination. He passed, and that afternoon he was promoted to commandant. The next day he was off.
“On Friday evening I was sitting on an American Galaxy, a huge transport plane, in Dublin Airport taking off for Tel Aviv, and then by road to south Lebanon.”
Would the Israelis have gone and if not what was he to do? If they had gone would there be anything left behind to disrupt the incoming Unifil troops?
The speed of his deployment, joining Ireland's first contingent to Unifil, the UN peacekeeping mission to oversee the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, was “a shock to the system at the time”, he recalls. “On the way I was reading up on the mandate and the mission I was about to carry out.”
In charge of several armoured cars and Panhard M3 armoured personnel carriers, Kelly's first task was literally to oversee the Israeli withdrawal. As soon as he could he got into a 4x4 vehicle with his operations officer, and set out to where the Israelis had been ensconced – and which he now hoped to find vacated.
Trepidation
“It was a journey we undertook with some trepidation,” he says, wondering at the time what awaited them.Would the Israelis have gone and if not what was he to do? If they had gone would there be anything left behind to disrupt the incoming Unifil troops?
In the event, the relevant buildings in which the Israelis had been installed since their invasion were vacated, but then at a crossroads Kelly and his ops officer came across some Israeli vehicles parked outside a house that had a small awning with grape vines climbing over it providing some shade from the sun.
Kelly walked inside the house only to find himself standing in front of an Israeli army officer – neither man expecting to see the other.
The Israeli looked up and stared at Kelly. “Where have you come from?” he asked.
“I looked at him, and it was all a bit tense,” says Kelly. “So I said ‘Ireland! ' He laughed and it broke the ice.”
The house was the Israeli withdrawal centre of operations and, pleasantries and formalities exchanged and mutual positions respected, the Israeli officer finished his business and was off within an hour. “I think we took the wind out of his sails with my answer,” says Kelly.
Irish involvement
And so began Irish involvement in Unifil, the mission that was born 40 years ago on Monday, which the Defence Forces, including newly-prompted Kelly, joined in May 1978 and have contributed to every day since.
Kelly later served in Untso, the UN truce supervision organisation that oversees observance of the 1948 ceasefire agreement between Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and later still was based in Naqoura, southern Lebanon.
In 2001, he retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel after what he remembers fondly as a “satisfying career”.
“If you like soldiering it's a great place to be.”
The Global Tubeless Tire market was valued at $130.16 billion in 2016, and is projected to reach $212.5 billion by 2024, having a CAGR of 6.4% during the forecast period of 2017 to 2024.
Tubeless tires run without a separate inner tube. Unlike pneumatic tires, tubeless tires have persistent ribs configured into the bead of the tire. In this way, the outer casing makes an air tight seal with the rim of the wheel, and air is held in the assembly of casing and rim. Tubeless tires are made up of tread, spiral layers and steel belt. Tread gives the frame support of the vehicle and enhanced grip, causing better transfer of braking stress to road. The tubeless tire market is expected to witness an impressive growth during the forecast period, as a result of its various advantages such as their high fuel efficiency, less balance weight requirement, easy repairing and safer drives as compared to pneumatic tires. In addition to this, these tires are good bump absorbents and offer better heat dissipation which increases the overall life and cost effectiveness of the tire
Market Determinants
A hiking demand for automobiles is witnessed all around the globe. This has rapidly increased the growth of vehicle production and sales, resulting to an increased requirement of tubeless tires. Moreover, rising awareness regarding road safety and stringent government regulations regarding vehicular emission and fuel economy is supposed to push the tubeless tire market growth. For example, the Transportation Recall Enhancement Accountability Documentation (TREAD) Act of 2000 required NHTSA to develop regulations for installing a tire pressure monitoring system in new passenger cars and light trucks. However, fluctuating prices of raw material and inclination of trend towards airless tires might restrain the market growth. Regardless of all these restraints, technological improvisations and innovations in the automotive tire industry and rise in aftermarket as a result of increased lifespan, will bring future growth opportunities to the tubeless tire market. Enhancing the fuel economy by new technical improvements regarding tire- pressure in tubeless tires, is a highly prioritized concern in the current scenario as a result of rapidly exhausting fuel resources. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, out of 130 billion gallons of fuel used in passenger cars and light trucks in 2005, about 1.2 billion gallons were wasted as a result of driving on underinflated tires.

BE AWARE: Senior Constable Matt Tonkin, cane train drivers Allan Alexander and Dan Cramer and Bundaberg Sugar cane supply manager Robert Powell are warning drivers to be cautious at rail crossings with the return of cane trains for the crush season.
SPARE a thought for a cane train driver this crush season.
The job has its hair-raising moments.
Better still, as car drivers are urged every year: be on the lookout at every rail crossing.
"We get a lot of near misses at level crossings because motorists aren't paying attention,” train driver Dan Cramer said.
With a trail of bins carrying up to 400 tonnes, "it takes a fair while to stop.”
Up to a kilometre, according to Bundaberg Sugar cane supply manager Robert Powell.
Close calls? "I've had a few,” Mr Cramer's colleague Allan Alexander said.
"Missed by millimetres. But no accidents - touch wood.”
Drivers, police and Bundaberg Sugar are hoping this season will be a safe one and are putting out the call ahead of the crush which starts on Monday at Millaquin Mill and the following Monday, June 26, at Bingera.
Mr Powell said crossings with lights and signage were actually where the most accidents happened, due to driver carelessness.
"There was a bloke out at Moore Park who reached down to pick up his phone that had fallen off the seat.
"When he came back up the lights were on and the train was there.”
You could face fines of up to $365 and three demerit points for offences including failing to stop or give way at respective signs on level crossings, entering with warning lights or bells operating, and entering while a train is approaching and collision is likely.
Man who poured boiling water over Hastings co-worker's head for taking a slice of sausage deported
The incident, that was caught on camera, took place in the lunchroom of a Turners and Growers pack house in Whakatu, near Hastings, in July 2015.
BERLIN (AP) — Scientists say they're several steps closer to perfecting a method for saving the northern white rhino from extinction.
Writing in the journal Nature Communications, researchers said Wednesday they've succeeded in creating embryos using frozen northern white rhino sperm and eggs from a southern white rhino.
It's the first time such hybrid embryos have been created, and the scientists from Europe and the United States hope it will provide a pathway to saving the northern white rhino sub-species, of which only two females remain.
They plan to harvest the females' egg cells soon and produce "pure" northern white rhinos to be borne by a southern white surrogate in three years. They're also working on a second method that would see sperm and eggs produced from preserved cells of northern white rhinos.

A Midland mother and son have been arrested over claims she faked her own death on a paradise island in an alleged £140,000 life insurance scam.
City of London Police said the woman's 19-year-old son and his guardian made a claim for life insurance last May.
The force said they alleged she had died in a car crash in Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa, and allegedly provided false documentation such as a death certificate and road traffic accident reports.
But the woman's insurer refused to pay out after finding the documents to be “suspicious”, police said.
The force's anti-fraud department launched an investigation late last year.

The teenager, from Walsall , was arrested and interviewed, when he was said to have admitted his mother, aged 45 and also from the town, was alive and living in Canada.
She was arrested at Perry Barr police station after she was ordered to return to the UK.
The son's guardian, aged 24 and from Walsall, was also interviewed.
All three suspects were bailed to return to Perry Barr police station in April.
BEIRUT - Egypt's military operations against an affiliate of the Islamic State group in North Sinai is threatening to spark a humanitarian crisis, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.
The offensive launched on February 9 "has left up to 420,000 residents in four northeastern cities in urgent need of humanitarian aid," said the New York-based organisation.
The campaign "has included imposing severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods in almost all of" North Sinai, HRW said in a report.
"Residents say they have experienced sharply diminished supplies of available food, medicine, cooking gas, and other essential commercial goods."
The authorities conducting the campaign, dubbed "Sinai 2018", have also banned the sale of gasoline for cars in the area "and cut telecommunication services for several days at a time," the report said.
Human Rights Watch also said authorities had "cut water and electricity almost entirely in the most eastern areas of North Sinai, including Rafah and Sheikh Zuwayed."
"A counterterrorism operation that imperils the flow of essential goods to hundreds of thousands of civilians is unlawful and unlikely to stem violence," said Sarah Leah Whitson, the organisation's Middle East and North Africa director.
"The Egyptian army's actions border on collective punishment," she added.
Since the launch of the offensive, the military has distributed images of forces providing humanitarian assistance to people living in the area.
According to the military, residents support the campaign and many have come forward with useful information to help the authorities neutralise the jihadists.
Security forces have stepped up efforts to quell attacks by an Egyptian jihadist group that later declared allegiance to IS since Islamist president Mohamed Morsi was deposed in 2013. Morsi was forced out by the military, following mass protests against him.
The group has killed hundreds of soldiers, policemen and civilians, mainly in its North Sinai stronghold but also elsewhere in Egypt.
More than 100 jihadists and at least 30 soldiers have been killed in the ongoing operation, according to army figures.

If you're a Led Zeppelin fan, you probably already know this. Still, I should give you fair warning: I'm about to describe something you will never unhear. Play Since I've Been Loving You from Led Zeppelin III, and listen for the squeak on the right channel.
It's from John Bonham's bass drum pedal. He used a model called the Ludwig Speed King which was the only pedal that supported his high-speed bass drumming. But its spring was notoriously squeaky, but for some reason, oiling it wasn't an option. I don't remember ever hearing the squeak when I used to listen to Led Zeppelin a lot.
Recently, after reading about it, I listened for it using a high-resolution file and a full-range audio system. It's surprising that I ever missed it. If anything, it's more audible on the compressed YouTube version through regular headphones. Technically, that squeak is noise. It's an annoying sound in itself, plus it's something that wasn't chosen to be in the signal. And yet it was part of the original performance, its timing as integral a part of Bonham's playing as the sound of the beater hitting the skin of the drum.
There's a thread on a Led Zeppelin forum where someone asks about that “annoying” squeak, and a poster called eskimoblueday replies, “ I LOVE THAT SQUEAK! That squeak is one of my favourite things about Led Zeppelin, period... I never got to see John Bonham live, but if I close my eyes while I'm listening to that song, and I hear that squeak, it's like I'm in studio with them while he's playing that song. It makes me feel like I am standing right next to him, even though I'm not.”
Getting more noticeable
The squeak is a “feature” of Led Zeppelin that gets more noticeable as playback technology and resolution improves. Today I saw the visual version of it. I was at a demonstration of Kaleidescape, a home movie player that offers true 4K Ultra HD. Though it wasn't connected to a 4K television, you could still see how good the picture was.
The rep played a scene from Lawrence of Arabia, and in it, Anthony Quinn's fake nose and the bad make-up all round were clearly visible. But also visible was wet look of film with vivid colours, huge dynamic range, and a sense of depth to the images. It was beautiful to watch, and being aware of the characters as painted actors seemed to take me there. I was standing by them in desert, just as eskimoblueday felt like she could stand by John Bonham in the studio.
I was in a meeting recently with someone who works for a high-end audio company. He told me about his boss, who stands by the belief that when you're listening to music you love, the quality of the sound is irrelevant. You bop along with the song whether you're listening to an MP3 on cheap earbuds, or whether it's playing from around the corner on an ancient radio on a street cart. The only thing high-quality sound gives you is your desire to seek it out more often, or perhaps, spend more time with it.
I have to agree. I can't pretend that when a compressed Since I've Been Loving You comes on the car radio, half drowned out by freeway noise, that I enjoy it any less than when I'm listening to the airy 96kHz, 24-bit FLAC file at home. And yes, now that I can never unhear that squeak, I too feel like I'm standing by Bonham's drums and it's 1970 outside.

Interior Ministry Secretary of State Pol Lim's son, Lim Chamnan, was demoted after firing a gun on a busy street while fleeing an accident on Saturday. Fresh News
Gun-firing cop loses position, is demoted
Lim Chamnan, son of Interior Ministry Secretary of State Pol Lim, has been demoted in rank and removed from his position as the deputy chief of Kandal's Provincial Traffic Department for firing a gun on the street while fleeing an accident on Saturday, National Police spokesman Kirth Chantharith announced in a video posted on the National Police website on Tuesday.
“At the request of the National Police Chief and Sar Kheng, the minister of interior, we have decided to punish Lim Chamnan in three ways,” he said.
In addition to receiving a warning letter, Chamnan has been “demoted one rank from lieutenant colonel to a major and removed from his position as the deputy head of the traffic bureau to become a regular police officer”.
Chantharith also explained the decision behind not criminally charging Chamnan.
“We have checked the law and it does not state that shooting one time into the sky must be punished by a jail sentence. Therefore, when it is not stated in the law, we need to comply with the . . . discipline of the National Police,” he said, referring to an article from the National Police Regulations.
However, Sok Sam Oeun, a legal expert, said that firing a weapon in public is punishable under the law on arms control if there is sufficient evidence – a decision at the discretion of the Interior Ministry.
“Maybe there is enough evidence to discipline but not enough evidence for criminal charge,” he said. “It remains unclear as to what would constitute ‘sufficient evidence'”.
The collision and the shooting were captured by the other car's dashboard camera, and Chamnan reportedly admitted to the incident.
In response to criticism that authorities are giving special treatment to Chamnan for his status as the son of a senior official, Chantharith assured the public that the policies of the Interior Ministry and the National Police do not “take anyone's side”.
“The enforcement is not in favour of any son,” he said.
Repair works on a section of rail line in Dublin were delayed for several months last year because the number of discarded syringes in the area made it impossible to carry out the job.
The area in question was a stretch of rail track near the derelict lock-keeper's cottage at the Royal Canal, close to the North Strand Road, on the north side of Dublin city.
There are a huge amount of syringes in the area which makes it very difficult to carry out the work
Syringes had been cleared from the spot on a number of occasions but the problem persisted and made the required work very difficult, according to minutes from last September's meeting of the Dublin City Canals Royal Canal Development Group.
The work eventually took place in mid-December after vegetation and a hoarding was removed and after Irish Rail liaised with a nearby addiction clinic.
Replace
The minutes of the September meeting said an Irish Rail representative “stated that he has to replace a stretch of rail line at the lock-keeper's cottage. However, there are a huge amount of syringes in the area which makes it very difficult to carry out the work. [The representative] has had the syringes cleared on at least three occasions to date but it remains as bad as ever.”
The minutes said staff from Irish Rail and Waterways Ireland would “visit the site so that they could review the area and to try to secure the site as quickly as possible in order for Irish Rail to progress their repair work”.
An Irish Rail spokesman told The Irish Times that “vegetation was removed from the areas and a hoarding that drug users were sheltering behind was removed and replaced with fencing, that makes the area more open.
“We were also in touch with a nearby clinic working with those suffering from addiction to explain the issue, and the combination of these activities have seen the number of instances dramatically reduce.”
RTÉ's new series, Striking Out (Sunday, RTÉ One, 9.35pm), ostensibly a drama starring Amy Huberman, really poses a more curious question: what would happen if you framed the plot and palaver of a comedy around a central character who is, to all appearances, catatonically depressed?
Our introduction to Tara Rafferty, a solicitor out on her hen night, doubles as an introduction to a sheeny idea of Dublin: the camera glides over the city at dusk finally settling on a waterside cluster of corporate buildings, glassy apartments and plentiful brunch options known as Grand Canal Dock.
In a neat manoeuvre, either superficial or deliberately satirical, the area's familiar red lightsabre sculpture dissolves into another shot of similarly designed cocktails, their glowing straws bobbing smugly in a livid green concoction that appears fundamentally toxic.
That seems a fitting toast to this part of Dublin in 2016. (Guided by signs of resurgent affluence, and staying as far south of the river as the court scenes will allow them, it's fair to consider this a period piece.)
With an amorous surge of carpe diem, Tara abandons her hen party without a word, only to find her chiselled fiancé Eric (Rory Keenan) at home, pinned firmly beneath another woman.
Here, director Lisa James Larsson understandably abandons the dialogue (“Are you having an affair?” “Sweetheart, this means nothing!” “Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?”) in favour of a solemn, slow-motion sequence in which a tearfully wronged woman lashes a semi-naked man with a giant inflatable penis.
Such is the tone of James Phelan's new series, all established before the opening credits, where the heartbreaks of life resemble ludicrous clichés, while James Larsson, Huberman and the audience discover the awkward consequences of taking them utterly seriously.
A Hollywood screenwriter once shared a depressingly familiar formula on making female protagonists “adorable” for a patriarchal culture: “you have to defeat her at the beginning. Abuse and break her, strip her of her dignity, and then she gets to live out our fantasies and have fun.”
ADVERTISEMENT
In Striking Out, writers Phelan and Rob Hyland achieve the first part of this dismal formula in under four minutes, which hardly counts as an advance. But, for Tara, the fun never starts.
Shoeless and unblinking, she stealthily clears out her office the next morning (Eric works in the firm, his father is a partner), running into a young offender named Ray (nicely played by newcomer Emmet Byrne) whom she is meant to defend that morning.
In court, she gets him off with a white lie – he has found a job – making him her first employee in a brand-new practice operating out of a waterfront coffee shop – a move The Simpsons' attorney-at-law Lionel Hutz might have admired. (For fear of intruding, perhaps, they soon move to a disued metal factory, a funkier environment for a pop-up law firm.)
Still, not even her first big case, an injunction to prevent “The World” newspaper from publishing a celebrity sextape, brings Tara (or Huberman) any respite from somnambulant grief – a brief recognition of the preposterousness of taking on The World, say, a rush of transferred rage, or even a dark chuckle.
Instead, we get a profoundly isolated character with apparently no female friends (her mother, played by Ingrid Craigie, sides with the cheating fiance, the abandoned hen party barely enquire after her disappearance) and only male supporters: Neil Morrissey as an older, distracted mentor type, Nick Dunning as a supportive father.
As a consequence, Huberman struggles to locate any character, shown weeping tides of mascara in the shower or staring shellshocked into the distance. It's hard to demonstrate personality when you're left so alone.
But who would root for her reunion with Eric, at which the show keeps tilting, whom Keenan seems to find as irredeemable as the rest of us.
In one telling moment, Eric stares long into his reflection, as though it would yield some depth, but the show, so far, is occupied purely with surfaces. Maybe that's why, alone at the end of episode one, Tara reaches not for a memory, but a selfie; a holiday video of two magnificent-looking blondes, so self-satisfied that it could only warm the hearts of the most committed Aryans.
I preferred a fleeting, otherwise inessential moment when Tara – still fascinatingly impervious to every farcical cue – proudly presented herself to the assistant manager of an underground sex club. “Tara Rafferty, solicitor,” she asserted, now the vengeful protector of a celebrity sex addict's privacy rights. There, among the leather, whips and harnesses, it seemed the right time to stop being submissive.
Whether Tara can reconcile the weird comedy and supposed drama of this show, or develop a character to rival her burgeoning practice, depends first on choosing to represent herself.

Major gridlock on the Bruce Hwy after a multi-vehicle crash.
A CRASH on the Bruce Highway at Elimbah this morning presented Queensland Ambulance Service officers with an unusual scenario on arrival.
Paramedics were called to a single-vehicle rollover at 6.15am, but paramedics were unable to locate the patient.

The northbound crash affected traffic towards the Coast causing morning delays for motorists.
Then just before 7am, the paramedics were called to another crash in the same area.
That second crash involved two vehicles with three patients being assessed.
It is still yet to be determined whether the two crashes are linked.
Queensland Police have reported the traffic congestion on the Bruce as "significant" and advise motorists to use caution on the roads.
Motorists heading south to Brisbane say the traffic is banked all the way past Caboolture.

Gunning for a return ticket to the zonal playoffs, Ceres Negros FC takes on Home United FC in the final match day of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Cup 2018 Asean zone group stage today at the Panaad Park and Stadium in Bacolod City.
The defending champion Yellow Busmen square off with the Protectors at 6 p.m.
Ceres Negros leads Group F with 13 points on an unbeaten record of four wins and a draw.
The Philippine titlist only needs a stalemate to enter the knockout phase for the second consecutive year.
Last season, Ceres beat Home United to emerge as the first Filipino club to rule the Asean zone. Head coach Risto Vidakovic wants to make history anew.
“We are not playing against Home United. We're playing because we want to make history. We have the opportunity to make an excellent finish on the group stage and be on top of the group,” said Vidakovic.
Home, on the other hand, stands at No. 2 with 10 points on a 3-3-1 win-draw-loss record.
The Singaporean booters need to win by five goals or more to edge out the Filipino squad in the race to the playoffs.
Mentor Aidil Sharin, who is eager to steer his Protectors to an upset victory, reminds his wards to keep their transition defense sturdy.
“Our mind is to win and get three points. That's the main objective to come here. But we have to be smart in how we're going play and of course be very tight during the counter-attack,” said Sharin.
The first meeting between the two regional powerhouse teams ended in a 1-1 draw at the Jala Besar Stadium last February 27.
Shahril Ishak scored the opening goal via a penalty kick for Home but Super Herrera hit an equalizer for Ceres late in the game.

CLEVELAND (AP) — The leader of a breakaway Amish group in Ohio convicted in hair- and beard-cutting attacks is pushing to get his convictions overturned using arguments already rejected in court.
An attorney for 72-year-old Samuel Mullet Sr. says Mullet's previous lawyer made mistakes during trial and in prior appeals.
In a Monday court filing, prosecutors say there were no errors that amounted to Mullet's rights to due process being violated, and a judge should reject his request.
Defense attorneys say the 2011 hair- and beard-cutting attacks stemmed from family disputes. Prosecutors say the motive was religious, as hair and beards have spiritual significance in the Amish faith.

Mullet is serving an 11-year sentence. Of the 16 Amish community members convicted in the case, only Mullet remains imprisoned.

The next-door rivalry game between West Florida and Pine Forest is always must-see prep football. This year's matchup featured a 4-1 Jaguar team coming off a bye week against the young but scrappy Eagles—with a twist—two first-year head coaches on each sideline.
Host West Florida and coach Rhett Summerford got a leg up on Pine Forest and Jason McDonald early, or two feet on a diving touchdown reception in the back of the end zone, and the defense held tough en route to a 17-7 victory on Friday night.
Here are five key moments in the cross-the-street high school matchup:
1. A swarming defense usually wins out — Especially when you have a giant defensive tackle The Jags were led by the overall player of the night, big No. 99 Adarius McWilliams. When he wasn't facing a double team, and even when he was, the senior bound for UAB was a constant force in the Eagle backfield. He registered at least 2.5 sacks, and allowed others to make big plays as well.
“It was a hard-fought game—defense played pretty good—we gave up a few runs in the second half but we played well,” McWilliams said. The difference tonight was the bye week. We took a hard loss against Crestview. Coming out here tonight, we wanted to keep the intensity up. It was a good overall team win.”
2. Jags offense did just enough to win — Aside from a couple of clutch plays, the Eagles held their own as well on defense. But the Jags made the tough runs and receptions count. Devin Abrams' 52-yard score starting things off, and Micheal Redding's end zone toe tapping from 36 yards out proved to be enough.
3. The Jags move to 5-1, but Coach Summerford knows his team has a lot of work to do — “Hats off to our defense ... it was an unbelievable job,” Summerford said. “The defense won the ballgame tonight. We came up with numerous stops and some big sacks, and I'm just so proud of them. It's a big win for us. I think we're right where we need to be. We've still got a long way, with district games coming up. We need to start clicking a little more on offense, especially in the red zone. We won the battle of the chained-linked fence.”
4. On a humid night, several Jaguars played through cramps — “We may need to run more,” Summerford said with a grin on his face.
5. Despite the loss, Pine Forest coach was proud of the defensive effort — “Our defense played their butt off tonight—offensively, we just couldn't get anything going,” McDonald said. “We've got a bunch of young guys on defense, and they're getting better and better each week.”
PARIS (AP) — The helicopter pilot who was taken hostage in the escape from prison by one of France's most notorious criminals said the convict's accomplices beat and threatened him during his kidnapping.
Stephane Buy, an experienced pilot and instructor, told RTL radio on Wednesday that two men at a flying club near Paris forced him to take off Sunday at gunpoint.
He knew them because they had previously made a flight with him.
"They told me that I had to comply and do my job well or my family would be in danger, that someone was in front of my home," he said, his voice breaking with emotion.

First, they made him touch down in a field so others on the breakout team could get onboard. At that point, the engine of the old-timer helicopter from the 1960s didn't restart.
Buy said the men hit him on the head and he briefly fell unconscious.
"It was terrible, because I felt helpless in front of that engine, which I had tried to restart five, six times," he said.
The engine finally restarted and they headed to Reau Prison, south of Paris, to hustle convict Redoine Faid to freedom.
The breakout crew made Buy touch down in a tiny area of the courtyard. One member of the team then stayed with him and forced him to wait, hovering about 1 1/2 meters (about 5 feet) above the ground in the prison courtyard.
"It seemed like an eternity," he said. "My fear was that the fuel level was running low ... I didn't know where they would lead me next."
Buy said Faid, the 46-year-old serial robber serving 25 years for murder, remained largely silent during the flight. He said he didn't know who Faid was, even though he is a notorious figure in France who has also written a book on his life of crime.
The men made the pilot head to a suburban town north of Paris where they released him and set fire to the helicopter.
French police have launched a massive manhunt for Faid, who has not been seen since the breakout Sunday.
Buy said he still hopes to be able to fly again in the coming days.
KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) – The Alaska ferry Taku did not receive any bids during the state Marine Highway System's most recent attempt at selling it.
CoastAlaska News reported (http://bit.ly/2rrclnk ) Monday that the minimum bid will now drop. A previous attempt at selling the ship priced it at $1.5 million, while the latest attempt had a minimum bid of $700,000.
Highway system General Manager John Falvey says the Taku will be out for bidding one more time at a price that's yet to be determined. He said it could be sold for scrap if no one buys the ferry.
The ferry system took the 54-year-old ship out of service about two years ago. It's being kept at Ketchikan's Ward Cove.

MANCHESTER, United States: US President Donald Trump tells a crowd gathered at a community college in Manchester, New Hampshire, that the US must have tougher measures against drugs dealers, including the death penalty. AFP
The Central Housing and Planning Authority (CH&PA) has begun legal action against owners of large swathes of land that have done nothing with those properties, Chief Executive Officer of the authority, Lelon Saul said Monday.
“The terms and conditions of the agreement of sale- the company that was involved in the agreement with CH&PA has not lived up to the terms and condition,” he told a news briefing.
Asked by Demerara Waves Online News what efforts were being made to repossess those lands, he said legal action has begun against Sunset Lakes whose directors have since changed hands.
Saul could not say what progress has been so far, he noted that the court system is “slothful” but he was confident that government would regain possession of the lands. He said the Directors of Sunset Lake have sold the company to Bai Shan Lin, but the CH&PA has filed a lawsuit against Sunset Lake.
“The principals have changed because they sold the company..The fact is there are new directors of the company and it is the company that we are pursuing,” he said.
The CH&PA Chief Executive Officer, meanwhile, said government's housing drive was continuing apace with the construction of numerous houses at Perseverance, East Bank Demerara; Onderneeming, West Bank Demerara; Hope-Experiment, West Berbice and Amelia's Ward, Linden. The Authority hopes to engage private developers before year-end.
Saul could not immeciately say what percentage of the Authority's budget has been already spent on the actual construction of houses, but he said the monies would be spent before the end of Guyana's financial year. “What I can assure you (is that) the monies that are allocated for the actual construction- we anticipate by the end of the year most of it will be spent or committed,” he said.
He said the contract for the construction of 40 duplexes at Perseverance was due to be opened on Monday at the CH&PA's Tender Board,
Meanwhile, fresh halibut prices take a tumble as some buyers turn away deliveries
Chum salmon returned home to Alaska this year in numbers never seen before from Southeast to Kotzebue, and set catch records statewide and in many regions.
Chums, also called dogs because of their long use as a prime food source for Alaska Native dog teams, are the most widely distributed of all Pacific salmon and occur throughout Alaska. The fish usually comprise about 15 percent of the total salmon catch, and this year's tally of almost 25 million is the biggest harvest since 2000.
At Kodiak, for example, a chum catch of nearly 2 million was 37 percent higher than usual and the highest take since 1995. Southeast Alaska's chum catch topped 11 million, and at an average price of $.80 a pound, each fish was worth more than $7 to fishermen.
Chums also helped push Norton Sound salmon fishermen to a record $2.8 million pay day, the first time the dock value has topped $2 million. At Kotzebue, two buyers showed up for the first tim?in three year?and flew off with a half million pound chum salmon catch. And at the Yukon, fishermen harvested over 1 million chums for a fishery value of nearly $700,000.
"It's a great year to have a record catch. The market for Alaska chums could not be better," sai?Andy Wink, a fisheries economist with the McDowell Group.
"Some years you have a situation where there is not enough demand to soak up all that you produce and prices come down. We might see a little price affect because it's a record year, but factors coming into this season were really supportive for chums," he added.
Topmost, the harvest in Japan, one of the largest chum producers, was down 30 percent in a run of several years' bad catches. There is no backlog of fish in U.S. cold storages, and higher priced farmed salmon has buyers looking for other options. Wink said wild chum salmon from Alaska, often marketed with the more upscale name of "keta," fits the bill.
"Those high farmed prices raised the bar for everything else and it gets more people interested in doing something with keta, and it also benefits from all the sockeye promotions," he said, adding that several big supermarket chains are doing a "salmon series."
"They will do promotions all season long and go from sockeye to chum to coho salmon," he said. "That makes for a really nice progression."
The chum roe market also is ripe.
Chum roe is the most valuable of all salmon and Japan's harvest shortfall will boost demand for Alaskan supply. Wholesale prices for all salmon roe skyrocketed during the first four months of this year, according to Alaska Department of Revenue data? For chum roe, the price averaged $20.03 per pound up from $15.44 at the same time last year.
Halibut hur?
For the first tim?in four years, fresh halibut prices are taking a tumble with reports of some Alaska buyers turning away deliveries. The stall stems from buyers' response to exorbitant prices over an extended period.
"We don't even want it," said a major Kodiak processor, adding that they are buying halibut only from longtime boats. Prices had dropped to the $5.70 to $6.10 per pound range, down from the more than $7 paid for several years running.
"Halibut is too expensive. Many restaurants have taken it off their menus and many retailers stopped carrying it a while ago for the same reason," echoed another major buyer.
Not coincidentally, this year saw the highest opening wholesale prices on fresh halibu?in four year?at $9.25 per pound, compared to $8.10 last year and $8 the year before that, pointed out market expert John Sackton of Seafood.com?
"The Alaskan halibut market got ahead of itself this year, and as a result, major foodservice customers have been reacting to the high prices," he said.
"Wholesale prices like that can push retail prices into the $30 a pound range for customers. Who in their right mind is going to pay that much for a pound of fish?" asserted Undercurrent News?
Alaska's halibut catch limit this year is just over 18 million pounds. The fishery began in early March and this year ends Nov. 7.
Flies feed fish
The global search for alternatives to wild fish as a meal source for farmed fish has found a winner — flies? A South Africa company called Agriprotein has just won a first ever 'food chain global champion' award in Britain for its MagMeal — a main ingredient in fish and animal feeds made from flies that are reared on food wastes?
"Insect protein is an idea whose time has come and we are now producing it at an industrial scale. This award is a vote of confidence in the waste-to-nutrient industry," said Jason Drew, AgriProtein co-founder and CEO.
Fish meal accounts for 60 to 70 percent of farmed fish production costs (including Alaska's salmon hatcheries) an?each year a quarter of the world'?fish catches — 20 million tons — goe? into fish meal?It can take as many as four pounds of wild fish-based meal to grow one pound of farmed salmon, and world growers are facing increased criticism to find other food sources.
Tests prove tha?all kinds of insect?can make a good feed but the high fat content in black soldier flies provides an extra nutritional boost? AgriProtein calls the United States the "world center" o?protein consumers an? organic wastes — a natural fit for its fly building business?
The compan?has plans t?build 200 fly farms in the United States and Canad? by 2027 to supply a $100 billion aquafeed market.
Scientists from Idaho universities also are embracing a maggot-based fish feed that reduces billions of pounds of cow poop.
Idaho is the nation's largest rainbow trout producer and the fourth biggest dairy state? In tests by animal waste management engineers, fly colonies quickly reduced 700 buckets of cow manure by half, and seeded it with their eggs?Two months later, fish guts from local farms were added to enrich the maggots with omega fatty acids.
The resulting fish feed was "snapped up" by trout in test stations along the Snake River?The scientists said it "made sense since flies are a more natural food than corn and soybean meals."

The Arizona Cardinals added a trio of defensive players in the offseason who played under new coach Steve Wilks with the Carolina Panthers. One is cornerback Lou Young, who signed with the team as a free agent in February.
He has been in the league since 2014, bouncing from roster to roster. He has spent time with the Denver Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, Jacksonville Jaguars, Washington Redskins and Panthers. The only playing time he has had is with the Panthers, as he appeared in six games in 2016.
The 6-1, 205-pound cornerback has one advantage over some of the other players on the roster. He has played in the defensive system before. Learning it was not easy for him, but he is ready to compete this offseason for a spot on the roster.
“You kind of learn from your mistakes, and now my mental and everything is right,” Young said, via Kyle Odegard for the official team site. “I'm confident in what I know. I can play fast and make plays.”
He has a great opportunity to make the team in a very wide-open cornerback competition. Aside from the uncertainty at the position, he wanted to come play for Wilks.
“Once everything calmed down with the coaching change and Coach Wilks came over, it was a no-brainer for me,” he said. “I have a lot of respect for them, as men, first and foremost, and then as coaches. I've learned a lot, both on the field and off the field, how to be a professional. I like to be around people that are going to challenge me and get the best out of me. They don't want anything less, and I don't want anything less.”
He has the length Wilks likes at the position. He is athletic. He comes with a knowledge of the defense. Now he needs to make plays to show he belongs on a team where the cornerback position is mostly unsettled beyond Patrick Peterson.

Share This: James Cameron Wants Audiences To Finally Get Avenger Fatigue Jon
For someone currently busy making four Avatar sequels, director James Cameron is surprisingly enthusiastic about the potential for audience fatigue. While he considers himself a fan of the MCU, he's anxious to see Hollywood take a break from superheroes. “I'm hoping we'll start getting Avenger fatigue here pretty soon,” he said over the weekend. “Not that I don't love the movies. It's just, come on guys, there are other stories to tell besides hyper-gonadal males without families doing death-defying things for two hours and wrecking cities in the process.”
Commercially, the 63-year-old has one of the best track records in Hollywood history, but he confesses that he doesn't really understand where today's audience is coming from. “I would say I don't have… my finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist today because I haven't had a TV show or movie out recently,” he explained. “So I don't know where tastes are going in respect to science fiction.”
Which brings us back to Marvel. While Cameron sees the merit in the company's films, he wishes there was a little more science in their fiction. “We can see the market drives us to a sort of science fiction now that's either completely escapist and doesn't require a technical consultant—an example of that would be Guardians of the Galaxy. It's just fun. We don't care how those spaceships work or any of that stuff works. And then you have scientifically responsible science fiction like The Martian or Interstellar.”
Cameron won't be back in theatres until Avatar 2 arrives in 2020, but Marvel returns later this week with Avengers: Infinity War. Check out the trailer below.

Class of 2013 ends its era on campus with caps, gowns and a few tortillas
[Click here for a Noozhawk photo gallery from UCSB's commencement ceremonies.]
Thousands of people packed UC Santa Barbara's campus for commencement ceremonies this weekend to see proud students throw their hats — and tortillas — after graduating.
There are eight ceremonies for the numerous colleges and UCSB is broadcasting all of them live this year. Click here to view them.
At Saturday afternoon's ceremony for engineering and sciences, Chancellor Henry Yang congratulated the students on their academic achievements.
“I have also noticed your ability to have a good time,” he said with a smile.
“Now is a great time to be engineers and scientists,” said commencement speaker Darlene Solomon, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Agilent Technologies.
Technological progress is accelerating exponentially, so there are so many more opportunities for new graduates to find work they care about and to pursue it with gusto, she said.
Both student speakers joked that they had Googled “life advice” when writing their speeches, which focused on taking risks and prioritizing what's most important.
Haleigh Rachelle Auck, graduating with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, said her curiosity and need to solve problems led her to engineering and, ultimately, to UCSB.
“I've been an engineer in training my whole life; I found more joy in taking the toy apart than playing with the toy itself,” she exclaimed.
Daniel Mena-Martinez, graduating with a bachelor's degree in actuarial sciences, grew up in a non-English-speaking household and used to look at his mechanic father's hands, which were calloused and oil-stained.
“He told me, don't study and you'll be forced to have hands like me,” he recalled.
With all the life lessons Mena-Martinez found online, he said they all had one thing in common: investing time for the important things.
“There are no shortcuts,” he said.

Scarlett Moffatt Made A Touching Tribute To Toff As She Hands Over Her I'm A Celeb Crown!
The Geordie beauty gave her crown to the new reigning queen of the jungle.
It's hard to believe that another series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here has come to an end!
After weeks of jungle life Made In Chelsea star Georgia 'Toff' Toffolo was crowned the winner of the show pipping actor Jamie Lomas to the post.
She looked stunned as Ant and Dec read out her name but she had been a fan favourite for a while and even the Geordie pair admitted on Extra Camp they had her hotly tipped to win!
But the loveliest moment of all was when last year's winner Scarlett Moffat gave a touching tribute to the new Queen of the jungle as she handed over her crown.
As she placed the crown on Toff's head she said: "Honestly, I really hope that this crown brings you as much luck and happiness as it's brought me, I honestly do."
She continued: "Oh my god, I feel like crying for you, because it's girls like you that make me so proud to be a young woman, you did it for all of us girls in there - proper girl power."
The 23-year-old star won over audiences of the show and was consistently bookies favourite to win throughout.
I was on a Féile an Phobail panel with Michelle O'Neill last Wednesday evening, discussing the prospects of Irish unity in the wake of Brexit.
She admitted that she was, “neither naïve nor insensitive about unionist unease on Irish unity,” then added, “constitutional change can be achieved without sacrificing identity or citizenship. For me, upholding, protecting and respecting the rights of all citizens must define a new, agreed and united Ireland. That means upholding the rights of citizens to be British and unionist.”
Here's my problem with that. I am a British citizen: by birth and by choice. I am a unionist by choice, too; someone who believes that the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland will be better protected within the United Kingdom than in a united Ireland. In the event of a border poll producing a majority for ending the Union (triggering years of negotiation against a background of uncertainty and instability) how does she, or anyone else, uphold my right to be British and unionist in the resultant united Ireland?
Nationalists may never have been happy with partition and part of Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom, but they were always able to hold onto the dream of ‘a nation once again'.
But unless there was a guarantee for unionists that a border poll in what had previously been Northern Ireland would be possible again at some point – and I don't see how such a guarantee could be included as part of the overall package – then the right of people like me (and there would be hundreds of thousands of us, don't forget) to be British and unionist wouldn't, in reality, amount to a hill of beans.
It is not possible to be British and unionist in a united Ireland in the way that it is possible to be Irish and nationalist in Northern Ireland. Irish unity shuts down unionism – because the fundamental purpose of unionism is to protect and promote a union with the United Kingdom. Voting to end the Union and then withholding the opportunity to rejoin the Union at some future point means that unionism ceases to have a purpose. What role would there be for the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party or any other unionist party?
Partition didn't rob Sinn Fein of a role and purpose. But Irish unity leaves nothing for political/electoral unionism.
So I'd like to know – and I touched upon the issue when I was guest speaker at a Sinn Fein ‘Uniting Ireland' conference in Dublin in January – what part of my unionism or unionist identity would be protected under Sinn Fein's proposals? I won't be able to campaign for the restoration of the Union. I won't be offered a border poll. I'm pretty sure that unionists wouldn't be given a veto over legislation to match the veto that nationalists have in the Assembly. I'm equally sure that there wouldn't be a form of mandatory power-sharing involving unionists in future all-Ireland governments.
Actually, I can't imagine why any of the Irish political parties would want to do anything with unionism other than relegating it to the status of an historical/cultural curiosity. They certainly wouldn't want it to become a political/electoral force to be reckoned with in the Dáil; or remain a belligerent, troublesome rump in its old strongholds in Antrim, North Down and so on.
Similarly, it would not be in the political/constitutional interests of a newly united Ireland to create space for what was Ulster unionism; so it's very unlikely that space would be created.
I would also like Sinn Fein to thoroughly address Michelle's claim that, “constitutional change can be achieved without sacrificing identity or citizenship”.
How? What would it mean to be a unionist in a united Ireland? What would it mean to be British in a united Ireland? If the Good Friday Agreement – with its right to be British or Irish (or both) – wasn't good enough for Sinn Fein, then why would unionists want a constitutional settlement in a new united Ireland which robs them of role, purpose and the ability to reverse the result of a border poll? If a border poll doesn't deliver Irish unity then Sinn Fein will keep on demanding another one. If a border poll does deliver a united Ireland then unionists will be told to ‘suck it up'.
Identity is a bedrock for most of us. We know who we are. We know who we want to be. That's why nationalists – many of whom have lived their whole lives in the United Kingdom – want a united Ireland. They feel Irish. They want to be Irish. They want their state to reflect their identity.
For the same reason, unionists – who live in a place with Ireland in the title – reject the primacy of the Irishness in favour of the United Kingdom; because they, too, want a state that reflects their identity. So, in just the same way that nationalists in Northern Ireland can't permanently settle for their Irish/nationalist identity being simply recognised and accommodated in part of the United Kingdom, unionists wouldn't settle for their British/unionist identity being simply recognised and accommodated in a united Ireland.
I welcome the fact that Sinn Fein seems ready to extend the unity debate (and I hope mainstream unionism will engage); but they really need to move beyond positions and guarantees for unionists in a united Ireland that Sinn Fein wouldn't themselves settle for in Northern Ireland.
MADRID (AP) — The Spanish parliament's lower house is debating whether to end Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's nearly eight years in power and replace him with the leader of the Socialist opposition.
Rajoy refused to resign after his conservative Popular Party was fined as beneficiary of a large kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. In a damaging ruling last week, the court questioned Rajoy's claim that he and other top officials were unaware of the party's illegal accounting.
Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, who is leading the no-confidence vote against Rajoy, would instantly become the country's prime minister if he wins 176 or more votes in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies on Friday.
His opening speech Thursday proposing an alternative government will be watched by other opposition lawmakers who are still undecided on whether to oust the government.
At the center of Charlottesville's violent white nationalist rally was a long-simmering controversy over the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.
Controversies over Confederate symbols have been brewing around the country — most notably in South Carolina, where the Confederate flag was lowered from the state house grounds two years ago, and New Orleans, where statues came down earlier this year.
But in Charlottesville, the movement to remove a Lee statue and the backlash that followed have become particularly intense thanks to an ongoing court battle and questions over whether the city council has the authority to remove it.
Now, the planned removal of the statue became a rallying cause for the alt-right — and symbol of growing discontent.
One hundred years ago, in 1917, the 26-foot-high statue was commissioned by a philanthropist and given to the city along with the surrounding land in honor of his parents. The statue took seven years and three sculptors (the first one died) to complete. According to the city of Charlottesville's website, the statue was unveiled in 1924 by 100 cadets from the Virginia Military Institute who "paraded through the center of Charlottesville decorated with Confederate colors." The new statue was also reportedly greeted with loud cheers and a speech by then-president of "the University of Virginia Edwin Alderman and followed by parties and balls.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The registration form from the Department of the Interior states that the sculpture "remains undisturbed in its original location. Charlottesville will undoubtedly keep it there, for the monument is a unique to the most eminent Confederate hero of all and an outstanding example of the outdoor sculpture of the late City Beautiful movement."
It is now doubtful — though still possible — that Charlottesville will "keep it there." In February, the city council voted 3-2 to sell the statue, ignoring the recommendation of a commission that suggested moving it.
A group called Virginia's Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the city, alleging it did not have the right to remove the statute since it was a war memorial. A related group, and others, filed a lawsuit in New Orleans to block the removal of a Gen. Lee statue as well as one of Jefferson Davis. A federal appeals court said that city could remove its Confederate monuments.
City Councilor Bob Fenwick, who cast a tie-breaking vote in Charlottesville in April (that vote allowed the city to sell the statue), hoped the city council's action would put to bed more than a year of heated debate in his city. "For now, it is now time for our city to rest," he said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
But that didn't happen. The movement against removal of the statue grew — there is a Facebook group to Save the Robert E. Lee Statue and call for donations to "fund litigation to preserve our monuments." The backlash to the planned removal culminated in a white nationalist rally last weekend, which used the planned removal as a rallying cause. It is important to note, however, that the group behind hte lawsuit, SVC, condemned the Charlottesville rallies. Chaplain-in-chief Ray Parker wrote on Facebook over the weekend: "I condemn in the strongest possible way the actions, words, and beliefs of the KKK and other white supremacist groups."
The statue has also been tagged with graffiti several times in the past few years, including with "black lives matter" and "native land."
In May, a judge granted a temporary injunction, which meant the statue could not be removed for next six months. So, for now, the statue is still standing in what used to be Lee Park. Only the city council also voted earlier this year to rename the park, an action that was upheld by a judge. Gen. Lee now, rather ironically, sits in Emancipation Park.
The DUP has reacted to today's draft deal between the British government and the EU by stressing that it does not contain any definitive blueprints for the post-Brexit border.
Following the release of the government's dense, 129-page draft deal document, much of the focus was on the clause about a “backstop” arrangement to keep Northern Ireland at least partly under EU rules in the event no deal is reached over Brexit.
Whilst the text does call for such a measure, the DUP issued a statement which said, “there has been no agreement around how arrangements of any potential border backstop” would work.
The party said the government and EU have already committed to having both “no hard border” on the island of Ireland, or any “borders or barriers to trade within the UK”.
The party statement added: “We will continue to work with the government on these matters and will be guided by the principle that there can be no internal border within the UK as we leave the EU.”
Sinn Fein reacted with a statement from its Northern Ireland MEP Martina Anderson which said “there is now confirmation that the British government is accepting the agreements made, including the backstop option which would see the north remaining in the customs union and significant elements of the single market”.
She also demanded that the taoiseach intervene to “ensure that the rights of people in the north are protected”.
When it comes to the idea of a backstop scenario which could see Northern Ireland placed under different rules than the UK mainland, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “I am glad that the British prime minister has sensibly rowed back from the language that no prime minister could sign up to this proposal.
“In the continued absence of that economic common sense from the British government, the backstop agreement will inevitably come into effect.”
Simon Coveney, the Republic of Ireland's foreign minister, said after meeting Michel Barnier that “negotiations are moving forward – progress on Irish issues remains a key priority for both negotiating teams and solidarity with our EU partners remains strong”.
A father of three who was caught with guns and ammunition belonging to dissident republicans has started a nine-month prison sentence.
Edward Francis Corr was arrested after police searched a shed at his Foxes Glen home in Dunmurry in October 2016.
Corr – who claimed he was threatened at gunpoint to store a bag containing the guns – was handed an 18-month sentence at Belfast Crown Court, and was told by Judge Paul Ramsey that he will serve half the sentence in prison, followed by nine months on licence when he is released from jail.
Corr admitted a charge of possessing firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life and possession of a modified firearm.
The court heard the charges related to the discovery of two semi-automatic pistols, two magazines and a quantity of ammunition as well as a Skorpion M48 submachine gun which was “designed or adapted that two or more missiles could be successively discharged without repeated pressure on the trigger''.
At the time of the discovery, police linked the guns to dissident republican group Oglaigh na hEireann (ONH).
At a previous hearing, prosecution counsel Liam McCollum QC said the weapons were seized by police during a search of a shed at Corr's Dunmurry home on October 24, 2016.
Corr was arrested and during police interview he told detectives that a week earlier he was having a cigarette at the side of his house when he saw a man at his garden shed trying to hide a bag.
He claimed that he confronted the man who told him that he was from a “paramilitary organisation”. Mr McCollum said this male told Corr to hold on the bag and it would be collected from him.
The prosecutor said: “He says he was resistant to this and the man pointed the gun at his head and threatened him.” Corr claimed the man told him he “would be shot” if he didn't keep the bag, and that it would be collected in five or six weeks time.
Corr also said during interview that he feared the consequences for his wife and three children if he didn't keep the bag, and if he didn't comply violence would be used against him.
The court was told Corr's fingerprint was found on one of the guns inside the bag after it underwent a forensic examination.
Gavan Duffy QC, representing Corr, said his client was a joiner by trade who had a mental health history brought on by the loss of his three-year-old brother in “traumatic circumstances” when they were both children.
Saying Corr had “kept himself to himself” on remand and did not associate with paramilitary inmates, Mr Duffy said Corr's main concern whilst behind bars is for his family.
MIAMI - James Johnson scored a career-high 31 points, Kelly Olynyk added 30 off the bench and the Miami Heat set a franchise single-game scoring record by beating the Denver Nuggets 149-141 in double overtime Monday night.
Miami's total was also an NBA season-high and helped the Heat get back to the No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference standings. Houston and Oklahoma City each scored 148 in games earlier this season.
Wayne Ellington scored 29 points for the Heat. Nikola Jokic had 34 for Denver, while Wilson Chandler added 26 for the Nuggets.
"That was as playoffs as it comes right there," Olynyk said.
The NBA's stat system crashed late in the first overtime, and crews were scrambling to determine the final numbers long after the buzzer. All that ultimately mattered was the score -- one that moved the Heat closer to a playoff berth and left the Nuggets two games back in the Western Conference race.
Neither team was at full strength. For Miami, Dwyane Wade (left hamstring strain) missed his fourth consecutive game, and Hassan Whiteside (left hip pain) sat out his fifth straight contest. Denver was without leading scorer Gary Harris, sidelined again by a strained right knee that could keep him out several more days.
Denver led 16-5 after 3 1/2 minutes, and that was the only double-digit lead by either side for about the next three hours. It was airtight until the very final moments, almost to an absurd degree.
After one quarter, Denver led by one.
Halftime, Miami led by one.
After three, Miami still by one.
After regulation, tied.
After one overtime, still tied.
Back and forth they went all night, two teams who played a one-point game at Denver back in November -- that one not being decided until Dion Waiters' missed jumper as time expired sealed the Nuggets' win -- and now are fighting with playoffs in mind. The Heat are essentially playing for a seed; the Nuggets are playing for a berth.
Denver led by six midway through the fourth before Miami used a 10-2 run to reclaim the lead. Nikola Jokic tied it for Denver with 10 seconds left in regulation, Josh Richardson missed for Miami at the end and to overtime they went tied at 118. The Heat thought they merited a trip to the line when Johnson missed at the end of the first overtime, but no whistle came.
So in the second overtime, they seized control and outscored the Nuggets 18-10 in the final five minutes. Wayne Ellington rattled in a 3-pointer to start the second extra session, and the Heat didn't trail again.
TIP-INS
Nuggets: Including the franchise's ABA days, all 28 previous Nuggets teams to finish .500 or better made the playoffs. ... Denver fell to 19-5 in games where it scores at least 115 points. The Nuggets are now 17-30 when allowing more than 105.
Heat: It was the highest-scoring first four quarters of an overtime game in Heat history. The previous before-OT high was 115 at Golden State on Dec. 1, 2008. ... A pregame moment of silence was held for the six victims of last week's bridge collapse near Florida International University. ... The previous scoring record was 141 points, done twice.
NEVER FORGET
The Heat continue paying tributes to the 17 victims of the shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra and several players spent their day off Sunday at the Parkland Rec League Basketball Championship, honoring the lives of victims Joaquin Oliver, Luke Hoyer and Alex Schacter by announcing scholarships in their names -- as well as a $500,000 donation.
ROAD TRIP
This seven-game trip for the Nuggets is their longest since a seven-gamer in the 2011-12 season. As if a late-season two-week trip wasn't tough enough, Denver's remaining schedule is brutal; after visiting Chicago on Wednesday, the Nuggets will have 10 games left -- all against teams currently in the playoff mix.
TOURNEY TIME
There's serious NCAA talk in the Heat locker room, with many players seeing their schools in the Sweet 16. The Heat-backed teams -- Kentucky (Bam Adebayo), Duke (Justise Winslow), Nevada (Luke Babbitt), Kansas State (Rodney McGruder), Gonzaga (Kelly Olynyk), Syracuse (Dion Waiters) and Michigan (Derrick Walton Jr.).
UP NEXT
Nuggets: Visit Chicago on Wednesday.
Heat: Host New York on Wednesday.

(WSVN) - If you're one those people who sip coffee out of a straw–even hot coffee–because you're afraid of staining your teeth, then get ready to get a caffeine-like rush from this: the first colorless and stainless coffee is here.
The “world's first colorless coffee” is here and it's called CLEAR COFFEE. According to the website, the clear coffee drink was created in Slovakia and is made from only two ingredients: Arabica coffee beans and water.
For those worried if the coffee-flavored water is flavored with chemicals, the company states that their beverage does not contain “preservatives, artificial flavours, stabilizers, sugar or any other sweeteners.”
We're a little skeptical, but hey, if you love your pearly whites but have a coffee addiction, give it a try!

The liberal rap against US Attorney General Jeff Sessions is pretty well ossified at this point: He's racist, according to critics who point to the comments that got him rejected from a federal judgeship in 1986. Coretta Scott King passionately opposed his judicial nomination at the time. Those critics also highlight Sessions' votes as a senator against expanding the federal hate crimes law, and his stance in the Trump administration limiting LGBT rights and cracking down on immigrants.
Given all that, lots of folks expected Sessions to distance himself from the violence at a hate parade this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. But Sessions pilloried white supremacists in the aftermath more than the president did in his initial comments. Sessions, beyond just calling out “racial bigotry,” announced a civil rights investigation on Sunday, and then on Monday morning said Saturday's car attack on anti-racism protesters — which killed one woman and injured 19 others — “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism.”
Lots of people on Tweeter were skeptical. @dominicholden Not to be a Debbie Downer, but since when did Sessions switch sides? I'm hedging my bets. Still reme… https://t.co/Xd31pjnIZ5
@dominicholden Please explain how this man can persecute minorities, and at the same time seriously make the statement above.
Regardless of his record of hostility to civil rights protections, Sessions' hard line this weekend fits neatly with his decades as a lawmaker and prosecutor: He believes in enforcing laws — particularly nailing violent criminals — more than he does in pursuing his own ideology.
“This is completely consistent with the Jeff Session that I worked for,” Willie Huntley, who served as a deputy US attorney under Sessions in Alabama in the 1980s, told BuzzFeed News Monday. “It doesn't surprise me at all.” Even though Sessions hasn't crusaded to expand legal rights for minorities, he's shown no compunction about using civil-rights laws to increase police power and mete out harsher penalties. “He can set aside the ideology and do the task, as long as it's within the rule of law,” added Huntley, a black man who says opponents on the left have mischaracterized Sessions' views on race. “I think his personal feelings take a backseat to enforcing the law,” he said. “And he did find those acts in Charlottesville to be reprehensible.” Violent crime has become a familiar devil in Sessions' evangelizing as head of the Justice Department. In at least six speeches since May, Sessions warned Americans that violent crime is rising and this scourge, particularly in cities, imperils our way of life. America will find salvation by giving more power to law enforcement, he argues, using each speech to pivot to the issues of the day: more mandatory prison terms, increasing property seizures, coercing cities into handing over undocumented immigrants. Criminals play the villain in his speeches, and the plot climaxes when we punish them. And in this pursuit of more policing power, he professes he will save people from across the political spectrum.
On June 29 in Washington, DC, Sessions convened a Hate Crimes Summit and pledged to enforce hate crimes laws — including the one he voted against enacting in 2009. “As long as I am attorney general, the Department of Justice will continue to protect the civil rights of all Americans — and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in our country,” he told a group of mostly progressive activists. “I have directed all our federal prosecutors to make fighting violent crime a top priority — and you can be sure that this includes hate crimes.” Sessions ticked through accomplishments under his watch: indicting a man for the arson of an Islamic center in Texas, charging the suspect in a shooting of three men perceived to be Muslim in Kansas, and sentencing a man in the homicide of a transgender woman in Mississippi. If the law says someone can be punished, Sessions seems ready go — his rhetoric has been indiscriminate. In March, several Democratic members of Congress wrote to Sessions with their concerns about the high rate of homicides of transgender women. Sessions wrote back in May that “violence against transgender individuals is a serious problem,” and he's looking into several cases to “determine whether federal action would be appropriate.” A Department of Justice official also told BuzzFeed News the agency has set up a subcommittee on anti-transgender hate crimes. Huntley said that Sessions gets a bad rap in part because of his association with Trump, who has been slow to disavow the KKK and white nationalists. “Sessions supported Trump early on and continued to support him as president,” he said. “So many individuals were shrouded with the belief that Jeff was an inner-core racist, and some people just weren't able to look past this and see that this is a man who is passionate about enforcing laws and protecting innocent victims,” he said. That said, the results of this investigation into what happened this weekend Charlottesville — and any criminal charges, or lack of them — are a way out. So no predictions here. But if Sessions charges someone — or multiple people — it doesn't seem he's doing it reluctantly or just for show. This is who he is. As Huntley noted, Sessions can be quite zealous about enforcing the law in the name of protecting victims. “On a scale of 1 to 10, Jeff would probably be an 11.”

With the latest instalment of Star Wars series ‘The Last Jedi' due for release next week, the Force could be with Star Wars fans who have valuable vintage action figures.
Indeed, the classic action figures can be worth tens of thousands of pounds, according to PromotionalCodes.org.uk, who have found the ten rarest and most sought-after.
As well as the very first models of Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobe with “double telescoping” light sabres, collectors also seek the near-legendary ‘rocket firing' Boba Fett, ‘small head' Han Solo and vinyl-caped Jawas.
Classic action figures can change hands for close to £30k, making a discarded collection from the 1970s potentially worth more than the average UK house.
The money saving website looked at how much the vintage 1970s and 80s dolls could fetch today and compiled a list of the ten rarest ones.
The most valuable and sought-after figures are the “carded” ones, which still retain the printed cardboard backing of their original packaging.
Original accessories, such as a blaster and cape for Princess Leia and lightsabre for Luke Skywalker, also increase the value. Figures also command higher prices when they are in good condition.
A very rare Boba Fett from the 1970s, still sealed in its original packaging, sold for £26,040 last year at Vectis Auctions in Teesside.
Previously, the auction house sold an R2-D2 toy dating back to the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back for £750. Both it and its original packaging were in near mint condition.
A 1977 Jawa figure, also with its original packaging and in near-mint condition, fetched £620, while a 1980 Yoda with its package went for £320.
Meanwhile, various other figures from the 1970s and 80s often go on eBay for around £70.
The holy grails of Star Wars collectibles are the very first versions of Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobe, which had “double telescoping” lightsabres.
Other particularly rare figures include the “small head” Han Solo, which was replaced at an early stage for one with a larger head that looked more like actor Harrison Ford.
There is also the semi-mystical “rocket firing Boba Fett” – one such figurine sold last year at Vectis for an unexpectedly low £18,600.
More recently, Lego produced some valuable, limited edition minifigures of various Star Wars characters as giveaway prizes.
These include a 14-karat gold C-3P0 and solid bronze models of Boba Fett – Lego made just five and four of these, respectively.
Darren Williams of Promotionalcodes.org.uk said: “More than 300 million-Star Wars action figures were sold between 1978 and 1985, so it's safe to say there must be quite a lot that are still floating around in people's possession.
“It's hard to say which toy is the most valuable, since it all depends on things like the condition of the toy, whether it still has its packaging and if so what condition that's in and so on.
“But if you do have a 1970s or 80s toy, it could potentially be worth a lot, so channel your inner mercenary Han Solo and get it valued.”
Ten rarest original Star Wars toys
“Double telescoping lightsabre” figures
The very first action figures of Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobe and Luke Skywalker had lightsabres that extended twice to full length. These were quickly replaced for cost reasons and because the lightsabres were highly breakable.
The Darth Vader double telescoping lightsabre figure is believed to be the rarest of the three, followed by Obi-Wan and Luke Skywalker.
Rocket firing Boba Fett
This toy is almost legendary. An early Boba Fett prototype had a rocket that fired from its back, but did not go into mass production due to safety concerns.
“Small head” Han Solo
The very first Han Solo was discontinued early for not bearing a close enough resemblance Harrison Ford, and replaced by another version with a larger head.
Vinyl cape Jawa
The original “vinyl cape” Jawa model from 1978 is another rarity, having been swiftly replaced with a cloth-caped version.
Blue Snaggletooth
When creating this toy back in the day, manufacturer Kenner had only a black and white headshot to work from. It decided to make the creature blue, but then in the film the alien wore red and was half the height. The original Blue Snaggletooth is a collector's item.
Yak Face
This is especially valuable in America, where it was never sold. It was the last action figure to be made before the line ceased in 1985.
FX-7 Medical Droid
It had just a few seconds of screen time in The Empire Strikes Back, but this model is a jewel for collectors.
Vlix
This little-known character is from the Star Wars spin-off show Droids. It is very rare - only one line of the Vlix model was produced, in Brazil.
1985 Anakin Skywalker
There have been numerous recent Anakin Skywalker dolls, but the 1985 original is a rare collector's item.
White cloaked Bib Fortuna
The Bib Fortuna figure had a brown cloak, but a few prototypes with white ones were produced.
Last week, Ellen took a rare detour from her usual fun and friendly topics into the world of current events.
One major discussion that's on her mind is police brutality. Ellen sat down with Van Jones to discuss the issue and she had a lot to say. Peep her commentary below!
Also On 93.9 WKYS:
A mother-of-four, who claimed she did not know her Las Vegas wedding was valid in Ireland, has been cleared of unlawfully obtaining almost €30,000 in one parent family payments.
At Dublin District Court, Judge John Brennan had compared the case to the comedy film The Hangover about the antics of a group of men at a bachelor party in Las Vegas in the United States.
Ruling on Wedesday, he said the marriage was valid.
However, he accepted submissions from Matthew Holmes BL that his client Michelle Burke (39), from Cappagh Road, Finglas, Dublin 11 could rely on the defence of “honest though unreasonable belief”.
Dismissing the case, the judge said he had studied her demeanour when she testified and he added that her evidence was effectively uncontroverted.
The total alleged fraud was €29,773 and it was the prosecution's case that she got married and failed to notify the Department of Social Protection while claiming the one parent family payment between November 2010 and August 2012, a charge she had denied.
If convicted she would have faced a possible six-month jail term.
The trial heard she had been in receipt of the one parent family payment since 1997. She was getting €317 a week.
A trawl by staff from the Department of Social Protection revealed Ms Burke got married to her current partner on November 6th, 2010, at the Holywood Wedding Chapel, Las Vegas. The court heard the marriage was legally recognised in Ireland.
Her payment was stopped and she was interviewed but told the inspector she did not think that the marriage was legal. She also said her partner, who was not the father of her children, paid tax and then lived at a different address in Dublin 1.
In the witness box, Ms Burke had claimed she had gone the US for a few days with a group for a friend's birthday party.
Questioned by her barrister about the marriage ceremony, she claimed “we just thought it was funny to do it” and it was for “for a laugh”.
“I honestly didn't think it was legal,” she said.
Asked why she did not remember much about the ceremony, she replied, “because we were drunk”.
GWI begins breaking down fence it says encroaches on Lama Canal reserve
The Guyana Water Incorporated (GWI) on Monday- March 19, 2018- began dismantling a fence which it said was found to be encroaching on its reserve near the Lama Canal.
Only the first of the two-layered zinc fence was removed.
The utility company said in a statement that the fence was encroaching on 66 feet of the company's reserve near the Canal that is used to supply water from the East Demerara Water Conservancy to Shelter Belt on Vlissengen Road for purification and distribution.
The company further explained that section of the reserve measured 149 feet by 181 feet in 2015 but Monday had a measurement of 149 feet by 118 feet.
GWI's Managing Director, Dr. Richard Van West-Charles, who was on site as workers dismantled the fence, said that the company cannot encourage such a level of encroachment, which he described as ‘lawless.'
He pointed out that it has been a long battle with residents regarding intrusions on the reserve and an attempt was made to meet with them in 2016 but they were a ‘no show.' According to him, the utility will be taking action straight along the Lamaha Canal.
In the latter part of 2015, the Georgetown Mayor and City Council had decided to use the unoccupied portion of land for a “Green” park. However, GWI reached out and indicated that it was interested in erecting a corporate office on said land and the parties arrived at a mutual understanding. At that time, there was a zinc fence erected behind the last house towards Sheriff Street in Georgetown.
It was indicated to the occupier, Mr. Peter Ramsaroop that the issues surrounding ownership and occupancy will be addressed and communicated to the residents who were on the reserve. Recently, it became noticeable that the fence behind the last house had moved to take in more land.
The Lamaha Canal is utilized by GWI's Shelter-Belt Water Treatment plant, and Regional Manager of Georgetown, Mr. Curtis Niles said that removing the illegal structures will allow the company to provide a better quality of water to residents of the capital city.
He explained that there are blockages and the illegal structures will hinder the cleaning of the intake of water from the canal, thus affecting water quality. According to him, removing the illegal structures will also allow the utility to function more efficiently, since access to properly clean the canal will result in the use of fewer chemicals for treatment of the water.
A current discussion between lawyers for City Hall and the Hotel Santa Barbara has centered on what is a tax and what is a fee.
The hotel threatens to sue if the utility fee is really a tax. This is a topic that I studied briefly when trying to assist the city with its budget shortfall as a City Council candidate.
A fee must represent some actual and specific service/s out of the ordinary rendered by the city, while a tax is simply to provide funds for city services. While not wanting to comment on the current discussion, I did discover many places where the city is not collecting fees for extraordinary services, particularly in the area of policing.
You can check the studies on this or ask a cop. A huge portion of city policing is caused by the consumption of alcoholic beverages, beer being the most common. This is not just in the bars, but a majority of domestic violence, disorderly conduct and gang violence are committed under the influence as are many motor vehicle accidents and infractions. This is above and beyond ordinary police services, and the taxpayer should be compensated through a fee charged to anyone who sells alcoholic beverages.
In October 2005, the Ventura City Council approved an Alcohol Sales Permit Ordinance. Funds collected pay for policing required by the consumption of alcoholic beverages. This has been done elsewhere and has not been challenged in the courts.

eBay has threatened to block Australians from using its platform if the government pushes ahead with its "unworkable" online GST changes.
Under new laws slated to come into effect from July 1, overseas businesses with an annual turnover of A$75,000 (NZ$81,000) or more will be required to register with the ATO to collect GST on all goods sold, including purchases under the current low-value threshold of A$1000.
Treasurer Scott Morrison claims the changes are about levelling the playing field to ensure Australian businesses "do not continue to be unfairly disadvantaged by the current GST exemption that applies to imports of low-value goods".
Major retailers including Harvey Norman and Premier Investments have long lobbied for the change, saying it will level the playing field against the likes of Amazon, Asos and eBay.
But in a scathing submission to a Senate inquiry, eBay has joined a growing chorus speaking out against the changes, describing it as a "hastily introduced", "counter-productive", "complex", "inconsistent" and "unworkable" bill that will "harm Australian consumers in many ways".
"Regrettably, the government's legislation may force eBay to prevent Australians from buying from foreign sellers," writes Jooman Park, eBay's vice president and managing director for Australia and New Zealand.
"No tax would be paid to Australia and none would be owed. It would raise no revenue, deny Australians access to choice and lessen price competition. This solution would not even represent a win for bricks and mortar retailers, because Australians would still find ways to buy online.
"They would do so direct via dotcoms without paying GST and they would lose the confidence they current enjoy buying from eBay with the advantage of its trusted seller ratings. This appears to be the most likely outcome at present."
If the bill is not withdrawn, eBay said, then "significant amendments" would be required "to even contemplate third-party online marketplaces somehow collecting GST given their current business models do not support it".

Echoing arguments by RMIT economists Sinclair Davidson and Chris Berg, eBay points out that the legislation "potentially deems eBay to be a 'seller' and an 'electronic distribution platform'" when it is neither.
"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the marketplace: eBay is not a seller," Mr Park writes. "eBay does not own the goods, does not handle payments and it does not distribute anything. eBay is a third party online marketplace that simply connects buyers and sellers.
"Perhaps there is confusion with other online marketplace-style business models. However, in those cases the online 'marketplace' is actually the real seller. Indeed, such first party marketplaces are no different to a retail shop, they hold and ship the goods, have large warehouses with stock and they handle the payments. eBay does none of this."
eBay said an online poll of 1000 Australians found 59 per cent did not support the bill as "it's unreasonable because eBay does not own, hold, sell or supply goods, rather it provides a marketplace for these transactions to occur".
"Under the current Australian proposal, tax liability changes depending on goods value; seller turnover; platform or direct sale; courier, postal company or repackaging business," Mr Park writes.
"A simpler alternative for an island nation is to work with the logistics companies. All parcels arrive at a small number of Customs points, via a small number of international logistics companies, one of which is government-owned.
"These companies can require buyers to declare whether a good is new and to nominate a value of the good as part of the pricing of parcel delivery to Australia. This system does not require parcels to be stopped, other than for routine auditing.
"It captures all goods, regardless of whether they were purchased via a platform or from a dot.com. It is practical and enforceable, raises genuine revenue and is fair. Unlike other proposals, this does level the playing field."
In a separate submission, Asos has also hit out against the changes. "We are concerned that if, complexity and uncertainty are not avoided, then compliance will be needlessly difficult which could have a negative impact on both the success of the legislation and the Australian consumer," writes Carly Cazzolli, Asos head of trading for Australia and New Zealand.
"There is too little time between the finalisation of the legislation and the proposed commencement date. It seems likely that the new legislation will not be finalised and enacted until May at the earliest, this only leaves one month to implement and test any required changes to both retailers' systems and those of any third parties involved in the supply chain."

The British model at the centre of a kidnap ordeal in Italy has said she's quitting glamour modelling.
The comments from Chloe Ayling came as she recalled the moment she thought she was going to die at the hands of her captors.
Appearing on Monday's This Morning for her first live TV interview, the model, 20, couldn't hold back the tears as she was questioned about her harrowing and terrifying abduction by a gang of sex traffickers in Italy, reports the Mirror.
Italian police said Ms Ayling was snatched by a group calling itself Black Death in Milan last month.
It is believed she was drugged and transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, where she was held for six days as her captors tried to auction her online.
She said she was injected with ketamine after being lured to a fake modelling shoot before being bundled into the boot of a car and told she was going to be sold as a sex slave.
And addressing how the terrifying time has affected her life, Chloe admitted: "I'm still scared, I'm not the same person at home. I'm going to have a complete career change.
"I haven't thought about the future, but I know I won't be the same person again."
Speaking frankly and candidly about her abduction in Milan and her time in captivity, the glamour model admitted that at one point she'd been left hoping for a "non-painful death", before revealing that she would never "be the same person again".
Following a sceptical backlash against her version of events, following an initial outpouring of sympathy and anger at what had happened to her, Chloe sat down opposite Eamon Holmes and Ruth Langsford to set the record straight.
Going into the shocking details of her abduction from a supposed photo studio in Milan, Chloe said she walked into a "silent" room - something that unnerved her.
However, her abductors struck almost instantly, drugging her and restraining her in a bag in the boot of a car.
"Before I had the time to process my thoughts... that's when the masked man put his arm around me and my face," she explained, before clarifying there was a second disguised attacker who injected her with a drug.

Recalling her first terrifying moments after waking up, Chloe explained: "I woke up in the boot of a car in a zip up bag, handcuffed, gagged with tape over my mouth.
"It was horrible, I was still drugged up. I was trying to shout and find my way out. The car was moving and the radio was on. It took a while for them to pull over the car and check on me.
"It was when they pulled over that I saw they'd put an empty suitcase there next to me. Why would they put that there unless they were planning to kill me?"
Clearly still struggling with the ordeal, which took place three weeks ago, she burst into tears whilst saying: "I was just hoping for a non-painful death."
“We're not any more special than anybody else, but we are targets,” said Rep. Barry Loudermilk. “This is exactly why there is a lot of fear of even doing town halls at this point.
The shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, which left Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise critically wounded, has renewed calls for stricter gun control measures in the country.
However, at least one Republican congressman is calling for more guns, in response to the tragedy.
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), who was present on the GOP baseball practice squad when the shooting occurred, says Congress should consider allowing lawmakers to arm themselves.
“If this had happened in Georgia, he wouldn't have gotten too far,” Loudermilk told Capitol Hill reporters, according to the Washington Post. “I had a staff member who was in his car maybe 20 yards behind the shooter, who was pinned in his car, who back in Georgia carries a 9-millimeter in his car. . . . He had a clear shot at him.”
The shooting has also brought into focus lax gun laws in Virginia, which is known to be a gun-friendly state.
Virginia State Police says firearms don't have to be registered and the state allows people to openly carry guns without a permit. Concealed carry, however, requires a permit. Meanwhile, in Alexandria, a permit for gun ownership is not required either does the city require for guns to be registered.
“No firearm or airgun (BB) can be discharged within the City limits except by law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties,” according to the city's official website.
Loudermilk, however, referenced gun laws in Washington that are comparatively stricter. He said all lawmakers deserved guns or some sort of security, not just the top level D.C. politicians.
“Most of us are here in D.C., so how do you have the gun here and just transport it to Virginia?” Loudermilk added. “I think we need to look at some kind of reciprocity for members here.”
And then bizarrely he suggested the lack of lax gun laws is the reason many lawmakers are not attending town halls. This is a false statement because the reason many, mostly Republican, congressmen have lately been ditching town halls is because they can't defend the disastrous GOP health care plan aka Trumpcare.
“We're not any more special than anybody else, but we are targets,” Loudermilk said. “This is exactly why there is a lot of fear of even doing town halls at this point.”
So, as per Loudermilk's logic, if one adds more guns to a mass shooting, it will help reduce gun violence.
Genius.

The incident, that was caught on camera, took place in the lunchroom of a Turners and Growers pack house in Whakatu, near Hastings, in July 2015.
Kylie's sisters Kim, Khloe and Kourtney are also fans of waist-trainers.
Kylie Jenner has revealed she is using a waist-trainer to get back in shape after giving birth to her first baby.
The US reality TV star, 20, welcomed daughter Stormi in February.
She posted a picture on Instagram showing her waist cinched into a black corset, which she said was of the “snap back” package.
She wrote: “my girl @premadonna87 hooked me up with the @waistgangsociety snap back package. #ad waistgang has the BEST quality snap back products.
“make sure you get your package & follow @waistgangsociety to join & keep up the journey together.”
Jenner is not the only member of her famous family who is a fan of the tummy-toning technique.
Both Kim and Khloe Kardashian have shared photos showing them using waist-trainers in the past.
Kourtney Kardashian was also pictured in one of the belts after having her third child.

Alexis Sanchez's first goal for Manchester United wrapped up a 2-0 victory against Huddersfield on a day when the clubs came together to mark the 60th anniversary of the Munich air disaster.
Tuesday is the 60th anniversary of the tragedy which claimed 23 lives, including eight players, as Matt Busby's side returned from a European Cup match at Red Star Belgrade.
Silence fell upon Old Trafford as those lost were remembered ahead of the Premier League match that United won, with goals from Romelu Lukaku and Sanchez sealing the victory on his home debut.
Huddersfield struggled to create clear-cut chances in their first league trip to Old Trafford since March 1972 but dug deep in the first half to frustrate the hosts, who claimed a penalty when Terence Kongolo poleaxed Scott McTominay.
United were struggling for a creative spark but went up a gear after halftime, going ahead within 10 minutes of the restart when Lukaku smartly turned home a cross from Juan Mata.
Sanchez won a penalty and saw it saved, only to turn home the rebound as United bounced back from the midweek loss at Tottenham, and extended Huddersfield's winless Premier League run to an eighth match.
Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier is leaving President Trump's American Manufacturing Council, saying, "I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."
The resignation came after Trump was criticized for his response to the violence at white supremacist events in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. The president, famous for his ability to be direct and forceful, was faulted for condemning violence "on many sides."
Within an hour of Merck announcing Frazier's withdrawal, Trump retorted on Twitter, "Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned ... he will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices!"
Frazier stated, "America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal."
He was acting, Frazier said, as both the CEO of Merck and "as a matter of personal conscience."
Members of his own party have called on Trump to condemn Saturday's killing of a woman who had been protesting white supremacists as an act of domestic terrorism. The White House later stated that Trump was including "white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups" in his remarks about the violence.
Frazier's departure is the latest high-profile exit from a presidential business council since Trump took office in January.
When Trump announced the U.S. would be leaving the Paris climate accord, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Bob Iger left his business advisory council.
And in February, Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick left the same advisory council during the fallout from Trump's executive order that banned immigrants from seven Muslim countries.
"The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," Kalanick said at the time.
It certainly was a Grand evening as businesses from across the south coast gathered in Brighton to celebrate excellence, but also to compete for the top prize.
Returning for a seventh year, the Johnston Press South Business Awards are dedicated to recognising, rewarding and celebrating local businesses.
Taking place at Brighton's Grand Hotel, the awards were presented by TV personality Nick Wallis on Friday night.
After a strong showing at their local JP Awards, Chichester's Guardian Angel Carers sccoped the top prize Overall Business Of The Year, as well as Large Business of the Year.
Business owner and managing director, Christina Bassadone, said: “It's absolutely amazing. It's just such a privilege.
“We had a hard year last year, this is such a huge boost to the team.
“I do not think staff always get the recognition they deserve. I really hope that they take a lot of inspiration from the award.
“Also a huge thank you to all of our carers for all of the wonderfuil work in the community.”
With so many fabulous restaurants and eateries across the region, it seems impossible to pick one to top them all.
But judges singled out Olive and Vine in Midhurst for the coveted Place to Eat or Drink Award, praising a business formed when its founders took a leap of faith and backed themselves.
Dean Brown-fuller, owner of Olive and Vine, said: “It's an amazing experience for a small business like ourselves to get the recognition.
He praised the work of his staff, adding: “They do really hard work and it is great to see it rewarded.”
Looking ahead, Mr Brown-fuller said he is looking forward to growing the business's outdoor catering arm and work more events in the open air.
The world of business can be tough for anyone, especially for those who are just starting out.
Brandon Relph from Go Creative in Eastbourne wowed judges for all he has achieved at such a young age, taking home the Young Achiever award.
Sam Worsey said it was ‘overwhelming' to win the Retailer of the Year award for her business, Southsea Bathing Hut in Portsmouth.
Beaming as she held her glass trophy she said: “We were thrilled to win Retailer of the Year on our home turf at the Portsmouth awards.
“We never would have imagined we would go into this huge event [JP South Business Awards] and win.
“It is amazing for our confidence, we are still a team of three.
“Things like this genuinely give us an extra rocket.”
One of the things the JP South Business Awards seeks to celebrate is companies making a difference in their local area.
This year Talks at Six, a Chichester forum which provides interesting talks on a range of subjects in aid of charity, took home the Outstanding Contribution to the Community award.
Marilyn Humphrey, the founder of Talks at Six, said: “It is a forum for local people. We have raised over £7,500 for in the last 15 months.
“Thank you to my son Freddie who has always been a support to me.”

Dear Mormon Neighbors,
Having lived in Gilbert for most of my life, we have been visited by many young, passionate, Mormon missionaries throughout the years. Recently they have been offering their help with anything we may need assistance with. These exchanges always include the typical pleasantries where I thank them for their generous offer, and add that, “no, we don't need help with anything at this time.” After their last visit however, as the young men pedaled away, I realized that I do have a request. A request that has been bubbling beneath the surface, unspoken for quite some time now. A desire that began formulating in my grade school years and has been refined since having children of my own. The next time a Mormon missionary asks if there's anything they can do for me, I'm going to humbly and vulnerably reply as follows:
Please teach your children to be inclusive of my non-mormon children and please guide them to carry that inclusion past grade school, into middle school, and throughout high school.
Please encourage your children to sit with mine in the lunchroom.
Please permit your kids to invite my kids to their slumber parties, birthday parties, and weekend get togethers even AFTER my child has made it clear that he or she is not interested in attending fireside, seminary, or church with your family.
my child has made it clear that he or she is not interested in attending fireside, seminary, or church with your family. Please allow your teen to go with mine to school dances, athletic events, and group dinners trusting that just like you, my husband and I have done the best we know how to raise a teenager who knows right from wrong.
Please welcome my children into your homes and permit your children to visit ours.
Please ask your kids to consider how isolating it must be on “Seminary (extra credit) Days” for those kids who do NOT come to school dressed for church.
come to school dressed for church. Please reflect on the fact that adolescents spend the majority of their waking hours comparing themselves to their peers, so when they recognize that it would never be “acceptable” to date your son or daughter or be your son or daughter's best friend, it is, at best, damaging to their delicate self-esteem.

Myanmar soldiers are using rape as a tool to terrorize and then push the Rohingya Muslim women out of the country for good, a new report found.
The horrific plight of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar appears to be particularly difficult (and deadly) to women and girls, a new Associated Press investigation shows.
Read More Photos Show The Plight Of Rohingya Muslims Fleeing Genocide In Myanmar
According to the special report, Myanmar's security forces are using rape as a weapon of war. The AP interviewed 29 women and found that the practice is used as a “calculated tool of terror” to exterminate the ethnic group.
According to one of the testimonials, a 13-year-old identified only by the letter R lost her father to a knife attack carried out by soldiers. Later, 10 soldiers came to her house, took her brothers and beat them, and then ripped her jewelry and took her clothes off. According to R, she was then brutally raped by the men, who took turns and even spit at her. She eventually passed out due to the pain and was later rushed to the Bangladesh border to see a doctor.
Another woman identified as M told the AP that she was home with her son, feeding him rice, when the military shot at her teenage brother. As her husband and children ran outside, M, who was eight months pregnant at the time, decided to stay at her brother's side.
After two days, her brother succumbed to his injuries. Shortly after, four soldiers stormed into her house.
She was dragged outside and stripped naked after being slapped and punched. The soldiers then beat her once again and threatened to kill her when she screamed. Eventually, one of the soldiers started raping her as others held her down. As a second soldier forced himself against her, she started kicking back, finally pushing them away.
M gave birth to her child that night in her house, but the baby girl was dead.
After her husband came back, they found out that soldiers had destroyed their land.
“They humiliated us, they destroyed our land and farm, they took our cows, they took our produce,” she told the AP. “How would I go back? They destroyed our livelihood.”
Like R and M, other women who talked to the AP shared stories involving military men who not only raped them in an effort to push them away, but who also either chased or killed their men, family members, and sometimes even their children.
Unfortunately, Myanmar officials continue to claim that the military has nothing to do with these incidents while the country's government also turns a blind eye to the abuse, the violence, and the deaths.
Despite pressure from the United Nations to bring about an end to the persecution of the Rohingya, it's unlikely that change will come anytime soon, prompting many to question whether Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, should have her Nobel Peace Prize taken away.

HINKLER residents will make up more than half of all Australians participating in the Cashless Debit Card trial if an amended Bill is passed by Parliament.
The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 was introduced to the House of Representatives yesterday morning.
The updated legislation expanded the original Cashless Debit Card welfare arrangements to a fourth trial site - the Hinkler electorate.
If passed, the Bill would deliver the controversial card to 6700 welfare recipients across Bundaberg and Hervey Bay.
The cashless card is already being trialled by 5700 people across Australia.
At least 800 people in South Australia are using the card after the trial was rolled out in the Ceduna region in 2016.
Hinkler MP Keith Pitt and Social Services Minister Dan Tehan discussing the Cashless Debit Card rollout for Bundaberg. Jim Alouat
A further 1300 West Australian participants in the East Kimberley region were added to the trial in April 2016.
The most recent region to start a progressive roll-out of the cashless card was the Goldfields region (WA) almost three months ago.
With 3600 people entering the trial, Goldfields is the largest participant so far.
However, should the amended Bill go through, 6700 of Hinkler's welfare recipients will be added to the trial, making up more than 54 per cent of the total participants.
Because of this influx, the amended legislation will also increase the maximum number of trial participants allowed from 10,000 to 15,000.
The Cashless Debit Card cannot be used to buy alcohol or gambling products and limits cash withdrawals to 20 per cent of a welfare payment. MICK TSIKAS
Minister for Social Services Dan Tehan said the Cashless Debit Card was "a world first in how it (operated)" and helped people manage their income and stabilise their lives".
"Doing nothing is not an option and I ... ask the Parliament to back this trial ... and help the people of Hinkler help themselves."
The Cashless Debit Card cannot be used to buy alcohol or gambling products and limits cash withdrawals to 20 per cent of a welfare payment.
If the Bill passes, recipients of Newstart, Youth Allowance (Jobseeker) and Parenting Payment living in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions will be subject to the trial.
Participants must be under 36 years old.
In a media statement last week, Mr Tehan confirmed the costs of delivering the cashless debit card trial were projected to be under $2000 per participant once the program was expanded to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions.
MP Keith Pitt said the cashless card would be good for Hinkler. LUKAS COCH
Member for Hinkler Keith Pitt yesterday told the NewsMail "this (was) a difficult, but necessary policy which could bring about positive changes in (the) community".
"Doing nothing is not an option and I call on the Labor Party to go back to its initial bi-partisan position and support this trial," he said.
"Welfare is for the necessities of life - rent, bills, food and clothing - not drugs, alcohol or gambling.
"80 per cent of a person's welfare payment is provided on a debit card which will work on any eftpos machine, except for the purchase of alcohol and gambling products.
"The remaining 20 per cent is available as cash."
Businesses do not need to register or sign up for the card.
Independent research into the cashless card has shown positive results at the other trial locations, where less drinking, gambling and drug use has been reported.
BUNDABERG police officers are being bullied at work according to the police union.
Claims of bullying and segregation within the Wide Bay and Burnett District policing unit were made public today.
Queensland Police Union of Employees general secretary Mick Barnes said police officers from Bundaberg and the Wide Bay Burnett District were involved in complaints against their management's practices.
"The officers here do a great job and unfortunately through some management practices, they are being segregated and prevented in going about doing their job,” Mr Barnes said.
"Even to the point of last year they were directed not to attend church services for National Police Remembrance Day.”
"Their (management's) argument is if officers are unarmed they shouldn't be out in the community.”
Mr Barnes said the bullying behaviours had been happening for a long time and recent amendments to the Industrial Relation Act had now allowed an investigation to commence in Bundaberg and the Wide Bay.
"We are up here today to speak to officers, to get affidavits and put together a matter for the Industrial Relations Commission,” Mr Barnes said.
He said the situation was a first in the union's history and an investigation of this nature had never been considered before.
"It's not industrial action but it is an investigation that we are taking with the view of putting the matter before the Industrial Relations Commission,” Mr Barnes said.
"We have raised these issues with senior management within the police service but that has been to no avail and that is exactly why we are here.”
Mr Barnes said as recently as this week police officers were being told not to attend certain events by management.
"These officers... have to take days off to attend community forums because the police service, through the management of the Wide Bay Burnett District Office, won't allow them to attend,” he said.
"Bundaberg has been a good area and what is under attack is the proactive nature of policing and creating those community partnerships.”
"The people at the centre of this are not only individual police officers but also the community of Bundaberg itself.”
The NewsMail contacted the Police Commissioner and Police Minister for comment.
A QPS media spokesperson said the Queensland Police Service was aware of an industrial relations matter between an officer and management.
"This matter is being looked into and, as such, it would be inappropriate to comment further due to privacy considerations,” the spokesperson said.
"The QPS has a zero-tolerance to bullying in the workplace and values the well-being of all staff.”

Drug company fights birth control lawsuit
JEFFERSON CITY (AP) — An attorney for chemical manufacturer Bayer is fighting a Missouri lawsuit over one of its birth control products, arguing the case does not belong in the state.
Bayer attorney Jonathan Cohn asked Missouri Supreme Court judges Tuesday to dismiss claims by non-Missouri residents or split them off from the case. Only seven Missouri residents are among the 92 women suing Bayer for alleged medical complications from Essure, an implant that permanently prevents pregnancy.
St. Louis Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty ruled in 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed in Missouri. Plaintiffs argue the case belongs in Missouri because of clinical trials in the state and a national marketing campaign based in Missouri.
Supreme Court judge Laura Denvir Stith seemed unconvinced and questioned what ties the out-of-state residents' complaints have to Missouri.

A Sutton Coldfield caretaker says “enough is enough” following a fifth school break-in in as many weeks.
Michael Milne and teachers at Blackwood Primary School in Streetly are becoming fed-up of a trespassing trio who are constantly breaking into the school and “smashing” an outdoor classroom.
Mr Milne, who has since released CCTV images of the vandal suspects, told the Sutton Coldfield Observer : “This Saturday's break-in was the fifth Saturday on the trot.
“They've smashed in a small summer house which is used as an outdoor classroom for the children. They've thrown all the tables and chairs around and I've had to empty it now.
“They're getting through via Blackwood Park, jumping over the fence and leaving what's left of their cannabis joints on the floor.
“They know exactly where the CCTV cameras are too and are clever with it by covering their faces up with either balaclavas or ski masks.

“Enough is enough and we're working with police to identify them though their clothes which are quite distinctive.”
The trio broke into Blackwood Primary School at around 4pm on Saturday, March 17.

The board of India's largest private sector lender ICICI Bank has ordered an independent probe into allegations of ‘conflict of interest' and ‘quid pro quo' in bank's MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar's dealing with certain borrowers.
There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis.
It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.
Last week, market regulator Sebi had served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower.
The enquiry was ordered by the board, at its meeting yesterday, on a complaint by an anonymous whistle-blower against Kochhar, the bank said in a regulatory filing today.
“…the enquiry to be headed by an independent and credible person (will) examine and enquire into an additional anonymous whistle-blower complaint…,” it said.
The scope of enquiry would be comprehensive and include all relevant matters arising out of and in course of examination of the facts and wherever warranted, use of forensics/email reviews and recordal of statements of relevant personal, it said.
The enquiry, the bank said, will be conducted by an ‘independent and credible' person.
The whistle-blower had alleged that the bank's MD and CEO had not adhered to provisions relating to code of conduct of the bank and legal and regulatory provisions relating to conflict of interest over a period of time and also alleged quid pro quo in the course of Kochhar's work in dealing with certain customers/borrowers of the bank.
Interestingly in April, the board had expressed full confidence in Kochhar and ruled out any quid pro quo as alleged with regard to certain loan given to Videocon group.
The regulator filing, which came today after close of stock market, further said the enquiry will cover all “connected matters” in the course of investigations to bring the matter to a final close.
In keeping with the whistle-blower policy of the bank, its board mandated the audit committee to appoint an independent and credible person to head the enquiry and also define the terms of reference, including timeline.
There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs 325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.
The investments from Ruias son-in-laws firm into NuPower started in December 2010. Incidentally, the same month ICICI Bank was lead banker in a consortium of Indian banks that extended a USD 530 million loan to Essar Steel Minnesota LLC on December 29, 2010. This loan was later classified as NPA.
The Reserve Bank in its 2016 investigation in the matter had raised questions over the ownership of the Mauritius-based entity, First Land Holding, which had invested Rs 325 crore in NuPower.
Also, there was no clarity over the alleged Rs 64-crore loan (unsecured fully convertible debentures) given to NuPower by Supreme Energy, which was 99.99 per cent owned by Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot at that time.
While Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved the loan to Videocon, there are allegations of conflict of interest in her husband's brother, Singapore-based Rajiv Kochhar, performing debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon.
The restructuring wasnt commissioned by the bank but by the borrowers.
Interestingly, the board of ICICI Bank expressed full faith in Chanda Kochhar, whose current tenure as CEO is set to end on March 31, 2019. It had reviewed credit approval processes and found them to be robust, according to a March 28 filing by the bank.

It was revealed earlier this week that a £1million-winning lottery ticket had been bought in Birmingham.
Despite that jaw-dropping revelation, however, sales of draw-based games - including Lotto and EuroMillions - tumbled 15%, or £619million, to an eight-year low of just over £4billion.
Camelot said total ticket sales fell to £6.9 billion for 2016/17 from a record £7.5 billion the previous year.
Total returns to good causes were lower than the previous year, mainly because of a "disappointing" performance across the National Lottery's range of draw-based games - especially on Lotto, where player confidence remained dented by three "very long and statistically unexpected" rollover series in quick succession at the beginning of last year.
EuroMillions also had a soft first six months in 2016/17 but its performance improved significantly over the second half.
Although the latest results reflected Camelot's fourth highest yearly sales, the company is facing increased competition from secondary lottery products such as Lottoland.
Camelot said it returned around 95p of every pound in revenue back to society, one of the highest percentages of any major lottery operator in the world.
The cost of playing EuroMillions increased by 50p to £2.50 a line and players had to choose from an extra number under changes introduced in September that decreased the odds of winning the jackpot but promised bigger prizes and double the number of UK millionaires.
Changes to the Lotto draw in 2015 saw the number of balls increase from 49 to 59 and the chance of winning the jackpot decrease from one in 14 million to one in 45 million.
The strategy review will focus on four key business areas: commercial plans to boost sales performance, investment in technology and systems, the current business structure, and long-term succession.
The company said an update will be given when Camelot announces its half-year sales.
Camelot chairman Jo Taylor said: "Achieving the fourth-highest ever sales, creating a record number of lottery millionaires and raising over £30 million every week for good causes, is no mean feat.
"However, sales in 2016/17 fell well short of where we'd like them to be - and that's largely down to a disappointing year for draw-based games and Lotto in particular.
"There's clearly work to be done to re-engage players and address the performance of our draw-based games - and this is one key area ... as part of the wider review.
"Given the current climate of economic uncertainty and increasing competition from the gambling sector, we expect 2017/18 to be equally, if not more, challenging for the National Lottery.
"It will therefore take time to turn things around and I anticipate a further sales decline this year.
"I am, however, confident that the review will enable us to put the business on the best possible footing to get back into growth - and so deliver even more for our players and the millions of people for whom National Lottery funding is so crucial over the remainder of this licence period."

Don't expect much to change in the Wells Fargo boardroom — at least not right away — even if shareholders vote for a clean sweep of the board at the annual meeting next week.
Wells investors are expected to send a stinging rebuke to the board when they gather for the company's annual meeting at a luxury beachside resort outside of Jacksonville, Fla., on April 25. It's the first board election since the phony-accounts scandal unfolded in September, and influential proxy advisers are recommending that shareholders vote against half to all of the 12 board members up for reelection; the company has 15 directors overall.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A Florida woman lit a cigarette, sparking an explosion of a propane barbeque grill being transported in her SUV.
Orlando police Lt. Cindy Lane tells news outlets that the grill was turned on and the propane tank was open in the back of the red Kia Sorento as she left a barbeque at the Central Florida Fairgrounds on Sunday afternoon.
Lane says the woman and her husband were burned and their sports utility vehicle was severely damaged. The couple's injuries are not considered to be life-threatening.

The human side of the data revolution
We the people are the source of most of the massive data accumulation now taking place.
For over a decade, data has been at or near the top of the enterprise agenda. A robust ecosystem has emerged around all aspects of data (collection, management, storage, exploitation and disposition). And yet in my discussions with Global 2000 executives, I find many are dissatisfied with their data investments and capabilities. This is not a technology problem. This is not a technique problem. This is a people problem.
Those enamored of data often want to eliminate the human from the equation, but it can't be done. And so, as climate science considers the impact of man on the environment, data science must wrestle with the inverse: the impact of data on man.
You can fill a library with books talking about the data revolution. There's Viktor Mayer-Schönberger's Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think; Steve Lohr's Data-ism: Inside the Big Data Revolution; Malcolm Frank, Paul Roehrig and Ben Pring's Code Halos; Bruce Schneier's Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World; Christian Rudder's Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One's Looking); Andreas Weigend's Data for the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work for You; and my very own The New Know: Innovation Powered by Analytics.
These are fine works of nonfiction focusing on the potential and perils of a rapidly informating world. “Informating” is a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff in her book In the Age of the Smart Machine (1988). It is the process that translates descriptions and measurements of activities, events and objects into data/information. “Datafication” is a synonym for “informating” — the trend associated with turning many aspects of modern life into machine-readable data and transforming this information into new forms of value.
What about the muggles?
The question that has not received much attention in technology circles is how and via what time frames the masses (a.k.a., the general public, regular humans, the muggles — those who are not trained, credentialed or particularly facile in data management and use) will respond to the accumulation of massive data. Sociologists and anthropologists need to weigh in here.
Some of the most interesting thinking about the impact of all this data is happening in literature. In Circles, David Eggers gives us a fictional portrayal of what a totally informated workplace might look like. It is not a pretty picture. I think this is a must-read for those who seek to understand the human side of the data revolution.
Some scholars contend we are in the middle of a personal-data gold rush (see “Personal Data: Thinking Inside the Box,” by H. Haddadi, et al.). It is not obvious that the beneficiary of this gold rush will be the source of the data gold — people. How many average Joes realize that if they are not paying for the service, they are the product? Data “accumulation is generally occurring with minimal consideration of us, the individuals at the heart of this process,” as Haddadi and his fellow researchers write.

Could you be making better use of your attic?
No matter how house proud you are, there are almost always a few parts of your home that aren't given quite as much love as others.
Apparently 15% of the average British home is unused, which could be £34,000 worth of wasted space, according to new research by TalkTalk. So instead of going through the hassle of moving house, here, interior designer and TV presenter Linda Barker shows how to make better use of those neglected spaces.
“We literally can't afford to waste space. We're moving house less than ever before and it's becoming increasingly important to make the most of what we have,” she says.
The research was commissioned to launch TalkTalk's new Wi-Fi hub.

Largest DDoS Attack Ever Reported: Here's What We Know
A massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on Wednesday, Feb. 28, left users unable to access the code repository GitHub for nearly 10 minutes. The 1.35 Tbps attack was the ever largest seen, according to the content delivery network services provider Akamai Technologies.
The attack on GitHub was delivered through a new method involving the memcached distributed memory caching system, which is designed to speed up performance of Web sites with dynamic, disk- or database-driven content. Attackers can flood such sites with huge volumes of traffic via memcached's use of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), a core Internet Protocol transport feature.
Just a day before GitHub was hit, Akamai had reported that DDoS attacks using UDP-based memcached traffic had the potential to reflect and amplify traffic loads of 190 Gbps and more. Akamai warned that "organizations need to be prepared for more multigigabit attacks using this protocol and should plan accordingly."
The largest previously reported DDoS attack was a 1.2 Tbps attack on the domain name provider Dyn in October 2016. That attack temporarily knocked multiple large sites, including Twitter and Spotify, offline.
Amplifying Traffic by 51,000x
Wednesday's attack on GitHub left the site unavailable for five minutes shortly after noon Eastern Time, and only intermittently available for another four minutes after that. However, the attack did not at any point affect the confidentiality or integrity of users' data, GitHub engineering manager Sam Kottler wrote in an update on the site yesterday.
Kottler said the attack worked by taking advantage of memcached instances that are "inadvertently accessible on the public Internet with UDP support enabled." By spoofing IP addresses, the attacker or attackers were able to direct memcached responses to GitHub, multiplying the volume of data sent in the process.
"The vulnerability via misconfiguration described in the post is somewhat unique amongst that class of attacks because the amplification factor is up to 51,000, meaning that for each byte sent by the attacker, up to 51KB is sent toward the target," Kottler said.
He added that over the past year GitHub had been taking steps to boost its transit capacity to better withstand DDoS attacks, and planned to continue doing so.
Be Cautious with UDP
"Making GitHub's edge infrastructure more resilient to current and future conditions of the Internet and less dependent upon human involvement requires better automated intervention," Kottler noted. "We're investigating the use of our monitoring infrastructure to automate enabling DDoS mitigation providers and will continue to measure our response times to incidents like this with a goal of reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR)."
What steps can other organizations take to prevent coming under a similar DDoS attack? The content delivery network provider Cloudflare said one key is to "stop using UDP."
"If you must, please don't enable it by default," said Cloudflare team member Marek Majkowski in a blog post. "We've been down this road so many times. DNS, NTP, Chargen, SSDP and now memcached. If you use UDP, you must always respond with strictly a smaller packet size then the request. Otherwise your protocol will be abused. Also remember that people do forget to set up a firewall. Be a nice citizen. Don't invent a UDP-based protocol that lacks authentication of any kind."

A special police task force has been launched to crackdown on so-called 'cuckoo' dealers who have been moving into Swadlincote to peddle drugs using violence and intimidation tactics.
Cuckoo dealers come from big cities like London and Birmingham and target drug dealers in smaller towns using threats and violence to force people to work for them.
Local dealers end up having to sell drugs for city dealers, many forced to work out of their own homes, hence the term 'cuckoo'.
It comes after a court case last week when George Lopes, 18, travelled to NewhallNewhall from London to 'take over' two addresses in Lanes End, Newhall, and Midland Road, Swadlincote.
He has now been sent to a young offenders' institution for three years after admitting possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Police say drug barons from big cities, including London, Birmingham and Nottingham, are targeting Swadlincote in an attempt to muscle in and take over the local market.
Officers have revealed that Newhall Park is being used as a dealing den as big city drug barons terrorise known local dealers and 'cuckoo' their homes to sell drugs from houses in Swadlincote.
In an attempt to stamp out the problem - which they also refer to as 'county lines', officers have set up a local task force within the town and warrants have already been issued across the district.
South Derbyshire MP Heather Wheeler is now encouraging her constituents to phone police with any information in a bid to deal with drugs issues in the town.
George Lopes was sent from London to run an operation selling crack cocaine and heroin in Swadlincote.
Derby Crown Court heard how the teenager first targeted a woman living in a flat in Lanes End, Newhall, where a police searched found him with wraps of almost 70 per cent pure crack cocaine in January.
He was released under investigation from that offence and went back to London but returned to Derbyshire in March where he ran from police officers carrying out a second raid at an address in Midland Road, Swadlincote. He was captured in a nearby park where more wraps of crack cocaine and heroin were found in his jacket.
It comes after Midland Road was also the scene of a brutal assault in which one man was attacked last week. Police have since urged social media users not to incite violence.
Derbyshire Police Chief Superintendent Jim Allen has also visited the town to update members of South Derbyshire District Council on the growing problem of drug gangs on their doorstep.
During the latest Newhall Area Forum, PCSO John Beard said drug warrants had been executed at addresses in Newhall in High Street; Parliament Street; Plummer Road; Meadow Lane; Lanes End, and Woodland Road, Stanton.
It was revealed at the forum earlier this year that two such 'cuckoo' operations had been shut down by police in the Newhall area.
PCSO Beard said: "There have been issues around Newhall that we are aware about and intelligence states that drugs are being used in Newhall Park and there have been incidents of drug deals there.
"We are looking for people to help us identify these people, any busy times, and any locations."
The PCSO added that drug warrants had been executed elsewhere in Newhall thanks to a special task force set up to tackle so-called 'county lines' drugs cases.
A variety of drugs were uncovered, including cocaine, heroin, cannabis and prescription drugs, he said.
Sergeant Graham Summers explained the worrying phenomenon of 'county lines', saying: "Dealers in cities, where there is so much competition, look for other ways of making money so they come to smaller towns such as Swadlincote and almost terrorise the local dealers to get them to deal drugs for them at their address so they can make a lot of money from local people.
"It is a phenomenon we are seeing over the last few years and we are putting in extra resources."
Sergeant Summers added that the new breed of drugs dealers would be people locals would not recognise. He urged the public to note down any registration plate numbers or make any CCTV available.
He added: "We have arrested numerous people from London, Birmingham, and Nottingham who are not from around here."
Councillor Paul Dunn, who represents Midway on South Derbyshire District Council, asked if vehicle recognition systems were being used to find these people.
Sergeant Summers said that while the system was used by police to track drug dealers down where they could, many vehicles used in crime often had bogus number plates.
He said: "So it takes us a little while to understand what car is doing what. The system can be handy but it is difficult in real time to know which vehicles they are in."
A day after the meeting, Chief Superintendent Jim Allen visited members of the district council at a meeting to further explain 'county lines' cases.
He said: "We have surveillance teams, informants and police in discreet settings working hard to dismantle these gangs.
"We are trying to make South Derbyshire a hostile environment for dealing drugs.
"You cannot get in and out of South Derbyshire without one of our cameras picking you up via number plates.
"The problem is probably not going to go away but we will continue to do our damndest to make sure South Derbyshire is not affected."
MP Heather Wheeler, said county lines was not just about drug dealing, but also included modern day slavery, human trafficking and sex exploitation.
She said: “County lines is a rapidly developing national issue involving not only the police, but also local councils and the NHS. The Government is serious about addressing this problem and has targeted it in its Serious Violence Strategy which was published in April 2018.
"However, it is important to recognise that county lines is not just about drug dealing. It includes modern day slavery, people trafficking, violence, sexual exploitation and missing persons. It can affect vulnerable adults as well as children and in some instances those as young as 12 have been exploited.
"Derbyshire Police are taking this issue very seriously as is clear from the special task force it has set up. Officers are working with many other agencies and organisations to tackle county lines because the issue cannot be contained to just one area.

"Communities in Swadlincote and Newhall can play their part too by reporting anything suspicious on 101 or in the case of a serious incident, calling 999 immediately.
"No detail is too insignificant and we can all play a part in trying to root out this poison which ruins the lives of so many.”

Fear not the country's most experienced politician and arguably the shrewdest operator Winston Peters is waiting in the wings, stepping up to the plate that he himself reckons could have been his more than quarter of a century ago if he'd played his cards right.
Ardern's giving herself six weeks maternity leave before returning to the Beehive's ninth floor and claims she'll be reading her usual load of papers while she's at home with the baby.

The first part's conceivable and second part's impossible, although the last and only other Prime Minister to give birth in office, Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto set the bar high.
Back in 1988 Pakistan's President announced his country's first election in almost a decade, knowing the then pregnant Bhutto would find campaigning tough, if not impossible.
Her campaign schedule was interrupted momentarily when her son, now a politician himself, was born four weeks early. Her win showed that voters were comfortable with a new mother running their country.
As Prime Minister she became pregnant again a couple of years later and refusing to tell her opponents of the birth date, fearing she'd be overthrown, she travelled incognito to a hospital, had a Caesarean section, and the next day was back on the job.
An old mate of mine Simon Walker, of Muldoon television interview fame, went to Oxford with Benazir Bhutto with both serving as former Presidents of the Oxford Union.
Walker described her as a lively, gregarious and an immensely popular person saying she was a real bridge between Islam and the West.
Unfortunately after living in exile for almost a decade Bhutto returned to Pakistan in 2007 to run for office again the following year, but within two months she was assassinated.
It's impossible to compare the volatile Pakistan with this country and to compare the two Prime Ministers is equally impossible.
But what the example of Bhutto shows is that against all the adversity she faced, anything is possible and the strength and determination of this woman was above and beyond what any of us would be capable of.
It puts into some perspective how much easier it is for a woman leader in 2018 to have a baby in office and that's not to diminish that history is being made for the second time.
The ringed planet Saturn, sitting in the nearby constellation of Virgo, will be one of the focal points of a free, public viewing Friday beginning at 8 p.m. at the Westmont Observatory.
The observatory opens its doors to the public every third Friday of the month in conjunction with the Santa Barbara Astronomical Unit, whose members bring their own telescopes to Westmont for the public to gaze through. The viewing lasts for several hours.
In case of inclement weather, please call the Telescope Viewing Hotline at 805.565.6272 or click here to check the Westmont website to see if the viewing has been canceled.
“Although the moon will be nearly full this evening, 12 days old, and placed in the constellation Libra, we should still get a good look at Saturn,” said Thomas Whittemore, Westmont physics instructor. “Saturn's large moon, Titan, will lie on one side of the planet and the moons Enceladus, Rhea and Dione on the other side of Saturn's rings. If the seeing is good, we should be able to see the Cassini Division, the beautiful, dark break between Saturn's A and B rings.”
— Scott Craig is the media relations manager for Westmont College.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A spokeswoman says Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland is being treated at a Washington hospital for pneumonia but is expected to recover quickly.
Spokeswoman Katie Grant said Wednesday in an emailed statement that the congressman was being treated with antibiotics and resting after being admitted to The George Washington University Hospital a day earlier.
Grant says the 79-year-old Hoyer was diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia.
She says Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, looks forward to being back at work "very soon."
Jury sides with Taylor Swift in groping lawsuit

DENVER -- Taylor Swift won $1 and long-awaited vindication after a jury decided that a radio host groped her during a pre-concert photo op four years ago.
After a weeklong trial over dueling lawsuits, jurors determined that fired Denver DJ David Mueller assaulted the pop star by grabbing her backside during a backstage meet-and-greet. The six-woman, two-man jury also found that Swift's mother and radio liaison were within their rights to contact Mueller's bosses.
Mueller sued the Swifts and their radio handler, Frank Bell, seeking up to $3 million for his ruined career.
Just before closing arguments, the judge dismissed Taylor Swift from Mueller's lawsuit, saying he had failed to prove that she sought to get Mueller fired or had any reason to believe that someone else may have assaulted her. U.S. District Judge William Martinez also drastically reduced the amount Mueller could collect.
The singer-songwriter said in her countersuit that she wanted a symbolic $1 and the chance to stand up for other women.
Testimony showed that Swift reported the incident to her mother and others on her team, but that she never sought any specific action regarding Mueller.
From the start, Swift's side portrayed the encounter as a clear case of sexual assault, even though they never reported it to police. Her mother tearfully testified that she asked Bell to reach out to Mueller's employers at country station KYGO-FM instead because they wanted to handle the matter quietly and avoid exposing the singer-songwriter to publicity.
Bell contacted a station vice president and asked for an investigation of Mueller's conduct. He also sent the station executive a photo taken of Swift, Mueller and Mueller's then-girlfriend at the meet-and-greet.
In a fiery hourlong stint on the witness stand last week, Swift blasted a low-key characterization by Mueller's attorney, Gabriel McFarland, of what happened. While Mueller testified he never grabbed Swift, she insisted she was groped.
"He stayed attached to my bare ass-cheek as I lurched away from him," Swift testified.
"It was a definite grab. A very long grab," she added.
Mueller emphatically denied reaching under the pop star's skirt or otherwise touching her inappropriately, insisting he touched only her ribs and may have brushed the outside of her skirt as they awkwardly posed for the picture.
That photo was virtually the evidence besides the testimony. In the image shown to jurors during opening statements but not publicly released, Mueller's hand is behind Swift, just below her waist. Both are smiling. Mueller's then-girlfriend is standing on the other side of Swift.
Swift testified that after she was groped, she numbly told Mueller and his girlfriend, "Thank you for coming," and moved on to photos with others waiting in line because she did not want to disappoint them.
But she said she immediately went to her photographer after the meet-and-greet ended and found the photo of her with Mueller, telling the photographer what happened.
Andrea Swift testified that she asked Bell to call Mueller's employers. They did not call the police to avoid further traumatizing her daughter, she said.
"We absolutely wanted to keep it private, but we didn't want him to get away with it," Andrea Swift testified.
Bell said he emailed the photo to Robert Call, KYGO's general manager, for use in Call's investigation of Mueller. He said he didn't ask that Mueller be fired but that "appropriate action be taken."

By Scott Strasser, February 14 2017 —
The Faculty of Social Work co-hosted a conference to raise awareness of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) from Feb. 5–9. The conference was held at Hotel Alma at the University of Calgary.
The faculty co-hosted the event alongside the Aboriginal Friendship Centre of Flin Flon, Manitoba and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The inaugural event aimed to educate members of Canada's Head Start Program sites of new developments in FASD research.
“This is the first ever national training event like this and we're really focused on a strengths-based perspective and positive outcome for children and families,” said U of C social work professor Dorothy Badry, whose research specializes in FASD.
FASD is a disability caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol. According to the Canada FASD Research Network, there are no confirmed statistics on the number of Canadians with FASD, but prenatal alcohol exposure is “considered the most common known cause of developmental disability in the western world.”
The disorder can result in physical development problems, as well as learning and behavioural difficulties later in life.
According to PHAC, the disorder is more common in indigenous communities than non-indigenous ones. A 1997 study of an indigenous reserve in Manitoba showed FASD was present in as many as 101 per 1,000 births in that community.
New Canadian diagnostic guidelines on FASD were developed at the College of New Caledonia in British Columbia and published in 2015.
The conference at the U of C was meant to bring more recent information on the disorder to indigenous communities across the country.
“It's about bringing the information across Canada to the Aboriginal Head Start programs so there can be information disseminated among each of the provinces,” conference facilitator Lisa Lothian said.
The Aboriginal Head Start program promotes education and childcare programs in indigenous communities across the country. There are 134 Head Start sites across Canada.
One of the conference attendees was Dolora Parisian, the executive director of the Aboriginal Family Service Centre in Regina. She said the information presented at the conference can have a ripple-effect.
“We all watch television and we all watch commercials and we know how much alcohol is promoted, especially aimed at the younger generations,” Parisian said. “We need to counter that message with the important facts that drinking can harm an unborn baby.”
Around 25 delegates from Head Start sites across Canada attended the conference.

Noisette Pastry Kitchen: Supporting local farmers
Noisette Pastry Kitchen in downtown Eugene is known for its tasty croissants and friendly staff. With desserts, coffee, sandwiches, soup and an evening wine bar, there is something delicious waiting for every customer — but what makes Noisette unique is where many of its ingredients come from.
Tobi Sovak, owner of Noisette, has sourced many of her bakery products locally since she opened her business in 2012. Having lived in many different places in the U.S. and Europe, Sovak has found that the raw ingredients here in the Willamette Valley are exceptional.
“We have really great access to high quality ingredients and to the people who grow them,” she said. An advantage to sourcing locally includes the ability to communicate with farmers to find out what products are available. Because Sovak has worked with them for so long, she understands which ingredients are best during each season and can change her menu accordingly.
Some of the ingredients she sources locally include grain, produce, dairy, lamb, wine and hazelnuts. Sovak named her pastry kitchen Noisette, the French word for hazelnut, because Oregon is known as the largest hazelnut supplier in the U.S.
Other products, such as cheese, chocolate, vanilla and almonds come from all over the world. “A lot of the products that you would use in a pastry shop have to be sourced from farther away,” Sovak said. “Even though we do source from a lot of local farms, there is so much product that we get from elsewhere.”
The disadvantages of using local ingredients are minimal in Sovak's opinion. “The only disadvantage would be if the season didn't go as well as we thought it would,” she said. Because she runs a small business, it's easy to purchase ingredients from larger sources when problems arise locally.
However, when sourcing locally, it's not uncommon to find inconsistencies in the products. Sovak said she would love to find products that are the same shape, size and flavor. She recognizes that's not always the way nature works though. “When products are at the height of their season we are aware of it and try to use them as frequently as possible,” she said.
Two things Sovak wishes customers knew more about include seasonality and local sourcing. “We try to do our best to educate our customers. Some people care a lot, some care a little and some could care less, but it's important to us.”
According to Sovak, having staff and customers who are educated on the seasonal aspects of food is important. Many customers don't understand that certain foods aren't always readily available. Seasonal changes affect which ingredients are best.
Occasionally, people call in the dead of winter asking for a berry tart. They typically will agree to do it, but then have to buy the ingredients from retail. “It's not something we prefer to do,” Sovak said. “Everything we serve is in season now, although we can get things that are in season somewhere else in the world.”
It took Sovak a couple of years to adjust to the seasonal differences when she moved from Los Angeles to Eugene, but being knowledgeable on which fruits and vegetables are in season has benefitted her business. One of Sovak's friends explained how the heavy rainfall in Oregon creates an abundance of gorgeous fruits in the summer. Those fruits are what help her maintain a locally sourced pastry kitchen.
Next time you visit a bakery or restaurant, consider asking where they locally source their ingredients.

PARIS (AP) — French authorities called for calm in France's western city of Nantes, where violent clashes between protesters and police broke out overnight after an officer shot dead a 22-year-old driver who was trying to avoid a police checkpoint.
Interior ministry Gerard Collomb strongly condemned the violence in a written statement Wednesday.
French authorities said prosecutors have opened a judicial investigation. Police also opened an internal probe looking at the officer's actions and his decision to use a firearm.
Protesters in Nantes clashed with police, throwing Molotov cocktails and burning cars and rubbish bins

Protesters also set fire to shops and buildings in three poor neighborhoods across the city.
The clashes ended early Wednesday morning.
Much has been made of the mosquito's love affair with the bromeliad. The arrival of Zika in 2016 in Miami-Dade County prompted mosquito control staff to examine more closely the breeding habits of container-inhabiting species of mosquitoes. Their findings pointed to the tank bromeliad as a common site where the disease-carrying mosquitos can breed.
But does that mean you should eliminate your decorative plants? We think not.
Bromeliads are native to the tropical Americas, the southeastern part of the United States, and one species is even native to Africa. They come in different colors and are simple to care for. Pineapples and Spanish moss are part of the bromeliad family. One of the unique characteristics of bromeliads is that their roots serve not as tools to absorb moisture and nutrients, but as anchors used to attach the plants to trees or rocks.
The tank bromeliad's leaf structure is such that they all combine at the base to form a rosette, which is a water-tight and circular formation. This structure allows for the natural accumulation of rainfall or water from artificial irrigation, which in turn helps hydrate the plant and capture the organic matter that is absorbed by the plant as nutritional intake. The water in the rosette also makes these plants very attractive to mosquitoes.
Females can easily detect the water found in these natural vases and they then proceed to lay their eggs near the surface. Within days, the eggs hatch and the larvae grow among the safe confines of the bromeliads' leaves. The young larva also feed on the gathered organic matter floating around. After a few days of feeding, they transform into pupae, and soon after, emerge as adults.
Although this would seem like reason enough to eradicate your bromeliads, the truth is that with some simple, preventative measures, the mosquito life cycle can easily be broken. Here's what you can do to preserve the beauty of this wonderful plant species while reducing mosquito breeding in your garden:
Treat the water with Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis). A common granular larvicide found locally at hardware stores, Bti is safe for use on plants, and around people and pets. Sprinkle a few granules in each tank every two weeks for maximum effectiveness.
Methoprene is a mosquito growth regulator that doesn't kill the larvae, but instead prevents them from reaching adulthood. This product is sold in a granular form under the name Altosid Pro-G and provides 30 days' worth of control.
In conclusion, there can be a fairytale ending to the romance between the mosquito and the bromeliad, but only one that favors the bromeliads and the green thumbs that care for them.

REINEH, Israel: Israeli archeologists on Thursday unveiled a 2,000-year-old workshop for making stone vessels similar to those Jesus is believed to have used to miraculously turn water into wine.
Located near the Galilee village of Reineh in northern Israel, the site is walking distance from Cana, the site of a wedding where the Gospel of John says Jesus performed the miracle, his first.
The workshop and an adjoining quarry were discovered by chance during the construction of an access road for a new sports center, excavation director Yonatan Adler said.
Since the discovery two months ago, Adler and his team have uncovered fragments of chalkstone mugs and bowls along with thousands of cylindrical chalk cores discarded in the process of hollowing out the vessels with a lathe.
They are typical of a period from the second half of the first century BC to the middle of the first century AD.
Jews of the period used stoneware for reasons of religious observance, Adler said.
“According to ancient Jewish ritual law, vessels made of pottery are easily made impure and must be broken. Stone, on the other hand, was thought to be a material which can never become ritually impure,” he said.
That practice was noted in John's New Testament account of the Cana wedding, which described larger vessels: “There were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews.”
“So far at this site we haven't found production of these large jars,” Adler said.
“But presumably the stone jars that would have been used at Cana would have been produced at a site like this, probably in the area.”
He said that prior to the Reineh excavation two similar sites had been excavated, both near Jerusalem.
“What's exciting here is that for the first time we have physical evidence of production of stone vessels here in Galilee,” he said.
“There has always been a question amongst scholars regarding the nature of Judaism in Galilee,” something particularly important when studying early Christianity, he said.
“The question is, who are these people that are living in Galilee?” AFP

AUGUSTA, Ga. (WJBF) – Students at Paine College now have a few more ways to release stress between classes. Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated donated several games to the local historically black college. Augusta Alumnae Chapter President Kim Gaines said the donation follows a $15,000 gift presented to the school a few weeks ago during the sorority's Georgia State Cluster. Gains said members throughout Georgia donated because the sorority was founded at an HBCU and now wants to help its local HBCU.
“We are women who have attended and graduated from college. But sometimes you need a stress releaser. We can't have academics all the time. This is a way for them to relax and kind of have fun, enjoy themselves and get ready for the next day,” Gaines said.
Paine College President Jerry Hardee received the donation, which was presented in the Student Center. He said the school is always looking for ways to create an environment where students enjoy being on campus, rather than leaving for the weekend and heading home. He added the $15,000 donation has not been earmarked yet.
But he added the Lions are making a lot of progress.
“Building four new classrooms and a theater. We will do some groundbreaking for the new dormitories next Friday, near the basketball courts,” he said.
NEW YORK (AP) " Kim Kardashian West takes her status as a role model seriously, and says part of that is owning up to her past mistakes and not letting online hatred distract her from her goals.
The reality show star spoke to The Associated Press Tuesday before taking the stage as one of the keynote speakers at the annual Forbes Women's Summit. Her wide-ranging conversations touched on how hurtful comments affect her, her still-growing brand, how the robbery in Paris has changed her life and husband Kanye West's photographic ability, or lack thereof.
Kardashian West told the AP she is aware of her detractors, but said she has a bigger message of positivity to share.
"I obviously have made my fair share of mistakes like everyone else, but I hope to never repeat those mistakes, and just learn from what I've done," she said. "So if people, or young girls, or kids can look up to just someone that works really hard, and focuses on really what I want, and makes that happen, then you know I hope that inspires them."

Earlier in the day, Kardashian West added to that brand as announced the launch of her beauty line KKW. Forbes just released its 2017 list ranking the world's highest-paid celebrities and Kardashian came in at number 47 with $45.5 million.
Kardashian West has a combined 180 million followers on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and has mastered each platform for maximum exposure for her overall brand, something she attributes to a simple rule.
"The most important thing is being authentic, and listening," she said.
With that many followers, Kardashian West said she knows there's going to be a certain level of negative comments, which of course bother her.
"Absolutely it affects me... there could be one or two negative comments that really do affect you, and get to you," she said. "You know I'm human just like everyone else. Like things do hurt my feelings, but I think that I do have a really thick skin."
She is more concerned that people, young and old, are victims of the same online bullying tactics.
"They have this keyboard courage that no one will see them and they will just write whatever and hurt your feelings," she said. "I know I can handle it, but I just fear for " I do see why young kids and people and teenagers, even get ... so hurt and bothered. That is what really bothers me."
In some instances, Kardashian West has turned the online hatred into fuel for her posts. She responded to backlash of her appearing on the cover of Forbes magazine last year with a self-deprecating tweet.
"We've built this brand, and I'm so proud of it," she said. "For everyone saying I have no talent, you know, I think I wrote, 'Not bad for a girl with no talent.'"
She credited her father, Robert Kardashian, with building bonds that allows her to draw strength from her family to deal with online negativity.
"We've always been a close family, but I think with everything that we go through, I think it brings us closer and closer," she said. "We're the only ones that really understand what it's like. You can report about it, you can talk about, but no one has really been through it, unless you are going through it with us. And luckily, we have each other. I don't know where most of us would be if we didn't have each other to vent to, to lean on, so I think we've been really blessed with a big family that all have the same core values."
"Keeping Up With the Kardashians" has exposed the private side of family struggles into the public forum, including her former brother-in-law Lamar Odom's addiction struggles, her brother Rob's issues with weight and depression, and sister Kourtney's tenuous relationship with Scott Disick. Then there's family tension after revelations in Caitlyn Jenner's book, where Kim came to her mother Kris Jenner's defense.
No struggle has shaken Kardashian West more than last year's Paris robbery where she was held at gunpoint. Thieves got away with more than $10 million dollars in jewelry after learning of her moves on social media. She admits that experience changed her life. Now she doesn't post pictures until she's returned from the event.
She hasn't necessarily transferred her social media acumen to her husband, rapper Kanye West.
She joked with Forbes Media CEO Steve Forbes during his onstage interview that she tried to enlist West to help take photos of their recent trip to Japan to share online.
"It was such a mess," she said. "He was just not the best photographer."

To err is human, to forgive divine.
As a coda to this: to err massively and hilariously is also human, as anyone who writes about sport can confirm. It is a common experience to find oneself wincing a little at the way things turn out in the real world, even when the way things turn out is also a source of pure sporting pleasure.
All of which is a prelude to a mea culpa. Yes: I was a Salah doubter. Or at least a nonplussed observer. My Guardian pre-season Premier League preview from last August contained the following dismissive summary of Jürgen Klopp's transfer business: “Liverpool have bought a good left-back and spent an awful lot of money on Mohamed Salah.” Let's just read that back. An awful. Lot of. Money. Mo Salah for £35m. Lol. Laughing weeping face emoji. Do I get paid for this stuff?
But then this is the joy and, indeed, the whole point of watching and playing sport. Whatever you say about it, it's not predictable. That's what it's not. It thumbs its nose, rips up your preconceptions.
In mitigation those tossed-off thoughts were written just before the four biggest transfers of all time took place, kicked off by the financial inanity of Neymar's move to Paris Saint-Germain. Shortly afterwards Barcelona paid three times Salah's fee for Ousmane Dembélé. By the end of the summer £35m was looking, if not small potatoes, then smaller potatoes. Right now it looks like one of the outstanding bargains of the last 10 years.
But then, even those who knew Salah's game in intimate detail, who spoke excitedly of his deeds in Serie A, will surely be a bit surprised at the sheer extent of his instant, exhilarating success under Klopp, a thing to be studied and marvelled at on its own terms.
With seven games to go Salah is the player of the season. He has 28 league goals, four more than Harry Kane and seven more than Sergio Agüero, capped by those four against Watford at the weekend. He also has nine assists, surpassed only by Leroy Sané and David Silva. Only Eden Hazard, Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend have made more successful dribbles. Only Kane has had more shots.
A nice touch too; despite playing in a bruising, full-throttle team Salah has yet to be shown any kind of card this season. There is a truism that good footballers need to have something nasty about them. Salah is merciless in many ways. But he kills you with a smile.
The numbers are, of course, just a part of it. It was not a goal or a man-of-the-match performance that revealed the full dawning Salah-ness of Salah to this observer. It was instead the 0-0 draw with Manchester United at Anfield in October, a game dominated by José Mourinho's defensive organisation.
Even here Salah just stood out, the only player on the pitch able to turn and surge away through the defensive lines. He made eight dribbles in 73 minutes, more than United's entire midfield and attack put together. More than this, he seemed a relentlessly optimistic player, football as reinterpreted by a gerbil superhero. Legs whirring, head up, chest out.
Physical creativity
Fast forward to Watford at the weekend and Salah has begun to make parts of the game look like a mismatch, the way only the very best can. The hat-trick goal at Anfield will remain one of the images of the season, those three Watford defenders squished together in front of Salah, tottering on their heels as this miracle of balance and speed springs to his left then springs back, leaving the yellow shirts collapsing helplessly like a row of derelict tenement houses. Even the finish is a lovely detail, the ball swished past Oscar Karnezis with an impudent playground shuffle.
At which point two questions occur. How has this happened? And how long can it go on?
The first of these is a legitimate question. In just seven months Salah has scored 36 goals for Liverpool, more than for any other club he has ever played for. It is the nature of it too, those moments of out-there physical creativity, the basic joy in his football that bears passing comparison, even after a single season, to the conjoined Henry-Ronaldo-Suárez-Bergkamp-Agüero attacking godhead of the Premier League years.
With this in mind it has been easy to look at Salah's time under Mourinho at Chelsea and see a genuine howler, a huge beaming, bouncy Egyptian stick with which to beat the master of toxic defence.
In Mourinho's defence he did at least see enough to sign Salah in the first place. He was 21. Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar were ahead of him. He never got a proper run, playing 19 games, starting 10 of them. For those who saw Salah in the flesh at Stamford Bridge the memory lingers of trapped energy, of an eager figure haring off down the right wing while his manager lurked and barked and burped on the touchline, never quite at ease with this scuttling force of attacking will.
It seems what Salah needed was to be driven on, to be given the stage. At Roma Luciano Spalletti famously held up Salah's contribution in one game as an example of perfect team play. Salah has said Spalletti would often sit with him after training teaching him how to defend, discussing the moral responsibilities of running and working for the team.
If Salah needed the paternal arm from Spalletti, he has clearly found another perfect fit in the speed-metal football of Klopp's exhilarating front three. It will be fascinating from here to see how he goes about sustaining that pitch of performance.
And this is the next challenge, as even the better teams begin to make detailed plans for a player who must now demand this level of attention. Can Salah continue to produce his extraordinary, uplifting fantasy football? Only a fool – as they have in the past – would bet against him.

LOS ANGELES: Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather and mixed martial arts icon Conor McGregor confirmed plans for a long-awaited showdown on Wednesday, triggering both criticism and anticipation for what is set to be one of the richest fights in history.
Mayweather and McGregor — kingpins of their sports — will climb into a boxing ring to face each other at Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena on August 26.
The 40-year-old Mayweather will be aiming to reach the 50-0 milestone while McGregor is a heavy underdog in the 12-round boxing match. A victory for the Irishman would be a monumental upset.
“Floyd is the greatest of all time and Conor is the master of our sport,” MMA promoter Dana White said. “I thought it would be an impossible deal to do, but it was the right fight at the right time and we got it done.”
Leonard Ellerbe, chief executive of Mayweather Promotions, said the boxer's team decided to end his 23-month retirement because the clamor for the 154-pound showdown had been impossible to ignore.
“There is not one place I go to with Floyd where he doesn't get asked the question, ‘Floyd are you going to fight Conor McGregor?' All Floyd thinks about is fighting Conor McGregor and whipping his ass,” Ellerbe said.
Mayweather announced the fight on his Instagram account with a graphic saying “IT'S OFFICIAL!!!” showing pictures of both fighters and listing Las Vegas as the location while McGregor sent out an earlier tweet stating “THE FIGHT IS ON.”
“Floyd said ‘154 is no problem, I don't want a catchweight,'” Ellerbe said.
McGregor is the top pay-per-view draw in UFC while Mayweather had been the money-spinner in some of boxing's biggest bouts, including matchups with Filipino legend Manny Pacquiao and US star Oscar De La Hoya. Mayweather earned $250 million for his fight against Pacquiao.
“There is a different feel from the Pacquiao fight, Ellerbe said. “It is the unknown factor (of fighting a MMA star).”
Neither Mayweather nor McGregor have competed this year. Mayweather retired from pro boxing in 2015 after defeating Andre Berto, while McGregor (21-3) defeated Eddie Alvarez in November 2016.
White said the key to finalizing the fight was luring Mayweather out of retirement.
“Everybody is happy with this deal,” he said. “Nobody is bummed out.”
The boxing format heavily favors the undefeated Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs), whom many consider to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.
McGregor, 28, will be entering unknown territory as he has not stepped into a boxing ring since he was a teenager.
Inexperienced
Despite having little or no boxing experience, White insists his MMA client McGregor is confident of victory. McGregor is UFC's only simultaneous two-division champion.
Ellerbe said Mayweather can't afford to take McGregor lightly.
“I have seen Floyd buzzed in a fight. Things happen in these kinds of fights,” he said. “Floyd is 40 and he has to prepare. We would be a bunch of damn fools to sit around and sleep on this.”
Although there will be no titles on the line, the fight will provide an opportunity for both to cash in financially.
The event is expected to be a pay-for-view blockbuster, and organizers are hoping it can challenge the 4.6 million pay-per-view buys for Mayweather-Pacquiao.
Stephen Espinoza, executive vice-president of Showtime Sports, said fans will buy the pay-per-view for the fight because of the novelty.
“The sky is the limit,” Espinoza said. “There is nothing to compare it against. No one has seen this type of competition in the ring.”
Not everyone will be excited to see a Mayweather-McGregor exhibition match, however, especially considering that McGregor is a 25-1 underdog.
Boxing champion-turned-promoter De La Hoya had already dismissed the planned fight as an embarrassment for boxing. News of the fight on Wednesday also triggered waves of scorn across social media, with many branding the bout a “freak show.”
Espinoza was unmoved by the criticism, however.
“This is not a referendum on the sport of boxing,” he said.
White said McGregor would be training for the fight in his homeland with Irish boxers. Promoters are hoping the trash-talking McGregor can sell tickets.
In his last fight, McGregor won the lightweight title from Alvarez in November 2015 in UFC's first Madison Square Garden card.
McGregor received a California boxing license last year, but is still waiting for his Nevada application to be approved. AFP

Police are talking to the person believed to be the driver of the truck which hit Terenzo Bozzone while he was riding his bike in Auckland yesterday.
Source: 1 NEWS
Police confirmed the news to 1 NEWS this evening and say the person is "assisting us with our inquiries in relation to this incident".
A spokesperson from Auckland District Health Board has confirmed that triathlete Terenzo Bozzone remains in a stable condition after he was seriously injured in a collision with a truck while cycling yesterday.
Bozzone was cycling in Kumeu, Auckland yesterday afternoon when the accident occurred at approximately 2:20pm.
The 33-year-old won his first Ironman New Zealand title in Taupo on March 3 after breaking the previous record time by over seven minutes with a time of seven hours, 59 minutes and 56 seconds.
Sinn Féin remains convinced of the need for a presidential election, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald saying she is mulling over a list of names before a party meeting later this month.
Many TDs and senators in Leinster House are still considering whether to back a candidate, with Independent minister Finian McGrath insisting that President Michael D Higgins should not secure a second seven-year term unchallenged.
Amid mounting demands for the President to clarify his intention about a second term, a spokesman for Mr Higgins last night reiterated he “will make his intentions known in due course”.
Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have all but ruled out backing an alternative candidate. Sinn Féin is the only major party considering whether to present a challenge if Mr Higgins decides to run.
Ms McDonald said a Sinn Féin ard comhairle meeting on July 14 will consider a list of possible candidates. “We are currently working our way through our options.”
She confirmed Sinn Féin is not ruling out supporting a candidate that the party does not nominate.
This could include an independent candidate, such as senator Gerard Craughwell, if they were to secure a nomination.
Gerard Craughwell
A potential candidate requires the support of 20 Oireachtas members or four local authorities.
Ms McDonald said she has “utmost respect” for Mr Higgins but believes the person who occupies “the highest office in the land ought to have an election sanction and mandate behind them”.
“I don't think it's appropriate that the incumbent simply rolls into another term of office seamlessly.
“I think the election provides the platform for a very healthy debate about Ireland, about where we are now and where we might go over the next seven years, not least because we are facing Brexit, not least because we are facing demographic changes in the North, not least because the issue of women in society now looms large in a way that is new and I believe very healthy because issues around rights for other citizens, I'm thinking of the LGBT-plus community but also Travellers, other sections of society that need to be heard loud and clear.”
She said a “presidential election, rather than a general election, allows that kind of broad-based conversation for Irish people to participate in”.
Meanwhile, Disabilities Minister Mr McGrath, at the Independent Alliance weekly meeting, asserted he wanted a presidential contest.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A woman who was found dead Wednesday in a stairwell of a power plant at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital had dementia and vanished from a nearby mental health facility 10 days ago, her daughter said.
A staff member found the body at about 1 p.m. The county medical examiner's office identified the woman as Ruby Andersen, 75.
An autopsy was pending.
"I don't know how she died," her daughter, Charlene Roberts, told KRON-TV . "Did she have a stroke or fell? I don't know what happened."

Roberts, who gave her mother's age as 76, said the woman had dementia and two hearing aids and went missing on May 20 from a mental health facility.
"We almost hired a private investigator" to look for her, Roberts said.
Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said the woman was not a patient at San Francisco General but noted that there were other facilities on the same campus operated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. They include the 47-bed Mental Health Rehabilitation Center.
Andersen was found in a stairwell that usually is locked and only accessible to maintenance workers, Kagan said.
"We are very concerned how this could have happened," she said.
Police, public health and sheriff's investigators were working on the case.
Five years ago, the body of a missing patient was found in a stairwell at the same hospital, more than two weeks after a patient disappeared from her room.
An autopsy determined that 57-year-old Lynne Spalding had been dead for several days before her body was found in a stairwell that was supposed to be routinely checked by security.
The Sheriff's Department, which is responsible for the hospital's security, paid Spalding's family $3 million to settle a legal claim.
Sussex Sharks would have travelled to sunny south London today in great heart after a moral boosting home win last Friday.
Indeed the NatWest T20 Blast table looked rosy with the team sitting in third place.
Unfortunately for the 2nd time in four days we had to leave the capitol with zero points. Unlike the game at Lords, where we lost in a photo, Surrey CCC were in no mood to give an inch.
Thanks to an Aaron Finch unbeaten ton they won at a canter.
Having won the toss Surrey built an inn of craft and entertainment in equal measures.
Jason Roy (50) and Finch completed the perfect power play scoring sixes at will. At 101 for 1 off 11 they were in the driving seat and wowing a big home support.
Beer and Jordan both bowled very well for the visitors only giving up 42 runs between them. But Surrey just kept finding more and in the 18th over Finch smashed 4 consecutive maximum's off David Weise.
The last of which came our way and was caught on the fly by a home supporter who apparently won £1000 in the bargain. They finished on 193 and as Shark you could only stand and applaud.
In response Chris Nash completed his 2nd half century in London but in truth none of the other visitors got involved. Perhaps the most positive aspect for the Hove team was that Archer and Jordan hit late runs which just might prove invaluable come late on Friday evening.
I would like to thank my wife Jan and best mate John for accompanying me to the Oval. Despite the result we had a nice afternoon in the sunny weather and in truth we witnessed on the best knocks of the current T20 competition.
We head back to our gorgeous 1st Central County Ground, Hove on Friday evening for the last of 14 group games against Essex. The South Group is so tight that Pythagoras himself wouldn't be able to work out all the permutations. Lets just say to qualify for the Quarter finals Sharks need to win and then prey to the gods. Six other teams are in much the same situation.
Rolls-Royce is preparing to relocate the "signing off" of British-made airliner engines to Europe, as the EU aviation authority will hold the right to certify they are safe to fly in the event of a hard Brexit.
The iconic British brand - and leading member of the country's £31.8 billion ($44.6) -a-year aerospace sector - is preparing the contingency plan to protect itself from huge disruption if negotiations stall over Britain leaving the EU, according to the Daily Telegraph.
Without such an arrangement, sources inside the company say that design, manufacturing and maintenance of Rolls-Royce engines built at its Derby base could grind to a halt if Britain suffers a "cliff-edge" departure from the EU.
The UK was a founder member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and Rolls-Royce's engines and designs are certified under its authority on a daily basis as the company modifies its designs.

But if Britain leaves the EU without agreeing a deal that includes associate membership of EASA, Rolls-Royce's products will not be able to be signed off in the UK and will, therefore, be unable to take to the air.
"It's a theoretical but real risk that either a deal or EASA membership will not happen," said a senior Rolls-Royce source. "We would have to stop making engines until it was sorted out without a plan in place."
The concerns ramp up the pressure on ministers to achieve a Brexit deal to ensure continuity for Britain's aerospace sector, the largest in Europe and second only to the US.
Theresa May's Mansion House speech last month identified as "critical" the UK remaining part of EASA. The Prime Minister said she accepted this meant "abiding by [its] rules and making an appropriate financial contribution".
However, industry sources say guidance from Government is that negotiations about a transitional deal ahead of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 are likely to "go to the wire", meaning companies such as Rolls-Royce have been forced to protect themselves from costly disruption.
ADS, the trade association which represents the aerospace sector, highlighted the importance of a deal to protect the industry.
"From the moment of the referendum we have made absolutely clear we need to remain part of EASA," said Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS. "We are reasonably optimistic - it seems to be one area on the EU on which everyone agrees."
A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said the company was in "regular dialogue with ministers to ensure there is no interruption in our service to customers as a result of Brexit".
He added that plans to transfer design approval for airliner engines were a "precautionary" measure and a final decision had not been made on such a move. The company said it "did not anticipate" jobs being transferred to Europe.
How a job candidate's experience affects your brand
New research reveals that how candidates are treated in the job search process directly impacts how they view your company as consumers.
The internet is forever. Memes, Tweets, blog posts, PR wins and gaffes -- once published, these things won't ever go away. Nowhere is this fact more important than on employer review sites, where candidates and employees turn to share their thoughts, feelings and personal experiences interacting with a company, says Dan Schawbel, research director at Future Workplace.
The research, "The Future of Recruiting," from Future Workplace and HR and social media recruiting technology solutions company CareerArc, surveyed 1,054 total respondents, including 616 employers and 438 job seekers, and showed that 61 percent of job seekers visit a company's online properties first before applying; a 17 percent increase from 2015.
In addition, job seekers increasingly trust reviews from other candidates and current employees to give them the lay of the land before applying. One in three job seekers has shared at least one negative review of a previous or prospective employer, and 55 percent of job seekers who have read a negative review have decided against applying for a position at that company, according to the survey. The survey also found that those employees and job seekers who do leave online negative reviews are 66 percent more likely to spread those opinions on social media, compared to those who only share their opinions directly with a friend or colleague.
And job seekers give more weight to the opinions of their fellow candidates and employees than a company's official stance. The survey showed that job seekers rank current employees as the most trusted source for information about a company, followed by online reviews from job applicants and former employees, respectively. The CEO or other company executives were ranked the least trusted source by job seekers.
Candidates are consumers
While it's important to offer a stellar candidate experience to potential employees, the research also revealed that the impression people get from interacting with your company as a candidate translates directly into their impression of your brand and how they interact with you as a consumer, as well.
"We found that if you give people a bad experience through the application, interview and screening process, they're less inclined to apply to your company for the rest of their lives. Now, we've discovered that the impact goes far beyond that; not only are they not likely to ever work for you, they are impacting your entire brand, your products, your bottom line as they share their sub-par experiences. And because the internet is forever, because it's now a company's 'permanent record,' that's impacting the perception of hundreds, thousands, possibly millions of potential candidates and customers," says Schawbel.

NEW YORK (AP) — Tina Turner is not done telling her story.
The rock superstar is working on a sequel to her 1986 memoir "I, Tina," Atria Books told The Associated Press on Monday. The new book is called "Tina Turner: My Love Story" and will come out next October, timed to the singer's 60th year in music.
Seventy-eight year-old Turner says in a statement that she will write about everything from "finding love" to surviving a "life-threatening illness" she had never disclosed before.
Turner, who endured a horrifying marriage to musician Ike Turner, married Erwin Bach in 2013. She is known for such hits as "Proud Mary" and "What's Love Got To Do With It," the title of a 1993 biopic starring Angela Bassett as Tina Turner and Laurence Fishburne as Ike.
One of 14 new Garden Villages will be built in East Northamptonshire.
The Government has today announced funding for the projects, which will see between 1,500 and 10,000 homes built on sites across the country.
Deenethorpe in East Northants will be the site of one of the Garden Villages, which will between them receive £6m in Government funding over the next two years.
Plans to develop the former airfield at Deenethorpe are nothing new – proposals were being looked as as long ago as 2012.
But this new funding means work is more likely to finally get under way.
A Government spokesman said: “The money will be used to unlock the full capacity of sites, providing funding for additional resources and expertise to accelerate development and avoid delays.”
Housing and Planning Minister Gavin Barwell said: “Locally-led Garden Towns and Villages have enormous potential to deliver the homes that communities need.
“New communities not only deliver homes, they also bring new jobs and facilities and a big boost to local economies.
“These places combined could provide almost 200,000 homes.”
The Garden Villages will be distinct new places with their own community facilities, rather than extensions to existing urban areas.
As well as Deenethorpe, the Garden Villages will be built in:
Long Marston in Stratford-on-Avon;
Oxfordshire Cotswold in West Oxfordshire;
Culm in Mid Devon;
Welborne near Fareham in Hampshire;
West Carclaze in Cornwall;
Dunton Hills near Brentwood, Essex;
Spitalgate Heath in South Kesteven District, Lincolnshire;
Hallsmead in Knowsley, Merseyside;
Longcross in Runnymede and Surrey Heath;
Bailrigg in Lancaster;
Infinity Garden Village in South Derbyshire and Derby City area;
St Cuthberts near Carlisle City, Cumbria; and
North Cheshire in Cheshire East.
Three new Garden Towns have also been announced, in Aylesbury, Taunton and Harlow.
An alleged ranking leader of the New People's Army (NPA) was arrested in Butuan City Friday, the military said in a report on Saturday.
Leonida Guao, the NPA's alleged finance officer in Mindanao, was arrested for the crime of murder in Barangay (village) Bading. The warrant was issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch-7 in Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur.
The NPA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.
Arresting police and military officers confiscated one pistol, 45 magazines, six rounds of live ammunition, one pistol holder, five blasting caps, and detonating cord.
Lt. General Benjamin R. Madrigal Jr., commander of the Eastern Mindanao Command, said the arrest of Guao proves that terrorists “cannot run away from the long arm of the law.”
“The arrest gave justice to the victims of their atrocities, particularly those indigenous peoples they brutally killed, the common people who have been victimized by their extortion and terroristic activities, and those who have lost their livelihood brought about by their arson and sabotage activities,” he said in a statement.
Guao was placed is the custody of the CARAGA regional police district for further legal processing.
She is the second communist leader arrested since President Rodrigo Duterte canceled the peace talks between the government and the rebel groups.
On January 31, National Democratic Front (NDF) consultant Rafael Baylosis and his comrade Guillermo Roque were arrested in Quezon City for illegal possession of firearms and explosives.
The Philippine National Police (PNP) Criminal Investigation and Detection Group will file a case of disobedience to lawful order against the two after they refused to have their mug shots and fingerprints taken.
They are being held in the PNP Custodial Center since no bail was recommended for their temporary liberty.
Duterte scrapped the peace negotiations with the communist group last year after the NPA launched a series of attacks on government targets. The decision to halt the talks came after the NPA ambushed members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) in North Cotabato in July 2017.
Cycle
Anakpawis party-list Rep. Ariel Casilao on Saturday warned that the arrest of consultants of the National Democratic Front (NDF) may become a “vicious cycle.”
Casilao warned that the NPA may retaliate and abduct government peace negotiators.
“If this will continue, ‘yung mga arrest ng mga so-called temporarily released on bail na mga NDF consultants, ‘pag nagpatuloy ito, aabot sa puntong, for example, ‘yung NPA din mag-declare din sila na ‘sige, aarestuhin din namin ‘yung mga GRP negotiators and consultants.' And this will be a vicious cycle all over again. Mauulit at mauulit ‘to (if this will continue, the arrest of so-called temporarily-released-on-bail NDF consultants, if this will continue, it will reach a point, for example, where the NPA would also decide to arrest GRP negotiators and consultants.' And this will be a vicious cycle to be repeated over again,) he said at a news forum in Quezon City.
The CPP-NPA has been waging a decades-long armed struggle against the government.
Casilao said the rebellion problem will not be resolved through military means.
“This will not be solved by the sheer might of the Armed Forces. Because the problem of insurgency[is]rooted in poverty. We have long been saying address the problem of poverty,” Casilao said.
Several lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives have condemned the arrest of Baylosis, a consultant of the NDF in the scuttled peace talks between the government and communist rebels.

RAMALLAH, Palestinian Territories: Hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli jails launched a hunger strike on Monday following a call from leader and prominent prisoner Marwan Barghouti, a Palestinian Authority official said.
Issa Qaraqe, head of prisoners affairs for the Palestinian Authority, said that “around 1,300 Palestinian prisoners” were participating in the hunger strike and the number could rise.
The Palestinian Prisoners Club NGO put the number at 1,500.
Israeli prison service spokesman Assaf Librati said that 700 prisoners had announced on Sunday their intention to begin a hunger strike.
“We are checking this morning to see the number of prisoners actually striking as some of them said they would only observe a symbolic protest strike and then resume eating afterwards,” he said.
“There will be an update later.”
Barghouti is serving a life sentence over his role in the violent second Palestinian intifada. He is a popular figure, with polls suggesting he could win the Palestinian presidency.
The strike was called in connection with Palestinian Prisoners Day, which is observed annually.
Some 6,500 Palestinians are currently detained by Israel.

The family of a young boy killed at a popular rotating restaurant in Atlanta have released a picture of the 5-year-old.
Charlie Holt suffered a severe head injury on Friday when he got stuck between the moving table and the wall at the Sun Dial restaurant on the 72nd floor of the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel.
Charlie was visiting with his family from Charlotte, North Carolina, when they stopped to have lunch at the venue, which offers spectacular views from the top floor.
The Sun Dial spins slowly to offer 360-degree views of the city's skyline and surrounding countryside and it appears the youngster became lodged between a fixed wall and a table that was moving.
A family spokesperson said: "The family asks for prayers and privacy right now to come to terms with this tragedy.
"No words can express their loss. If you have a loved one, please give them an extra hug today."
The family were the last customers in the restaurant when the boy wandered away from his parents to have a look at the views for himself, WSBTV reported.
Charlie Holt was said to be visiting with his family from Charlotte, North Carolina, and they stopped to have lunch at the Sun Dial Restaurant on the 72nd floor of the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel
The hotel's security staff and employees scrambled to pull the boy out after realising he was stuck in the narrow 12cm between the wall and table.

"His whole body was caught in between maybe 4 or 5 inches of space and his head took the brunt of the injury," police said to, WXIA. "It crushed his little small body."
"The amount of people who were helping was amazing," a spokesman for the hotel said. "They were moving furniture, they were pulling chairs - chairs that were bolted to the floor - they were pulling them up to try to get the child out."
They were eventually able to free him, but unfortunately it was too late.
Although the moving floor immediately stopped, Charlie suffered severe head trauma.
He was taken to Grady Hospital about 3.30pm, and was later pronounced dead.
'There was a tragic accident at the hotel involving a young boy,' Westin Peachtree Plaza manager George Reed said.
"Words cannot express the depths of our sorrow. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."
The Sun Dial is now closed until further notice, and an investigation is being conducted by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.
Charlie's death comes just a year after a kitchen employee at the same hotel died after getting accidentally locked in a freezer overnight.
Carolyn Robinson, 61, had worked at the Westin hotel for more than 35 years.
Less than a month after that, 10-year-old Stephen Akinlabi died at the hotel's pool after he fell in at a birthday party.

LONDON: Twelve people were injured when a corrosive substance was thrown inside a packed London nightclub on Monday, police and fire services said, amid a sharp rise in acid attacks in the British capital.
A London Fire Brigade spokesman told AFP an “unknown corrosive substance” was thrown in Mangle, a club in east London, in the early hours of Monday.
It was identified as “an acidic substance” from testing, he said, adding that there were around 600 people in the venue at the time of the incident.
“Twelve people showing signs and symptoms attributed to corrosive substances were treated on scene by ambulance and brigade personnel prior to removal to hospital,” he added.
The police said in a statement that all the injuries were “non-life threatening” and the incident was not believed to be terrorism-related.
Police were called to the scene at around 0010 GMT “after members of the public complained of a noxious substance,” the statement said.
The streets around the club have been closed to traffic as the investigation continues and no arrests have been made.
London has seen a sharp rise in acid attacks in London in recent years.
There were more than 1,800 reports of attacks involving corrosive fluids in London since 2010, according to police data cited by the BBC last month.
In 2016, corrosive fluids were used in 454 crimes, compared to 261 in 2015.
Some experts have suggested that criminal gangs may be switching from carrying knives to acid because it could lower the risk of prosecution.
In an acid attack in north London earlier this month, a 40-year-old father, 36-year-old mother and their three-year-old son were hurt.
The woman and child were later discharged from hospital but the man suffered “life-changing injuries”, police said.

Birmingham City are reportedly considering a move for Wes Hoolahan this summer.
The Irishman will become a free agent at the end of the season when his contract at Norwich City runs out. When that happens, it'll end his ten-year association with the Canaries, for whom he has made 350 appearances.
The nimble attacking midfielder, who has more than 40 caps for the Republic of Ireland, has scored more than 50 times for the Norfolk side and will leave a legend.
It's believed that, despite offers, Hoolahan has no intention of returning to play in the League of Ireland just yet as he feels he is fit and good enough to continue in the upper reaches of English football - even at 35.
Hoolahan, who scored a wonderful goal for his nation as they drew with Sweden 1-1 at Euro 2016, is in the thoughts of Garry Monk this summer, reports the Irish Sun .
The veteran said recently: “It's been a great ten years. I've thoroughly enjoyed myself at this club and it's going to be an emotional day on Saturday against Leeds.
“My ten years have been brilliant, with a lot of ups and downs.
“It will be strange to leave this club after ten great years but you have to move on. The fans have been amazing to me, the club have been great and I'm going to miss the place."
Monk has almost confirmed safety and another Championship campaign in his short time at Blues - another result in one or both of their final matches against QPR and Fulham will solidify their status - and will begin preparations for the summer transfer window in the near future.
The boss will look to make his mark on the squad he inherited, built from a mixture of buys from Harry Redknapp, Gary Rowett and Lee Clark.
Selling nicely
Birmingham City are heading towards a sell-out for the final match of the season against Fulham.
With two matches to play, Blues are five points ahead of 22nd placed Barnsley - who have a game in hand - and three ahead of 21st side Bolton Wanderers.
Though Garry Monk would dare suggest it, the win over Sheffield United has at least served to offer Blues some much-needed breathing space between themselves and the dreaded relegation places.
So much so, that the victory over the Blades saw their own odds with the bookmakers to drop into League One rocket over the weekend to 14/1.
Monk will rightly have his players focused on the trip to QPR this weekend, and then the welcoming of the high flying Cottagers who haven't lost a league match since September.
It has the makings of a day in which Bluenoses will be turning out in their numbers, too - and hopefully one that is nowhere near as dramatic as the final days of 2014 and 2017!
Blues welcome Slavisa Jokanovic's men on Sunday, May 6, a side who remain hopeful of pipping Cardiff City to the second automatic promotion place.
There could be a capacity crowd, too, with the Tilton Road End already sold out and ticket sales in other parts of the crowd moving along nicely.
Blues' ticketing manager Aamir Javaid tweeted: “The feeling when you find out that the Tilton is now fully sold out for the Fulham game!
“How long before the Kop sells out? Great support Bluenoses!
“Can we sell it out for @GarryMonk and the boys in Royal Blue? #KRO #GreatFans #BCFC
“Kop blocks limited. Block 38 open. Block 39 open. Block 40 open.
“Tickets are selling fast Bluenoses so book now to avoid missing out! Fantastic support from our fans #KRO #BCFC #LOYAL”

TAMPA (CBSMiami/SportsDirect) – The Florida Gators are looking to cap off an up-and-down season with a bowl victory on Monday.
Florida's defense has struggled and will try to redeem itself after two disappointing performances when the Gators take on Iowa in the Outback Bowl at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.
Florida allowed 14 or fewer points in eight of its first 10 games to earn a spot in the SEC Championship game before giving up 85 combined against rival Florida State and Alabama in the last two.
Gators defensive coordinator Geoff Collins was hired as the new coach at Temple last week and former Miami (Fla.) coach Randy Shannon will run the defense against Iowa.
Iowa recently won the Joe Moore Award, given to the nation's most outstanding offensive line, and the Hawkeyes sealed it with impressive performances in consecutive victories over Michigan, Illinois and Nebraska to end the regular season.
Senior LeShun Daniels Jr. (1,013 yards, 10 touchdowns) and junior Akrum Wadley (966, 10) could become the first pair of Iowa running backs to go over 1,000 in the same season.
Iowa rushed for a total of 526 yards in the wins over Illinois and Nebraska after grinding out the upset win against Michigan with 98 on the ground.
This is the third time the programs meet in the Outback Bowl as Iowa took the 2004 contest 37-17 before the Gators fought back to win 31-24 in 2006.
Florida lost two of its last three bowl games after the 41-7 setback against Michigan in the 2015 Citrus Bowl and is 21-21 all-time.
The Hawkeyes play their fourth straight January bowl game and dropped four in a row overall after last season's 45-16 defeat against Stanford in the Rose Bowl – falling to .500 all time at 14-14-1.
TV: 1 p.m. ET, ABC. LINE: Florida -3
ABOUT FLORIDA (8-4, 6-2 SEC): The Gators gave up 483 yards on the ground over the last two games to push their season average to 142.2 – 36th in the nation – and are still sixth overall in total defense (298.6) despite two rough outings.
Sophomore running back Jordan Scarlett (795 yards, six touchdowns on the ground) prospered with more carries in the middle of the season – totaling three 100-yard efforts in five games before being limited to 70 combined in the last two.
Senior transfer Austin Appleby took over at quarterback when Luke Del Rio was injured, completing 61.6 percent of his passes in the last four games, and sophomore Antonio Callaway is his most dangerous target (47 catches, 666 yards, three touchdowns).
ABOUT IOWA (8-4, 6-3 Big Ten): The Hawkeyes lost their top receiver (Matt VandeBerg) to a season-ending injury early on and coach Kirk Ferentz had to do a lot of mixing and matching on the offensive line.
Senior quarterback C.J. Beathard (17 touchdown passes, seven interceptions) threw for only 290 yards combined the last three weeks as the running attack took over with Daniels totaled 317 yards on the ground against Illinois and Nebraska while combining with Wadley for 20 rushing TDs overall.
The defense stepped up after a 41-14 loss at Penn State, allowing 23 total points in the last three games, and linebacker Josey Jewell (fourth team) along with defensive back Desmond King (second) were named All-Americans.

WHAT if we've been wrong about Mr Cruel all along?
The man who terrorised Victorians in the 1980s with a series of violent, disturbing attacks - often on children - has never been caught. Australians have always assumed he was a local who went underground or died when the attacks stopped in 1991.
But there's another theory that amateur crime buffs think holds weight and that police on the other side of the world were forced to investigate.
Police in Victoria and San Francisco compared notes on the notorious Golden State Killer, who shared a remarkable connection that made some wonder whether he and Mr Cruel were the same person, The Australian reported.
Before Mr Cruel attacked four girls under the age of 13 in Melbourne's outer suburbs between 1987 and 1991, culminating in the unsolved murder of Karmein Chan, the Golden State Killer was doing exactly the same thing on America's west coast.
He murdered 12 people and raped 45 women in a series of depraved attacks during the 1970s and early 1980s. He left blood everywhere but covered his tracks and was never caught.
Then suddenly, in 1986, the attacks stopped and the killer disappeared. A year later, Mr Cruel arrived on the scene in Melbourne.
Sketches of the Golden State Killer, courtesy of Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.
Mr Cruel terrorised Victoria during the 1980s.
The two lived by the same criminal code. The Australian reports that they both took breaks to eat meals, were both armed with a knife and a gun, both pretended to have conversations with people who weren't there and both used expert knots to tie up their victims - and in Mr Cruel's case - to tie up parents while he attacked their children.
The links between the two killers didn't end there.
Both wore dark-coloured balaclavas and had long hair protruding from underneath - and because of that the police sketches are almost identical. Both crept into homes holding large knives and waited to be found. Both would be aged between 60-75 years old if still alive and both were pathologically meticulous.
Both also came under the microscope of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, despite the crimes occurring on different sides of the planet.
In 1991, following the disappearance of Karmein Chan, the FBI sent a letter to Victoria Police. It detailed steps they should take to catch Mr Cruel, what his interests were, how his relationships likely played out and why he attacked where and when he did.
The FBI noted that "the offender has an intense interest in children … will have his own homemade pornography [and] would typically live in a single-family residence, one with a garage or carport". The letter, dated April 24, 1991, stated that if the killer were in a relationship, "the partner would be aware of sexual dysfunctions".
A letter to the late Karmein Chan from her younger sister, Karen.
It wasn't the last time Mr Cruel's file would land on the desk of law enforcement in the United States.
In 2016, following a renewed appeal for information into the unsolved murders committed by the so-called Golden State Killer, retired Los Angeles Sheriff's Department detective David Gates reached out.
He suggested the GSK closely resembled a man wanted for burglaries in the mid-1980s who police later discovered had moved to Australia. When contacted by The Australian, Mr Gates said "the fair-haired college kid" he had investigated was "just a nasty piece of work".
On the other side of the world, Victoria Police were also watching the serial killer in California, but ruled out any suggestion the two were the same person.
The Golden State Killer's story resurfaced recently thanks to a documentary entitled Unmasking a Killer. The five-part documentary series claims to "take viewers inside the investigation, the case files and the mind of the Golden State Killer - a man believed to be the most prolific uncaught rapist and serial killer in the nation".
The project, 10 years in the making, includes interviews with investigators and those who survived.
The Golden State Killer first struck in 1978 with the double murder of Brian and Katie Maggiore in Sacramento. A year later he broke into the home of Robert Offerman and his girlfriend Debra Manning, tied them both up and shot them.
Over the next six years he would kill three more couples and two single women. A number of the murders were in Goleta and Irvine, suggesting the killer returned to neighbourhoods he was familiar with.
The FBI suggested Mr Cruel did exactly the same thing. In their letter to Victorian Police, they said they believed the offender "may reside in the vicinity of the first assault".
"This is further strengthened by the fact that the offender has returned to that same general area in the fourth assault," the bureau said.
The fourth assault they referred to followed the abduction and assaults of three young girls. One is described only as "an 11-year-old girl" and the other two were Nicola Lynas and Sharon Wills.
On the fourth occasion, Mr Cruel took Karmein Chan, 13, from her home while she was babysitting her two sisters, aged 9 and 7. The teen was confronted with the masked intruder during an ad break while the three girls were watching a movie in Karmein's bedroom.
Mr Cruel grabbed the two younger girls and forced them into a cupboard before abducting Karmein.
Her body was found nearly a year later at a landfill site in Edgars Creek, not far from the Chan family home.

A racist manspreader assaulted a woman on the subway because she asked him to give her a bit more room to sit down, police said Saturday.
The 34-year-old victim was seated inside a northbound E train on Tuesday at around 5: 10 pm when the man sat down, partially on top of her, police said.
When she asked him to move for a moment so she could readjust herself, he shouted: “Just because you're African American, you think you can go on your Kanye West rant, you black b***h,” according to cops, who have released an image of the suspect.
Later, as the woman was preparing to exit the train, she bumped his bag, prompting him to spit on the back of her head, said police.
The matter escalated even further when both passengers left at the 7th Avenue stop in Manhattan. When she grabbed the man's backpack to confront him, he punched her in the shoulder and spit in her face again, and then fled back onto the train, police said.
Police describe the man as white-Hispanic, in his 30s, and approximately 5-foot-9 and 150 pounds.

A couple who alleged they were subject to an ongoing campaign of Garda harassment and intimidation has settled a High Court action against the Garda Commissioner.
Stephen Costello (47) and his wife, Karen, from Woodstown Gardens, Woodstown, Knocklyon, Co Dublin had sued the Commissioner for damages for alleged trespass, intimidation and harassment.
In 2005 they obtained an injunction restraining any garda entering their home unless they had a warrant or were acting at the request of a member of the household.
The Commissioner, represented by Paul O'Higgins and Patrick McCann SC, denied the claims.
The case which was due to last for between four to six weeks was scheduled to commence today but was adjourned over an issue concerning medical reports.
Following talks between the parties. Alan Toal Bl told Mr Justice Denis McDonald the case was settled and could be struck out.
The Judge welcomed the settlement, which is confidential.
At the opening of the case, Mr Toal said the gardaí mistakenly believe Mr Costello had been “involved in the drugs trade,” which counsel said his client was”most certainly not”.
No drugs had ever been found on his client when searched by the Gardai, counsel added.
In a pretrial motion heard by the High Court in 2014, Mr Costello claimed gardaí began their alleged campaign of harassment against him in the 1990s. He claimed the alleged harassment caused himself and his wife considerable distress and affected his health, his ability to work and their family life.
He said he was first arrested in 1996 and questioned about stolen guns.
Mr Costello said after he got married, gardaí were constantly in the vicinity of his then home and often drove into the driveway of his house with the lights of the squad car flashing before driving off.
The alleged harassment he claimed continued after he and his wife moved to their current home in 2003.
He installed CCTV cameras around his property and obtained a High Court injunction against the Gardai.
Despite the injunction, he claimed he was subjected to further incidents of harassment from members of the Gardai.
He also claimed he was stopped, searched and strip-searched on other occasions.
The claims of harassment were all denied.

Rise in need for faster recovery, reduced pain and discomfort has led to growth of global robotic surgery market in the past few years. Owing to rising adoption of minimally invasive surgeries, the market for global robotic surgery grew at a healthy CAGR of ~% during 2012-2017 from USD ~ million in 2012 to ~ million in 2017. During the concerned period, market grew predominantly due to increase in sales of da Vinci systems across the world and surgical procedures performed by them. The number of installed da Vinci systems grew from ~ in 2012 to ~ in 2017 and the number of surgical procedures conducted inclined from 359,000 in 2011 to 753,000 in 2016.
The market growth was also aided due to the commercial launch of several new systems in the US and/or Europe and other territories. Some of the surgical robots approved and commercially launched included MAKO, OMNIBotics, ARTAS, ROSA, NAVIO, TSoultion One, Neuromate,
Mazor X and Renaissance for a variety of indication such as spine and brain surgeries, total/partial knee and total hip arthroplasty and hair transplant. Over ~ spine and brain surgeries and more than ~ total/partial knee and total hip replacement procedures were performed using surgical robots in 2017.
International expansion has been slow over the past decade due to the fact that the majority of these companies are US based. Most companies have been focused on gaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and subsequently market the product aggressively before launching the systems elsewhere in the world. The process of individually gaining approval in various countries has slowed the growth of the entire surgical robotics industry. Additionally, all robotics companies face the challenge of convincing hospitals to purchase systems that are usually priced in excess of USD 1 million.
Which Segments are doing Well in Global Robotic Surgery Market?
North America accounted for the highest market share (~ %) in 2017, in terms of revenue. This was primarily due to high standards of healthcare infrastructure, high patient awareness levels and high healthcare expenditure by consumer and government as compared to other regions of the world.
Over ~ % of the North American revenue was due to high adoption of robotic surgery systems in the US. The US market for surgical robotics has been driven by the financial capability of hospitals to invest in these systems, strategic collaboration with insurance players, rising patient acceptance owing to superior post-operative outcomes, and general awareness about computer-assisted surgeries.
Of the 3,919 da Vinci systems installed worldwide, 2,563 of them were installed in the US alone. Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World (ROW) comprised for ~ %, ~ % and ~ % market share as of 2017, respectively.
Snapshot on Us Robotic Surgery Market
The US accounted for more than ~% of the overall robotic surgery market in 2017, in terms of revenue. Hence, the US robotic surgery market stood at over USD ~ billion in 2017. High healthcare standards, financial capability of hospitals to invest in these systems, strategic collaboration with insurance players, rising patient acceptance owing to superior post-operative outcomes, and general awareness about computer-assisted surgeries have led to high adoption of robot-assisted surgeries in the US.
The US is at the forefront of medical research and is more often the first country to adopt new, innovative surgical robots for a variety of indications. Although robot-assisted surgeries are expensive, insurers pay no more for surgeries that utilize robotic systems than for other types of minimally-invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy. Higher treatment cost with surgical robots has resulted in slower adoption of robotic surgeries amongst the citizens of the US.
Major Companies:
A vast majority of the companies developing and marketing surgical robots are based out of the US. This includes the market leader Intuitive Surgical, which generated about ~% of its entire annual revenues from the US itself in 2016. Several other major players in this sector such as Accuray, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet, OMNIlife Science, Think Surgical, Restoration Robotics, Medrobotics, TransEnterix and Auris Surgical are based in the US. Even those companies which are not based out of the US, sale of robotic systems in the US contributed for a fair portion of their overall annual revenues.
In terms of product development, US based medical device companies clearly dominated over others in developing surgical robots indicated for radio surgery, hair transplant and soft tissue surgeries involved in urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic and general surgical procedures.
Market Potential:
At present, the US is currently experiencing a severe shortage of general surgeons. The number of total active physicians in all specialties rose less than 2% annually to 860,939 in 2015 from 799,501 in 2010, according to the AAMC's (Association of American Medical Colleges) 2016 Physician Specialty Data Report. The US will face a shortage of between 61,700 and 94,700 doctors by 2025, according to AAMC.
As of 2016, only ~% of the ~ million applicable soft tissue surgeries were performed using robotic surgical technology.
Da Vinci system for soft tissue surgeries were installed in about ~ US hospitals, with potential to be installed in over ~ more hospitals and ~ ambulatory surgical centers.
The number of total hip replacement procedures in the US was approximately ~ each year, and is expected to increase threefold by 2030.
The demand for total-knee replacements is expected to increase more than six fold by 2030 from current ~ each year.
Within five years, ~ of all surgeries in the US, more than double the current levels, are expected to be performed with robotic systems.

Former RTÉ sports broadcaster Fred Cogley has died aged 82.
Best known for his commentary of rugby over 49 seasons, he also covered 11 Olympic Games and 12 World Cups.
Cogley began his broadcasting career as a 16-year-old with Raidio Éireann in 1950. Between 1973 and 1997, Cogley presented RTÉ's flagship television sports programme Sports Stadium.
RTÉ head of sport Ryle Nugent paid tribute to his late colleague on Twitter: “Fred Cogley RIP. Was so generous with his time and encouragement. Gentleman to his toes. Sound track to a generation of TV rugby.”
Cogley described his times as a pionnering broadcaster and head of sports in RTÉ in a 2012 memoir Voices from My Past.
In an interview with The Irish Times in 2013, he recalled how RTÉ “was very poorly served in terms of technical facilities” in the 1970s, limiting its ability to cover GAA in particular.
“There was one outside broadcast unit which was state of the art for its time. But the problem was that it was so state of the art that RTÉ only used it on special occasions. Sport was too run-of-the-mill.”
He noted: “Action replay didn't happen in those days. It was one of the great developments of the early '80s. The only way we could do it was by getting two machines in the video editing suite – one to record and one to play out. So we had six guys to hold the tape coming off the recording machine and stand around the room so that we would lengthen the time between the recording and the play-out.
“The director in studio and the commentators had to be very careful to give a pause where there would be a changeover from one tape to another tape if we were showing a replay. If someone took their eye off the game, the whole thing went to pot.”
Cogley's father was Mitchel Cogley, a sports journalist in the Irish Independent, and his son Niall Cogley followed him into broadcasting, becoming director of broadcasting at TV3. One of Cogley's grandchildren is psychology student Clodagh Cogley, who survived the Berkeley balcony tragedy.

MORE TO COME
SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) — Former Macedonian prime minister Nikola Gruevski has resigned as leader of the conservative opposition VMRO-DPMNE party following its recent defeat in local government elections.
Gruevski served as prime minister for a decade before failing to form a coalition government after general elections last year. He was eventually succeeded by Social Democrat leader and bitter rival Zoran Zaev following months of political crisis. The 47-year-old Gruevski is facing charges of corruption and abuse of power in number of legal cases that emerged following a major wiretapping scandal.
Zaev's government has renewed the country's drive to join NATO and improve troubled relations with neighbor Greece.
Gruevski submitted his resignation late Sunday and the decision was formally announced Monday, two weeks ahead of a party congress.
Israel Dagg is excited to face off against former Crusaders teammate Kieron Fonotia tomorrow night when the All Blacks face off against Samoa - especially since he didn't even know the clash was possible.
The pair were teammates at the Crusaders for four seasons until Fonotia decided to part ways with the club at the end of last season to play for Welsh club Ospreys.
The move appears to have helped Fonotia, who will get his international debut tomorrow night against New Zealand after being selected to start in the midfield for Samoa - a selection Dagg wasn't even aware was possible.
"Kieron, he's a good mate of mine,' Dagg said.
"But I didn't even know he was Samoan!"
FebFest offers music, film, food and fun
For the third year, the Freeport FebFest of Arts & Culture will celebrate the vibrancy and depth of arts and culture in Freeport. This year the spotlight shines on painting, theater, music, film, food, and more all around town.
Many arts and cultural organizations, artists, artisans and craftspeople call Freeport home. There's a lot going on in Freeport's arts sector, even in the dead of winter. The public is invited to come check out some of the artistic delights available.
There are lectures at LL Bean, author talks and programs for kids at Freeport Library. On Tuesday, Feb. 21, there will be an Infant and Toddlers Story Time from 10-10:30 a.m., and a time for preschoolers from 10:30-11 a.m. at the Freeport Community Library.

Mother of Purl: part of the maker movement
Co-owners of the Mother of Purl Yarn Shop, Patty Bright and Susan Pennoyer, have announced the listing of exciting and new knitting and fiber arts classes. Mother of Purl is a community resource where people of all ages can come together to “make” and be a part of the “Maker” revolution, creating their own unique and creative items. Their goal is to maintain a place where fiber enthusiasts can feel at home and find lots of ideas and inspiration.
Additionally, the owners, staff and customers are celebrating a recent relocation from the original space to a nearby retail location just “doors” away at 541 U.S. Route 1 in Freeport, next door to Maine Beer Company and across the way from Cuddledown and Buck's BBQ. The new location has a more open feel that highlights the vibrant colors, textures and fibers. It also houses a large space on the second floor to be used as a classroom for fiber arts workshops and instruction. Pennoyer will have space for dyeing yarns, which is done exclusively for Mother of Purl, and the creation all kinds of fiber arts patterns.
Mother of Purl classes are taught for all levels – beginners to more advanced knitters and fiber arts creators. Instruction includes resist felting and NUNO felting, which is a process of creating fabric from wool fiber, learn-to-knit basics, mittens, cables, shawls, cowls, beginning lace, a Valentine's project, and a very popular Girls' Night Out Knitting Series. Bright and Pennoyer, along with their staff of eight, strive to offer a variety of classes and be available to help in the journey of creation by giving support and encouragement. A special new class is Yoga for Knitters with certified yoga instructor Elizabeth Bird, who specializes in injury prevention and recovery. Participants will learn different strategies for over-use injury prevention and recovery, and focus on postures that will help relieve tired arms, shoulders and hands.
Both of the owners have been involved in knitting and fiber projects from an early age. Pennoyer was sewing by the age of 7 because she felt her dolls needed clothing. Bright's mother taught her to knit when she was 6 or 7 years old, also started with clothes for her doll, and quickly advanced to scarves and afghans, then on to sweaters. Their many years of experience knitting and designing project patterns has made great partnership that is felt by their customers.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says rebooting the Mideast peace process is a very high priority for the Trump administration, although peace may not come in the form of a two-state solution.
A senior White House official says President Donald Trump is eager to begin facilitating a peace deal and hoping to bring the Israelis and Palestinians together sometime soon.
Trump is meeting Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The official says that peace is the goal, regardless of whether it comes in the form of a two-state solution. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to preview the meeting.
Other topics of discussion expected to come up Wednesday include expanded Israeli settlements, Iran and a potential move of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

A US preacher is causing controversy after asking his followers to help fund his fourth private jet.
Jesse Duplantis, a televangelist, said he was initially hesitant about the $77 million price tag said but Jesus "wouldn't be riding a donkey", the BBC reports.
Mr Duplantis said God had told him: "I didn't ask you to pay for it. I asked you to believe for it."
Twitter users responded with disbelief, with many quoting Bible verses warning against greed, "false prophets" and suggesting the large sum of money would be put to better use by helping the poor.
In a video posted to his website, the 68-year-old attempted to justify the request, saying: "You know, I've owned three different jets in my life, and I've used them and just burning them up for the Lord Jesus Christ."

A Muslim doctor living in Dublin has spoken of the insults and harassment she suffers for wearing a hijab following the release of a report warning that hate crime remains under-reported in Ireland.
The “Lifecycle of Hate Crime” report from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, released on Wednesday, found that hate crime was “not part of the language of the Irish criminal justice process” and the State had a responsibility to “send a clear message to society that hate crime is not tolerated”.
Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan described the findings of the report as “not acceptable” and said its recommendations would be “urgently” examined by his department.
Amna*, a doctor from South Asia who has been living in Ireland for nearly three years, said racial hatred was “spreading like wildfire” and “requires immediate attention”.
Verbal harassment
Writing a post on Reddit, Amna described how on Saturday night, while travelling from Dublin city centre to Kilmainham on a Dublin Bus, she was verbally harassed by a female passenger for wearing a hijab. She wrote that a middle aged woman who was “heavily intoxicated” repeatedly asked where she came from, before calling her a “refugee” and asking “why are in you in this country”? She said the woman continued swearing at her, even when she took out her phone and began filming the incident. Eventually, she said, a male passenger offered to swap seats so Amna could move away from the woman.
In Ireland, Amna said she finds that women who wear a head scarf are either considered to be refugees or “someone who deserves an insult in the name of religion”.
When she first arrived in Dublin and was searching for an apartment she said some landlords told her she should “live with her own community”, while one landlord refused to let her enter the house because he said she might have a gun in her handbag. More recently she said that upon completing an examination, the adjudicator approached her and said she should return home to work as a doctor rather than remaining in Ireland.
“Why should I face this professional and social discrimination time and time again? Is it because I have opted to adhere to my religious beliefs which teach me to spread love, treat all with respect, do no harm, hear no evil, not to judge others, to be selfless, to be honest, to be non-judgmental towards all?
“Disrespecting others, just for the sake of your personal satisfaction, isn't acceptable behaviour in any culture or religion. Condescending behaviour, insulting others publicly just because people feel they have the given right to do so is totally unacceptable.”
Scared
According to Amna, many Muslim women in this country feel too scared to contact the Garda or report racial abuse. “I think we've become desensitised to it,” she told The Irish Times. “People make comments as we walk by so often that we've been told to brush it off. But we need to stop brushing it off. We can't accept it.”
Amna said she often turns to the advice of American TV star Ellen DeGeneres for guidance when faced with discrimination and racial abuse. “When I start to lose faith in kindness due to inappropriate behaviour, I pray and I binge watch her to put my mind at ease. For me it's a constant reminder, as she rightly says, to ‘please be kind to one another'.”

THE HIGH COURT has continued an injunction against the owners of several Dublin properties which was obtained after tenants were forcibly removed from one of their premises.
On Wednesday, Ken Fennell secured a temporary injunction against Paul Howard and Una McClean preventing them from interfering with the properties including several apartments in Mountjoy Square in central Dublin, and properties at Harold's Cross, and Kilnamanagh, Dublin 24.
The order prevents the defendants, their agents and all persons with knowledge of the injunction from trespassing, damaging, and collecting rent from the tenants living in the properties.
The injunction also requires the defendants to hand over possession of all the properties to the receiver, and the prevents them from interfering with the receivership.
Fennell, represented in court by Stephen Byrne Bl, instructed by Sean Neville of Byrne Wallace solicitors, was appointed receiver over the properties last month by financial fund Promontoria (Oyster) DAC.
He sought the injunction over concerns for the safety and welfare of those renting the accommodation, particularly following reports last weekend that tenants were forcibly removed from one of the apartments at Mountjoy Square.
He was also concerned about ongoing interference and deliberate attempts by the defendants to thwart the receivership, and over the conditions of some of the premises.
High Court decisions
When the matter returned before the High Court, Justice Caroline Costello agreed to continue the orders and adjourned the matter to 13 February.
Solicitor Maurice Lyons said he had taken instructions from the defendants, but due to a conflict of interest was unable to formally represent them.
Another lawyer would have to represent the defendants, who were not present in court.
Lyons said defendants were giving undertakings to agree to abide by the injunctions and would also hand over any rent that may have been collected following the making of the order to the receiver.
Following an application by Byrne the judge also granted the receiver permission to bring a motion for attachment and committal against the defendants.
Counsel said that hopefully there would be no need to advance that particular application, given the undertakings given by the defendants.
Counsel said Fennell had sought the application after he obtained information Howard had attempted to collect rent on yesterday, the day after he injunction had been granted.
Counsel said Howard had sent text messages to tenants concerning the payment of rent, while two agents of Howard had attended at Mountjoy Square yesterday.
The Judge also adjourned the attachment and committal motion to 13 February.
Previously the court heard that in 2016 Promontoria acquired loans advanced by First Active to Howard and McClean, with an address at Larkfield Avenue, Harold's Cross, Dublin.
It claims Howard and McClean jointly owe the fund €1.4 million while Howard owes an additional €400,000.
Talks between the parties over the debts had not been successful, and the receiver was appointed.
In correspondence with the receiver Howard disputes the validity of the receivership.
Super Rugby boss Andy Marinos says more teams could be cut from the much-criticised competition should they not measure up.
In an interview with Newstalk ZB's Tony Veitch, chief executive Marinos said he and his organisation were confident the culling of Australian team the Force, and South African teams the Kings and Cheetahs, would give the new 15-team competition more stability and integrity from next year until the end the broadcast deal in 2020.
"The biggest thing is getting integrity back in the comp," he said. "We need all the teams to play against each other as frequently as possible and [for] that to culminate into an incredible finals series.
"It's about re-invigorating and re-engaging our fans and stakeholders but the best way we can do that is the unpredictability of the results and the competitiveness of the teams."

But Marinos also gave himself room for further changes when he added: "In saying that, sport is an unpredictable and volatile environment.
"If some of the teams, for whatever reason, aren't able to participate then we have to have some flexibility if we need it."
There must be scrutiny on the Sunwolves next year, the struggling Japanese team beating a poor Blues outfit in Tokyo after travelling home from Cape Town but won only one other game this season.
The spotlight should also be on the Rebels, the Melbourne team winning only one match despite being in a weak Australian conference.
Most supporters of New Zealand teams will be satisfied with the culling of a trio of teams who rarely raised pulses here, but there is little doubt that the unbridled desire for expansion -- mostly against the wishes of the public and media -- and then the mishandled axing of the Force in particular, has harmed the game in the southern hemisphere.
Marinos empathised with the players and supporters of the excluded teams. The competition has expanded from 12 to 14 to 15 to 18 teams and teams from Japan and Argentina added which has caused lopsided results and a lessening of public interest, but Marinos believed that was the right thing to do at the time.
"At the time, when we were looking at the expansion, all the triggers in the market were pointing in the right direction and there was appetite [for expansion] from our key stakeholders in that regard.
"The key piece that underpins it all is the high performance and sustainability and as we ventured down this path it became a lot more prevalent that some of the countries didn't quite have the high-performance outfits to deliver week-in, week-out in this new competition structure.
"There was severe financial strain on the number of the unions as well so that's what has really caused us to take a good look at the competition structure and revisit where we are."
Marinos said the television audience held up quite well this year compared to last. He said in 2016 there was a global audience of 50 million. This year there was an audience of 48.9 million.
"It's not all doom and gloom," he said. "If we look at the global audience compared with other competitions such as the Aviva or Top 14 [in Europe], we're certainly drawing a substantial audience. The numbers are good and the attendances weren't as bad. Yes, there has been a slight drop-off and again that can be attributed to the performances of the teams. I'm really confident going into 2018 with a settled structure that we're going to see some stability in the metrics that we use to assess [the competition]."
But while Marinos was upbeat about Super Rugby, he admitted to being worried about the continued All Black dominance in the Rugby Championship. Steve Hansen's men, who play the Springboks in Cape Town tomorrow morning, have already claimed the trophy with one round remaining.
"Absolutely it concerns me and I think it's even a bigger concern for New Zealand," Marinos said. "Sometimes your sustained success can end up becoming your biggest weakness because it just becomes an uncompetitive environment.
"There is a significant challenge to South Africa, Australia and Argentina."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate's GOP and Democratic leaders can't agree on much, but they both say they want to dedicate weeks to passing legislation to fund the government next year — and avoid the annual take-it-or-leave-it vote on a foot-tall, $1 trillion-plus catchall spending bill.
For now, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer are saying all the right things to try to revive the older, more deliberative ways of doing Senate business rather than bundling the 12 annual spending bills together.
Critics say it gives too much power to top leaders while rank and file lawmakers are shut out of secretive negotiations.
President Donald Trump is playing a role as well, promising that he won't sign any more such "omnibus" appropriations bills.
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - Police have arrested a juvenile after they say he called 911 and lied about shots fired at a Fort Lauderdale elementary school.
According to the Broward Sheriff's Office, a 10-year-old boy was arrested and appeared in juvenile court Tuesday morning. Deputies charged the boy with misusing the 911 system by calling in a fake report of shots fired at North Andrews Gardens Elementary on Monday.

LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Officials say the death toll from two days of heavy monsoon rains in eastern Pakistan has risen to 15.
The heaviest rains seen in Lahore since 1980 continued into Wednesday, flooding streets and causing some residents to join small demonstrations against local authorities.
Rescue officials and police confirmed the death toll, saying most deaths were caused by electrocution and homes caving in.
Pakistan has long struggled to cope with the annual monsoon rains, which trigger flash floods and mud slides that destroy homes.
BARBERTON, Ohio (AP) — Authorities say an Ohio woman shot her husband multiple times earlier this year and dismembered his body.
Forty-nine-year-old Marcia Eubank has been charged with murder in the death of 54-year-old Howard Eubank. Records don't show an attorney for her.
The Summit County sheriff's office says in a release that deputies went to the couple's home in Coventry Township in suburban Akron on Saturday when the couple's adult son called about possible remains. The deputies found deteriorating remains tentatively identified as those of Howard Eubank. The release says investigators believe Eubank was killed earlier this year in a "domestic-related incident."
Authorities say Marcia Eubank was arrested later Saturday in a store parking lot. A Barberton Municipal Court judge on Monday set bond for her at $1 million.
Guest Editorial
Dear America,
Over a decade ago I lived within the concrete sprawl of Houston, so to escape I drove south down I-45 to Galveston and veered further south along the Texas coast to San Luis Pass. There the San Luis Pass Pier jutted out like some kind of wonder of the world, stretching over the Gulf of Mexico, the pilings, boards, and railings forming a huge structure that allowed me to walk across the water. I crossed all the way out to the end of the pier, and as I stood and felt the wind on my face, and as I inhaled the salty air, I felt briny and as distant and removed from the strife and complications of city living as any minority could ever be.
What I remember most about the end of the pier was a yellow line that denoted a unique space where no one could remain, because you could cross the line and cast your lines and leave your surf fishing rods propped against the end railing, but you couldn't stay beyond the line and block anyone from being able to reach their fishing rods. No, the small square space beyond the yellow line couldn't become too crowded. What occurred because of the existence of that space was that people—African Americans, Mexicans, Caucasians, and Asians (some Chinese-American, like me) cooperated in the most communal or admirable and supportive fashion, so that if there were a multitude of anglers, all of the fishing rods were arranged in tight rows, resting against the end railing, the lines fanning out, covering the expanse of the Gulf in a broad swath. And if anyone hooked a bull red or a tiger shark or a massive stingray, people would lift their lines to help any fisherman from tangling lines, whether the fish ran in one direction or another, and you might see a fisherman loan another fisherman a drop net to help retrieve a catch from far below.
One night when I lost a fish that broke my leader, two Mexican fishermen showed me how they crimped their leaders out of wire, beads, and swivels to be stronger, and on another day a Caucasian fisherman showed me how to best hook fresh dead mullet, and I gave him some mullet when he ran out of bait. There was always the sense that the Gulf and the wind and the sun—that nature—without the least amount of effort, was far greater than any of us. So I have not forgotten all of the rituals of civility that occurred at any hour, whether in the black depths of the night or under the hot noontime sun, high tides forever waiting for anyone, the fish inevitably appearing, always seeming eager to bite.
I learned recently how William Lee, an accomplished Chinese-American lawyer who grew up in the 1950s, was told this past August in Wellesley, Massachusetts to go back to his own country, before being followed by another car until he pulled into a police station. And I've read the reports from the Southern Poverty Law Center about the outbreak of more than 900 hate crimes since the Presidential election.
So I recall the space at the end of the pier with a greater reverence, and all of this makes me consider how my mentor, the late James Alan McPherson, returned time and again for ideological fortitude to our earlier history, when categories and caste systems in American needed to be abolished by Congress, whereby a third, neutral category was created, as McPherson writes, “for the purposes of legal classification: that of citizen of the United States. This hypothetical person, neither black nor white, (and now, by extension, neither Latino, Native American, or Asian American) or male or female, would enjoy all the rights of citizenship and would be expected to meet all the responsibilities required of such a citizen. When such rights and responsibilities were assessed, the separating categories of race would be meaningless.” This, he continues, “was the purpose of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution:
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.
This ideal of not being able to deprive any citizen of life, liberty, or property, I think, is how our country is supposed to be. McPherson was also fond of citing the famous case of Plessy v. Ferguson that stemmed from segregation on trains; the case was argued in 1896 before the Supreme Court. He writes in his book Railroad how the phrase “'Our Constitution is color-blind' . . . was admitted into the language of the law by Justice John Harlan in his eloquent dissent from the majority opinion in Plessy”:
The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth, and in power. . . . But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior dominant ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is colorblind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.
These words, “Our Constitution is colorblind,” McPherson writes, “have shaped the course of legal theory from 1896 to the present.” I find them to be artful and sustaining. The phrase further points toward how the country should be for anyone born on this soil, so I like to keep it in mind. I should add that I was born in 1962 and therefore grew up believing that by the time I reached midlife perhaps our nation's racial problems might be solved, or at least vastly improved upon. But this evening I watched President-elect Trump rallying in Ohio, and I saw not one person of color seated behind him, and I heard chants of “USA! USA!” on a mass scale, and along with this chanting I noticed how the incendiary language of white nationalism ran hot throughout Trump's speech, decrying globalism, insisting upon building the wall on the Mexico border, vowing to renegotiate or throw out all existing foreign trade agreements, along with deregulating on a mass scale statutes that protect the environment (as if nature isn't larger in scope than all of us), all the while promising repeatedly to make America great again. Yes, as it's frequently been pointed out, this is simply code for making America “white” again.
So we are living now in a culture of escalation, in a confluence of tension between the haves and have-nots, combined with a struggle over the concern for the environment and the denial of global warming, accompanied by the purchasing and stockpiling of guns that's been spurred by the lobbying efforts of the NRA, further complicated by white fear that minorities will soon outnumber them and forever run the country if some sort of grand last stand isn't taken. Many, like Morris Berman, have foreseen and predicted a crisis of empire, stating that the American dream is simply over whether Trump is in power or not. At the same time I have never seen as many of my graduate or undergraduate students or old friends as upset, or as fearful, and I have never witnessed as many of my colleagues in academia being watchful, wondering if they might be targeted or put on a watch list for expressing “liberal” opinions, as if we have regressed to an era of McCarthyism. I've heard from several of my former business associates in venture capital that they're uncertain about the future, too, while the sentiment of “What can we do?” seems to be growing more prevalent.
The San Luis Pass Pier, I'm sorry to say, was destroyed by Hurricane Ike in 2008. But as I hold onto my memory of the pier, and as I continue to recall the premise and of citizenship, a larger part of me takes life head on, living day to day and in the moment, and feeling more present, alert, and sensitive to changes in the air than before.
As a minority who has lived in the Deep South for over 12 years now, I am in survival mode. I always have been, in one way or another. Though I wear eyeglasses because of nearsightedness, I have always strived to avoid the Asian stereotype: I drive a dark blue pickup truck, wear jeans and flannel shirts and hiking boots, and I have been known to wear a tan Carhartt barn jacket that has Ruger stitched in dark brown letters on the right side, so while I've never owned or carried a handgun, when I'm walking on the sidewalks in our small town I'm aware of how white male Southerners notice Ruger on my jacket, their expressions becoming contemplative, pondering whether I'm carrying a revolver under my coat. I don't mind their thinking about it, or believing in the possibility that I'm armed, because so far I've been left peacefully alone, passing as I may be.
Still, lately I have told my students that during times like this they should feel that their choice to be a writer—their public identity as a writer—is more important now than during any recent time, since this is when we write our stories and essays and poems to protest and to chronicle the current state of unrest and to express and imagine how we think life should be—in opposition to all of the strife, hypocrisy, and amplified hate we see. Yes, writers have always been activists, so we cannot be silent.
And I suppose there is further wisdom that I can offer because of my age. What I should say is that I lived through being young in the 60s, when deeper strains of racism and more institutionalized behaviors were being taken on, and gains were made, some small and others far more significant, and history is cyclic, so we—which is to say, the better, more inclusive ideals of America—shall certainly survive through this.

In an eagerly anticipated all-British cruiserweight fight, Lawrence Okolie won a wide decision over Isaac Chamberlain in a grudge match at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday.
The bout was billed as puncher (Okolie) vs. boxer (Chamberlain), however, from the get-go, 2012 Olympian Okolie was too much for his compatriot in front of 8,000 fans.
Okolie (8-0, 6 knockouts) dropped Chamberlain (9-1, 4 KOs) in the first and sixth rounds and used his greater height and reach to win an often awkward encounter on the scorecards by unanimous decision: 98-89, 96-90 and 97-89.
“This is good as a benchmark,” Okolie told Sky Sports. “He tested me in a different way. I hurt him early and if he's brave enough he's going to keep coming and it's going to turn into a long night. I have nothing but respect for him for his mental toughness and fortitude.
“I'm going to have a little rest, then fight on the Joshua undercard against someone like Craig Kennedy.”
Rising welterweight prospect Ted Cheeseman (13-0, 8 KOs) navigated a few awkward moments against wily American veteran Carson Jones (40-13-3, 30 KOs) en route to a 10-round unanimous decision.
Both men fought on near-even terms early on; Jones bloodied the Brit's nose as early as the second but was unable to capitalize on it further.
By the mid-rounds Jones — who missed weight by four pounds — had faded and allowed the younger man to use his skills and edge ahead in the fight. With the fight seemingly in hand, Cheeseman was caught late in the ninth and lost his shape and looked ragged. To his credit, he gathered himself and won the final round.
It was a good learning curve for the 22-year-old Brit, who was awarded the verdict by a verdict wider than it should have been: 99-91, 99-91 and 100-89.
“At times I thought I could get him out of there, but I didn't want to take too much of a risk because I knew he was a good fighter,” Cheeseman told Sky Sports afterwards. “I thought I boxed exceptionally well and got the job done perfectly.
“This was a career-changer, this win. It's going to push me on to big things. I didn't want to take risks to muck that up; I'll take risks when I need to take risks. All tonight was about was winning. I wanted to get him out of there, but I never pushed for it and gave him a boxing lesson.”
2016 Olympic light heavyweight bronze medalist Joshua Buatsi (4-0, 3 KOs) continued his development with a second-round stoppage of Jordon Joseph (7-2-1, 2 KOs).
The 24-year-old university graduate almost got his opponent out in the first round before referee Bob Williams called a halt at 2:43 of the second round. Buatsi looks to have a high ceiling, and although it is early in his career, much is expected of him.
Heavy-handed Reece Bellotti (12-0, 11 KOs) successfully retained his Commonwealth title for the first time with an impressive sixth-round stoppage over Ben Jones (22-7-1, 10 KOs).
The title was only on the line for Bellotti because Jones failed to make the 126-pound weight limit at Friday's weigh in. Bellotti had too much power for the perennial contender, dropping him in the fourth round with a bodyshot before getting the stoppage two rounds later with a huge overhand right.
Bellotti and promoter Eddie Hearn hope to face the winner of Isaac Lowe-Ryan Walsh, who meet on February 17 for the British title.
Former IBF bantamweight titlist Paul Butler (26-1, 14 KOs) stayed active with a workmanlike display, finally stopping journeyman Jefferson Vargas (5-8) at 2:02 of the eighth and final round. Butler, who weighed 124, will doubtlessly be hoping for a world title shot at IBF 115-pound titleholder Kal Yafai at some point this year.
Former world title challenger Charlie Edwards (12-1, 5 KOs) stopped Ricky Little (3-2-1, 1 KO) in the opening round of their junior bantamweight fight. The 24-year-old Londoner has won four fights since losing to Johnriel Casimero in an IBF 115-pound title fight in September 2016, on the undercard of Gennady Golovkin-Kell Brook.
Heavyweight hopeful Nick Webb (12-0, 10 KOs) returned from a year's inactivity and wasted little time knocking Croatian journeyman Ante Verunica (3-5-1, 1 KO) flat on his back at 2:45 of the second round with a huge right hand, after which he was counted out by referee Robert Williams.
In super bantamweight action, Gamal Yafai (14-0, 7 KOs) warmed up for next month's domestic battle with Gavin McDonnell with a third-round stoppage over Spanish-based Nicaraguan Jose Hernandez (4-17-1, 3 KOs).
2010 Commonwealth Games gold medalist Sean McGoldrick (4-0, 2 KOs) continued his progression with a third-round stoppage over Michael Barnor (14-20-3, 10 KOs).
Up-and-coming middleweight Felix Cash (8-0, 6 KOs) stopped James Hagenimana (8-7-1, 6 KOs) at 1:27 of the fifth round of a scheduled eight.

SCOTTSDALE, AZ - FEBRUARY 02: Bryson DeChambeau watches his tee shot on the during the second round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale on February 2, 2018 in Scottsdale, Arizona. (Photo by Robert Laberge/Getty Images)
By Associated Press Contact Associated Press on Twitter:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Rickie Fowler took a share of the lead into the weekend in the Waste Management Phoenix Open. He knows from experience the party is just getting started.
"Just keep the gas pedal down," Fowler said.
Fowler has had a lot of success at TPC Scottsdale without winning. He finished a shot behind Hunter Mahan in 2010, lost to Hideki Matsuyama on the fourth extra hole in 2016, and tied for fourth last year.
"From the first couple times I played it, I knew it was just kind of a matter of time before I would win here," Fowler said. "I know I can win here. I put myself in position plenty of times."
Fowler was tied with SMU-ex Bryson DeChambeau, with each shooting his second straight 5-under 66.
The festive tournament drew an estimated Friday-record crowd of 191,400 fans, bringing the week's total to 439,088. The third-round mark of 204,906 set last year is expected to be shattered Saturday, and the week record of 655,434 from a year ago could fall with a day to spare.
DeChambeau birdied the final two holes, hitting a wedge to 8 inches on the par-4 18th late on another 80-degree afternoon.
"I missed a few short putts on the back nine, so definitely didn't play my best," DeChambeau said.
He won the John Deere Classic last year. In 2015, the former SMU star became the fifth player to win the NCAA individual title and U.S. Amateur in the same year.
Daniel Berger and former Arizona State player Chez Reavie were a stroke back.
Fowler birdied four of the first six holes. He bogeyed his old nemesis, the 317-yard 17th, after driving short of the green to the left and chipping across and off the green.
The tournament lost some star power when Jordan Spieth missed the cut and two-time defending champion Matsuyama withdrew because of a left wrist injury.
Spieth shot 72-70, playing alongside Justin Thomas, who is at 6-under along with first-round leader Bill Haas. The third-ranked Spieth last failed to advance to weekend play in May, when he missed consecutive cuts in The Players Championship and the AT&T Byron Nelson.
U.S. comedian Roseanne Barr said she was tired of “being attacked and belittled” and blamed sleep aid Ambien for her tweet that compared a black former Obama administration official to an ape, a racist remark that sparked a wave of outrage.
Barr said in a series of Tweets on Tuesday and early on Wednesday that what she did was “unforgivable” when she posted on Twitter that if the Islamist political movement “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj,” referring to Valerie Jarrett, a former aide to President Barack Obama.
“It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible,” she wrote. “I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please.”
In other Tweets, Barr said that she was tired of “being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse” and asked for people not to boycott ABC, saying that the network has the right to “do what they wish.”
Walt Disney Co's ABC network on Tuesday canceled her popular U.S. television comedy “Roseanne” after her tweet.
Barr, 65, then apologized “for making a bad joke” about Jarrett, who is black and was born in Iran to American parents.
“Don't feel sorry for me, guys!!,” Barr said in a Tweet late on Tuesday. “I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet.”
Jarrett, 61, said on Tuesday that Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger called her before ABC announced the show's cancellation.
Hollywood talent agency ICM said in a statement on Tuesday it will no longer represent Barr. Several networks said it was removing reruns of her show. Hulu said episodes of the new show would no longer be available on its streaming service.
The original “Roseanne” ran from 1988 to 1997, featuring a blue-collar family, the Conners, with overweight parents struggling to get by. It was praised for its realistic portrayal of working-class life.
The current “Roseanne” was ABC's biggest hit of the 2017-2018 season, drawing an average 18.7 million viewers, second only to CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory,” according to Nielsen data through May 20.

A recent study published in Oxford Economic Papers suggests that going to university has beneficial effects on interpersonal skills and individual conscientiousness.
Behavioural economists led by Sonja Kassenboehmer observed 575 adolescents in Australian universities over a period of eight years. The team found a correlation between the teens´ “education decisions” and their conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion. The researchers concluded that “exposure to university life” was the key factor in increasing students´ “non-cognitive ability.” This effect was particularly strong in cases of youngsters from low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds.
The results of this study may not seem surprising – university environment is poised to make students more outspoken. Primary or secondary school simply does not achieve the same things. Comparing primary or secondary school with university is like juxtaposing a pond with a sea. With strangers all around (especially first year), students are nudged to make new friends quickly, and agreeableness and confidence make this a bit less challenging. It is likely that the diversity of people and greater academic pressure at University pushes students towards responsibility. However, it is also possible that due to the rigorous application process, newcomers to university are “naturally” more inclined to be fastidious, with academic institutions only reinforcing this natural tendency.
However, the strong correlation in the low-income student population is rather well explained by the change of atmosphere university brings. Poverty can go hand-in-hand with social isolation and oftentimes creates a low self-image due to a classist society. Attending university might give such students an opportunity to make acquaintances and friends who do not care about their social status.
From a scientific point of view, the results of this study should be taken with a pinch of salt. The Big Five methodology the authors used to measure character traits is flawed. Furthermore, the study maps a single student cohort in Australia – results for different students in other countries may not necessarily be similar.
Most importantly, as with most psychological research, this study was correlational. It can only state that university attendance and improved social skills occur together. Common occurrence and causation are two wildly different concepts. Greater sociability may be caused by factors different from attending university: age and interaction with peers may be alternate explanations. One needs to be careful with correlation, as it sometimes produces very implausible, but amusing relationships. After all, there has been a study that found a statistically significant relationship between dishwasher use and the practice of safe sex.

Nearly 3 of 5 small business owners (58 percent) currently approve of the job President Donald Trump is doing but really need his domestic agenda to be put into place. That's the finding from the first Survey Monkey/CNBC quarterly Small Business Index.
Potential Impact of Trump on Small Business Optimism
Despite the 58 percent approval rating, small business owners indicate stalling the economic agenda President Donald Trump is proposing will cause this figure to drop.
The Index gives an overall “Confidence” score for small businesses. This score is based on answers to eight questions in the survey. The first survey has small business confidence at 60 out of 100.
Fewer Hearings, More Legislation
In order to get small business confidence higher — or at least to hold steady — lawmakers in Washington D.C. need to get to work. Think less investigations and more passing bills.
For instance, the biggest issue facing small businesses is taxes. According to the survey, 25 percent of small businesses believe this is the most important challenge facing them. And 42 percent of those surveyed believe a change in tax policy will have a positive impact on their business.
Earlier this year, President Trump unveiled a brief look at the proposed tax plan for next year. If it were passed as proposed, the new tax rate for businesses could be as low as 15 percent.
Regulations, customer demand, and the cost of healthcare coverage were all identified as the next greatest challenges to small businesses, according to the Survey Monkey data. Fourteen percent of small businesses identified each of those factors as their biggest challenge. Here's a deeper look at some of the data from this survey:
38 percent say that regulation changes will impact their business positively (26 percent say it will have a negative impact)
27 percent say trade policy changes will have a positive impact on their business (22 percent negative)
Hiring Freeze
Despite another small business survey painting the President in a positive light, it's not all good news.
Small businesses don't expect to hire much full-time help in the coming year. Just 27 percent of the small businesses surveyed say they'll add a new job over the next year.
Red Pill
Survey Monkey and CNBC surveyed more than 2,000 small business owners for this first index. Of those that responded, 38 percent are Republicans and 23 percent are Democrats.
A woman has been saved from violent intruders, including one wielding a machete, by her dog.
The 20-year-old victim was pushed to the floor and kicked a number of times in the incident on April 13, Derbyshire Police said.
The woman was attacked by three men between 11.20pm and 11.50pm when she opened the back door of her home on Reeves Road, Derby.
The intruders forced their way in and threatened her with a machete before her dog sprang into action.
One of the men threw a dining room chair at the victim but she managed to escape through the back door.
The dog suffered a cut to the nose in the incident but nothing was stolen from the house, the force said.
Police are urging anyone who saw something suspicious that night to come forward.

So, anytime you may need a Life then ask for it and any time you have some extra Lives then present it to other gamers. Each and every player can gift as much as 5 Lives every single couple of hours. So, you'll be able to continue enjoying your game with no worrying about Lives.
Boosters:
Boosters are exceptionally crucial to clear several pieces at a time inside the grid. There are quite a few distinct types of Boosters accessible inside the game that can be made use of for enhancing your gameplay. Nevertheless, acquiring them is just not uncomplicated! It is possible to procure them once within a while by unlocking Frequent Chest or Star Chest, so you'll want to use them sparingly. In case that you are stuck up using a difficult level, then make use of the Booster otherwise begin playing the exact same level again using the hope of completing it inside the second time.
As an example; the Boxing Glove Booster is usually utilized for destroying each and every piece in an entire row. An Anvil Booster can clear an entire column in the grid whereas a Hammer Booster will destroy single blocks. Also, if you commence stages, you may get some Boosters which will be beneficial in turning a block into a Disco Ball, Rocket, or Bomb.
Listed Below Are Some Amazing Recommendations That can Make Your Toon Blast Game Simpler:
Ahead of you begin with matching blocks around the grid, analyze the board and see if there are actually pieces that can be grouped together to produce a combo. Each and every time you make a combo of four or far more blocks, you can be capable of generate a specific block.
After you obtain a Rocket and Bomb, try and have them adjacent to each other. This may allow you to combine particular pieces for any effective effect. For example; two Rockets with each other will allow you to delete two lines at when. Two Bombs collectively will produce a highly effective explosion. You can even produce combinations of various specific pieces.
A Rocket as well as a Bomb combo is definitely the finest remedy to wipe out three adjacent columns and rows. This combo can even be used for destroying objective connected blocks like bubbles or balloons. Similarly, if you make a combo out of a Bomb along with a Disco Ball, it's going to transform the color from the blocks and destroy a lot of the blocks around the grid.
Adjust the date and time on your gaming device to obtain Lives instantaneously. All you need to complete is move the time forward by a couple of hours. This trick will save you from wasting time in waiting for the Lives to regenerate on its own. Recall to change the time once more just after you finish playing the game for the day.
To conclude, Toon Blast is usually a exciting game that can preserve you busy with its a lot of challenges. So, join the crazy globe of Toon Blast and have a blast!
HONOLULU (AP) — Fast-moving lava is advancing to another part of a rural Big Island district where Kilauea volcano is erupting, officials said Wednesday in advising those residents to evacuate.
Lava continues to advance toward subdivisions in the Puna district. Those in Kapoho Beach Lots, Vacationland and Waa Waa were being advised to evacuate, the Hawaii County Civil Defense agency said.
"You are at risk of being isolated due to possible lava inundation of Beach Road near Four Corners," the agency advised the public, referring to the area where two highways intersect.
Lava crossed Highway 132, which connects the commercial center with smaller towns and farms in the area, authorities said Tuesday. Hawaii County officials said lava destroyed the local electric utility's equipment on the highway, which knocked out power to Vacationland and Kapoho Beach Lots neighborhoods toward the coast.

Officials ordered about 2,000 residents of Leilani Estates and nearby areas to evacuate when fissures began opening in the communities earlier this month.
The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said vigorous eruption continues from the series of vents.
Lava from one fissure created fountains Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning that reached over 200 feet (61 meters). The fountains fed a lava flow that moved downslope along Highway 132, the observatory said.
The flow moved north of the highway and was headed to the area where Highway 132 and Highway 137 intersect.
Aerial observations from the U.S. Geological Survey on Wednesday morning showed lava from a fissure with 0.65 miles (1.04 kilometers) of Highway 137 and was advancing at about 100 yards (91.44 meters) per hour. Lava from another fissure was about 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) above the intersection and was advancing in pauses and surges of about 600 yards (548.64 meters) per hour, scientists said.
Strands of volcanic glass, known as Pele's hair named for the Hawaiian volcano goddess, were accumulating on the ground in Leilani Estates, and winds may blow lighter particles farther away, scientists said.
Volcanic gas emissions remain high from the fissure eruptions, scientists said. Wind conditions for Wednesday were forecast to result in widespread vog — or volcanic smog— over the Big Island.
Andreas Mikkelsen was the surprise leader of RallyRACC Catalunya - Rally de España after a fascinating opening on Friday morning.
Driving a Hyundai i20 in competition for the first time after signing for the Korean manufacturer last month, Mikkelsen vaulted from fifth to first after winning the tough Terra Alta speed test which closed the morning's action.
With tyres already showing wear after two gravel tests, managing the rubber through the 39km special stage, which also contained several abrasive and technical asphalt sections, was key. Mikkelsen mastered it.
He was the fastest by 2.7sec to lead fellow Norwegian Mads Østberg by 0.6sec and said: “I made some differential changes before the stage and it's better now. I start to feel more and more at home.”
Østberg was second quickest but continued to struggle with dust entering his Ford Fiesta's cockpit. “It's ridiculous, I don't see in the stage and Torstein (co-driver Eriksen) is struggling with this voice,” he explained.
Road opener Sébastien Ogier had the worst of the conditions but the championship leader climbed to third overall in his Fiesta, 4.0sec behind Østberg. He finished with two badly worn tyres but third fastest was his reward for a fine drive.
Fourth was Ott Tänak, the Estonian slipping back from the lead and 7.4sec behind Mikkelsen after a slow puncture in his Fiesta. “On the Tarmac section we had a tyre alarm. It was disturbing and I lost my rhythm,” he explained.
Kris Meeke dropped time on the mid-stage asphalt but the Citroën C3 pilot was just 0.2sec behind Tänak in fifth place, with Dani Sordo completing the top six in another i20.
There was a glum expression on Thierry Neuville's face at the stage finish. The Belgian was the only driver to opt for soft compound rubber all round and it was a decision he regretted.
“Not the greatest choice. The information was the soft compounds would last at least 50km, but the temperature was higher than expected and they went off after 10km. We couldn't take advantage,” said Neuville, who was seventh and 15.8sec off the lead.
Jari-Matti Latvala and Juho Hänninen were eighth and ninth in Toyota Yaris cars, with Elfyn Evans completing the leaderboard after clipping a stone near the finish. The impact broke his Fiesta's front left wheel.
Esapekka Lappi conceded 30sec after losing the brakes in his Yaris on the asphalt.
BEIJING (AP) — Volkswagen and Nissan have unveiled electric cars designed for China at a Beijing auto show that highlights the growing importance of Chinese buyers for a technology seen as a key part of the global industry's future.
General Motors displayed five all-electric models Wednesday including a concept Buick SUV it says can go 600 kilometers (375 miles) on one charge. Ford and other brands showed off some of the dozens of electric SUVs, sedans and other models they say are planned for China.
Auto China 2018, the industry's biggest sales event this year, is overshadowed by mounting trade tensions between Beijing and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods including automobiles in a dispute over technology policy.
The impact on automakers should be small, according to industry analysts, because exports amount to only a few thousand vehicles a year. Those include a GM SUV, the Envision, and Volvo Cars sedans made in China for export to the United States.

China accounted for half of last year's global electric car sales, boosted by subsidies and other prodding from communist leaders who want to make their country a center for the emerging technology.
"The Chinese market is key for the international auto industry and it is key to our success," VW CEO Herbert Diess said on Tuesday.
Volkswagen unveiled the E20X, an SUV that is the first model for SOL, an electric brand launched by the German automaker with a Chinese partner. The E20X, promising a 300-kilometer (185-mile) range on one charge, is aimed at the Chinese market's bargain-priced tiers, where demand is strongest.
GM, Ford, Daimler AG's Mercedes unit and other automakers also have announced ventures with local partners to develop models for China that deliver more range at lower prices.
On Wednesday, Nissan Motor Co. presented its Sylphy Zero Emission, which it said can go 338 kilometers (210 miles) on a charge. The Sylphy is based on Nissan's Leaf, a version of which is available in China but has sold poorly due to its relatively high price.
Automakers say they expect electrics to account for 35 to over 50 percent of their China sales by 2025.
First-quarter sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 154 percent over a year earlier to 143,000 units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That compares with sales of just under 200,000 for all of last year in the United States, the No. 2 market.
That trend has been propelled by the ruling Communist Party's support for the technology. The party is shifting the financial burden to automakers with sales quotas that take effect next year and require them to earn credits by selling electrics or buy them from competitors.
That increases pressure to transform electrics into a mainstream product that competes on price and features.
Automakers also displayed dozens of gasoline-powered models from compact sedans to luxurious SUVs. Their popularity is paying for development of electrics, which aren't expected to become profitable for most producers until sometime in the next decade.
China's total sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans reached 24.7 million units last year, compared with 17.2 million for the United States.
SUVs are the industry's cash cow. First-quarter sales rose 11.3 percent over a year earlier to 2.6 million, or almost 45 percent of total auto sales, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
On Wednesday, Ford displayed its Mondeo Energi plug-in hybrid, its first electric model for China, which went on sale in March. Plans call for Ford and its luxury unit, Lincoln, to release 15 new electrified vehicles by 2025.
GM plans to launch 10 electrics or hybrids in China from through 2020.
VW is due to launch 15 electrics and hybrids in the next two to three years as part of a 10 billion euro ($12 billion) development plan announced in November.
Nissan says it will roll out 20 electrified models in China over the next five years.
New but fast-growing Chinese auto trail global rivals in traditional gasoline technology but industry analysts say the top Chinese brands are catching up in electrics, a market with no entrenched leaders.
BYD Auto, the biggest global electric brand by number sold, debuted two hybrid SUVs and an electric concept car.
The company, which manufactures electric buses at a California factory and exports battery-powered taxis to Europe, also displayed nine other hybrid and plug-in electric models.
Chery Automobile Co. showed a lineup that included two electric sedans, an SUV and a hatchback, all promising 250 to 400 kilometers (150 to 250 miles) on a charge. They include futuristic features such as internet-linked navigation and smartphone-style dashboard displays.
"Our focus is not just an EV that runs. It is excellent performance," Chery CEO Chen Anning said in an interview ahead of the show.
Electrics are likely to play a leading role as Chery develops plans announced last year to expand to Western Europe, said Chen. He said the company has yet to decide on a timeline.
Chery was China's biggest auto exporter last year, selling 108,000 gasoline-powered vehicles abroad, though mostly in developing markets such as Russia and Egypt.
"We do have a clear intention to bring an EV product as one of our initial offerings" in Europe, Chen said.

Isaiah Silva, the ex-husband of Love and Cobain's daughter, Francis Bean Cobain, has made the allegation in a lawsuit filed against several people in a Los Angeles court, Nine News reports.
Apart from Love they also include her manager Sam Lutfi, private investigator John Nazarian, musician Michael Schenk and actor Ross Butler.
Frances was locked in a bitter court battle with her ex-husband Isaiah over the ownership of the Martin D-18E guitar that originally belonged to Kurt, and according to TMZ, a settlement has been reached that gives the instrument to Isaiah.

Derby County's three-game losing streak came to an end at Pride Park Stadium tonight.
The Rams put a dent in Cardiff City's automatic promotion hopes - as they came from behind to beat the Bluebirds 3-1 at Pride Park Stadium.
A welcome three points for Gary Rowett's men moves them back up into the Sky Bet Championship play-off places, ahead of Millwall and into sixth.
For Cardiff, they remain a point ahead of in-form Fulham, with both sides having just two games left to play.
Callum Patterson's first-half strike seemed to have the Bluebirds on course to take a giant step towards the Premier League, but Cameron Jerome drew Derby level after the break.
Substitute Matej Vydra then slammed home from inside the box, before Jerome wrapped up the three points in added time.
Derby Telegraph chief football writer Steve Nicholson was at Pride Park and you can watch his video verdict above.
When, one is entitled to ask, will real reform of the health service begin? Waiting lists for appointments and operations are at record levels, as are the number of patients on trolleys in emergency departments. These problems can only get worse as the population ages.
There is a plan for the future, in the form of the Sláintecare report published last year. Its proposals enjoy cross-party support for the most part, but there is no agreement on how to fund its ambitious objectives. So we remain stuck in a holding pattern whereby the Government inches forward with implementation of the report.
Sláintecare was long on proposals for additional spending, despite the fact that Ireland's health spending is already well above the international average. It was much shorter on the detail of reforming the system to reduce waste and overspending while improving outcomes. Yet there is much that can be done to achieve these objectives now. The streamlining of trauma services is a case in point. Currently, 26 hospitals can receive trauma patients, though not one of them fulfils the criteria, in terms of services and patient throughput, for designation as a major trauma centre. About one-quarter of patients have to be taken from their original hospital to a better equipped facility. Almost half of patients with a brain injury never get to be treated in a neurological unit. Severely injured patients are not getting the right care, where they need it.
It is more than a decade now since cancer services were rationalised. The National Cancer Control Programme was established, and services were centralised in eight sites in place of the 30 centres that previously treated patients. The result was a dramatic improvement in patient outcomes. The same process needs to be undertaken in a number of areas of the health service, including trauma. This is not happening, though, for a number of reasons, but mainly due to political opposition to the loss of locally-based services, even when these are sub-optimal. Witness the delay in reconfiguring the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, despite the serious concerns of senior clinicians about standards there.
It comes as no surprise therefore to learn that the Department of Health's plans for streamlining trauma services is meeting resistance, and that this resistance is to a large extent based on regional considerations rather than concerns over improving quality and outcomes. Ministers Denis Naughten and Michael Ring – both based west of the Shannon – appear to want more services located in Connaught. There may be some merit in Naughten's objection to the siting of three trauma centres in Dublin – why not in one location? – but it behoves Minister for Health Simon Harris not to delay in implementing trauma care reform in a way that will ultimately save lives.

Utah Police Shooting Underscores the Added Threat Facing Black People on Bikes
The Salt Lake City police officer who shot and killed Patrick Harmon, 50, during a stop for biking without a light faces no charges, despite bodycam footage released this week that shows him firing three times while Harmon was running away.
Harmon was riding his bike when police pulled him over for not having a rear light. The officers claimed Harmon threatened to cut them with a knife, but the footage released this week shows Harmon attempting to flee when officer Clinton Fox shouted “I'll fucking shoot you!” and fired.
Evidence from cities all over the country — in Minneapolis, in Tampa, in Chicago, in New York — shows that black Americans are stopped for these types of minor infractions while biking or walking at much higher rates than white Americans. The disparity of course extends to driving violations — the common thread is that police often stop people of color as a pretext to conduct intrusive searches.
With alarming frequency, these police stops escalate into violence. Police took Patrick Harmon's life even though he posed no threat to them. “They just murdered him flat out,” Harmon's niece Alisha Shaw told the Guardian. “They are lying. There is no way they were threatened by anything.”
The fallout from police brutality is far-reaching, and the effects include how people decide to get around. Research by Rutgers researcher Charles Brown has illustrated how the threat of racial profiling and police brutality prevent black people from cycling.
The racial disparities in police stops and unabated police killings highlight the need for both reforms to policing in general and to traffic enforcement in particular. A traffic safety strategy that relies on enforcement by a racially biased police force is not going to make people safer. Knowing the anti-black bias of local police, advocates like Oboi Reed of Slow Roll Chicago are calling for the removal of police enforcement from Vision Zero initiatives.

A hat-trick by skipper Jimmy Smith helped to end Crawley Town's four-game winless run with a fine 3-2 win away to Colchester United.
Reds recovered from going a goal behind and then pushed to a 2-1 lead at half-time thanks to two goals by Smith.
The Crawley captain then scored his third goal of the game early in the second half to pave the way for a morale-boosting victory in Essex.
The home side pulled a goal back from a well-taken free-kick by Ben Dickinson, but they could not find a third to grab a point.
Colchester went into the game high in confidence having won their previous five home matches.
The US took the lead in the 18th minute when a cross from the left wasn't cleared and Denny Johnstone scored with a shot which was deflected over keeper Glenn Morris.
The goal was controversial as appeals for handball were ignored by the referee.
Smith pulled Reds back on to level terms just five minutes later when he rose to head home Dean Cox's corner.
Smith then added a stunning second goal to give Crawley the lead in the 34th minute when he received a ball from Enzio Boldewijn from the far post and he volleyed in it sweetly into the net.
Cox tried to find James Collins with a cross as they looked for a third goal but home keeper Sam Walker gathered the ball.
Just before half-time Reds went close again when Cox broke clear and nearly put Boldewijn through for a chance but the ball was cleared.
Coming out from a 2-1 half-time lead, Smith continued in the same vein by clinching his hat-trick in the 51st minute, hitting the ball under Walker from the edge of the area.
Midway through the half the referee had to receive treatment for an injury and was then substituted and Mr Waters replaced official Collins.
Smith's inspired night nearly brought a fourth goal when from a breakaway move, Boldewijn cut back and Smith's shot was blocked before Kaby Djalo hit the rebound wide.
With two minutes to go Reds survived a threat when they cleared from a goalmouth scramble.
Play had been held up by the incident with the referee and so consequently eight added minutes were indicated.
During the long period of injury-time Colchester pulled a goal back to 3-2 with a 93rd minute goal by Dickinson from a curling free-kick.
There was a tense last few minutes as Crawley battled to hold out for the valuable three away points and in the final seconds Morris held a dangerous ball sent into the penalty area as Crawley clinched a rare away victory.

A Northamptonshire couple, who had just tied the knot, were forced to walk home after their wedding car driver was found speeding, with no insurance.
PC Dave Lee of the Safer Roads Team stopped a BMW travelling at 46mph in a 30mph zone on Saturday (April 21), which was transporting a couple home after they had just got hitched.
He Tweeted: 'Just stopped a BMW doing 46 in a 30. Driver was transporting a happily married couple home after their wedding. Sadly he didn't have insurance either so they ended up walking the rest of the way home'.
After being questioned on Twitter about why Northants Police did not step in and go the extra mile to take the couple to their destination, he responded: 'There is no discretion when someone is driving with no insurance.
'How could we justify letting an uninsured vehicle carry on? Northants police haven't ruined their day. Their choice of driver did by not having insurance. As well as putting their lives & others at risk by speeding'.
But the couple were still in 'high spirits' and asked to have a selfie with PC Lee before walking two minutes home after the incident.
Victoria Beckham and Mel C staged a mini Spice Girls reunion on New Year's Eve in the Maldives.

The 42-year-old fashion designer - better known as Posh Spice when in the group - and the Version of Me hitmaker, also 42, performed their classic hit 2 Become 1 at the bash held at five-star luxury resort Amilla Fushi in the Maldives, despite rejecting the chance to be involved in a proper reunion with their band mates, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner.
Sharing a photo of the pair on stage, Mel wrote on Instagram: "Candle lit and soul forever ... A wonderful start to 2017 xxx"

Victoria and her retired soccer star husband David Beckham - who have kids Brooklyn, 17, Romeo, 14, Cruz, 11, and five-year-old daughter Harper - enlisted the services of Mel C to provide the entertainment at their getaway with pals Gordon and Tana Ramsay.
A source previously said: "Victoria has been the instigator for the whole trip.
"She's sorted all the accommodation for both families and ensured Mel is there to perform."
Mel and Victoria are said to have grown closer in recent months after both turned down the chance to reform the Spice Girls.
They added: "They've always been great pals, but have got closer over the past few months due to their shared stance on the Spice Girls comeback.
"There was no way Mel was going to turn down the invite as the gig will be something special."
However, it wasn't hard work for Mel as she was joined by her boyfriend Joe Marshall for the celebrations in between performances.
Victoria turned down a Spice Girls reunion to concentrate on her fashion label and Mel later admitted she didn't want to re-join the band as a fourpiece.

The western hills can look quite glorious in winter, sculpted by a raking sun. Bogs cloaked in dying moorgrass can shine as golden as a lion's mane. The little blue lakes can gleam like sapphires.
That, I'm getting afraid, was before climate change. Now the west must be shrouded in endless rain and hammered with storms of wind and hail. The hills have been laced with white water, slicing the peat, baring the bedrock, ponding the twisting roads.
But news of a tiny fragment of a mountain has drawn me out of their gloom. A gritty fossil the size of a thumbnail has led me to engage with the giant turmoils of the planet and infinite stretches of time.
Crepidosoma doyleii, a sea-bed brittle-star, belonged to the deep-water life of a vanishing ocean 435 million years ago. A Silurian species new to science, it has been named by international experts for an Irish geologist, Dr Eamon Doyle, a rare honour for an Irish scientist. He made the discovery in the 1990s, on his field research for a PhD from NUI Galway.
Five of the minute fossils, their body-discs and arms remarkably intact, ended up high in the scarp of Muintir Eoghan in the Maamturks of Connemara. Drive south from Leenane and over the rise into the Maam Valley; it's up on the right, above the clear-felled forestry.
The fossils' story predates anything in the modern western landscape and was set long before Jurassic dinosaurs, the popular image of an ancient Earth.
In the planet's Silurian period, 440 to 410 million years ago (and named, if it matters, for a tribe of Celts on the Welsh borders), Earth was recovering from an Ordovician ice age. First land plants were growing in moist regions near the equator and early insects were living among them.

The first fish with jaws appeared in the oceans and coral reefs expanded. So were the crinoids, the living “sea lilies”, and seabed animals including brittle-stars, spidery relatives of starfish and sea urchins.
Ireland at that time was still in two halves, each a nameless little zone in a crustal plate somewhere south of the Equator. What is now the northwestern portion of Ireland was in the shores of a big and barren Laurentia continent and the southern bit in the shore of the smaller Avalonia. The plates were separated by the Iapetus Ocean, narrowing slowly as they inched towards each other.
Their eventual collision was titanic, folding and refolding the crustal rock into mountains on the scale of the Himalayas. Today's hills of Connemara and south Mayo are mere relict stubs, worn down by fierce erosion and furrowed by great glaciations of ice.
The last, chaotic throes of the disappearing Iapetus produced volcanic islands, their ash and magma flowing into basins of stormy sea and smothering much of their life. The brittle-stars of Dr Doyle's discovery were living in deep water, perhaps 50m down. Preserved as moulded forms in compressed sedimentary rock, they ended within the one massive supercontinent of Pangaea.
In the Jurassic period, starting some 200 million years ago, Pangaea split apart. The northern half, Laurentia, then also fragmented, opening basins of the later Atlantic Ocean.
In the hills of modern Connacht, marine rocks from the Silurian stretch from east to west at the borders of Galway and Mayo in what geologists call the Kilbride Formation. It runs from rocks above Lough Mask in Joyce Country almost to the coast south of Killary Harbour, where crowded beds of today's brittle-stars wave with their long, whiplike arms. They can shed one or two of them readily and grow new ones. Brittle, indeed.
The Kilbride rocks hold changing seabed communities, gathered in beds at the fringe of stormy Silurian seas. They offer fossil bivalves, corals, sea lilies, trilobites. But in the western reaches of Kilbride, Crepidosoma doyleii emerged as Ireland's first recorded Silurian brittle-star.
This is described, with a map and fossil photographs, in the Irish Journal of Earth Sciences, published by the Royal Irish Academy (online at http://iti.ms/2F68jTV). Its authors include Dr David Harper, who supervised Eamon Doyle's PhD, and scientists in America and the Netherlands.
Twenty years, it seems, is not inordinately long for international recognition of a new species with a name honouring the discoverer. Dr Doyle is now the geologist for the Burren and Moher cliffs geopark, developing fossil trails in the famous limestone hills.
Ireland's rocks are remarkably rich in their evidence of ancient sealife and of Earth's ancient dramas and upheavals. Bringing their stories alive is the challenge of Ireland's new Unesco geoparks. Dr Doyle's is the third for the island, after Marble Arch caves in Fermanagh and the “Copper Coast” of Co Waterford with its early mining history
Crepidosoma doylei, soon for display in the National Museum, may justify a fourth geopark in Maam Valley and the hills of Joyce Country.

Labour leader Jacinda Ardern says her party would apply a royalty on commercial water use of water use the revenue to clean up New Zealand's rivers, lakes and streams.
National MPs, NZ First leader Winston Peters and industry groups say the proposed royalty would badly hurt farmers and the cost of water-intensive products like milk, meat and wine would skyrocket.
The Herald has fact-checked those claims to see if they are accurate.
Claim: Labour's water royalty will cost farmers $50,000 to $100,000 a year (Finance Minister Steven Joyce)
The facts: Labour says its price on water would be set after consultation, but it has suggested that it will be around 2c per 1000 litres for irrigators.

The amount of water used by farms varies depending on several factors - location, type of farm, and whether they use irrigation. Labour's tax would only apply to water sources from waters and aquifers (but not town supplies).
According to Irrigation NZ, the average, irrigated New Zealand farm uses around 4000 cubic metres of water per hectare.
The typical farm size is around 100 hectares, meaning they would use 400,000 cubic metres of water a year. If Labour's tax was set at 2c, then the average farm would pay additional tax of around $8000 a year.
Conclusion: Partly fictional. Large farms (600 hectares or more) would pay close to $50,000, but it would not be the norm. However, an extra $8000 in tax could be a huge amount for a marginally viable farm.
Claim: Labour's water tax will add $75 to the cost of a bottle of wine (Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy)
The facts: A 2013 Massey University study found that it takes around 900 litres of water to make 1 litre of wine (or about 650 litres of water for a typical 750ml bottle of wine).
In making the claim, Guy applied a tax of 10c per litre - a price previously proposed by the Green Party for bottled, exported, spring water. Labour has since said its price would be 2c per 1000 litres for farming, and lower than 10c for bottled water.
Of the 650 litres of water it takes to make a bottle of wine, between 80 litres and 400 litres of that water comes from rivers, lakes, streams or aquifers.
That means a tax of 2c per 1000 litres would add a cost of around 0.16c and 0.8c to a bottle of wine.
Conclusion: Fiction. The price of wine could rise if winemakers passed on the cost, but the change would be negligible.
Petitioners ignorant— Sole Administrator
By Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief
ABUJA—Staff of ABUJA—Staff of Ajaokuta Steel Company in Kogi State have petitioned the Federal Government over alleged refusal of the Sole Administrator, Mr Joseph Isah, to retire after completing his tenure.The staff, in the petition sent through Acting Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mrs. Habibat Lawal, to Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo; and Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, asked for Federal Government's urgent intervention.
In the said petition, Isah allegedly refused to hand over to the most senior management staff after completing his 35 years as stipulated by the Nigerian Civil Service Rules.In the petition by Mr. Salifu Oguche Usman Esq, Principal Partner at Abbluent Partners, Abuja, on behalf of the Ajaokuta Steel Company staff, it was claimed that Isah should have retired on August 3, 2017, having completed the statutory 35 years of service.
He was said to have been employed on August 3, 1982, as a Process Engineer in the company.The staff accused him of re-appointing himself to remain in office beyond his tenure and asked for his immediate exit.Isah was also accused of contravening financial and administrative regulations of government as he was alleged to have diverted workers' promotion allowances to other uses.However, Isah told Vanguard on phone that the petitioners acted out of ignorance.“I was appointed sole administrator in November 2012. Technically, by that appointment, my civil service career ended because my appointment is a political appointment. I earn a political appointee's salary. My appointment letter is there for anyone to see,” he said.
The staff urged the SGF not to only direct the Sole Administrator to proceed on retirement but also investigate the allegations on financial impropriety and other infractions raised by them against the Sole Administrator.
CHICAGO: LeBron James worked out for a full practice session Thursday (Friday in Manila) for the first time since spraining his left ankle last week and could return to the Cleveland Cavaliers' lineup for an NBA pre-season matchup Friday against Indiana.

Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player could return when the Cavs host the Pacers.
“Not sure yet,” Lue said. “We'll see how he feels after going through practice today.”
James, who has played in the past seven NBA Finals, has yet to take the court alongside the revamped Cleveland starting lineup in the wake of Kyrie Irving's trade to the Boston Celtics.
The Cavaliers, who lost to Golden State in last June's NBA Finals, added forward Jae Crowder and guard Isaiah Thomas from the Celtics and former New York and Chicago guard Derrick Rose to join James and Kevin Love, who could shift to center in the retooled Cleveland starting five.
Iman Shumpert will miss seven to 10 days with a left foot sprain, the team announced. The veteran guard was hurt during an awkward landing after a missed dunk in a 109-93 pre-season loss Wednesday to Atlanta.
Shumpert averaged 7.5 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in a career-high 76 regular-season games for Cleveland last season.
With three-time NBA champion guard Dwyane Wade joining Cleveland and Rose, who has struggled with knee injuries in past seasons, looking solid, the Cavaliers again figure to be the team to beat in the Eastern Confernece.
“They're both good slashers, good off the ball,” Lue said of pairing the two in the Cavs' backcourt. “We'll wait and see how it looks but I'm excited about it.”
Rose said he was amazed at the space left to him to attack the basket by opposing defenders in early pre-season work.
“He's playing at a high level as far as speed and quickness and being explosive getting to the basket,” Lue said. “Having the shooters we have on the floor, it makes it a lot easier for him.”
Adding to Cleveland's backcourt riches would be Thomas, who could return by the end of the year from a nagging hip injury.

Paul Thompson sent in this lovely picture of his flower-filled garden.
He said: ‘‘I have retired now and previously my son Richard, who is 25, was the keen gardener. He has now bought his own house and left me with the job of maintaining his good work! To be fair most of what you see in the photograph is down to him. I put the bird house in a few months ago and I think it makes a nice feature,'' said Paul.
He added: ‘‘Personally I like the relaxation of planting and renewal and to watch the bees and other insects as they move from flower to flower. We have seen some lovely butterflies too and I took some pictures of them. It is hard to beat sitting in the sunshine on a warm day and enjoying the results.''
Paul said the plants in this part of the garden include crocosmia, giant daisies, delphinium, dahlias, hydrangea, geraniums, bottlebrush, poppies, rhododendron, foxglove and garvinea.
‘‘There are other areas with lilies, antirrhinum, lavender, carnations, marigolds, gladioli, lobelia, lupins and other shrubs I don't know the names of.''

Ever since Sky first started broadcasting in the 1980s, it has been synonymous with two things: billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the concept of satellite television. Now the question is, which of these will it leave behind first?
The company is 39 per cent owned by Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, which is bidding to buy 100 per cent of it, though it has encountered a regulatory stumbling block, as the UK's Competition and Markets Authority doesn't think a man who owns so many newspapers should also be in control of Sky News. But even if Murdoch succeeds, his full ownership of Sky might not last for long: Fox's stake in Sky, whatever its size, is among the assets that it has agreed to sell to global media conglomerate Disney.
More impact
Another change coming down the tracks may have more impact on Sky subscribers. The pay-TV company has signalled that it will soon allow its customers to “ditch the dish”. It has been edging in this direction for a while: Sky's forays into the “pay-lite” TV market through the Now TV service effectively allowed dish-less viewers to access its content for the first time.
In what it describes as a “major development”, Sky has now confirmed that it will move further from its satellite broadcasting origins by making all of its channels and content available over the broadband-connected Sky Q box – with no need for a dish.
This will start in its Italian market, followed by Austria, so it may take some time before it reaches Ireland, while the company has also said it has no plans to stop broadcasting by satellite. But the trajectory of technology in the television business couldn't be clearer: satellites are yesterday's news. Sky, whoever ends up owning it, is moving on.
A mobile app for pancreatic cancer patients, a data exchange to help beat diabetes, an online health education platform and a secure messaging solution to communicate between aged care homes and GPs are among 15 projects being given early access to existing My Health Records in a government backed ‘test beds' program.
The projects are being run by universities, patient advocacy groups, health tech firms and hospitals between them sharing $8.5 million in funding.
As of last month 5.89 million Australians have registered for a My Health Record, as well as 12,763 healthcare organisations including general practices, hospitals, pharmacies and aged care services. More than 20 million prescription and dispense records have been uploaded. Only consenting My Health Record holders will participate in the trials.
The aim of the initiative is for proposed uses of the Health Records to be “rigorously reviewed and then scaled nationally”.
In one trial Eastern Health in Melbourne, Monash University, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, Deakin University and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia will develop a program to increase the engagement between discharged patients and their community pharmacist and use My Health Record data to “help patients with their medicines in the transition from hospital to home”.
More than 290 community pharmacies and 5,000 patients will be involved.
“We know when patients leave hospital on new medications they can find it confusing knowing how much to take and when. Every year almost a quarter of a million Australians will be hospitalised from medication errors, which is more than the number hospitalised from car accidents,” a spokesperson for the Australian Digital Health Agency, the system operator of My Health Record, said.
“This program aims to reduce unplanned and early readmission to hospital due to medication errors while utilising evidence based research,” they added.
Avoiding medication errors and adverse reactions, is also a focus of the government backed Digital Health Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) which launched in April.
In another ‘test bed' trial, Darling Downs and West Moreton Primary Health Network is partnering with the University of Queensland and West Moreton Hospital and Health Service to use the My Health Record to develop a coordinated information transfer and patient journey for prisoners released from incarceration. The aim is to ensure former prisoners can maintain and continue their access to healthcare when back in the community.
44 actions by 2022
The government today released its National Digital Health Strategy and an accompanying implementation plan Framework for Action.
The framework outlines 44 activities prioritised for delivery by 2022, covering My Health Record, secure messaging of health information, improving the quality of health data, improving access to medicines information, enhancing models of care, educating healthcare providers on using digital health technologies and ‘driving innovation'.
The top priority for the Australian Digital Health Agency is to ensure the widespread adoption of My Health Record.
Australians will have three months from mid-July to opt out of having a My Health Record automatically created for them. After the opt-out deadline has passed the record cannot be deleted, only made “unavailable” to health providers and individuals, the Department of Health revealed last year.
The decision to shift to an opt-out model in order to boost uptake of the eHealth record followed trials in Queensland and New South Wales. Those trials were staged in the wake of a 2013 review of the system – originally named the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR) – that concluded the system should shift to an opt-out approach.
The 2017-18 federal budget earmarked $374.2 million over two years for the expansion of the system as it moved away from opt-in.
“My Health Record will help save and protect lives, and it will offer increasing clinical utility in our health system in the future,” said Minister for Health Greg Hunt in a statement today.

Less than two years after Nadezhda Savchenko returned from a Russian prison to a hero's welcome, the ex-military pilot dubbed “Ukraine's Joan of Arc” is now accused of plotting to blow up Kiev's parliament and massacre its deputies.
The latest extraordinary claims from Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko – who recently accused former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili of planning a coup in Ukraine – are stoking a febrile political atmosphere that bodes ill for Ukraine's stability ahead of major elections in 2019.
“The investigation has irrefutable evidence that Nadezhda Savchenko, a deputy of Ukraine, personally planned [and] personally gave instructions on how to commit a terrorist act here in this hall,” Mr Lutsenko told parliament.
He said that after using grenades and mortars to destroy much of the main chamber and the glass dome of the building in central Kiev, she intended to “use automatic rifles to finish off anyone who survived”.
At Mr Lutsenko's request, parliament is due to debate on Thursday whether to lift the immunity from prosecution that Ms Savchenko enjoys as a deputy.
Ms Savchenko (36) was captured during fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and handed to Russia, where she was convicted in a show trial over the death of two Russian journalists. She returned home to great fanfare in a prisoner swap in May 2016.
‘Politically motivated'
Now she accuses Mr Lutsenko and other allies of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko of trying to silence criticism and distract public attention from their broken promises ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections next year.
While calling the allegations against her politically motivated, she also urged Ukrainians to “overthrow the criminal authorities of Poroshenko”.
“Now there are many servicemen who hear me, who agree that a military coup in Ukraine is a quite expected and probably quite correct event,” she said.
Ms Savchenko says Ukraine's leaders are at least partly culpable for Moscow's annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the deaths of more than 10,300 people in a four-year war between government troops and Russian-led separatists in eastern Ukraine.
She also accused fellow deputy Serhiy Pashinskyi of leading snipers into a hotel overlooking Kiev's Maidan square before dozens of protesters were shot dead there on the bloodiest day of Ukraine's 2014 revolution, and said Mr Lutsenko was covering up the truth of the massacre.
“I now I call on Ukrainians – if you understand that if now you fail to defend your right to life, your freedom, then you will live worse than under the terrorist, totalitarian Russian regime,” she said.
“I'm not scared . . . Fighting for truth, it is never scary to live or die.”
Ms Savchenko made her allegations after being questioned as a witness in another case that has left Ukrainians unsure of what and whom to believe.
Volodymyr Ruban, who has been hailed for negotiating prisoner exchanges between government and separatist forces, was arrested this month in a van carrying a hidden cache of weapons. He is accused of planning to use them to kill Mr Poroshenko and other top officials. Mr Ruban denies the allegations.
Global Grind
Matt Barnes is taking off his basketball shorts and trading them in for a nice pair of eggplant sweats, as he announced his official retirement from the NBA just a couple hours ago on Instagram.
“Had a cool 15yr run!! Traveled the world met alota cool people, some will be brothers for the rest of my life! BUT NOW…. You're telling me I can dress like this for business meetings & make more money off the court than I made ON?? & spend more time with my kids??!!,” he wrote to his followers before giving middle fingers to those who said he'd never make anything of himself.
It was a very Matt Barnes way to do things and social media had an immediate reaction. See what everybody had to say about his announcement on the flip.

Bookmakers have slashed the odds on Aston Villa continuing their downwards spiral into League One.
The sacking of Steve Round has prompted the bookies to adjust their odds of a Villa relegation in the coming season.
Oddschecker are reporting that Villa's odds have plummeted from 20/1 to just 5/1 to end up in the third tier of English football.
The current odds are here and they indicate that the bookies believe Villa are in for a tough season ahead.
They do however offer odds of as low as 4/1 to be promoted.
Both sets of odds highlight the unpredictable state of affairs at the club since last season.
Oddschecker spokesman George Elek: “Aston Villa are in turmoil. Their owner appears to want to sink with the ship rather than look for help.
"We've seen this happen over the years with the likes of Portsmouth and Blackpool, so it is a real possibility they could be doomed for relegation.”
Sacked
Steve Round was today sacked as technical director at Aston Villa by owner Tony Xia.
The club chairman decided to give Round the boot as preparations for next season begin.
Round was told this morning at Bodymoor Heath and it came as a shock, according to sources.
With CEO Keith Wyness leaving last month - and still no replacement lined up - Villa are now desperately short on senior figures with football experience.
The position of boss Steve Bruce is uncertain, too.
He will take the group out to Portugal tomorrow for a warm-weather training camp following their return to pre-season training yesterday.
It's understood that he will now adopt an old-school approach to transfers, targeting his own men, rather than liaising with Round, or any other sporting director for that matter.
Of course this is nothing new to him. He worked this way at his former clubs and will have no problems returning to that way, should he stay at Villa.
poll loading Are Aston Villa right to get rid of Steve Round? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
Bruce and Round got on well and enjoyed a good working relationship. There were never any signs that the manager struggled working under his first ever technical director, either.
The boss also had a certain amount of freedom to track the players he felt were right for the team, rather than just taking advice from the recruitment team.
Xia, meanwhile, has no plans to replace Round and will therefore leave the position vacant.
Outside investment could change the outlook depending on what the potential new board members want for the future.

The scouting department still remains staffed so Bruce will have trusted experts to turn to in the times ahead.
Club secretary Sharon Barnhurst will also provide support with incomings and outgoings over the summer.
But Villa need to sell before they can buy and will only be looking for freebies and loan signings in the weeks ahead.
'It's worse than Randy Lerner' - angry Aston Villa fans react to Steve Round departure
More Villa news
Aston Villa are in a tussle with West Bromwich Albion and Bristol City for the signature of David McGoldrick, according to reports .
McGoldrick, 30, is a Republic of Ireland international who has left Ipswich Town upon the expiry of his contract this summer.
The forward had been at Portman Road for the last five years and has also previously had spells with Southampton, Nottingham Forest and Coventry City.
Villa, who haven't done any business as of yet this summer because of financial problems that have crippled the club, are supposedly keen on McGoldrick, who is available on a free transfer.
Neighbours Albion and Lee Johnson's Bristol City have also been credited with an interest.
McGoldrick averages roughly one goal every four matches in his playing career.
Takeover latest
Tony Xia has knocked back another offer for a share of the control at Aston Villa.
It can be revealed that an American group bid £30m for 30 per-cent of the club last month - but it was flat-out rejected.
BirminghamLive understands that representatives from the group visited Villa Park and were hoping to play a part in rebuilding the club.
But despite looking for outside investment - and receiving an offer that matched his financial demands - Xia still turned it down.
That's now two serious bids rejected by the Chinese businessman.
Last week we revealed that an offer from a European group for 51 per-cent of control was also rejected.
It's understood that another consortium - who have been linked with a move for Villa before - also met with the current management team consisting of chief commercial officer Luke Organ and others last week.
There has been no formal offer, though.
It's understood that the American group, who placed a bid for 30 per-cent, were confident of getting the go-ahead.
They were also willing to discuss a potential takeover and offered up the promise of another £15m should promotion be achieved in two years.
Of course there were some proposals of their own.
One of those was to sell star performer Jack Grealish for no less than £40m - and use all of the incoming funds as operating capital.
They understand that the 22-year-old is the club's prized asset and actually want to keep him on board next season, but losing him for an exorbitant fee wouldn't be the worse thing to happen if the interest was there.
Xia, however - through his Villa Park representatives - declined the first offer, and that was as far as it got.
They haven't given up hope, though, and are expected to return with another offer later this week.
Meanwhile, as reported by BirminghamLive last week, two other parties remain keen.
They both have the funds available to invest heavily and continue to support the club in the quest for a return to the Premier League, however new owners would have to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations.
They are now in the process of drawing up their offers.
NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein was indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said Wednesday's indictment brings Weinstein "another step closer to accountability" for alleged attacks on two women in New York.
Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he would "vigorously defend" against the indictment and ask a court to dismiss it. He called the allegations "unsupported" and reiterated that Weinstein strongly denies them.
The indictment came hours after Weinstein's lawyer said the film producer would decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare him and "political pressure" made an indictment unavoidable.

"Regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein," the statement said.
Weinstein, 66, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself on Friday, according to his lawyers. Brafman said that with a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon for Weinstein to testify or not, prosecutors denied his request for more time.
Vance said the Weinstein camp's "recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable."
"We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand," Vance said in a statement.
Weinstein was charged Friday with raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act by compelling oral sex from another. A grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case, as it had been doing for weeks.
Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons.
Freed on $1 million bail and electronic monitoring, he is due back in court July 30, though that date may now be moved up in light of the indictment.
Beyond the two women involved in the case, dozens more women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales.
He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and Brafman said Tuesday that Weinstein was "confident he's going to clear his name" in the New York prosecution.
Brafman called the rape allegation "absurd," saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that began before and continued after the alleged 2013 attack.
The woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators that Weinstein confined her in a hotel room and raped her.
The other accuser in the case, former actress Lucia Evans, has gone public with her account of Weinstein forcing her to perform oral sex at his office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.
Vance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped her during a meeting.
Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded herself confronting Weinstein and him apologizing for his conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter.

Indulging on a glass or two of wine with dinner can lower one's risk of dying from all causes and especially from cardiovascular disease, a new study has found.
But heavy drinkers increase their risk of mortality, the study by the American College of Cardiology warned.
The study comes on the heels of a report that said moderate-to-heavy drinkers are more likely to live to the age of 85 without dementia, according to the Daily Mail.

While alcoholism and excessive drinking has been linked to a host of health issues, recent studies are proving the benefits of enjoying moderate amounts of alcohol.
The ACA's study said adults who drink moderate amounts of alcohol reduce their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease specifically.
"Our research shows that light-to-moderate drinking might have some protective effects against cardiovascular disease, while heavy drinking can lead to death," the study's lead author, Bo Xi, said.
He added: "A delicate balance exists between the beneficial and detrimental effects of alcohol consumption, which should be stressed to consumers and patients."
Researchers observed 333,247 patients from 1997 to 2009 for the study. The participants were asked about their alcohol consumption habits.
Alcohol consumption was divided into six potential categories: lifetime abstainers, lifetime infrequent drinkers, former drinkers, current light drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers.
Current light drinkers had less than three drinks a week.
Moderate drinking is defined as having more than three drinks and less than 14 drinks for males or more than three and less than seven for females.
Heavy male drinkers had more than 14 drinks a week while heavy female drinkers had more than seven.
Throughout the duration of the study, 34,754 of the participants died. About 9,000 died from cardiovascular disease and about 85,000 died from cancer.
The study found that moderate male drinkers had a 13 per cent decreased risk of all-cause mortality and moderate female drinkers had a 25 per cent decreased risk.
Similarly, moderate drinkers decreased their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by 21 percent for men and 34 percent for women. The statistics were similar for light drinkers, the study said.
The report found that heavy drinkers were 25 percent more likely to die than non-heavy drinkers. They were also 67 percent more likely to die from cancer. These increases were not observed in the female participants.
NEW YORK (AP) — Comedy Central's Jordan Klepper is planning a slumber party for young activists pushing for action on gun control
Klepper plans to host Thursday's episode of his show, "The Opposition," from a living room of a private home in Bethesda, Maryland. That's where young people are gathering in preparation for Saturday's March For Our Lives on Washington to oppose gun violence.
Klepper took special interest in the issue even before he began hosting the show last fall. He did several stories on gun control when he was part of "The Daily Show."
He plans to stay in character, as a right-wing conspiracy theorist, as he interviews the activists. His show airs at 11:30 p.m. Eastern.
[Noozhawk's note: This article is part of Day 8 in Noozhawk's 12-day, six-week special investigative series, Prescription for Abuse. Related links are below.]
Despite the walls put up by regulators to limit prescription drug abuse, those barriers are often just porous enough for a steady supply of opiates to end up on the street.
Lisa W., a former drug addict who recently completed treatment at the Santa Barbara Rescue Mission's Bethel House, says she visited dozens of practitioners to get the prescriptions needed to fill her habit.
“(My husband and I) went from my main doctor to a pain management doctor to a psychiatrist for things like the ativans and the ‘benzos,' and then shopped to another pain management doctor, to every ER in Santa Barbara County to every Urgent Care in Santa Barbara County,” she told Noozhawk on condition of anonymity.
“As long as I looked presentable, I never had any problems.”
| Prescription for Abuse | Complete Series Index |
When that option is exhausted, said all of the addicts Noozhawk interviewed for this Prescription for Abuse series, they were able to sustain their drug habits by finding and purchasing prescription medications on the street.
Among them was Alicia, a former drug abuser now living in Los Alamos, who asked that her last name not be used. She told Noozhawk she purchased her drug of choice, Tramadol, from an online pharmacy that shipped from the East Coast after her local doctor stopped writing her more prescriptions.
A quick online search yields hundreds of such suppliers. The first Web site that comes up after a search for “Tramadol” requests that purchasers fill out a medical questionnaire and provide a credit-card number. Buyers are then asked to agree to the site's terms and conditions, one of which states that the purchaser has undergone an exam by a physician and has a prescription for the drug being ordered. Once Alicia began ordering online, she said no one from the supplier ever checked with her doctor about the authenticity of the prescription.
“There's no way for them to track whether you're getting a refill,” she said of the Web site operators. “They give you a bottle of 100, which should last two months, and it ends up lasting two weeks, and no one asks any questions.”
Tracking down doctors who overprescribe is a challenge, which Noozhawk discovered firsthand while investigating this series. Multiple sources — ranging from pharmacists, emergency-room doctors and law enforcement — pointed out one general practitioner who operates out of a Lower Eastside Santa Barbara storefront. According to these sources, the doctor consistently overprescribes pain medication.
Santa Barbara County civil court documents reveal a medical malpractice case and another case of negligence, both of which the physician settled. The Medical Board of California doesn't reveal complaints against doctors or whether an investigation is ongoing, so records for the Santa Barbara doctor yielded nothing. Only formal actions taken by the medical board are reported on its Web site, leaving little information available to consumers.
But local sources know there is more to the doctor than the licensing board will reveal.
One source, who contacted Noozhawk after the Prescription for Abuse series started, has an adult child who has received OxyContin and morphine from the Santa Barbara doctor without a legitimate medical condition to warrant the prescriptions.
“Huge amounts” were prescribed to the family member, the source said, and at least 10 emergency room visits have resulted because of overdoses. The source contacted the state medical board, local hospitals and pharmacies, and even federal authorities, but the physician is still practicing.
“He's ruined our lives,” the source said of the physician. “Somebody's gotta stop this.”
The state medical board is under increasing scrutiny after a report was issued last month by Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, which called on Gov. Jerry Brown to take action by disciplining dangerous doctors. (Scroll down for the full Public Citizen report.)
Public Citizen reported that the medical board has failed to take action against 710 physicians, all of whom were disciplined for wrongdoing between 1990 and 2010 by California hospitals, health maintenance organizations, ambulatory surgical centers and other health-care organizations. Of the 710 doctors, none of whom were named, 102 of them were designated by peer reviewers as an “immediate threat to health or safety” of patients, the watchdog group says.
A last line of defense is often pharmacists, who have the ability to refuse to fill a doctor's prescriptions if they believe he or she is overprescribing.
“We have the right to question a prescription,” according to Tim Connell, a CVS pharmacist in Lompoc. “We can lose our license and we are just as liable as anyone else.”
That's exactly what happened to a Ventura pharmacy owner who kept filling prescriptions from a doctor who was overprescribing to patients, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.
“There are definitely doctors that I won't prescribe for,” said Connell, including three doctors in Santa Barbara County who have been blacklisted from CVS.
Pharmacy workers are wary of another two, he said.
Prescriptions from outside Santa Barbara County also raise warnings locally. A group of doctors from Reseda recently set off alarm bells for Connell when he noticed that several morphine-based prescriptions, like Opana, come in large doses. A co-worker filled one prescription, and within a couple of hours, the store started getting phone calls for more prescriptions to be filled from the area.
When asked how to solve some of the issues prescription medications present, Connell was reflective.
“It's a tough one because people definitely have pain,” he said, but he added that there are alternatives.
There's only so much relief a person can get with an opiate, and Connell said he believes other options, like chiropractic care, aren't always pursued.
Prescribing anti-inflammatory drugs for pain instead of opiates is another route, he said. Doctors will sometimes prescribe Xanax as a muscle relaxer, but “there are so many muscle relaxers out there,” he said. “Why use one with addictive qualities and a high street value?”
“I think a lot of times they'll just listen to what the patient wants,” said Connell, adding that vigilance by pharmacies is also important.
“Doctor shopping” is also a way to get multiple prescriptions, and communication between physicians and hospital networks is almost nonexistent, Noozhawk found.
Although a state database monitors prescription drugs dispensed in California, people who are doctor-shopping for medications are still able to slip through. The Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, or CURES, allows a patient's treating physician to check prescription records if a problem is suspected. But that database isn't available to everyone, and authorities and health-care officials say the system has had limited success in the county as a gatekeeping measure.
Cottage Health System has its own database that is used by all three of its hospitals to track what is prescribed and when, according to Dr. Chris Lambert, director of its Frequent Opiate User Program. Lambert can see which patients have been flagged for frequent use and review records to see who needs to be placed on a restriction list. About 10 people per month are restricted, about half of whom aren't locals, he said.
The goal over the next year is to improve communications between health-care organizations. Efforts for a shared database were under way about a decade ago, but Lambert said worries about exchanging proprietary and confidential information hindered the move.
“We don't necessarily talk to each other as well as we could,” Lambert said. “A stumbling block all along has been the lack of a common database.”
Sansum Clinic also has its own database to track prescriptions, but it is specific only to the clinic's network, according to Sansum marketing director Jill Fonte.
“Due to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), it would not be appropriate for us to share this type of information with any other entity, especially if they were not involved in the care of the patient,” she said.

Public Citizen Report
Many of the changes that Peters has proposed could be workable, says Fran O'Sullivan.
What does Winston want? It's the question that has occupied the negotiating teams for National and Labour, who had their first meeting with New Zealand First's negotiating team this week.
It has also been occupying the business sector.
The policy agreements that are made between NZ First and the party which ultimately becomes the lead player in the next Government will have an impact on business settings.

But it is important not to become hysterical over the eventual deals. Business will adjust - as it always does - and get on with things. If policies are perceived as detrimental to various interests, there is always the ability to lobby Government to modify them.
Importantly, if Labour and the Greens had emerged with more than 50 per cent of the vote at the election, there would have been substantial change to a number of settings - among them immigration, environmental rules, the Reserve Bank Act and taxation.
Although National had to swallow some dead rats when Jim Bolger and Peters formed the first coalition Government, the former National Prime Minister said recently that it was workable.
Peters was Treasurer, and with the able assistance of former National Finance Minister Bill Birch, presented some relatively orthodox Budgets. It remains a pity that his superannuation initiative was scuttled. It was ahead of its time.
Likewise, Peters played a credible role as Foreign Minister in Helen Clark's Government, particularly in helping to restore working relations at a senior level with the United States.
Formal negotiations are expected to get under way after today's release of the results of the 384,000 special votes, two weeks on from the September 23 election. They comprise 15 per cent of the total vote, and Peters has said he wanted to see how they impacted on the final seat count for National, Labour and the minor parties before beginning talks.
Special votes have tended to favour left-wing parties. If the Labour-Greens bloc increases its total seats to 54 - as many pundits expect - that will leave it just two seats behind National on 56 seats.
Expect a pause in immigration. All parties want to limit immigration numbers. National went down that route prior to the election with a policy which raised the bar for migrants to New Zealand. This was later modified after firms and farmers pointed out how it would harm their own ability to conduct business.
Winston Peters wants to slice 60,000 off the 70,000 or so net migration increases. Winston Peters wants to slice 60,000 off the 70,000 or so net migration increases.
The big increase in net migrant numbers has put pressure on infrastructure and contributed to rising house prices. But it has also been a vote of confidence in the NZ economy.
Peters wants to slice 60,000 off the 70,000 or so net migration increases which have taken place annually in recent years.
This would be extreme. But there is room for some targeted Kiwi short-term visas to ensure business gets the skilled workers and labourers it needs without killing the golden goose.
Expect also a commitment to look at modifying the Reserve Bank Act.
Labour already wants to do this. Peters has been concerned about how persistently high exchange rates harm exporters returns. Coupled with an initiative for a special tax break for exporters, this could be welcomed by that sector.
It would be a step away from the orthodoxy of the past 30 years. But it will be on the table nevertheless.
He is also keen to deliver a regional development scheme for Northland.
Currently, this takes the form of a special economic zone in Northland; relocating Ports of Aucklands operations to Northport; and building a rail link to that port.
This legacy project is not really within the realm of either National or Labour to grant.
Ports of Auckland is owned by Auckland Council - not government. Northport is 50 per cent owned by Port of Tauranga.
It would require special legislation.
KiwiRail would have to be recapitalised to build the Northport rail link that Peters wants.
It is a transformational project but there are many fish-hooks that would have to be addressed before this has an even chance of getting out of the blocks. Particularly whether it is economically feasible.
Foreign investment is another major issue.
Both Labour and NZ First want to see a ban on foreigners buying residential houses in New Zealand.
Winston is keen to deliver a regional development scheme for Northland. Winston is keen to deliver a regional development scheme for Northland.
This is difficult to achieve given New Zealand's free trade agreements, which in some cases would be an impediment to legislative moves. But stamp duties could be applied.
Peters also wants to establish a foreign buyers register for land acquisitions. Again, this is not unreasonable and arguably should have happened years ago.
The final key issue is superannuation.
Peters has proposed a super Super Card - essentially combining a range of services including transport cards. This would be popular with superannuitants. He wants to restart payments to the NZ Super Fund and for the Government to stop taxing it.
Keeping the retirement age at 65 years might pose an issue (NZ really does need to start recognising the demographic imperative). But it would not pose a problem for any party wanting to achieve office.
There will no doubt be surprises when the new governing arrangements are unveiled.
But a good deal of what Peters has proposed is workable. Perhaps not at the extremes, but it is not going to collapse business or the economy.
MIAMI (AP) — A person familiar with the situation says NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan has a small stake in Derek Jeter's investment group that reached an agreement to buy the Miami Marlins.
The person confirmed Jordan's role to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Sunday because the parties involved have not commented.
Jordan already owns the NBA Charlotte Hornets. He and Jeter have known each other for more than 20 years and are close friends.
A signed $1.2 billion agreement was submitted Saturday to Major League Baseball for Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria to sell the franchise to a group that includes Jeter, the former New York Yankees captain. Venture capitalist Bruce Sherman of Naples, Florida would be the controlling owner.
The Marlins expect to close the deal in early October.

If you've ever wondered exactly what sorts of things Facebook would like you not to do on its service, you're in luck.
For the first time, the social network is publishing detailed guidelines to what does and doesn't belong on its service — 27 pages worth of them, in fact.
So please don't make credible violent threats or revel in sexual violence; promote terrorism or the poaching of endangered species; attempt to buy marijuana, sell firearms, or list prescription drug prices for sale; post instructions for self-injury; depict minors in a sexual context; or commit multiple homicides at different times or locations.
Facebook already banned most of these actions on its previous "community standards" page, which sketched out the company's standards in broad strokes. But on Tuesday it will spell out the sometimes gory details.
Advertisement
The updated community standards will mirror the rules its 7,600 moderators used to review questionable posts, then decide if they should be pulled off Facebook. And sometimes whether to call in the authorities.
The standards themselves aren't changing, but the details reveal some interesting tidbits.
Photos of breasts are OK in some cases — such as breastfeeding or in a painting — but not in others. The document details what counts as sexual exploitation of adults or minors, but leaves room to ban more forms of abuse, should it arise.
Since Facebook doesn't allow serial murders on its service, its new standards even define the term. Anyone who has committed two or more murders over "multiple incidents or locations" qualifies. But you're not banned if you've only committed a single homicide. It could have been self-defense, after all.
Reading through the guidelines gives you an idea of how difficult the jobs of Facebook moderators must be. These are people who have to read and watch objectionable material of every stripe and then make hard calls — deciding, for instance, if a video promotes eating disorders or merely seeks to help people. Or what crosses the line from joke to harassment, from theoretical musing to direct threats, and so on.
Moderators work in 40 languages. Facebook's goal is to respond to reports of questionable content within 24 hours. But the company says it doesn't impose quotas or time limits on the reviewers.
The company has made some high-profile mistakes over the years. For instance, human rights groups say Facebook has mounted an inadequate response to hate speech and the incitement of violence against Muslim minorities in Myanmar.
In 2016, Facebook backtracked after removing an iconic 1972 Associated Press photo featuring a screaming, naked girl running from a napalm attack in Vietnam. The company initially insisted it couldn't create an exception for that particular photograph of a nude child, but soon reversed itself, saying the photo had "global importance."
Monica Bickert, Facebook's head of product policy and counterterrorism, said the detailed public guidelines have been a long time in the works.
"I have been at this job five years and I wanted to do this that whole time," she said.
Bickert said Facebook's recent privacy travails, which forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify for 10 hours before Congress, didn't prompt their release now.
The policy is an evolving document, and Bickert said updates go out to the content reviewers every week.
Facebook hopes it will give people clarity if posts or videos they report aren't taken down.
Bickert said one challenge is having the same document guide vastly different "community standards" around the world. What passes as acceptable nudity in Norway may not pass in Uganda or the U.S.
There are more universal gray areas, too. For instance, what exactly counts as political protest? How can you know that the person in a photo agreed to have it posted on Facebook?
That latter question is the main reason for Facebook's nudity ban, Bickert said, since it's "hard to determine consent and age."
Even if the person agreed to be taped or photographed, for example, they may not have agreed to have their naked image posted on social media.
Facebook uses a combination of the human reviewers and artificial intelligence to weed out content that violates its policies. But its AI tools aren't close to the point where they could pinpoint subtle differences in context and history — not to mention shadings such as humor and satire — that would let them make judgments as accurate as those of humans.
And of course, humans make plenty of mistakes themselves.

VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) - Oil giant Chevron saw its NYSE-listed equity slip more than 6% on Friday after it reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.
The San Ramon, California-based energy company reported earnings of $3.1-billion, or $1.64 a share for the fourth quarter ended December, compared with just $415-million, or $0.22 a share in the comparable quarter of 2016.

The net profit included a $2.02-billion gain related to US tax reform and a non-cash charge of $190-million related to a former mining asset. Excluding these items, he companies earned adjusted profit of $0.72 a share, which was far below the $1.22 a share Wall Street analysts were expecting.
The top line, however, came in above expectations at $37.62-billion, compared with estimates for the period of $37.59-billion.

Chevron's upstream business, where the major produces oil and natural gas, rose some 469% year-on-year to $5.3-billion in the fourth quarter, from $930-million a year earlier, and were boosted by $3.3-billion related to the US tax reform.
Chevron also saw a 258% rise in its downstream segment, which includes refining crude oil into fuels such as petrol, to $1.3-billion for the quarter, up from $357-million from 2016. The downstream business also benefitted from a $1.16-billion boost from tax reform. However, the international downstream operations earned $84-million in fourth quarter - a 75% drop compared with $357-million a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was mainly attributable to lower margins on refined product sales.
For the full year 2017, Chevron reported profits of $9.2-billion, compared with a loss of $497-million in 2016. This reflected the company's strongest financial performance since the oil price started its catastrophic fall late in 2014.
Cash flow from operations was up 60% year-on year at $20.5-billion.
Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.74-million barrels a day in fourth quarter, compared with 2.67-million barrels a day from a year earlier. Net oil-equivalent production for the full year 2017 was 2.73-million barrels a day, compared with 2.59-million barrels a day from the prior year.
"We achieved our objective of being cash flow positive through deliberate actions to reduce capital expenditures, lower our cost structure, start and ramp-up projects, and conclude planned asset sales," chairperson and CEO Michael Wirth stated in a press release, adding that higher commodity prices helped as well.
On the back of an improved market outlook and strong cash flow, Chevron on Wednesday declared a $0.04 increase to its dividend from the prior quarter, lifting it to $1.12 a share.
Chevron's stock closed down 5.57% on Friday at $118.58 apiece, dragging the equity down 5.28% since the start of the year.
Iron Sulfate Heptahydrate Market: Overview
Sulfate compounds are salts or esters of sulfuric acid formed by replacing one or both of the hydrogen atoms with a metal atom. Iron Sulfate heptahydrate [iron (II) Sulfate] is also known as ferrous Sulfate heptahydrate. It is soluble in water and acids. It shows octahedral molecular geometry of iron. Unlike fluorides and oxides, most of the metallic Sulfate compounds are readily soluble in water. Iron Sulfate heptahydrate is produced during the manufacture of titanium dioxide from ilmenite.
Request Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=20819
Iron Sulfate heptahydrate is also known as copperas or green vitriol (blue-green heptahydrate). Sulfate is a co-product of the manufacturing process of titanium dioxide. Crystallization of hot Sulfate solution can also yield iron Sulfate heptahydrate, upon cooling. Iron Sulfate produced in this process is iron Sulfate heptahydrate (copperas) with free moisture content of at least 4%. Iron crystals in copperas tend to stick to one another, leading to the product becoming dusty. The acid liquid present in copperas tends to leach out and potentially attack the container in which copperas is stored. Iron Sulfate heptahydrate has iron content ranging from 18 weight% to 20 weight% and free acid content of 3 weight% at the maximum, based on the total weight of iron Sulfate heptahydrate. As discussed, in addition to iron, iron Sulfate heptahydrate also comprises an acidic compound such as sulfuric acid. The acidic compound is typically a result of the formation of iron Sulfate heptahydrate.
Iron Sulfate Heptahydrate Market: Dynamics and Trends
The hydrated form of iron Sulfate heptahydrate is used medically to treat iron deficiency and also for industrial applications. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a list of essential medicines. As per the list, iron Sulfate heptahydrate is one of the most important medicines required for basic health. Historically, iron sulfate heptahydrate was used in the textile industry as a textile dye fixative, to blacken leather, and also as a constituent of ink. Iron chlorosis affects the fruit cultivation to a great extent. Iron Sulfate heptahydrate is used to treat iron chlorosis.
Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/iron-sulfate-heptahydrate-market.html
More recently, iron Sulfate heptahydrate has been applied in the purification of water by flocculation and phosphate removal from municipal and industrial sewage. The compound prevents eutrophication of surface water bodies. The modified grade of iron Sulfate heptahydrate can be used to reduce Cr6+ (Chromium Ions) in the cement industry. It can, therefore, be used as an additive to the cement mixture. Additionally, it can be used as an iron supplier in the agriculture industry.

A TEEN used the trust he'd gained from a long-term friendship to rape a girl while she slept in her own home.
The boy - who was aged 17 at the time - was invited to the then 16-year-old girl's Currimundi home for a sleepover in March last year.
The pair slept next to each other in the lounge room on a double mattress with separate blankets.
In the early hours of the morning the teen - who can't be named - put two fingers inside the girl's vagina while she was sleeping.
She woke and said, "what the f--- are you doing?" before falling back asleep.
Undeterred, he then pulled the girl's underwear to the side and took photos of her genitals.
The flash from the camera woke her up again and her abuser quickly left.
By 10am that day, the teenage boy was being questioned by police and made full admissions.
He yesterday pleaded guilty in Maroochydore District Court to single counts of rape and recordings in breach of privacy of the genital region.
Although the teen was 17 at the time of the offence, he was sentenced as an adult.
The court heard the pair had been friends for six or seven years and met when his family had moved from South Africa to Australia.
The teen had also hoped to become a police officer upon graduating Year 12, but now had to consider doing a trade instead.
Judge John Robertson sentenced the teen to 12 months' imprisonment for the rape, suspended immediately for 18 months and 18 months' probation for taking the photos.
No convictions were recorded.
The Los Angeles Rams took everyone surprise in 2017 by winning 11 games and earning a spot in the playoffs as NFC West champions. After going 4-12 in 2016 and ranking dead last in points scored, no one expected Los Angeles to make that sort of jump.
With a first-place schedule upcoming in 2018 and the 49ers looking like legitimate threats in the division, some wonder if the Rams will continue to improve or take a step back. At least one sportsbook in Vegas sees Los Angeles going the opposite direction.
The Rams' win total is set at 9.5 next season, which every fan hopes they'll surpass.

All things considered, 9.5 seems low for the Rams. Sure, there's a chance they're finally bitten by the injury bug, or that Jared Goff takes a step back in Year 3, but it's really hard to imagine Los Angeles winning just nine games next season.
When we ran through the 2018 schedule, we had them going 12-4 and winning the NFC West. Nothing is given in the NFL and absolutely anything can happen, but after seeing the Rams improve dramatically on defense this offseason, there's very little chance they finish with nine or fewer wins.

Shinzo Abe eradicates last hawks from the Bank of Japan
Cruise and Maritime Voyages welcomed their new flagship Columbus into their fleet last Thursday, at a glittering naming ceremony at the London Cruise Terminal in Tilbury.
The 64,000 tonnes ship will carry up to 1400 people and will be cruising year round from London – Tilbury. The cruise industry saw nearly 1.9 million people sail from a UK port last year and now with the arrival of Columbus, a new cruise ship for Britain, this is set to grow even further.
The Godmother to Columbus, who named the ship at the ceremony, is TV personality Angela Rippon CBE. Whilst naming the ship, within the splendid Palladium show lounge, she told a delighted audience of the media, travel trade and VIP customers “I look forward to offering Columbus the same respect as my own godchildren.” Angela reminded the audience that Columbus discovered the New World of America on the 12th October 1492. “12th October is my birthday” she said.
Chris Coates, Commercial Director at CMV said “When we introduced Magellan to our fleet just over two years ago, I suggested that it would be a game changer for us. Indeed it has been, and now we begin a new chapter as we proudly introduce our new flagship, Columbus, enabling us to respond to growing customer demand for traditional style cruising on board mid-sized cruise ships. The arrival of Columbus means we are on course to carry 100,000 passengers in 2018 cruising from the UK, which is 10% of the market.”
Mr Coates also announced that “Thanks to the support of our travel trade partners, we have sold over 95% of our 2017 Columbus cruise programme and an incredible 40% of 2018 capacity. Our Buy One, Get One Free deals offer the best possible value and our customers recognise that it pays to book early.”
Columbus set sail from the London Cruise Terminal at Tilbury yesterday, Sunday 11th June, on her maiden three night cruises to Amsterdam and Antwerp. In glorious sunshine, a brass band and confetti cannons bid her bon voyage! The season continues with cruises to the Norwegian Fjords, British Isles, Iceland, Baltic Cities, Canary Islands & Madeira, Scottish Highlights & Faroes, Spain, Portugal, France & Gibraltar and a spectacular 46 night voyages to Cuba, Central America & the Caribbean.

Like most people, I hate flying. But unlike most, it's not the altitude or the fear of crashing that makes me spiral. You probably know where I'm going here: The thing I hate most is the negative effect it has on my skin. Planes make me feel incredibly dry and tight, and of course, there's always the inevitable post-flying breakout. Cabin pressure and a massive reduction in humidity levels basically suck everything nice in your (my) skin out of it—causing extreme dehydration and general dullness.
For years, I suffered silently, filing this among the millions of other “it is what it is” travel unpleasantries. It was only when I watched a woman, middle seat in coach, delicately apply a face mask mid-flight that I thought to myself: Why am I not as fearless as this woman? A lot of times, when people find out that I have an excessive in-flight beauty routine, they'll ask if I ever feel embarrassed or awkward pampering myself between strangers on planes. The answer is no. And anyway, I've never received a complaint from my neighbors about my tendency to turn my seat into a full mini-spa. Also, with the exception of spraying myself with a mist (we'll get to that later), most of my beauty steps are fairly noninvasive. The routine is all about pumping hydration into the skin, and if you're blemish-prone, moisturizing in a way that preventatively tends to spot. Here are the small-enough-to-get-through-security products I actually refuse to fly without.
When I'm flying, I sub in this Bioderma Micellar Water as a cleanser. I drop a few drops onto a cotton pad and wipe away at my face and neck—this basically allows me to take the initial airplane and airport grime off of my face. It's also really hydrating and soothing, creating a nice, clean base.

Right after I clean my face with the Bioderma, I pat in (important) a few drops of my SK-II essence all around my face. You guys know I can't live without my SK-II essence—I got a miniature one from their travel set that has become an in-flight staple for me. This provides my skin with the perfect layer of moisture and soothing to combat the super-dry plane. If this product is (understandably) too expensive, substitute it for the Cosrx Snail Mucin Serum.

I don't tend to follow my traditional evening or night routine when I'm on a flight, so I avoid my straight blemish or vitamin-C serums and focus more on soothing and hydrating. I typically do that with snail and aloe-vera masks—both of which work wonders for deep hydrating, healing, and calming anything angry (including acne). Be shameless with this—usually, people are too polite to stare, and also you'd be surprised by how many people are familiar with sheet masks. Typical sheet masks will tell you to keep them on for about 15 to 20 minutes, but when I'm on flights, I keep them on for about 45 minutes—my skin needs all the hydration it can get! When I take this mask off, I'll pat any of the excess treatment into my skin.
BUY: My Beauty Diary Mask
$20, Amazon
When my skin starts to feel a little dry again post-masking, I take two to three drops of this on my palm and pat it into my face. A friend of mine recently raved about this product to me, and I'm so happy I finally decided to give it a try. I've incorporated this oil into my everyday routine, but it's extra incredible on flights. This oil is incredibly nourishing and hydrating, and I've personally seen it work wonders on any blemishes or generally irritated skin. I also love how glowy this leaves my skin looking. A new Holy Grail of mine!

About an hour before landing, I'll throw on these eye patches from Skyn Iceland. These are my new favorites—they help hydrate and bring circulation to my under-eye bags, which are always worsened on long-haul flights. Using them close to when I'm about to get off the plane is important to me, as it allows me to feel more awake and alert when I'm touching down. It can be tricky to feel like a normal person when you get off of a plane—this helps me mentally prepare for my post-plane day.
BUY: Travel Size Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels
$23, Amazon
Seconds before I'm about to get off of the plane, I'll give myself a spritz of this Oxygenating Spray from Lumion. I randomly got sent this product and didn't think much about it. But when I ran out of my Tatcha Dewy Mist, I decided to give it a try and was really impressed with the results. This gives a really nice boost of hydration, and essentially just breathes life back into your skin. I also use this daily to hydrate my face before I apply makeup, dampen my beauty blender, or set my makeup. This mist has a tendency to spray a lot of liquid seemingly out of nowhere, so be mindful of that when using it in the middle seat. I like to lean over when I spray it, so I don't splash my neighbors.
BUY: Lumion Oxygenating Skin Mist
$28, Amazon
In general, I'm a bit of a Chap Stick fiend, but I go really in on my usage when I'm flying. I hate the feeling of dry, chapped lips, and this lip balm from Tata Harper, which I randomly tried, has become one of my favorite heavy-duty Chap Sticks.

THREE new police officers, fresh from the academy, are set to start their first shifts in Bundaberg this week after the station welcomed them with open arms.
Constables Cameron Bass, Maddy Strohfelde and Hayden Busk will be stationed in the district for 12 months to gain on-the-job training and mentoring.
Yesterday morning Acting Inspector Glenn Cameron said having more officers in the region was always a bonus.
"The enthusiasm that the new police bring rubs off on the station, so we're always willing to take on and welcome more police officers," he said.
The three new officers will work directly with field training officers in conducting general duties as well as responding to 000 calls.
NEW TRAINEES: David Batt MP, constables Hayden Busk, Maddy Strohfelde and Cameron Bass and Acting Inspector Glenn Cameron. Sarah Steger
Act Insp Cameron said the officers would also be exposed to crime scenes, detectives, the Bargara station and other special areas like the road policing unit.
"It's important to have the on-the-job training because the first seven months (at police academy) are mostly theory and scenario-based training," he said.
"This is the first opportunity that they'll get to put that training into play in a real life situation."
Originally from the Gold Coast hinterland, first year Constable Cameron Bass said while he was both nervous and excited to start working as an operational police officer, he wanted to be a role model for the younger generations.
"I was fortunate enough when I was younger to know quite a number of police officers and they were always really good role models ... and that inspired me to try and follow in their footsteps and hopefully inspire some other young people eventually as well," he said.

The influx of three fresh officers is the first arrival of new uniformed officers in the district in 18 months, according to State Member for Bundaberg David Batt.
"These officers will learn a lot in Bundaberg and hopefully they'll stay and become permanent officers here," he said.
Eager to learn, former Rockhampton resident Constable Hayden Busk said he had "always had a passion for helping people" and wanted to bring his best to the community.
He said in terms of the future, working in the dog squad had always interested him, but that he was keen to explore all areas before deciding on a career path.
Constable Maddy Strohfelde, born in Bundaberg but from Yeppoon, said she was more interested in the Criminal In-
vestigation Branch as a potential next step. "I've always just wanted to help out the community," she said.

KOLKATA (miningweekly.com) – On the directive of the Power Ministry, Coal India Limited (CIL) will supply 1.4-million tons a day to all thermal power plants across the country, even as federal and state governments joust over whether the domestic power sector is facing a dry fuel shortage or not.
Soon after taking charge, new CIL chairperson Anil Kumar Jha said that the Power Ministry had set a daily supply level to ensure that every thermal power plant was carrying 22 days consumption of coal – the normative stock as laid down in standard operating procedures.

Owing to past issues, coal stocks had fallen to critical levels. However, CIL's daily supplies of 1.4-million tons would enable power plants to increase stock, but they would have to make timely bookings as per their fuel supply agreements. He said that the general practice of minimising fuel inventories to check cash flow was not prudent in the case of bulk fuel consuming industries.
As reported earlier by Mining Weekly Online, according to data sourced from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), on April 22, thermal power plants with aggregating generation capacity of 140 065 MW had coal stocks of 15.01-million tons, equivalent to about nine days' consumption, against a normative stock requirement of 22 days set by CEA.

However, even as private and public thermal power companies report a sharp fall in coal stocks, the Coal Ministry has denied that there is a coal shortage in the country.
The Ministry maintains that all government-operated thermal power companies are being allocated coal above their requirement to meet the rising power demand while private thermal power companies are being allocated coal as per their “contractual agreement”.
The placation of private thermal power companies from the Ministry comes in the wake of government's decision to make “out of turn coal allocation to government thermal power plant”, which private power companies have labelled as “discriminatory and a distortion of a level playing ground based on ownership of the power generation plants”.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to the Prime Minister, seeking his intervention to ensure that CIL will offer additional railway rakes for the transportation of coal to thermal power plants in the Delhi region, as the Indian capital is facing acute shortage of power as a result of lower coal stock.
The newly elected Karnataka Chief Minister, H D Kumaraswami, has also communicated to the Prime Minister warning of the coal shortages being faced by three power plant in his state, which currently have coal stocks to operate for 15 days.
Ronda Rousey recently spoke with The Kingston Whig-Standard at this link. Below are highlights from the interview:
Learning a new skillset for pro wrestling and how that has been humbling, motivating:
"Mastering new skills is one of the things that motivates me the most. At first I related it a lot to (movie) stunt work and fight choreography. The more that I get into everything, though they're very related, it is completely different."
"I'm completely amazed at what these athletes are really able to do, not just physically, but mentally. They can make up these entire matches by just talking to each other about it for five minutes -- and they barely do anything physical to each other -- and then they just walk out and put on these incredible matches. If we were to film the exact same thing for a movie, it would have to have been drilled for six weeks straight and probably have taken about three different takes before we even got one good one. I'm just blown away every day at what everybody in this business is capable of."
"I'm trying my best to learn. I pride myself on being a great student, but of course it also takes time and it's hard to learn something from scratch with the whole world watching."
Just a matter of time before she becomes a dominant force in WWE:
"I really believe that if and when I apply everything that I have to this industry, I feel like I can be an asset. I'm trying my absolute best and that's the best I can do and the best that I can do could change the world sometimes. We'll see what this does."
WWE's faith in her, teaming with WWE Hall of Famer Kurt Angle to face Triple H and Stephanie McMahon at WrestleMania 34:
"I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity. To be honest, sometimes I can't believe my own life and the stuff that is happening. I really feel like I'm investing every bit of myself into this and I really feel like the company is matching my effort in every way."
"If I'm pouring every ounce of energy I have into this being a success and they're doing everything they can to set me up for success, all I can do is go out there and prove them right for believing in me. Yeah, it's a lot of pressure and probably a crazy and unrealistic amount of pressure to put on someone for their first match ever, but you know what, if anyone in the world can handle it, I believe it can be me."

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) – A teenager has killed a mountain lion on a hunting trip in western Iowa.
17-year-old Jacob Altena of Rock Rapids was hunting deer Saturday about a half-mile west of Akron when he encountered the animal.
The mountain lion is believed to be the sixth killed in Iowa in recent history. Five previous kills have been reported to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The DNR says there have been three confirmed mountain lion sightings in Iowa in 2017.
Mountain lions generally come from western South Dakota and Nebraska, which both have natural populations. The animals are uncommon in Iowa.
They are not listed as a furbearer and have no protected status in Iowa.

HARTFORD, Wis. (WJBF) — One year ago this week, Augusta's Wesley Bryan was coming off his first-ever PGA Tour start, a 58th place finish at the FedEx St. Jude Classic, and getting set for a Web.com Tour start at the Nashville Golf Open.
This year, he's preparing to make his major championship debut at the U.S. Open after becoming the first South Carolinian to win his home state's RBC Heritage in April.
“To be able to get my first win on Easter Sunday in my home state was something I'll never forget,” Bryan said. “I'll go down as the first South Carolinian to win it and that's just a tremendous honor. It's a tournament I grew up going to as a kid, so to be able to win there was really special.”
With the victory, Bryan earned a tour exemption through the 2018-19 season and an invitation to the 2018 Masters.
“I'll be able to sleep in my own bed and drive about three miles to the front gate,” Bryan said. “To be able to play in a Masters tournament is something I never really could have dreamed of, but I'm definitely looking forward to it.”
First though, Bryan will try to become the first player to win their debut at the U.S. Open since Francis Ouimet did it more than a century ago in 1913.
“It's just another golf tournament,” Bryan said. “But, it's going to be a little more challenging than your average week on tour.”
Bryan tees off at 2:14 p.m. ET on Thursday.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Brazil's former President Dilma Rousseff has praised the BRICS club of emerging powers as a key achievement of this century, in an interview with Sputnik.
Brazil, Russia, India, and China held the group's first summit in 2009 and were joined by South Africa the following year. Together they account for over one third of the world's population and a significant portion of the total output in goods and services.
“There are countries with a large population, vast territories and ample riches. They showed up and created large space for action as never seen before. I think the emergence of BRICS was one of the fundamental events of the 21st century,” Rousseff said.
Brazil's impeached president called BRICs the proof that a multipolar world could exist at a time when the United States tried to force its will on the entire region and treated Latin America as its “backyard.”
She also accused the administration of sitting President Michel Temer who took over in summer 2016 of blindly following orders of US President Donald Trump.

The death toll from the devastating tower block fire in west London is expected to rise as investigators trawl through the wreckage in the search for other victims.
At least 12 people have died after the huge fire destroyed Grenfell Tower in London, where flames could still be seen burning almost 24 hours after the blaze started yesterday.
Prime Minister Theresa May has promised a "proper investigation" after the fire tore through the 24-storey building amid growing concerns about how the fire could have spread so rapidly.
Speaking in Downing Street, May said: "When it's possible to identify the cause of this fire, then of course there will be proper investigation and if there are any lessons to be learnt they will be and action will be taken."
Many people are unaccounted for and firefighters are continuing to tackle "pockets of fire", with the operation now in the "recovery phase".
Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan Police said: "This is going to be a long and complex recovery operation and I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase beyond those 12."
Residents' groups have claimed they voiced concerns about the safety of the building, which had been recently refurbished, while those who escaped complained their fire alarms had not been set off by the blaze.
Policing and Fire minister Nick Hurd said emergency checks would be carried out on tower blocks undergoing similar renovations.
Kensington and Chelsea Council admitted it had received complaints over the works after an action group said its warnings about safety had fallen on deaf ears.
A blog post from Grenfell Action Group in November said "only a catastrophic event" would expose residents' concerns.
The group said there was one entry and exit to the tower during improvement works and it had issues with evacuation procedures.
Concerns had also been raised about exposed gas pipes weeks before the blaze.
Rydon Group, which that carried out the refurbishment, said the project "met all required building regulations".
But a line stating the project had met all "fire regulation and health and safety standards", which was included in an earlier release, had disappeared.
Witnesses described hearing screams for help from people trapped on the upper floors of the block as flames engulfed the building, which contains 120 flats thought to be home to between 400 and 600 people.
Children and a baby were seen being thrown out of the windows to be caught by emergency workers and members of the public below.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The circumference of the Earth at the equator is 24,901 miles. My family and I traveled a distance a tad more than that over the last two weeks to Cape Town and other cities and towns in South Africa, along with a five-day visit to Dubai.
Our odyssey began a few months ago when my wife Katie asked me how I felt about visiting South Africa over the holidays. To this day, she can't recall the origin of the idea to visit South Africa or, for me, why my instantaneous response to her question was, “sure, why not, sounds fun.”
It was less than a week later when I got a follow-up question from Katie: “Any interest in spending a few days in the Persian Gulf, too?” Since most flights between Boston and South Africa connect through Dubai, my wife proposed compelling logic in combining these two disparate destinations.
To their credit, our two teenagers, Zack and Cammy, were as eager for exploration as my wife and I.
So, two weeks ago we boarded an Emirates Airlines flight at Logan and landed in South Africa some 28 hours later. After a day in Cape Town, we traveled north to a conservation game reserve for three days of photo safari, which was amazing.
Twice a day we traveled with a licensed guide over thousands of acres of protected land, where we saw lions, elephants, zebras, rhinos and dozens of other species, all roaming the open spaces. We also saw one of the fewer than 7,000 cheetahs left in the world.
Seeing thousands of these beautiful animals in a natural habitat makes it hard to understand the mindset of “trophy hunters” who derive joy from killing these animals just for sport. Gandhi was right: “The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”
Friends shouldn't encourage friends to trophy hunt – not just for the sake of the animals, but for how that impulse defines us and calibrates our overall humanity. I can't imagine a person spending 30 minutes watching the living connection between a mother zebra and her 2-month-old baby, like we did, and not being repulsed by the thought of someone shooting either animal just for fun.
Another experience in South Africa relates to the country's deep-rooted history with slavery. We visited The Slave Lodge in Cape Town, a museum within the building to the 1600s, where slaves were bought, sold and housed.
It was a solemn and somber experience to be in the same place where tens of thousands of people were dehumanized and devalued in what became an import/export hub of human suffering. I left The Slave Lodge with a greater understanding of this element of history, along with a deeper empathy and sensitivity for the many issues relating to race, in South Africa and in the United States, that remain today.
The contrast was stark in Dubai, which in just 30 years has grown from a small desert outpost into one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Everything in Dubai is the biggest or best.
Fueled by, well, fuel (oil), Dubai boasts a roaring economy with all the iconic features; world's best airport, world's tallest building, new skyscrapers and epic infrastructure popping up daily.
Around the clock, the roads of Dubai are seemingly jammed with Rolls Royces, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, all racing to a marina filled with a flotilla of the grandest yachts in the world. With shopping malls that feature shark-filled aquariums, ski slopes and ice skating rinks, Dubai is the epicenter of consumerism.
Though we've felt safer here in Dubai than in many areas of New York City, it's still a bit disconcerting to look at a map and see that Iran is less than 100 miles away.
Within just a few hundred miles in all directions, actually, Dubai is surrounded by some very rough neighbors that are home to some of the most horrific, violent and sad stories of this century. But, to date and by outward appearance, Dubai's powerful economic system keeps itself well-insulated against the geo-political problems of the region.
Now I'm happy to be heading home to Maine. I'm also grateful for this experience over the last couple of weeks to visit two very different, and very special places – with new friendships and lessons learned along the way.
While the speed and scope of global economics continue to pull us all closer together, with both force and opportunity, dark forces of global ignorance threaten to keep pushing us apart. We should all resist those forces through deeper understanding and greater empathy.

The Musso dual-cab ute will spearhead the Korean brand's return and will be joined by the Tivoli and Rexton SUVs.
The Musso dual-cab ute will spearhead the Korean brand's return and will be joined by the Tivoli and Rexton SUVs.
SSANGYONG has confirmed it will return to Australia late in 2018 after previous failures.
The Musso dual-cab ute will spearhead the Korean brand's return and will be joined by the Tivoli and Rexton SUVs.
Power for the Musso comes from a 2.2-litre four-cylinder turbo diesel (133kW/420Nm), matched to a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission turning all four wheels.
The workhorse is capable of towing 3.5 tonnes and carrying a one-tonne payload.
In the UK, Ssangyong backs its products with a five-year/unlimited kilometre warranty - which if applied to Australia would join the segment benchmark guarantee recently announced by Ford and Holden.
Complementing the dual-cab is the Rexton large off-roader. Built on the same underpinnings as the Musso, the Rexton will fit a similar profile to the Toyota Fortuner and Ford Everest, which fit a wagon body on a ute frame.

The third model in the maker's Australian plan is the Tivoli compact SUV. If it follows the same pricing model as overseas markets, it will undercut all competitors with a list price well below $20,000.
Ssangyong has not revealed too many details about its Australian relaunch but has said autonomous emergency braking and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will be used extensively throughout the range.
It plans to expand the range in 2019 with the mid-size Korando SUV that was previously sold in Australia.
However, Ssangyong will have to overcome its poor reputation in Australia, following past failures to crack the local new car market. The brand was known more for its awkward styling than its on-road prowess.
Ssangyong's previous dual-cab ute was maligned for its less than appealing styling. (Photo: Supplied)
The maker is now jumping into the most competitive new car market in the country. The perennial favourite utes - the Toyota HiLux and Ford Ranger - dominate the top end of the market while new cut-price Chinese players such as LDV and Great Wall struggle for sales.
Booming SUV sales are dominated by the longstanding badges. Cheaper alternatives are failing to become a feature on local roads as buyers head for known brands with a history of reliability.
Initial reports are optimistic but the rebound Korean brand brand faces an uphill battle to gain permanent status. Cheap alternatives unburdened by a poor reputation have already piqued buyer interest.
As a cost-effective and collaborative option, the open-plan office has become a major attraction for businesses, but if not planned correctly, can cause significant issues according to experts.
A recent study from Berkeley University in California found noise was the number one annoyance for 62 per cent of office workers.
UK-based member of the Institute of Acoustics Colin Rawlings said a poorly planned office could result in a significant decrease in staff productivity.
Rawlings said there were 15 to 20 per cent more people in the same space today compared with 10 years ago, but said it was possible to have an office that was aesthetic and acoustically well-planned.
"Open plan is here to stay because it's the most cost-effective way of getting the number of staff into a space," Rawlings said.
"If it's done properly it works well because you get more collaboration but it does have to be well planned."
Rawlings, who is also the technical director of UK firm Acoustics By Design, was in New Zealand last month with Kiwi company, Haworth by Europlan, in conjunction with Orangebox UK, giving seminars and advising companies on their work spaces.
Although open-plan was becoming extremely popular, Rawlings said aesthetics were often put ahead of acoustics with plans including lots of wood and glass and high ceilings which then echoed and ended up being distracting and noisy for staff.
A move towards agile working and having breakout spaces in offices was resolving this issue but Rawlings said there were other things that could be done to improve open-plan office use.
"The prediction is that by 2020 we're going to have four generations of staff working, and people of different ages work in different ways and want different things out of their office," Rawlings said.
"You have to have the different spaces for people to work but you also have to train and teach them to use those spaces so they're productive and aren't disturbing other people," he said.
Top Tips
• Plan the office with a space planner and in consultation with staff
• Create breakout spaces from private to semi-private to cater for different uses
• Use desk-dividing screens in between rows of desks to reduce the distance sound can travel
• Avoid big, open ceilings made of concrete, wood or glass and use suspended ceilings to avoid echoing
• Use acoustic tiles where necessary
• Consider sound-masking systems with white noise or pink noise which artificially raises background sound level

The 2019 model year marks the start of a new cycle for some of America's top trucks, led by redesigned pickups from Chevrolet and Ram. Ford's top-selling F-150 had updates in 2018, and more may be in the offing for 2019. Typically, Japanese truckmakers Nissan and Toyota aren't far behind with their own updates. Edmunds breaks down what you need to know about today's crop of full-size pickups.
2019 CHEVROLET SILVERADO
Arriving at dealers in the fall, the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado features a ground-up redesign that results in a longer, lighter pickup. Weight savings of around 450 pounds should pay dividends for fuel economy and acceleration.
The new Silverado offers a taller driving position and more room in crew-cab models. It also has the largest cargo box in its class and a power-lowering and -raising tailgate that's exclusive to the class.

The Silverado offers a variety of engines: a V6 (285 horsepower), a V8 (355 horsepower), a larger and stronger V8 (420 horsepower), and a turbocharged four-cylinder (310 horsepower). A six-cylinder diesel arrives in early 2019.
The Silverado's mechanical twin, the GMC Sierra, is also new and goes on sale in the fall. The 2019 Sierra will offer a more upscale interior than the Chevy, along with other exclusive features such as a carbon-fiber cargo box and enhanced technology. The MSRP for a 2019 Silverado crew cab ranges from $34,600 to $53,000.
2018 FORD F-150
Perennially the top-selling vehicle in America, the F-150 reigns supreme among full-size trucks. Multiple trims and configurations, four engine options, and remarkable capabilities make the F-150 a benchmark. Engines include a new base-level 3.3-liter V6 (290 horsepower), along with two turbo V6 options (325 horsepower or 375 horsepower), a V8 (395 horsepower) and a new diesel V6 (250 horsepower).
With towing capacity of up to 13,200 pounds and up to 25 mpg combined city/highway fuel economy, there's not much the F-150 can't do. There's even the bonkers 450-horsepower Raptor edition that can traverse broad swaths of off-road terrain without breaking a sweat. The MSRP for a 2018 F-150 crew cab ranges from $34,245 to $60,850. The 2019 F-150 is expected to be released later this summer.
2018 NISSAN TITAN
Built in Mississippi, the Titan is nearly as American as its domestic rivals despite its Japanese origins. The current Titan was redesigned for 2017 with a bold new look and a new XD model that splits the difference between the capabilities of regular half-ton and heavy-duty pickups. The Titan offers a single 390-horsepower V8 engine and can tow up to 9,740 pounds. The XD version comes with the same V8 or an optional diesel V8 that helps the truck tow up to 12,640 pounds.
The Titan's not our first choice among full-size pickups, but it's roomy and comfortable and it delivers legitimate capability at an attractive price. The MSRP for a 2018 Nissan Titan crew cab ranges from $35,930 to $56,800. The 2019 Nissan Titan arrives this fall.
2019 RAM 1500
Ram shook up the truck world a decade ago with a new rear suspension design that delivered sedan-like ride comfort without sacrificing capability. A refined, comfortable cabin and advanced tech features made its rivals look like archaic work trucks almost overnight. The rivals have since caught up, but the new Ram, thoroughly overhauled for 2019 and now on sale, continues to innovate.
A new frame and body design yield more room for rear passengers and reduce weight by about 200 pounds. The Ram's V8 engine (395 horsepower) returns with a revamped eight-speed transmission that makes more timely shifts. There's also a 3.6-liter V6 base engine that will be paired up with an electric-assist system for smoother power and acceleration and a maximum tow capacity of 12,750 pounds. Redesigned front seats, new technology features and an optional 12-inch infotainment display add to the Ram's winning streak of refinement. The MSRP for a 2019 Ram 1500 crew cab ranges from $34,495 to $56,495.
2018 TOYOTA TUNDRA
The Tundra has gone the longest of any in this group without a full redesign. It's still plenty capable, offering two V8 engines (310 horsepower and 381 horsepower), two body styles and three bed lengths. It can tow up to 10,200 pounds, carry a 1,730-pound payload and handle itself well off-road. The Tundra also is built in the U.S.
The aging Tundra could benefit from a diesel engine (increased towing strength), a smaller turbocharged V6 (better fuel economy) and a thorough technology update. Still, the Tundra has a charm for certain truck buyers. The MSRP for a 2018 Toyota Tundra crew cab ranges from $35,450 to $50,330. The 2019 model arrives in the fall.
EDMUNDS SAYS: With new designs from Chevrolet and Ram and further refinements to the venerable F-150, it's a great time for full-size truck shoppers. Most pickups offer similar capabilities, so look for such qualities as comfort and innovative technology to make a difference.

Senior United Nations officials, including the Organization's top humanitarian official as well as the head of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) have expressed “horror” at the recent attack on people evacuating from the besieged Syrian towns of Foah and Kefraya and underlined that civilians must be protected from any harm.
In a statement today, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stephen O'Brien, strongly condemned the violent act and reminded all parties to the conflict of their obligations under international law which expressly prohibits any harm on civilians.
“The perpetrators of such a monstrous and cowardly attack displayed a shameless disregard for human life,” said Mr. O'Brien.
“International humanitarian law is very clear: warring parties must protect civilians and distinguish between military and civilian targets,” he underscored.
In a separate statement, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake underscored that the attack must renew everyone's determination to reach all children throughout the war-ravaged country with support and relief.
“After six years of war and human carnage in Syria… six years of heartbreak for so many Syrian families… there comes a new horror that must break the heart of anyone who has one,” said Lake.
“A convoy of families who for so long had already known so much suffering … now the survivors must bear such a new and terrible loss,” he added.
According to reports, scores of people, including nearly 70 children were killed in the devastating explosion that hit the convoy of buses in which some 5,000 people were evacuating from Foah and Kefraya to Government-controlled areas yesterday.
The explosion occurred as the buses passed Rasheedin in western Aleppo.
In the aftermath of the attack, humanitarian organizations, including the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and UN partners, are providing assistance to the injured, including transferring them to hospitals.
The evacuation from the two besieged towns was a part of an agreement, popularly referred to as the “Four Towns” Agreement meant to facilitate humanitarian access to the people in need in those besieged towns. In addition to Foah and Kefraya in Idlib, the Agreement also includes Madaya and Zabadani in rural Damascus.
In his statement, O'Brien—also the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs—noted that while the organization was not involved in the agreement or evacuation process, it stands ready to scale up its support to evacuees.
“In that regard, I call on all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, and to facilitate safe and unimpeded access for the UN and its partners to bring life-saving help to those in need,” he said.

These are the "one test wonders" - and we celebrate them because for that one moment in their lives they were the best this country could produce for the international stage.
They are the conduit between those who go on to revered test careers… and the rest of us who toil at club or social level long after such dreams have passed.
Herald writers David Leggat, Chris Rattue, Cameron McMillan and Andrew Alderson give an insight into some of these men - they spoke to many of them and hear of their experience for better or worse, and how they feel looking through hindsight's lens.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — European businesses are unsettled as they watch the U.S. and China collide over trade. And for good reason: the nascent global trade war could represent the biggest single threat to the economic upswing that has helped the region get past its financial crisis.
In theory, some European companies could benefit, jumping into market niches if Chinese businesses are kept out of the U.S. market. But that would only be a few companies or sectors.
When your entire economy is heavily dependent on trade, an overall slowdown in global commerce caused by tit-for-tat import taxes provokes fear and undermines confidence.
And that's just what's happening in Europe. By one measure, business confidence has fallen in six of the past seven months in Germany, where exports are almost half of annual economic output.

"It's worth all our efforts to defuse this conflict, so it doesn't become a war," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday.
The U.S. is due to put tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday. The Chinese will respond with tariffs on an equivalent value of U.S. products such as soybeans, seafood and crude oil.
Amid all this, Europe has its own trade dispute with the U.S. After the U.S. put tariffs on steel and aluminum from many allies, including the European Union, the 28-country bloc responded with import taxes on some $3.25 billion of U.S. goods. The Trump administration is also studying the option of putting tariffs on cars, which would significantly escalate the confrontation.
The head of the EU's executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, will head to Washington in late July to try to personally persuade Trump against further measures targeting Europe.
The disputes over trade threaten to spoil the good times for Europe's economy.
Growth last year was the strongest in a decade, since before the global financial crisis. While that has eased in recent quarters, the economy is still strong enough to create jobs. The number of unemployed fell by 125,000 in May, leaving unemployment in the 19 countries that use the euro at 8.4 percent, the lowest since 2008 and down from a high of 12.1 percent in 2013.
"Trade tensions stoked by U.S. President Donald Trump are clouding the economic outlook in Europe," wrote analysts at Berenberg bank in London. They rated the trade risk ahead of troubles from Italy's heavy debt load or faster than expected interest rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Many European companies would suffer because they both produce and sell goods in the U.S. and China, the world's biggest economies.
For example, tariffs that China is expected to impose Friday on U.S.-made autos would hit German carmakers Daimler and BMW since they both make vehicles in the United States and export them to China.
Daimler has already lowered its outlook for profits, citing higher than expected costs from the new tariffs. BMW warned in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday that tariffs would make it harder for it to sell in China the vehicles it builds at its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, "potentially leading to a strongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States."
Last year, BMW exported 272,000 vehicles from the Spartanburg plant, more than half its total production. Of those, 81,000 — worth $2.37 billion — went to China. BMW says its exports reduced the U.S. trade deficit by around $1 billion.
By themselves, the tariffs that take effect Friday won't immediately have a dramatic impact on global trade. The fear is that retaliation will spiral, hitting the total amount of global commerce.
Even if the overall effect is to harm growth, there could be benefits for some European companies and sectors. Economists Alicia Garcia Herrero and Jianwei Xu at the French bank Natixis say that European makers of cars, aircraft, chemicals, computer chips and factory machinery could in theory snare market share by substituting for Chinese or American products in the two markets. But that's only if Europe's own trade dispute with the U.S. does not escalate — a big if.
Europe is waiting to see whether the Trump administration will go ahead separately with tariffs on auto imports. European companies like BMW, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen's Porsche and Audi divisions, and Fiat Chrysler send $46.6 billion worth of vehicles every year to the U.S. Some 13.3 million people, or 6.1 percent of the employed population of the EU, work in the automotive sector, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
"Europe cannot win anything" on an overall basis "for one obvious reason: we are net exporters," said Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis and a senior fellow at European research institute Bruegel. "But we should not understate the view that some sectors could get something out of a U.S.-China trade war."
Amid the brewing conflict, China has sought to get Europe on its side, putting on a diplomatic charm offensive during visits by Merkel and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The EU and China agreed last month to deepen commercial ties and support trade rules. But the EU remains a close, longtime ally of the U.S. on a range of issues, despite the current tensions with the Trump administration.
One negative outcome for Europe, Herrero said, would be if Trump can push the Chinese into a trade agreement aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The additional U.S. goods to China could come at the expense of European competitors.
"If China concedes to the U.S. proposed agreement, the whole situation faced by the EU would be much tougher," she and Xu wrote in a research note. "For China to massively reduce its trade surplus with the U.S., it has to in some ways substitute its imports away from the EU to the U.S., which would have a significant negative impact on the EU producers."

A damning report into a Dublin facility for people with disabilities suggests some residents were not consulted about do not resuscitate orders.
An unannounced inspection by Hiqa in January this year has detailed a litany of major non-compliances.
They include listing “going to bed” as community inclusion and attending a physio appointment as an “activity”.
Inspectors were not happy that action had been taken to address potential financial abuse.
There was not a paper trail to show that residents or their families were aware they had been identified as not to be resuscitated.

AS the Bundaberg Regional Council 2017-2018 Budget was handed down this morning, only one councillor made any objections.
Water and wastewater portfolio spokesman Jason Bartels said he could not support a budget with a general rates and services increase of 3.45%, as was his election commitment.
"I made a promise when elected not to support rate rises,” Cr Bartels said.
"This year we should have been the ones to show restraint ... we've gone too far.”
Cr Bartels said while he understood it was a balancing act and we all wanted to live in a community that was prospering, raising rates this year was not good for the community.
Mayor Jack Dempsey said he understood Cr Bartels dilemma but the budget was later adopted by the council.
Speaking after the meeting, Cr Bartels said "I campaigned on lower rates and I'll continue that stance”.
However now the budget has been adopted, he will show his support and get on with the job.

David Davis has provided an injury bulletin after suffering an untimely injury.
Davis hurt his knee in pre-season training at the Trillion Trophy Training Centre at Wast Hills on Monday.
Blues revealed the midfielder was undergoing surgery on the joint today - and the player himself has revealed the operation went well.
He also promised to return stronger and expressed his gratitude to Bluenoses who sent their best wishes.
Tweeting from his @Diggad1991 Twitter account, he wrote: "Op successful! Ill be back stronger than ever thanks for the messages of support means alot #kro."
A statement on the club website earlier today said: “The 27-year-old has been booked in for an operation today.
“Thereafter, the club will have a clearer picture of his required rehabilitation process and will update in due course.
“The misfortune is naturally major blow for Davis, who was looking in excellent shape in pre-season, and Manager Garry Monk.”
Davis looked set to be an important player under Garry Monk this season and to build on the contract extension announced in May.
He has made 167 appearances since joining from Wolves in the summer of 2014 and is one of the few players to have been picked by every Blues manager in the last 18 months.
Season ticket news
Two successive relegation battles and still Birmingham City supporters' craving for their club grows, with season ticket sales booming.
Just as they bought into the Harry Redknapp revolution last summer, Blues fans are getting behind Garry Monk's new era - in even greater numbers.
In fact the club believe they could even surpass last year's mark of around 14,000, which was boosted by Redknapp's bullish optimism and summer shopping.
Blues haven't been anything like as active in the transfer market under Monk - and they won't be with the manager talking in terms of evolution rather than revolution.
poll loading Would Lewis Grabban be a good signing for Blues? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
But the feelgood factor generated by five wins from the final nine games of last term has clearly spanned the off-season, with just a month to go before the curtain-raiser against Norwich City.
Despite a third brush with the drop in five years attendances rose last season and the average broke the 20,000 mark for the first time since the Premier League days.
By the end of the campaign they averaged 21,042 - well over 2,000 up on the previous season.
Jesse's message
Former Birmingham City starlet Jesse Lingard summed up the euphoria of the nation with a superb Tweet.
The England attacker turned in a lung-bursting two hour effort on Tuesday night as the Three Lions recorded their first ever World Cup penalty shoot out success.
As soon as Eric Dier's spot kick hit the back of the Colombia net, England fans everywhere were contemplating going all the way in Russia.
And so were the players - as a chorus of ‘Coming home...' rang from every bar in the country, Lingard was adding his social media voice.
The 25-year-old Manchester United star has been a key man in England's march to the last eight and after a good season at Old Trafford is fulfilling the potential obvious when he was on loan at Blues.
Lingard spent the first half of the 2013/2014 campaign at St Andrew's, marked his debut with four goals against Sheffield Wednesday but was cruelly recalled, sending Lee Clark's team into a tailspin.
Those memories are distant now though as the Warrington-born Lingard goes for World Cup glory - meaning his mum will have to wait.
Grabban interest
Birmingham City hope to challenge for former Aston Villa striker Lewis Grabban but a move to Championship rivals Nottingham Forest looks far more likely.
Grabban, who spent the second half of the season at Villa Park and finished with 20 goals after a previous loan stint at Sunderland, is expected to leave Bournemouth this summer.
The Sun are reporting today that Blues have expressed an interested in the 30-year-old, who is expected to fetch a fee of around £5m, but BirminghamLive understands that Grabban's most likely destination remains Aitor Karanka's Forest.
Talks between Grabban and Forest have gone well this week and it is understood it is likely the forward will become Karanka's ninth signing of a busy summer rebuild.
Kayvon Webster's tenure in Los Angeles got off to a not-so-great start in Week 1 when he injured his shoulder, which forced him to miss two games. It was an unfortunate situation but ultimately not a very costly one.
As it turns out, Webster's shoulder never actually healed. He revealed in an Instagram post Monday that he played through a torn labrum and rotator cuff all season before rupturing his Achilles on Sunday.
Webster picked off his first pass as a member of the Rams in the first quarter against the Eagles, but he was unfortunately unable to finish the game due to his Achilles rupturing. It was a non-contact injury, which is often the worst type, clutching his ankle right when it happened.
He's obviously out for the remainder of the season, which coach Sean McVay called “very unfortunate.”

Harveys Lake Patrolman Corey Pavinski
HARVEYS LAKE— Last month, law enforcement officers challenged each other to lip sync battles.
The trend has gone viral, and one video of a local law enforcement officer is getting a lot of attention.
It all started with a Facebook post on June 28 when Harveys Lake patrolman Corey Pavinski shared the video of Texas law enforcement officers lip syncing.
Pavinski's wrote: “100 likes and I'll do one. But, you have to comment a song you would like to see done and I'll choose the funniest or best one! Tag away!”
Two days later, Pavinski shared his own lip sync battle video that has more than 22,000 views.
“I'm a fun guy, so I figured, why not?” Pavinski said. “I was outside in my cruiser and I just wanted to bring some light to the job. Cops are always bashed for the negative things people hear. But I just love to have fun and want to show people that cops are people too.”
Pavinski's friend Joe Kulick, who works for the U.S. Navy's Military Police said the video is very artistic original and is definitely Pavinski's personality.
“He's always been that cop that gets involved with the community,” Kulick said. “Whether he's playing basketball with kids in the street, or developing a rapport with the community, he wants everyone to know that cops are approachable. We leave the comfort of our homes and families to protect yours, and this video shows perfectly that cops are people too. So from me it gets five stars.”
Sam Smith, a friend of Pavinski, said he's not surprised the video is getting attention because Pavinski is so hands-on in the community.
“He's really funny. I loved that he finished his donut before he started lip syncing,” said Smith, who is from Mountain Top. “He's a great cop, so people respect him. He's hands-on with the kids so they learn to respect authority, while also realizing at a young age that cops are approachable. They're just normal people with normal jobs.”
Pavinski's girlfriend, Jen Boback, said this video helps show people they shouldn't be afraid of cops, because they're just like everyone else.
“I think the video is hilarious,” Boback said. “Cops have a bad reputation lately, so it's nice to see something positive.”
Pavinski said It's not always easy to see and do the things police officers have to. But, everyday they put that badge on and go back out there, so sometimes you just have to blow off some steam.
“It feels great to have everyone's support with the video, I would've loved to do the song ‘Ice Ice Baby', for a friend, but I forgot,” Pavinski said. “But who knows, maybe there will be more songs that I will actually sing and not lip sync.”
From July 15-20, Pavinski will attend training to be a school resources officer to protect the students, faculty and staff of Noxen Elementary, where he will be employed this fall.

F1's official tyre supplier wants a full day of official winter testing to take place on a wet track.
There will be only eight days of official running in Barcelona before Melbourne, and teams are traditionally nervous in the winter about losing pre-season mileage due to rain.
Indeed, Pirelli chief Paul Hembery chuckled that his biggest fear for the forthcoming testing is "snow".
But with the big rules changes for 2017, including the physically much bigger tyres, Pirelli F1 manager Mario Isola said the Italian brand actually wants some wet running.
"With a greater footprint, the possibility of aquaplaning increases," he is quoted by the Spanish sports daily Marca.
"That is why we have asked the FIA that the fourth day of the first week of testing in Montmelo be on a wet track, so that we can continue to develop.
"On the other side the bigger tyres this year will clear more water and I hope the performance of the intermediate and extreme rain tyres is getting better," Isola added.

There was a massive jump in the number of people taking advantage of B.C.'s property tax deferrals in 2016, but experts warn the program might be doing more harm than good.
Nearly 10,000 homeowners opted to delay making their tax payment last year, an increase of 67 per cent over 2015.
The program was designed to let seniors stay in their homes longer, accumulating taxes in the form of a low-interest loan until the properties are sold, but real estate experts argue the loose rules are benefiting some who don't need the help.
"Thousands of people who can afford to pay their property tax are taking advantage of it because it's not means tested, and it should be," consultant Michael Geller said.
That's because the interest rate for anyone over the age of 55 is just 0.7 per cent. That's too good to pass up for people like Geller, who defers thousands of dollars a year and invests the money instead.
"I think next year many more people will take advantage of it. They are fools not to from a financial point of view," he said.
Seniors staying in their large houses longer also means less supply and higher prices for families desperate to find a place to live, Geller added.
He believes the government should be encouraging seniors to downsize rather than trying to keep them where they are.
Younger families with children can also defer their property taxes, but the interest rate is higher, at 2.7 per cent.
But if anyone should be getting a preferential rate, it's them, according to researcher Paul Kershaw of Generation Squeeze.
"If we're going to have more generous interest rates, it needs to be for younger people. They're the ones being especially harmed by high house prices," Kershaw said.
The B.C. government said it has no plans to change the program, which it is promoting, along with its down-payment loans, in ads leading into the May election.

Recent incident (Thu, Sep 28, 2017) GLOBAL AIRPORT MELTDOWN where CHECK-IN computer systems at airports around the globe had crashed defines the necessity & importance of an efficient Airport IT Systems. A wave of havoc broke as airports including Gatwick, Washington DC, Paris Charles De Gaulle, Frankfurt and Sydney were affected hitting numerous airlines as the Airport IT System Crashed
Passengers were unable to check in for their flights with airlines such as British Airways, Air France, Qantas and Lufthansa. Since the system was down at REAGAN airport in DC & Tambo International in Gauteng, South Africa, passengers feared of delayed departures causing the chaos getting intensified further. Passengers struggle to check-in due to systems failure and it is said that it was a ‘Glitch' with software used by 125 airlines around the world. Problems also appear to affect some online check-ins. The Software firm confirmed ‘network issue causing disruption'.
As airport information systems extend across multiple service providers, real-time coordination and collaboration are critical. Implementing multiple point systems designed to meet specific work areas can increase complexity while decreasing airport's ability to coordinate and respond to real-time events. Airports need a solution that can not only meet point requirements but that can also provide a sustainable basis for continuous operational improvements, reduce costs, add new capacity and meet compliance demands.
Airport IT Systems solutions, combined with the systems integration capability, can help establish a strong foundation of operational flexibility, no disruptive capacity growth and a unique ability to optimize costs. Airport operations systems, including airport operational database, revenue management, flight information display, baggage management, cargo management and common-use check-in systems, Airport-specific enterprise resource planning systems for aviation billing systems, Security systems, such as video surveillance, Passenger-experience solutions, including common-use kiosks and information kiosks and a mobile enablement platform, Infrastructure for data, voice and wireless solutions, Customized enterprise service bus for airports, Business analytics and optimization and asset management.

“My first ever F1 race was at Silverstone so it's always a special one for me. I've always loved the circuit, it's high speed, flowing and beautiful. Copse is flat and then into Maggots and Becketts is just epic, I'm genuinely so excited about this race. It's gonna be, full, full, lift, downshift and back to full, it's gonna be sick. I don't always love the weather but you win some, you lose some. It also has one of the most loyal and patriotic crowds and the place is rich in motorsport history. I had a fun race there last year coming from the back and through the field to fifth, it's always been a pretty happy hunting ground for me. I've had a podium there but never a win, I might steal it from Lewis. He has a pretty good home record but I'll try and get one back on the English, they are doing a bit too well in sport at the moment (laughs). I definitely want the track to stay on the calendar and I really hope that's the case, but if for some reason it had to be replaced with another English circuit I would say Brands Hatch GP Circuit, that would also be sick in an F1 car. Whatever happens, we have to have at least one English race on the calendar.”
Max Verstappen
“Coming to the end of three busy weeks of racing it will be nice to get a little break before Hockenheim. Silverstone is a great track to end this busy stint at, it is of course a very historic track but also great fun. It has a lot of fast corners, Becketts and Maggots being my favourite and there are always loads of fans out in force. It is quite hard to overtake due to the fast corners which means it is hard to follow so I'll be hoping for some of that lovely British rain. I have been on the podium once before there so I'm eager to get back on it. Being close to the team HQ is also a bonus, it is nice for the mechanics and engineers to be close to home for a race weekend.”

HYDERABAD, India (AP) — A blaze at a firecracker warehouse in southern India on Wednesday killed 11 people, police said.
The fire caused explosions in the warehouse in Kotilingala, a village in Telangana state, said Police Commissioner V. Ravindra Said, adding that the bodies were charred beyond recognition.
The cause of the fire is being investigated.
Five injured people have been hospitalized, the New Delhi Television news channel reported.

Kotalingala is 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Hyderabad, the joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states.
India has a huge demand for firecrackers, which are used in religious festivals and weddings. There are fatal accidents nearly every year as people work in makeshift factories in the absence of proper safety standards.
In January this year, a massive fire at a firecracker factory in New Delhi killed 17 workers. Last year, 23 workers were killed when a blast occurred while they were producing firecrackers in Kheri village in Madhya Pradesh state in central India.
Factories start producing firecrackers months before the nation's biggest Hindu festivals, when people set them off in celebration.

Investigators said they did not see the bandit on surveillance video footage.
The bandit did not open fire or injure any of the pump attendants.
GOOD BOY: Allan Smith and dog Mac take a breather after bringing the sheep in.
TO SUCCEED in the sheep dog trial arena, sheep dogs need to have certain attributes of excellence, something Allan Smith has had a keen eye for recognising for almost 70 years.
Taught by his father, himself one of Australia's top dog handlers, Mr Smith first competed as a teenager in Roma in 1953 and even now at 81 years of age, is still as hungry as ever for the competition.
Mr Smith grew up on a property at Barrackdale, south of Roma, and was surrounded by working dogs from an early age.
"Not all working dogs will make a top trial dog though,” he said.
"You need that natural ability first and foremost but the dog needs to be gentle and soft moving.
Mr Smith said anticipation is a skill both a good dog handler and their dog must possess.
"You need to be able to direct the dog,” he said.
"If you think the sheep are going to head in a certain direction, you can ask your dog to be in that position to stop them.”
The sheep dog trial course is 9.1 metres long and consists of obstacles that a dog might experience in its normal working life.
Each competitor starts with 100 points, some of which are deducted by judges for errors from the dog and the worker.
The dog and handler must corral the three sheep through the course as quickly and cleanly as possible to achieve the highest score possible.
Mr Smith said he would look for certain signs that a dog might become a trial dog from about four to six months of age.
"You need to see that they're keen and that they love what they're doing,” he said.
"Typically, they're more reliable in a trial situation from about two years of age.
"They need to listen and respond and as well as being flexible with your commands.
"Only certain dogs have what it takes to be great.”
Many hours of practice for both dog and handler are essential to achieving success at sheep trials.
Replicating trial conditions, working with obstacles and different sheep to lay a strong foundation of trust and understanding between dog and handler.
Mr Smith said he keeps his commands to a minimum.
"To avoid confusing the dog,” he said.
"I keep it very simple and with a tone of voice or whistle I can get them to do what I want.
"And I prefer not to train dogs too young; you've got to be careful not to put too much pressure on them too early.
"They could get over-excited and bite the sheep, which will get you an automatic disqualification.”
In 1984 after his father's passing, Mr Smith took on four of his dad's top dogs.
In 1990, he represented Queensland for sheep dog trials and with dog Barrackdale Kep placed third in the Australian Supreme Championship.
This led to a spot on the Australian team, competing in a Test series against New Zealand that same year.
"They came to Tasmania and it was four dogs and handlers again four,” Mr Smith said.
"We won the series and that was the pinnacle of my sheep trial career.”
In the late 1990s, Mr Smith underwent a massive cancer operation, which he said knocked him back a bit.
"I continued to compete, but never with the same success,” he said.
"More health concerns and leg troubles mean I don't do as many trials these days.
"One of my dogs, Ashgrove Reo, is of the Barrackdale Kep bloodline and I've won the Darling Downs and Western Downs championships with him in more recent times.”
At home in Warwick, Mr Smith keeps a flock of sheep and works his dogs a few times a week to keep them up to scratch.
"I can just stand at the fence these days and they do all the work,” he said.
"It's great to watch and I love working with them.
"There's always that strong bond between animal and owner and they like doing a good job and keeping me happy.”
Next, Mr Smith has his eyes set on the Queensland Championships to be held in Clifton in September.
The Quezon City government has warned City Hall employees to avoid engaging in electioneering and partisan political activities during the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan election period. City Administrator Aldrin Cu reminded the employees of Executive Order 292 or the Administrative Code of 1987 which provides that “no officer or employee in the Civil Service including members of the Armed Forces, shall engage directly or indirectly in any partisan political activity or take part in any election except to vote nor shall he use his official authority or influence to coerce the political activity of any other person or body.” Civil servants who will be found guilty shall face suspension of one month and one day up to six months for the first offense and dismissal from the service for the second offense, under the Civil Service Commission Resolution or the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Cuña pointed out that to cast their vote should be the only participation of QC Hall employees during the election period.
A police crime alert signboard displayed at a public housing estate in Singapore. Authorities in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore warned of a growth in online scams cheating lonely people out of their savings.
SYDNEY: Love may be in the air on Saint Valentine's Day but authorities in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore warned Monday of a growth in online scams cheating lonely people out of their savings.
Romance scams cost Australians more money than any other form of cheating, with those aged over 45 more likely to be stung, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said.
Victims are lured with promises of love and companionship into giving strangers money.
“Romance scammers are getting increasingly manipulative so if you are going online this Valentine's Day to look for love, it's absolutely vital that you're able to recognise the warning signs,” ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard said in a statement.
“Scammers create very believable profiles, including stealing the identities of real, trusted people.
“If you meet someone who seems too good to be true, do some research to see if they're the real deal,” Rickard said.
In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian and Singapore police said 27 suspects — including 11 Nigerians, whose country is notorious for offshore financial swindles — were arrested in a joint operation against a syndicate preying on people seeking partners.
They cheated 108 people in the neighbouring countries out of about 21.6 million ringgit (Dh18 million; $4.9 million) in 2016, authorities said in the Malaysian capital.
Evidence seized in the operation — including computers, mobile phones and automatic teller cards — was presented at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.
Acryl Sani, director of Malaysia's Commercial Crime Investigation Department, said the victims were from both sexes, with 43 from Singapore and 65 from Malaysia, and included elderly people.
“We believe there are more such syndicates operating in Malaysia. The police will hunt them and nab the culprits,” he told AFP.
Acryl said suspects found guilty of cheating could be jailed for up to 20 years.
“The syndicate members involved in the romance scam use powerful words and emotions to prey on the lonely victims by using text messages only, and never face-to-face or phone communications,” he said.
David Chew, director of Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department, said online scams are increasingly complex and transnational in nature.
“To the criminals who think that they could hide behind the cloak of anonymity provided by the internet to perpetrate fraud, we want to send a deterrent message that crime does not pay,” he said.

Birmingham City have joined the chase for Lewis Grabban.
Nottingham Forest are still frontrunners to sign the Championship hotshot, who hit 20 goals in the second tier last season.
But Blues are also interested in Grabban, with the 30-year-old frontman set to leave Bournemouth for good this summer after a series of loan spells away from Dean Court.
He has had a nomadic existence recently, unable to establish himself as a regular in Eddie Howe's Premier League XI.
Last season he left Bournemouth temporarily for loan spells at Sunderland and Blues' fierce rivals Aston Villa.
Here are the verdicts on how he got on at each of those three clubs:
His time at Villa
Mat Kendrick, Birmingham Live football editor
Despite the cringeworthy way Villa announced his arrival, Grabban proved to be a very effective signing - even though he was unable to achieve the ultimate aim of firing them to promotion.
Villa needed goals and he responded with eight of them to help Steve Bruce's men clinch a play-off place.
Many of his strikes are what you would regard as typical cente forward goals, being in the right place at the right time and applying a clinical finish with boot or head.
His form was enough to restrict big money signings Scott Hogan and Jonathan Kodjia (as he eased back to fitness) to places on the bench.
poll loading Would Lewis Grabban be a good signing for Blues? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
Bruce remarked that Grabban was actually a better all round player than he had given him credit for before he signed him.
The striker needs service and support though.
As Villa found to their cost - most notably during the play-off final defeat to Fulham at Wembley - leave him isolated and he will struggle to get involved.
His hold up play is okay, but he is much more likely to get on the end of good deliveries than he is to conjure something for himself out of nothing.
His time at Sunderland
Stuart Rayner, Black Cats reporter for The Chronicle
If Grabban was expecting some sort of glowing tribute when he left Sunderland, he was not getting it from Chris Coleman.
Coleman has made a point of not hiding his feelings about players who have missed games through injury, and the fact Grabban's calf started playing up as the transfer window was about to open was bound to lead to suspicions, whether valid or not.
Scoring 12 goals in half a season with the bottom-of-the Championship side was no mean feat.
“He scored a lot of goals, yes, but we haven't got a lot of wins,” Coleman pointed out in his first Press conference after Grabban returned to his parent club.
“When you look at the stats, there were consolations and penalties, fine – he's a natural goalscorer, but we had won one game in 17.”
To suggest it was Grabban's fault Sunderland did not have more wins was as harsh, as the implication he specialised in soft goals.
Nine of Grabban's strikes for the club changed the course of a game, putting them ahead against Norwich City, Brentford, Bolton Wanderers and Millwall, and equalising against Derby County, Brentford, Bristol City, Bolton and Birmingham City.
Electric at the start, the longer Grabban's loan went on, the more he seemed like a player with one eye off the ball, looking instead at where he might go next.
His time at Bournemouth
Graham Nickless, freelance reporter for The Sun, on the south coast
Nickless, speaking in January, said Grabban had largely struggled at Bournemouth, but showed promise in the Championship playing alongside a big man.
He said: "I think Grabban could make an excellent Championship striker, but he hasn't proven it at Premier League level with Bournemouth.
"He has been training with the under-20s, I believe, which suggests Eddie Howe doesn't thing he is worth the effort and is getting rid of the player.
Nickless said Grabban's biggest successes on the south coast were playing next to Yann Kermorgant in the second flight.
He added: "Grabban can score at Championship level but I don't think he'll do it at Bournemouth.
"One of the things that has disadvantaged him here is not playing with a big man. He needs to play off a big striker. When Kermorgant was here, holding up the ball and winning headers, he was scoring regularly.
"I think for him to succeed, he needs that next to him."
GRABBAN IN THE WORDS OF HIS MANAGERS
Millwall manager Kenny Jackett - March 2008
Jackett hailed Grabban after the striker put Millwall ahead in a 2-1 win over Swansea City.
"We played very well, were disciplined, and by far and away it was our best performance.
"That's three goals in three games for Lewis Grabban now, goalscoring and performance-wise he looks like he has a lot of ability.”
Andy Scott, Rotherham United boss at the time - November 2011
Grabban's 11-goal haul in the first half of the season had brought speculation that he was on the January shopping list for several clubs.
“I'd imagine there are a few clubs interested in Lewis. He's got 11 goals already and goalscorers are an asset.
“We brought Lewis here to get us goals and he's doing a job for us.
“He fits into a side that's playing to his strengths and he's done very well alongside Alex Revell and Gareth Evans, so we've got players who are helping him get those goals.
“But he's going nowhere. We want to be promoted and that's the whole point.”
Former Bournemouth assistant manager Shaun Brooks - June 2012
Brooks was speaking after Grabban signed for the Cherries from Rotherham.
"Lewis can play out wide or up front, he is strong, quick and has good feet.
"He believes in what we are trying to do as a football club, so he has got all the right attributes."
Eddie Howe, Bournemouth manager - October 2013
Howe on Grabban's Championship ability after promotion from League One.
"I think he has grown to the level. There are question marks when you gain promotion over how certain individuals will perform and no one can ever predict that.
"But he is someone who has really made the most of the opportunity and hopefully he can continue to do that.
"You have to keep on proving yourself in football, so he still has some work to do."
Ex-Norwich City boss chief Alex Neil - January 2016
Neil reflected on the decision to allow Grabban to leave as the striker re-joined Bournemouth.
We just felt, for us, he was a player who had run his course at Norwich really," he said.
"He was not involved, he was not in our squads.
"I think he had set his heart on getting a move, so basically it made sense for us. We can gather that money and hopefully re-invest it.
"Sometimes players have their heads turned and get their heart set on going elsewhere, and I think when that happens at times it becomes a difficult one, as you try and get the best out of a player and get him focused on his job.
poll loading Would Lewis Grabban be a good signing for Blues? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
"But in Lewis' situation? There was too much water under the bridge and it just made sense, because we were not utilising his talents. We had a commodity there that wasn't supplying anything for us.
“So what we had to do was try and get the best value for that, re-invest it and bring someone in who can contribute."
Reading boss Jaap Stam - February 2017
Stam discussed the decision to deploy Grabban as a central midfielder in a goalless draw against Barnsley.
"We're always looking at players who can play there [in central midfield] and who can make a difference in going forward with quality on the ball.
"And players who can produce something in tight areas and spaces.
"Lewis is comfortable on the ball, he can get it in the build-up, in between lines and he can go forward.
Birmingham City man training with U23s as he is axed on summer return
"He has got scoring ability and is a clever player as well as he can switch the play and that's why you put him in a different position.
"He has played there in the past and as a no.10 so we knew he could play in midfield.
"He is happy to play and there and sometimes you need to be able to do something when you're not happy with it. But I think he likes that position."
Sunderland manager Chris Coleman - January 2018
Coleman spoke about Grabban's record of 12 goals in 20 games for Sunderland before he was recalled by Bournemouth.
“He scored a lot of goals, yes, but we haven't got a lot of wins,” said Coleman.
“When you look at the stats, there were consolations and penalties, fine - he's a natural goalscorer, but we had won one game in 17.
“You don't want to lose him, but that's up to him and he didn't want to be with us.
“As I've said from the get-go, why should I go down on my hands and knees to convince anybody to be with us, even though we are at the bottom of the league?
“Yes, it's hard and it's tough.
“But if they don't want to be with us, that's how it is.
“He has gone back to Bournemouth and we will get on with it.”
Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce - March 2018
Bruce took Grabban on loan to Villa in January - and was repaid with eight goals
"Just at the right time we have a striker who is bang in form,” said Bruce.
"To get 12 goals at Sunderland in 19 appearances, for a team that is bottom of the league, was enough for us to make a move for him.
"If I can say it, he is a better player than I thought he was. That's always nice for a manager.
"I have always liked him from afar but now I can see he is a very, very good player. He has certainly been a good addition to us."
"I wanted to bring our school values in, and I wanted it to be original."
This was St John's College student Jake Dunn's vision for their entry in the Lions Foundation Young Enterprise Scheme.
And original it is.
It is the first time the Hastings catholic secondary school has entered, and their business model incorporates youth inmates from Hawke's Bay Regional Prison.

Principal Adviser of Rehabilitation and Learning, Tony Denton, says it's a unique opportunity. "They would not normally have had this opportunity until this school came knocking on our door... so we certainly welcomed it for our boys to take part in it."
The inmates in question are 16 to 19-year-olds who are serving either 6-12 month, or life sentences.
It was when Jake was researching for an internal assessment that he had the brainwave.
"I came across some appalling statistics that 80 per cent of young offenders reoffend. So I thought what better way to enter into the enterprise project than to have a product which lowers that statistic and brings the values from our school into it."
The Young Enterprise Scheme requires students to form real businesses and sell real products and services to the market.
The College's entry is 'Just Boards' - wooden platters produced under the name Bruthas Ltd.
For the last six months the students have been regularly visiting their business partners behind bars - an experience in itself.
"It's something I've never felt before," Jake says. "After the powhiri, it lifted all tensions and worries and it felt like we were just best friends talking to each other and the business venture.
Together they created recycled rimu platters which interlock to symbolise a waka - underpinning Māori culture.
They're packaged in recycled coffee sacks.
"If you've that edge on your products it's another point of difference for your products," Jake says. He already has a clear path marked out for his future.
"I want to do a conjoined degree in a Bachelor of Commerce and Law and start my own business in the future."
But, not everyone his age is so ambitious.
Principal Corrections Officer, Lawrence Ereatara says many of their rangatahi have "grown up in the system" being exposed to drugs, alcohol, violence and the gang culture.
"A lot of them have mental health issues as well... for them it was being able to see the other side, so to see through the eyes of our St John's students with regards to what else is out there in the community, the meeting of two minds but from two different cultures."
Three and a half thousand students and nearly 1000 companies are involved in this year's scheme.
Bruthas Ltd is hoping the popularity of their $150 product will put them in good stead to take a top placing.
Investigators were searching for a man suspected in a stabbing that sent a Santa Maria man to the hospital Sunday, according to Santa Maria police.
Jose De Jesus Amariba, 31, of Santa Maria, is wanted in connection with an attack on a 21-year-old man that occurred about 4 p.m. at an apartment in the 700 block of South Pine Street, Lt. Mark Schneider said.
The victim suffered two stab wounds, and was taken to Marian Regional Medical Center, where was listed in stable condition, Schneider said.
Amariba was last seen running from the apartment complex, Schneider said.
He was described as as having a dark complexion, 5-foot-7, 150 pounds, and was wearing a green shirt and blue jeans at the time.
“The victim and suspect know one another, and the motive for the stabbing remains under investigation,” Schneider said.
Anyone with information on the Amariba's whereabouts is asked to contact the Santa Maria Police Department at 805.928.3781, or CrimeStoppers at 1.877.800.9100.

Gardaí stationed near the Border are seeking the return of machine guns to individual stations ahead of a possible hard Brexit.
They are also asking the Minister for Justice and Garda management for more Armed Support Units (ASUs) to help police the estimated 208 crossings along the 500km Border.
Gardaí along the Border say criminals and subversives see the force as weak and ill-equipped and they are correct, according to Garda Brendan O'Connor who represents Donegal-based members for the Garda Representative Association (GRA).
“Our members feel that criminals and the cross-Border drug dealers and people of a political persuasion, they don't take us seriously. They don't see us as having the capabilities to take them on. They see us as weak. They see us as we see ourselves – untrained, ill-equipped and not enough numbers.”
Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine guns were issued to local detective units until 2012 when Garda management said the gun no longer suited requirements.
Detectives' Smith and Wesson revolvers, which carried six rounds, were also replaced with the 15-shot SiG Sauer handgun. Management said the Sauer, with its increased capacity, would fill the role of both the Uzi and the revolver.
Now GRA representatives want the Uzi, or another automatic machine gun such as the MP7, to be reissued to non-specialised gardaí for use in emergencies.
The association, which has been meeting in Wexford, is also asking for Tasers and body-cameras to be issued to all front-line gardaí.
Having an automatic weapon in each station would allow gardaí to respond to serious situations and provide cover while Armed Support Units are mobilised, Garda O'Connor said.
‘Scramble armed units'
“Ten years ago gardaí could scramble armed units at local level with the Uzi available at local district level. It wasn't ideal, but it was a deterrent,” he said.
“That capability has been taken away despite the threat being greater. And unfortunately cross-Border criminals have access to arms and aren't afraid to use them. Our members are extremely vulnerable on the Border without proper backup.
“If we have an incident now, what do we have? A couple of detectives with a side arm for personal protection and no tactical training. It's just simply not up to the threat and the danger that's there.”
He added: “We need a deterrent. Our members need the confidence to know when they stand on the road and put up their hand that, whoever that person is coming along, feels there will be consequences to their actions.”
Garda O'Connor said gardaí also want more ASUs, covering a wider geographical area, particularly around the Border.
There are currently two ASU's in Border areas, one in Dundalk, Co Louth, and the other in Ballyshannon, Co Donegal, meaning it could take hours for a unit to reach a scene, he said. Garda O'Connor said he would like to see one in every division.
‘Gathering of evidence'
Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said issues like firearms and Tasers are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. However, he said he supports the introduction of a body camera “in principle”.
“I do believe they will add considerably to the work of An Garda Síochána and I would hope that over a period of time consideration would be given towards having such a scheme. It would protect them in their duties and it would also be important in the gathering of evidence,” he said at the GRA's annual conference in Wexford on Wednesday.
“I'm in favour of them but I understand there is a process and there are also resources issues.”
A garda working group is currently examining different models of body cameras, including cameras which provide a constant “live feed” back to a control centre and ones which store the footage locally on the device before it is uploaded later.
An Auckland man who inspired the nation's biggest fundraising campaign for an organ transplant has died.
Steven "Stevie" Young died peacefully at home on Saturday night, his father Steven confirmed today.
He was being taken back home to Piopio in the King Country where he would be laid to rest in the family urupa on Wednesday.
Earlier
At just 4 months old Steven "Stevie" Young united sports stars, celebrities and ordinary New Zealanders to raise $250,000 for a liver transplant in Australia.
At 24, and after three life-saving transplants, Stevie was terminally ill and spending his last precious moments surrounded by family and friends.
At his Drury home two weeks ago, Stevie's family, including parents Zana Collins and Steven Young and his brothers and sisters wanted to thank everyone who contributed to their boy's first life saving surgery 22 years ago.
Stevie, one of New Zealand biggest Star Wars fans, was born with Biliary atresia, a rare disease that affects the bile ducts in the liver.
At 4 months old specialists told his parents he needed a transplant only available in Brisbane, and at the cost of $250,000.
Sports stars including the late Jonah Lomu and Sean Fitzpatrick, photographer Anne Geddes and singers such as Annie Crummer were all involved a nationwide campaign to raise the funds.

"We want to thank everyone involved back then but also everyone else, from people who gave 20 cents to $20," Stevie's mother, Zana Collins, said.
"There were people who recognised Stevie in his push-chair and ran over and gave us a few dollars to help."
"That was a lot of money all those years ago."
Zana said Stevie had lived a life brimming with happiness, travels, overseas study and many friends.
The first two transplants, at 2 years and 12 years, extended Stevie's life by 10 years each.
"We don't call them organ transplants, we call them gifts, they gave us Stevie for more than 20 years," sister Sommer-May said.
Stevie's third transplant, on Christmas Day 2015, was not as successful and five weeks ago specialists delivered the heartbreaking news that nothing else could be done.
"It was a complete shock to us, we thought we had at the very least five years," Sommer-May said.
In the past few weeks Stevie brought people together once again.
Family and friends came from overseas, there have been harbour cruises, family dinners and an exclusive Star Wars movie night.
One of Stevie's dying wishes was to see the upcoming Star Wars movie, due for release in December.
Friends contacted Disney International to make it happen but, despite the company's best efforts, there were no scenes ready for Stevie to view.
Instead Disney arranged a viewing of Stevie's favourite Star Wars movie, The Empire Strikes Back.
"It was amazing, they worked with Hoyts at Botany and 28 of us saw it," Sommer-May said.
"There was food set up, there were Storm Troopers and they gave Stevie merchandise. It was so special."
But Sommer-May said Stevie's biggest wish was to raise awareness for organ donation.
"Our whole family is really passionate about this and think we should have an "opt out" system for organ donation."
Many of Stevie's family have tattoos of the green ribbon associated with organ donations.
"It's one way we can raise awareness," Sommer-May said.
"The organs, blood and plasma Stevie received saved his life and gave us so much more time with him."

David Haye and Tony Bellew are returning to the ring again.
The pair fought in March 2017 and it ended in a surprise result when odds-on Haye was defeated in the 11th round.
However, that match is perhaps best remembered for Haye suffering an Achilles injury mid-bout.
It has taken a year to get back into the ring after the first attempt on December 17 last year was called off.
That was due to another Haye injury, in this case his bicep, but the Brits are ready to rumble again.
Here's all you need to know:
When does the fight take place?
The rematch takes place on Saturday, May 5, at the O2 Arena in London.
What time will it start?
The ring walk should begin around 10pm UK time, depending on if the fight schedule is running on time.
Is it on TV?
The fight will be aired on Sky Box Office, details on how to purchase will be announced closer to the fight.

About 60 people were killed in a bloody prison riot in the Amazon jungle city of Manaus sparked by a war between rival drug gangs, officials have said, in the worst violence in over two decades in Brazil's overcrowded penitentiary system.
The head of security for Amazonas state, Sergio Fontes, told a news conference that the death toll could rise as authorities get a clearer idea of the scale of the rebellion sparked by a fight between rival drug gangs. Mr Fontes told reporters that several of the dead had their decapitated bodies thrown over the prison wall – and that most of those killed came from one gang.
“This was another chapter in the silent and ruthless war of drug trafficking,” he said. Pedro Florencio, the Amazonas state prison secretary, said the massacre was a “revenge killing” that formed part of an ongoing feud between criminal gangs in Brazil.
The riot began late Sunday and was brought under control by about 7am yesterday, Mr Fontes said. Authorities were still counting the prisoners to determine how many had escaped, he added, with reports that up to 300 fled. Just as the riot began in one unit of the Anisio Jobim prison complex, dozens of prisoners in the second unit started a mass escape in what authorities said was a co-ordinated effort to distract guards.
Overcrowding is extremely common in Brazil's prisons, which suffer endemic violence and what rights group call medieval conditions with cells so crowded prisoners have no space to lie down and food is scarce.
The Anisio Jobim prison complex currently houses 2,230 inmates despite having a capacity of only 590. Watchdog groups sharply criticise Brazil for its prisons where deadly riots routinely break out. “These massacres occur almost daily in Brazil,” said Fr Valdir Silveira, director of Pastoral Carceraria, a Catholic centre that monitors prison conditions in Brazil. “Our prisons were built to annihilate, torture and kill.”

The violence was the latest clash between inmates aligned with the São Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) drug gang, Brazil's most powerful, and a local Manaus criminal group known as the North Family. The Manaus-based gang is widely believed to be attacking PCC inmates at the behest of the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command (CV) drug gang, Brazil's second largest. Security analysts have said that a truce that held for years between the PCC and CV was broken last year, resulting in months of deadly prison battles between the gangs and sparking fears that chaos will spread to other prisons.
In the latest riot, a group of inmates exchanged gunfire with police and held 12 prison guards hostage late on Sunday in the largest prison in Manaus, an industrial city on the banks of the Amazon River, Globo TV reported.
Mr Fontes said 74 prisoners were taken hostage during the riot, with some executed and some released. A video posted on the website of the Manaus-based newspaper Em Tempo showed dozens of bloodied and mutilated bodies piled atop each other on the prison floor as other inmates milled about. Brazil's prison system is precariously overcrowded and conditions in many institutions are horrific. That has sparked a rash of deadly riots in recent years. Sunday's riot was the deadliest in years.
A 1992 rebellion at the Carandiru prison in São Paulo state saw 111 inmates killed, nearly all of them by police as they retook the jail. Maria Canineu, director of Human Rights Watch for Brazil, said the most recent violence was the result of “no government in 20 years giving much attention to the penitentiary system”. Ms Canineu said that for years it had been very difficult for states to receiving any funding help from the federal government for prisons. President Michel Temer announced last week that the federal government would furnish states with 1.2 billion reais (€350 million), mostly to improve infrastructure and security in existing prisons and to build new ones. – (Reuters)
Pooja Puri's The Jungle provides a window on the life of a refugee teenager, Mico, who has left his family and home behind in Kenya in search of a new life. An important issue that is commonly overlooked in more than just fiction, The Jungle's theme of the displacement and loss suffered in Calais refugee camp has the potential to break crucial new ground. However, whilst it is a charming piece of young adult literature, the novel doesn't manage the poignant impact that is necessary for a story about such an urgent issue.
Two hundred pages is too few to set the scene of the Calais ‘jungle' faithfully, and as a result it is difficult to connect emotionally with the characters or the setting. By attempting to confront the real and desperate world of life in the refugee camp, Puri was embarking upon a mammoth task, but her story and its vague plotline are ultimately neither convincing nor powerful enough to convey the emotions she is trying to evoke.
However, that is not to say that The Jungle is not a worthwhile or insightful read. Rather than merely observing the characters tackle various challenges, the reader is able to follow the ebb and flow of the characters' hope and hopelessness. The novel is more concerned with the psyche of the characters it discusses than developing a plot, and its greatest merit is its discussion of a wide spectrum of characters with diverse backstories and cultures who share one common goal: to find a better life.
Puri details, for example, the toll brought about by living in squalor alone, whilst being viewed as inferior by society. This is represented allegorically by various characters – the introduction of Leila and her bright yellow bag, for example, marks the return of hope to Mico; when the same bag is dirtied we know that hope is lost again.
Perhaps one of the most unusual things about this novel is that it never reaches a climactic point. Mico meets the feisty female character Leila, and they dream about escaping, but to no avail. People leave the camp, but everyone seems so used to loss that it remains inconsequential. No one finishes the novel in a better position than when it began, which may be Puri's intent. The reader is left with the feeling that the novel is just a snapshot, and that life at the camp will remain in stasis for ever.
The success of Puri's novel lies in her ability to create individual identities for her characters. Their own nuances make a refreshing change from the usual depiction of this issue, where the blanket term ‘refugee' all too frequently prevents us seeing the person behind the word.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The United States will revoke a range of economic sanctions it had imposed on Sudan effective on October 12, a senior US administration official told reporters on Friday.
“The United States has decided to formally revoke a number of economically-focused sanctions on Sudan in recognition of the government of Sudan's sustained positive actions in five key areas,” the official stated.
The official also noted despite this action, Sudan will remain on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.
The sanctions being revoked do not include any Darfur-related sanctions, which will remain in place in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, the official added.
The government of Sudan is still required to make progress in the areas of humanitarian assistance and counterterrorism activities, the official said.
Washington imposed economic, trade and financial restrictions on Sudan in 1997 on accusations of state support for terrorism, destabilizing neighboring states and violating human rights. The US extended the sanctions regime a decade later over the Darfur conflict.

KiwiBuild is ramping up with the announcement of the first two KiwiBuild projects (Unitec at up to 4000 dwellings, McLennan at 18 dwellings), a new head appointed to the KiwiBuild Unit in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and ongoing consultation across the sector.
Yet to be finalised is the question of eligibility for KiwiBuild dwellings – who will qualify to buy an affordable dwelling?
While the criteria are still being worked on, the ministry has reportedly confirmed that first home buyers' eligibility will not be based on their household income.
This will be a surprise to many and it suggests a couple of extra challenges for the scheme. One is that it may reduce the opportunity to maximise the benefits of KiwiBuild. The other is public acceptance of that approach.
Advertisement
Effective targeting of KiwiBuild is very important if the strategy is to sustainably deliver the desired outcomes. A core reason for the Government to directly enter the housing market is to fix a specific problem – there are not enough dwellings in the lower price bands, and as a consequence home ownership rates have declined, with associated social and economic impacts.
KiwiBuild is intended to improve affordability, both directly by injecting dwellings in the under-$600,000 price bands, and indirectly by increasing total supply and helping to temper house price growth.
In the Auckland housing market, into which KiwiBuild aims to inject 50,000 affordable dwellings over the next decade, the 2013 Census data is useful to show which segments of the community were "missing out" on ownership. They are those who would very likely been homeowners in 2013 but for the effects of the "housing shock" which occurred before and after the global financial crisis.
Auckland has another 63,000 households by 2017 but the same groups in the community are still the most affected.
Unsurprisingly, the medium and medium-low income segments of the community have been the hardest hit by the housing shock. If KiwiBuild is indeed a once-off initiative to plug a specific gap, then why would the eligibility criteria not include household income?
The gap between incomes and dwelling prices is at the heart of the problem KiwiBuild seeks to address. Among the first home buyer segments who are trying to become owners, household income is the strongest indicator of whether they can succeed by themselves, or whether they are unlikely to become owners without direct support through KiwiBuild.
The scheme can generally maximise its benefits if all of the owners of KiwiBuild dwellings are households which would not otherwise have become owners. The "success rate" will be the increase in ownership not otherwise achievable, compared with total KiwiBuild dwellings constructed
Fine tuning to get the best success rate is not an easy task. Markets and households' circumstances change. If the KiwiBuild criteria do not take account of income, then the risk is that households may qualify for a KiwiBuild dwelling when they could have become owners in the open market without help from the scheme.
That would reduce the effectiveness of KiwiBuild because some other households not able to become owners by themselves would then miss out.
Equally, placing too much weight on income alone may also cause problems. For example, an income threshold set too low could see households miss out if they are close to becoming owners on the open market, but cannot quite bridge the gap.
The absence of an income criterion is likely to reduce the success rate, however. Some simple number crunching shows this. The Auckland community has around 190,000 households who do not own their dwelling (excluding around 32,000 in Housing NZ dwellings and emergency accommodation).
Becoming a KiwiBuild owner will mean a loan must be serviced in most instances. The target pricing of Auckland KiwiBuild dwellings at $600,000 means that those in the lowest 30 per cent of household incomes (under $80,000) would likely not be able to afford a KiwiBuild dwelling even with additional help.
Auckland households earning above the 70th income percentile are able to afford a dwelling at above the median price, so in theory these households would not need the support of KiwiBuild.
Analysis suggests the Auckland non-owning households which would benefit most from KiwiBuild and be able to afford a dwelling are the 64,000 or so in the middle bands (see graph). Allowing for some of these to not be first home buyers, these numbers are in the same ball-park as KiwiBuild's 50,000 targets.
However, a critical point is that if the 65,000 non-owner households in higher income segments are also eligible for KiwiBuild, then by weight of numbers alone they may dilute the success rate and effectiveness of KiwiBuild. They might otherwise have become owners independently of the scheme.
The related challenge is that of public acceptability. KiwiBuild is a bold and large-scale initiative, and plugging the housing supply gap is very important. Nevertheless, KiwiBuild will impose some (tax) cost on those in the community who will not benefit directly.
Policies which redistribute income and wealth are long established in New Zealand, and are accepted because much of the transfer is toward those less well off, especially in income terms.
The possibility that someone in the top 20 per cent of incomes may qualify for a KiwiBuild dwelling is unlikely to sit comfortably with many in the community, especially if someone else in the lower income bands might miss out.
Income should not be the only criterion for KiwiBuild eligibility. However, it should be included as one of the criteria, and an important one at that.

Cairo: Newly elected Lebanese President Michel Aoun arrived in Egypt on Monday, a day after he defended Hezbollah's refusal to give up its arms in media comments that underlined his unabated support for the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group.
Aoun's visit to Egypt is the first for the former army commander in 55 years. He was elected after a 29-month vacuum in Lebanon's top post. He met with Egypt's President Abdul Fattah Al Sissi who is, like him, a career military officer. Aoun was scheduled to address the Arab League later during his one-day visit.
In a news conference, Aoun said that he discussed with Al Sissi regional issues and called upon Egypt to lead an “Arab salvation plan” to combat terrorism in the Arab world. He also extended an invitation to Al Sissi to visit Lebanon.
Lebanon's political factions are deeply divided with some, like Aoun's party and Hezbollah, aligning with Iran, while their opponents are siding with Saudi Arabia.
Hezbollah, which represents much of Lebanon's large Shiite community, has a military capability rivaling that of the country's army and police. Aoun, whose Christian party is allied with Hezbollah, said earlier that Iran's support for the group “could continue indefinitely.”
“As long as the Lebanese army is not strong enough to battle Israel ... we feel the need for its existence,” Aoun told the Egyptian TV network CBC on Sunday night, alluding to Hezbollah. He added: “It has a complementary role to the Lebanese army.”
His remarks could spark tension with Saudi Arabia which has been engaged in proxy wars with Iran across the region for years.
Aoun's visit to Egypt also comes amid a lingering rift between Egypt and Saudi Arabia over conflicting agendas, including Syria and Yemen. In October, the Saudis halted oil shipments to Egypt at a time when the Arab world's most populous nation was undergoing an economic crisis.
The Saudi move appears to have been taken in response to Egypt's support of a UN Security Council resolution on Syria that was fiercely opposed by Riyadh. Saudi Arabia is a leading supporter of the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Al Assad. Egypt has pushed for a political solution that might keep him in power.
Meanwhile, Egypt has been reluctant to heavily support Saudi's campaign in Yemen against Iran-backed Al Houthi rebels, which Saudis accuse of acting as an Iranian proxy in the Arab world's poorest nation.
It may take another decade before supply matches demand in the Irish property market, Standard and Poor's (S&P) has warned.
In a new report, the rating agency said the property market here remains impaired by what it called “crisis legacy issues”. In particular, it highlighted the high levels of household debt that still prevail eight years on from the crash.
Economy-wide debt-to-disposable income ratio in Ireland fell to 150 per cent last year, down from 170 per cent a year earlier, and from above 230 per cent at its peak in 2009.
“Despite this remarkable improvement, household debt remains very high compared to most European economies, and deleveraging will need to continue for the situation to normalise,” S&P said. With house prices in 2016 still 30 per cent below their peak, many households remain in negative equity, unable to move on, it said. Another issue was the low level of investment in residential construction since the crash.
The agency noted that private investment in housing, in real terms, had fallen by a “staggering” 80 per cent from its peak in early 2006 to its trough in 2012.
“The recovery is now on the way, but from very low levels. It will likely take a decade or so to recover to equilibrium levels,” it concluded.
S&P said several years of extremely low investment in residential construction have contributed to the build-up of pronounced shortages in key areas, particularly in Dublin, and will be an important driver of prices in the foreseeable future. As a result, it predicted house prices would remain on an upward curve for several years to come. This trend was likely to be underpinned by improvement in the labour market; the Government's new help-to-buy scheme; and the Central Bank's recent decision to loosen its mortgage lending rules.
In its report, S&P forecast house-price inflation of 7 per cent this year and 5 per cent in 2018.

Lag effect
The firm also predicted a pronounced lag effect related to key Government policy measures.
“Given that the housing shortage is set to remain a key characteristic of the market over the forecast horizon and beyond, any policy that stimulates demand will first stoke house-price inflation in the short term, before relatively inert supply responds in the medium term,” it said.
“This will also be the – partly intended – effect of the Government's new help-to-buy scheme, active since January, as well as of more relaxed mortgage lending rules for first-time buyers put in place by the central bank late last year,” it added.
S&P said against the background of still high household leverage, negative equity, inability or reluctance to move, stock limitations, and macroprudential rules introduced in the aftermath of the crisis, overall demand for mortgages remains more muted than supply offered by banks that are increasingly able and willing to lend again.
According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), property prices nationally rose by 8.1 per cent last year, while prices in the capital climbed by 5.7 per cent. Its latest property price index, however, showed the rate of house-price growth unexpectedly slowed in December, bucking a trend of accelerating growth in 2016.
Prices nationally fell by 0.4 per cent in December, marking the first monthly reverse since March.
The principal of a Southland high school says the school's board is considering a need for hats or beanies, but he stood by the decision to make students take off beanies when they arrived at school.
Central Southland College principal Grant Dick said the Winton school's board of trustees set the rules around uniform and the school enforced them.
He said there was common sense and students were allowed to wear non-uniform to school to stay warm, but they were made to take it off once they were at school.
The majority of students followed the rules and there were no issues, the principal said.
He said the board was considering a proposal around hats and beanies.
"The funny thing is it has been raised by a couple of my deans at school that said should we be considering hats to school?" he told TVNZ 1's Breakfast.
"He has written a letter that has gone to the board so actually the board are considering at the moment is there a need for hats or beanies?"
Mr Dick was amused by some of the reaction to the story.

Mark Schniepp, speaking at the Radius Group Economic Forecast, believes a housing market turnaround is key to a recovery
Although the economy has stalled and will continue its slow growth, the indicators don't point to a double-dip recession, Mark Schniepp, director of the Santa Barbara-based California Economic Forecast, said during Thursday's Radius Group Economic Forecast.
“For a recession to occur, the indicators that have been signaling expansion would have to turn quickly, stall out this month or sooner,” Schniepp said.
GDP, the stock market, job growth, retail sales and corporate profits have not shown consistent downturns during the past several months, therefore, another recession is not a foregone conclusion, he said.
A housing market turnaround is the key to the recovery, but it's currently stalled by minimal job creation, Schniepp said. In Santa Barbara County, there has been virtually no new housing built and no price appreciation, which has shattered confidence in real estate, he added.
Schniepp said he expects job creation to move at a glacial pace, the unemployment rate to stay in double digits until 2014, and little change in the housing market.
But the bright spot in the South County is in the apartment sector, which boasts a 1.63 percent vacancy, according to Radius principal Steve Golis. The county's population trends show more Generation Y workers and retirees by 2020, and both groups are likely to prefer apartments over long-term investment, he said.
With low rents and low interest rates, there is a lot of opportunity for growth, Schniepp said. Consumer uncertainty has delayed investments, but when things do happen, they will happen fast, he said.
Publicly held federal debt has increased 80 percent since December 2007, which worries Dr. Peter Rupert, director of the UCSB Economic Forecast Project.
“That's something that should worry all of us,” he said.
Similar to California Lutheran University economist Bill Watkins, who spoke Tuesday night at Montecito Bank &Trust's Business-to-Business event, Schniepp's biggest worry stems from the European Union.
The European banking system is hampered by weak credits, other countries are withdrawing its funds and the PIIGS are facing significant debt problems, Schniepp said.
Watkins said he expects at least one country to break away from the European Union by the end of next year.
“Given the weakness in the United States and global financial markets, the upcoming financial crisis has the potential to cause another, very painful recession,” he said.

The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.
The move by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump's own conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.

Five people briefed on the requests, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Daniel Coats, the current director of national intelligence, Adm. Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, and Rogers' recently departed deputy, Richard Ledgett, agreed to be interviewed by Mueller's investigators as early as this week. The investigation has been cloaked in secrecy and it's unclear how many others have been questioned by the FBI.
The NSA said in statement that it will "fully cooperate with the special counsel," and declined to comment further. The office of Director of National Intelligence and Ledgett declined to comment.
The White House now refers all questions about the Russia investigation to Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. "The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal," said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Kasowitz.
The officials said Coats, Rogers and Ledgett would appear voluntarily, though it remains unclear whether they will describe in full their conversations with Trump and other top officials, or will be directed by the White House to invoke executive privilege. It is doubtful the White House could ultimately use executive privilege to try to block them from speaking to Mueller's investigators. Experts point out that the Supreme Court ruled during the Watergate scandal that officials cannot use privilege to withhold evidence in criminal prosecutions.
The obstruction of justice investigation into the president began days after Comey was fired on May 9, according to people familiar with the matter. Mueller's office has now taken up that work, and the preliminary interviews scheduled with intelligence officials indicate his team is actively pursuing potential witnesses inside and outside the government.
The interviews suggest Mueller sees the attempted obstruction of justice question as more than just a "he said, he said" dispute between the president and the fired FBI director, an official said.
Probing the president for possible crimes is a complicated affair, even if convincing evidence of a crime is found. The Justice Department has long held that it would not be appropriate to indict a sitting president. Instead, experts say the onus would be on Congress to review any findings of criminal misconduct and then decide whether to initiate impeachment proceedings.
Comey confirmed publicly in congressional testimony on March 20 that the bureau was investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
Comey's statement before the House Intelligence Committee upset Trump, who has repeatedly denied that any coordination with the Russians took place. Trump had wanted Comey to disclose publicly that he wasn't personally under investigation but the FBI director refused to do so.
Soon after, Trump spoke to Coats and Rogers about the Russia investigation.
Officials said one of the exchanges of potential interest to Mueller took place on March 22, less than a week after Coats was confirmed by the Senate to serve as the nation's top intelligence official.
Coats was attending a briefing at the White House together with officials from several other government agencies. When the briefing ended, as The Post previously reported, Trump asked everyone to leave the room except for Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.
Coats told associates that Trump had asked him if he could intervene with Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe, according to officials. Coats later told lawmakers that he never felt pressured to intervene.
A day or two after the March 22 meeting, Trump telephoned Coats and Rogers to separately ask them to issue public statements denying the existence of any evidence of coordination between his campaign and the Russian government.
Coats and Rogers refused to comply with the president's requests, officials said.
It is unclear whether Ledgett had direct contact with Trump or other top officials about the Russia probe, but he wrote an internal NSA memo documenting the president's phone call with Rogers, according to officials.

As part of the probe, the special counsel has also gathered Comey's written accounts of his conversations with Trump. The president has accused Comey of lying about those encounters.
Mueller is overseeing a host of investigations involving people who are or were in Trump's orbit, people familiar with the probe said. The investigation is examining possible contacts with Russian operatives as well as any suspicious financial activity related to those individuals.
Last week, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had informed Trump that there was no investigation of the president's personal conduct, at least while he was leading the FBI.
Comey's carefully worded comments, and those of Andrew McCabe, who took over as acting FBI director, suggested to some officials that a probe of Trump for attempted obstruction may have been launched after Comey's departure, particularly in light of Trump's alleged statements regarding Flynn.
"I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that's a conclusion I'm sure the special counsel will work towards, to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that's an offense," Comey testified last week.
Mueller has not publicly discussed his work, and a spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.
Accounts by Comey and other officials of their conversations with the president could become central pieces of evidence if Mueller decides to pursue an obstruction case.
Investigators will also look for any statements the president may have made publicly and privately to people outside the government about his reasons for firing Comey and his concerns about the Russia probe and other related investigations, people familiar with the matter said.
Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that he was certain his firing was due to the president's concerns about the Russia probe, rather than over his handling of a now-closed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state, as the White House had initially asserted. "It's my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation," Comey said. "I was fired, in some way, to change - or the endeavour was to change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted."
The fired FBI director said ultimately it was up to Mueller to make a determination whether the president crossed a legal line.
In addition to describing his interactions with the president, Comey told the intelligence committee that while he was FBI director he told Trump on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation as part of a counter-intelligence probe involving Russian meddling in the election.
Republican lawmakers seized on Comey's testimony to point out Trump wasn't in the FBI's crosshairs when Comey led the FBI.
After Comey's testimony in which he acknowledged telling Trump that he was not under investigation, Trump tweeted that he felt "total and complete vindication." It is unclear if McCabe, Comey's successor, has informed Trump of the change in the scope of the probe.

MADRID: Granada's slim hopes of launching a bid for La Liga survival under Tony Adams were further diminished as an under-strength Celta Vigo ran out 3-0 away winners on Sunday (Monday in Manila).
Former Arsenal and England captain Adams took temporary charge until the end of the season earlier this week having previously worked at Granada as an adviser to Chinese owner Jiang Lizhang.
Granada remains seven points off safety with just six games remaining.
“It's going to be hard to change mentality and confidence in the next few weeks, but I am going to try,” said Adams.
“I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve about bringing this squad together.
“When you are in these situations there is a lot of fear, a lot of blame, human beings try to look after themselves and deflect criticism. I certainly don't, I'm not one of those characters.”
Adams named a side of 11 different nationalities and without a single Spaniard in his starting line-up at Nuevo Los Carmenes stadium.
But Granada rarely threatened a much-changed Celta side, with one eye on the second leg of their Europa League quarterfinals against Genk, and Jozabed opened the scoring midway through the first half.
Marcelo Diaz's fine free-kick doubled Celta's lead 17 minutes from time before Claudio Beauvue added a third after Theo Bongonda's effort came back off the post.
“I've got to build on the performance,” added Adams. “I saw a couple of players today that I haven't seen play like that all season.”
At the other end of the table fourth-placed Sevilla's slump in form continued but they were grateful to escape with a point from a 0-0 draw at Valencia.
Valencia were denied a fourth consecutive win as Italian striker Simone Zaza had a goal ruled out for handball 17 minutes from time.
Sevilla's best effort saw Stevan Jovetic hit the post early on, but Jorge Sampaoli's men have now won just one of their last eight games in all competitions.
A point means Sevilla trail Atletico Madrid by three points in the battle for automatic Champions League qualification in third.
However, they enjoy a comfortable eight-point lead over fifth-placed Villarreal, who travel to Alaves on Monday.
Leganes remain just five points above the relegation zone after Leo Baptistao struck in stoppage time to hand Espanyol a 1-0 win.
Eibar's quest to qualify for Europe for the first time faltered as they lost 2-0 at Real Betis.

Demands for an end to the two-tier pay scale facing new entrants are set to dominate teachers conferences today.
Teachers recruited since January 2011 are on significantly lower pay-scales than their colleagues due to austerity-era cuts.
The Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO), which represents 40,000 primary school teachers north and south of the Border, is set to debate motions calling for an urgent return to pay parity.
Minister for Education Richard Bruton will address the INTO's delegates at its annual congress in Belfast on Tuesday morning.
However, while he is due to attend the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) annual convention in Killarney later on Tuesday evening, he will not address teachers.
This, a spokesman for the Minister said, was due to “logistical constraints”. Instead, he will attend a dinner, but there will not be a speaking opportunity.
ASTI conferences have often involved a hostile reception for the minister for education of the day.
Heckled
The last time a minister addressed its annual gathering was in 2014 when Ruairi Quinn was heckled by delegates.
Mr Bruton is due to address the annual conference of the Teachers' Union of Ireland in Cork on Wednesday, as well as the Impact trade union's education section.
Opening the INTO's annual congress on Monday, Rosena Jordan, president of the 40,000-strong union , said: “We believe that this unequal pay for exactly the same work is neither justifiable nor lawful.
“The great majority of new entrant teachers are young and we believe that it is indirectly discriminatory on the age ground to pay them less for the same work.”
Her successor who takes over shortly, president-elect John Boyle, has signalled that the union wants an end to two-tier pay completed before the end of the Lansdowne Road in 2018.
The ASTI's annual conference will also hear motions calling for the pay parity for new entrants, as well as an unwinding of financial emergency legislation.
Pay frozen
Many of the union's 18,000-members have had their pay frozen and are excluded from measures to provide faster permanency under measures contained in this legislation.
This followed the ASTI's decision to cease working additional “Croke Park hours”, which the Government regarded as a breach of the Lansdowne Road agreement.
The Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) is also expected to call on the Government to move towards pay parity by restoring a higher diploma allowance to teachers appointed after February 2012.
The union will also highlight the need for additional funding for third-level education. It argues that a dedicated 1 per cent levy should be applied to corporate profits to generate a special fund for the higher education.
At the time of Prince's death, his Paisley Park home and recording compound in Minnesota were strewn with “a sizeable amount” of narcotic painkillers for which he did not have prescriptions, including some hidden in over-the-counter vitamin and aspirin bottles and others issued in the name of a close aide, according to newly released court documents related to the investigation into the accidental opioid overdose that killed the musician last year.
Search warrants and affidavits from the Carver County Sheriff's Office, which is leading the continuing homicide investigation in conjunction with the Drug Enforcement Administration, were unsealed Monday.
The documents do not solve the mystery of where Prince got the powerful opioid fentanyl that killed him. But they sketch a picture of how this musician, a strict proponent of clean living who suffered from chronic hip pain, concealed his opioid addiction using a variety of methods, including mixing various prescription pills in bottles for everyday products like Bayer and Aleve.
In at least one instance, Prince procured an opiate prescription in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s, according to investigators.
Prince was found dead in the elevator of his home in Chanhassen, Minnesota, on April 21st, 2016, by Mr Johnson and others after he ingested the fatal amount of fentanyl, which is often used to manufacture counterfeit pills that are sold on the black market as oxycodone and other pain relievers.
Investigators have said they are most concerned with who obtained the fentanyl, and have yet to charge anyone in Prince's death. They noted in court records that those who were present at the home that morning “provided inconsistent and, at times, contradictory statements.”
The warrants, dating from April to September of last year, show investigators tracking to what extent Johnson had helped Prince conceal his drug habit, at one point applying for a search warrant for Johnson's cellphone records.
Dr Michael T. Schulenberg, who treated Prince for the hip pain in the weeks before his death and arrived at Paisley Park with test results that morning, told investigators that he had prescribed the singer oxycodone on April 14th, a week before the fatal overdose, “but put the prescription in Kirk Johnson's name for Prince's privacy,” according to a search warrant.
That prescription was filled on the same day that Prince's private jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Illinois after the singer overdosed during a flight home after a concert in Atlanta. Mr Johnson told hospital staff at the time that Prince “may have taken Percocet,” an opioid, containing oxycodone on the plane, according to one application for a search warrant.
In a statement, Schulenberg's lawyer, Amy S. Conners, took issue with the assertion that her client had acknowledged prescribing oxycodone for Mr Johnson that was actually intended for Prince. “Dr Schulenberg never directly prescribed opioids to Prince, nor did he ever prescribe opioids to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince,” the statement said.
Ms Conners has said that the physician has not been interviewed by investigators since the day Prince died. Dr Schulenberg has not been the subject of any disciplinary action, according to the records of the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice. Ruth Martinez, the board's executive director, said Minnesota state law “says you have to write a prescription for the person for whom it is intended. That's reinforced by federal statutes.” She said the board does not comment on whether a doctor's conduct is being reviewed.
In several instances, Mr Johnson, who had unrestricted access to Paisley Park, told the investigators that he had limited knowledge of Prince's dependence on painkillers. On the day before the singer's death, Mr Johnson said he went to a local Walgreens to pick up three prescriptions issued by Schulenberg for drugs often used to treat anxiety; according to the court papers, he said it “was the first time he had ever done something like that for Prince.”
Among the additional evidence found at Paisley Park was a suitcase with a name tag for “Peter Bravestrong, ” an alias used by Prince, containing several prescription bottles in Mr Johnson's name. (The suitcase also contained lyrics for the song ‘U Got the Look,' apparently in Prince's handwriting, according to investigators.) In addition to Prince's bedroom, pills were found throughout the residence, including in the laundry room, the police said.
A lawyer for Mr Johnson, F. Clayton Tyler, said in a statement: “After reviewing the search warrants and affidavits released today, we believe that it is clear that Kirk Johnson did not secure nor supply the drugs which caused Prince's death. There will be no further comment.”
The Associated Press has reported that Mr Johnson has not been interviewed since hours after Prince's death. In a recent interview with CBS, including a tour of the Paisley Park compound, Mr Johnson was asked about Prince's final days. “Kirk has a vault,” he said. “Right here. It's never gonna be unlocked.”
Among the drugs seized were 20 1/2 white pills labelled “Watson 853,” a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, that were found in an Aleve bottle. Investigators later found that the pills contained fentanyl, according to published reports, but they have not given any indication as to whether those pills are tied to Prince's death. Notes from investigators say that 64 1/4 matching Watson 853 pills were also found in a Bayer bottle, and another 15 were discovered in a second-floor dressing room.
Some overdoses, officials say, are attributable to the fact that people take what they believe is a pain pill of a strength they are familiar with and die because they are unaware it has been produced with a much stronger drug, like fentanyl.
Others who spoke to investigators included Andrew Kornfeld, the son of Dr Howard Kornfeld, an opioid-addiction specialist who had been called on to treat Prince. Andrew Kornfeld arrived at Paisley Park after Prince had died with a small dose of the drug Suboxone, an anti-addiction agent and controlled substance. He is the person who called 911.
Andrew Kornfeld, who is not a doctor, told investigators that he had not planned on administering the drug until he had consulted with a physician authorized to prescribe it. His lawyer, William Mauzy, said he believes Andrew is exempt from criminal liability as a result of Minnesota's Good Samaritan law, which protects a 911 caller and the overdose victim from prosecution for drug possession.
“The investigation remains active at this point,” said Jason Kamerud, chief deputy for the Carver County Sheriff's Office. “We've gained a lot of progress over the last year, but there still is some more work to be done,” he said.

Rachel Lindsay was announced as ABC's next Bachelorette on Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this week after making it through yet another episode of The Bachelor.
The 31-year-old talked about her upcoming journey on Tuesday, which also happened to be Valentine's Day, with Good Morning America's Michael Strahan.
In addition to breaking tradition by being announced before the current season's After the Final Rose special, the attorney from Texas will also be the first African American lead for the reality show franchise, the Daily Mail reports.

"I'm just glad I don't have to keep it a secret anymore!' the raven-haired beauty shared with the host.
"You're making history," Strahan, 45, started the conversation. "You're the first African American Bachelorette. How did that make you feel? Is that added pressure, you think?"
"I don't feel added pressure," Rachel stated confidently. "I'm just trying to find love, and even though I'm an African American woman, it's no different from any other Bachelorette."
Never watched one episode of the Bachelor or the Bachelorette but I'm happy that a black woman is being featured. Congrats Rachel Lindsay! — Charisse Price (@Charisse_Price) February 15, 2017

I'm still shook that we're actually having a black Bachelorette #TheBachelor — zara (not the store) (@whoanormani) February 15, 2017
The eligible lady kept the focus on herself rather than attempting to be a spokesperson, adding, "I'm honoured to have this opportunity and to represent myself as an African American woman."
This isn't the first time race has been a topic of conversation for Rachel, who has spent season 20 of The Bachelor vying for the affections of a Caucasian man, Nick Viall.
Strahan got a sneak peek of next week's episode where the 36-year-old model and former software salesman meets Rachel's mother, and she asked Nick about his feelings on being in an interracial relationship.
"Did you know that conversation was coming?" the host asked.
"I know my mom," Rachel replied, matter-of-factly. "I am not shocked that my mom asked that. My sister is married to a white guy and so it's nothing new for our family and she just wanted to make sure Nick was comfortable with it."
Fans will have to wait until next week to see how The Bachelor responded, but they already know that no matter what he said, it ultimately didn't end well for those two.

So naturally, looking forward to her shot at being ABC's next leading lady, Rachel shared that her skepticism didn't go unchecked.
"I was excited that they asked me to do it, but I was also equally nervous," she admitted. "But then when I started to weigh out the pros and the cons I decided that this is too good of an opportunity to turn away."
But there are pitfalls, thankfully, the Texan will easily be able to avoid, like her biggest pet peeve from her time, so far, with the show.
"[My] the least favorite part was living in a house full of women," she shared with GMA. "Yeah, sharing a room with that many women... I mean, I was in a sorority, I haven't done that in years!"
Overall, the well-spoken woman articulated that she enjoyed the process and was surprised by how well she clicked with Nick. She remained optimistic about finding her own happy ending.
"I figure if I just stay true to my self then it'll be a successful show," she added.
Rachel's season of The Bachelorette is set to premiere in May.

Clay carvings considered the "Gallipoli Holy Grail" have given an extraordinary new meaning to Anzac Day for one Rotorua whanau.
It's July 1915 and 500 fresh reinforcements from Te Ope Tuatahi Maori Contingent have landed on the shores of Anzac Cove.
The contingent was delegated hard labour jobs such as digging and building trenches such as the "Big Sap" which connected Anzac Cove near Ari Burnu to No. 2 Outpost.
This photo shows multiple carvings on different walls of the sap at Gallipoli, July 1915. Photo/Australian War Memorial
Conditions were hot and dry, and water was scarce.

For the past century history books have mentioned the Maori carvings at the Big Sap.
Some included photos and drawings.

But the mystery soldier who carved the designs into trench walls was not identified until 2015 when Te Papa staff researched the Te Ope Tuatahi Maori Contingent.
The head of Te Papa's Matauranga Maori collection, Puawai Cairns, approached Weta Workshop to recreate the carvings from the pictures for the "Gallipoli: The scale of our war" exhibition ahead of the opening in 2015.
The carvings appeared to be in the style of Te Arawa, and Cairns wanted to put a name to them.
About a week before the opening, she came across a big clue in a photo caption in the digitised Australian War Memorial records.
"'Taratnoke [sic] and the man of the arawa [sic] tribe who carved it."
Private Mekiora Akapita, also known as Tuoro Akapita Pango, beside his carvings at Gallipoli, 1915. Photo/ Collection of Major Charles L. Mason, British Army, Australian War Memorial
She posted the image on her Facebook page and Sarah Johnston from Nga Taonga Sound and Vision contacted Cairns to say the carvings were mentioned in the introduction of an archived interview.
"Here is Tuoro Akapita Pango, M.B.E., the spokesman of the Arawa tribe and himself an artist of distinction. When he was on Gallipoli he carved a figure on the side of a trench ..."
Pango was not listed in the army service records, but Private Mekiora Akapita 16/128 from Rotorua was the most likely link to Te Arawa.
Te Papa's iwi relationships team made contact with Kingi Biddle, a great-grandson of Private Akapita, who confirmed his koro went by multiple names including Tuoro Akapita Pango.
Biddle and his sister Lauren James never knew about the carvings but they identified their koro in the Australians' photo.

"In other pictures we have seen he looked quite frail, but seeing him as a young strapping man, that was a real eye-opener for us," James told the Rotorua Daily Post.
Biddle still lives in his great-grandfather's former house in Koutu.
He was taken aback by the photo.
"My first thought was 'Gee my koro's handsome! What happened with some of us?'."
Kingi Biddle, a great-grandson of Private Akapita who carved at Gallipoli. Photo/Stephen Parker
Akapita died in the early 1960s before Biddle and James' father was a teenager, and they knew very little about his time at war, so Te Papa's discovery was "huge", James said.
"There was a whole new sense of pride that he still undertook traditional practices there. He did what he knew best with the carvings."
Biddle said carving would have been "second nature" to his koro who was of Ngati Tarawhai and Ngati Whakaue descent.
Carving was in Akapita's bloodlines on both sides, especially his mother's.
"He was away from home, it seems he was bringing home to him, and his guardians too."
Cairns said finding the identity behind the famous carvings "was like finding a Gallipoli Holy Grail".

She was honoured to meet Akapita's whanau.
"Sarah Johnston led to the solution. She is wonderful. She has a thankless job as an archivist."
It is not known what happened to the carvings when Gallipoli was evacuated.
"It is likely they crumbled and disintegrated," Cairns said
Te Papa had intended on closing the Gallipoli exhibition next year but Cairns said they were now looking at extending it.
"We are still getting queues there, so we hope to keep it open as long as we can. We are trying to be sensitive to the public in that respect."
She was not sure what was intended for the exhibition items in the long term.
"When, and if, we can contemplate distributing them, I would love to see the carving replicas go back to Rotorua to the museum."
Biddle has since learned more about his koro through speeches Akapita wrote and delivered on marae later in life.
"In his writings when he spoke of war he described 'te ahi whanaariki [sic]' or 'fire and brimstone'. He called it hell."
Akapita was considered too old to fight in WWII, but he spoke of his hopes for peaceful korero.
"He said 'let's go talk to Hitler and have a gentlemen's conversation'. That reflects the attitude of our people at that time, they took people for their word.
"Koro, his cousins and his friends, they lost and took lives in a bid to create a world where this would never have to happen again. The best way to honour those men is to be good to each other and act with kindness."
Aerial antics for Ford in Air Force One.
Harrison Ford has narrowly avoided crashing his light aircraft into a passenger plane after accidentally heading for the taxiway instead of the runway at California's John Wayne airport. It's the fourth time the Star Wars star has got in trouble while flying. He survived crashing a plane into a golf course just two years ago.
In Monday's incident, Ford skimmed over the top of an American Airlines Boeing 737 containing 110 passengers and six crew members. "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?" he asked air traffic control.
The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident.

Calling all spoken word fans, jazz lovers, and poetry aficionados! Le Balcon will host a unique evening of live music, poetry, and fine dining on April 26. On the menu is a melting-pot of emerging slammers, poets, and musicians, all tied together with a relaxed atmosphere reminiscent of Harlem's spoken word era. Spoken word is a form of oral poetry which emerged during the Harlem Renaissance, and was deeply influenced by the ‘60s Civil Rights Movement. Prior to the ‘60s, spoken word was predominantly viewed as a useful tool to narrate stories and express oneself artistically. However, after the Civil Rights Movement, spoken word became a politicised form of art that countercultural groups used to express their worries, emotions and demands in the fight for racial, post-colonial, gender, and social justice reform all over the world.
Legendary speeches like Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream,” Sojourner Truth's “Ain't I a Woman?” and Booker T. Washington's “Cast Down Your Buckets,” inspired many groups of artists and musicians to develop and refine spoken word in the 1960s. One of these groups, The Last Poets, played a crucial role in popularizing the art form and inscribing it at the heart of Black culture. Spoken word has since played a vital role in shaping Black music, and is considered to have given birth to rap, hip-hop and many other musical genres.
Today, spoken word and slam poetry are both thriving and effective art forms drawing on diverse subject matters and musical trends. This is especially true in Montreal's art scene, which has produced some of the genre's most talented artists, such as Fabrice Koffy and Kym Domique-Ferguson, who will be the featured in Le Balcon's Les Séries Spoken'Jazz # 1.
Meet the Artists
Fabrice, one of the artists of Le Balcon's upcoming event, grew up in the Ivory Coast, and began writing poetry in French as a teenager. Over the past five years, he has been working with the Kalmunity Vibe Collective (www.kalmunity.com) and has participated in a variety of collaborations and shows. This includes shows at the FrancoFolies de Montréal and the Montreal International Jazz Festival. In 2016, he won a Vitrine des Musiques Locales Métissées award (an award highlighting Montreal artists who blend their inspirations of cultures and traditions from all around the world), and was invited to MASA (Marché des Arts et du Spectacle Africain) and performed onstage with Salif Keita (Afro-pop singer and songwritter from Mali known as “The Golden Voice of Africa”). Fabrice is also active in community organizations and schools, where he frequently gives slam and poetry workshops. He also regularly takes part in slam events organized by the Ligue Québécoise de Slam (LIQS). Onstage, Fabrice brings elements of theatre and music to his distinctly modern and urban poetry.
Kym Dominique-Ferguson, another of Le Balcon's upcoming artists event, is a poet by birth, a theater artist by training, and a producer by nature. For over a decade, he has wowed Montrealers with his theatrical poetry and open mic nights. In August 2015, he successfully produced and performed his first one-man show, The Born Jamhaitianadian, to a sold-out audience. From 2015 to 2016, he participated in the Black Theatre Workshop's Artist Mentorship Program ensemble and, soon after, was accepted into the renowned Spoken Word Program at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta. In September 2017, he made his directorial debut with the Phenomenal 5IVE, an acclaimed production that ran for five days at the MAI (Montréal Arts Interculturels). Phenomenal 5IVE was a production mixing poetry, music, theatre and dance featuring 5 phenomenal women (Aliyah Thomas, Carmina Vanessa, Elena Stoodley, Majiza Philip, and Manouchka Elinor). The poet is currently working on his first play, titled #DearBlackMan.
The McGill Daily met with Kym Dominique-Ferguson and asked him a few questions.
The McGill Daily (MD): How long have you been doing Spoken word?
Kym Dominique-Ferguson (KDF): I have been writing poetry since I could put my pen on paper, but the actual practice of performing spoken word/poetry I began when I was 18 years old at the Edna Manley College School of Drama in Kingston, Jamaica.
MD: Do you think Spoken Word still as powerful a protest tool like it was in the past?
KDF: Definitely. The expressions “sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me” are the words of a fool. Words have been the most powerful tool used to control people, to move them to take action, to create revolutions, to cause an uprising. Very few people can hear the words “I have a Dream” and not associate them with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s most famous speech. “By any means necessary” is one of the most controversial expressions Malcolm X was notorious for using. “Fight the Power” was synonymous with the Black Panther party of the late 60s-early 70s, but associated to the rap group Public Enemy. President Obama's acceptance speech from his first inauguration was pure poetry, meant to bring change and hope to the nation. The spoken word artist has the job of telling the truth of their time to the people who will listen. By retelling the news in metaphors, rhymes, iambic pentameter and more. To make you laugh, cry, think, and to make you wonder and question. To make you want to read, read, read, and write, write, write. We are the singers and rappers, the storytellers and the revealers of truth.
MD: How important do you think the spoken word movement is today?
KDF: Very much. In a time of fake news it is the responsibility of the spoken word artist to show the reality we and the people around us experience. At the end of the day, our words will go down in history, right alongside Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman, and more. Without the spoken word movement, people lose their voice. Without their voice, there is no push-back against a system that is set-up against the people who live in it.
MD: How is the Montreal Spoken Word scene, and what should we expect on April 26?
KDF: Montreal's spoken word scene is as diverse as it is vibrant. You should expect to see fireworks, slow burning flames, soft caresses and hard hitting wake-up calls. Be prepared to see artists open up the hearts and speak their lived truths through their souls.

After winning another Senior National Title in Karate, Caradh O'Donovan has launched an online fundraising campaign to help her qualify for the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020.
Only making her switch from Kickboxing to Karate a few months ago, O'Donovan is still a reigning Kickboxing World Cup Champion and is a former World and European titleholder. Already an established member of the Irish Karate Squad her focus is now on qualification for the Olympics in two years time.
The qualification process for Tokyo is intense and requires attendance from athletes at numerous international events worldwide to collect crucial ranking points. This process starts on 1st July 2018 and will finish up in April 2020. Sport Ireland announced their sport investment for 2018 recently and out of a total of €7 million in High Performance funding they have decided to give Karate zero. “It's really frustrating and disappointing as I know for certain that I have the ability to be the best in the world in this sport but now Karate Ireland have no money to fund us athletes. That's why I've decided to start the online campaign as I have no other choice in order to get to the Olympics in two years time.”
Needing to raise at least €10,000 is a tough ask but with the campaign already hitting €1.4k in the first few days it's been a great start. “I'm overwhelmed at the support but I know I've a lot more to do. I'll be running the campaign over the coming months until I hit my target. Hopefully if people help me with this I'll be able to bring back home the medal I know I'm capable of getting.”
Caradh is now focused on selection for the WKF (World Karate Federation) European Championships in May and more WKF ranking events following this. Here is the link to support Caradh on her journey – https://www.gofundme.com/caradhs-olympic-dream
DAVIE, FLA. (WSVN) - Authorities are on the lookout for a man who, they believe, attacked a Davie resident with a pool cue.
The suspect was identified as Zachary Haedo.
Police said Haedo was caught on surveillance video playing pool before he walked over and repeatedly struck a 17-year-old with a pool cue.
The incident happened inside a clubhouse of a Davie apartment complex in September.
The victim needed several staples in his head.
If you know anything about Haedo, call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.

NASA ambassador Theo Wellington addressed the Wilson County Commission during Monday's monthly meeting and described the eclipse, along with the crowd the event is expected to attract.
“I used to qualify it and call it the biggest astronomical event. I don't do that anymore. This is going to be the biggest public one-day event ever in U.S. history,” Wellington said.
“You guys are right in the best part of it,” said Wellington, who said the last total solar eclipse possible to be seen in Tennessee took place in 1869.
Wellington said the eclipse is not a “science geeky” occurrence and would challenge our senses and could cause emotional reactions for some people.
“To see the Sun go out in the middle of the day is something your brain knows doesn't happen, so it hits you at a very human level. People cry. They shout. They go silent and speechless,” she said.
Wellington said half of the U.S. population is within a one day's drive to the total solar eclipse path, which means areas along the path, such as Wilson County, will experience an influx of visitors.
“The expectation is the population will double all the way across that path that day. I want you to think about how that impacts everything – even things you don't think about,” Wellington said.
Wellington said the total eclipse path is important because it's the path in which a total eclipse is visible. Other areas will only experience a partial eclipse, which doesn't bring darkness.
“It's a nationwide event. Everybody will see part of the Sun covered up that day, but only those in the 70-mile wide path get to see the total eclipse,” said Wellington, who said the eclipse causes a night and day difference.
“You guys are snugged up right next to the very center of the path,” she said.
Wellington said the maximum amount of time the total eclipse can be viewed is 2 minutes and 40 seconds.
“The Wilson County [Fairground] is only 2 seconds off the longest time,” she said.
Wellington said the biggest event surrounding the eclipse she knows about will take place in St. Joseph, Mo., where an extra 100,000 people are expected in the city – about 30,000 more than its population.
The commission also voted to allow officers to retain their service weapon upon retirement.
The Tennessee General Assembly gave counties authorization in 2006 to permit full-time sheriffs or deputy sheriffs to retain their service weapon upon retirement as long as the county legislative body approves it by a two-thirds vote.
A sheriff or deputy who retires on disability retirement may also retain the service weapon. The move was to recognize the officers for their “many years of good and faithful service.”
According to the resolution, to receive the service weapon, the certified officer must retire in good standing after 15 years or have at least 15 years with the department at the point or retirement from injury.
Commissioners Terry Ashe and Gary Keith abstained their vote.
The commission also voted to equip the future Springdale Elementary School with a school resource officer once the school opens in August.
Wilson County Sheriff Robert Bryan said the $10,000 budget amendment would go toward training and SRO certification before school begins. The department currently provides an SRO for every public school in Wilson County.
Springdale Elementary School is at 5675 Central Pike.
Rezoning plans have more than 500 students who currently attend Stoner Creek Elementary School and 200 students who currently attend Elzie D. Patton Elementary School rezoned to Springdale.
Popular live trivia app HQ Trivia usually pays out a cash prize after 12 questions, but last night, for the second time, they've tried a “winner takes all” approach. After 27 minutes of trivia, with $25,000 on the line, two players remained—then the game abruptly ended as one of them reportedly got kicked from the game for cheating.
Ever since it got popular, cheating has plagued the live competition game, HQ Trivia. In January The Daily Beast reported that a web developer had made significant progress on a bot that would generate correct answers for the game. HQ Trivia made it clear that it considers using bots cheating, as opposed to quickly Googling an answer or asking a friend. February saw the rise and fall of several popular HQ cheating bots, as they either closed voluntarily or were served cease & desist notices.
Evidently, that doesn't mean cheating has stopped. During Sunday night's game, question 26 eliminated all but two players, Jeric Brual and Kayla14. Before Jaric could answer the 27th question, he was kicked from the game, as you can see in this video by Flip Review below. Kayla answered incorrectly, and the game was over. HQ Trivia followed the game up by tweeting that moderators “kick players that violate HQ's terms of service.”
It didn't take long for players to find tweets on Jaric's Twitter account saying that they had used bots for other games of HQ. Jeric has since locked his Twitter. Kotaku has reached out to both HQ and Jeric but they did not respond in time for publication.

The Daily Beast reports that both Jeric and Kayla are apparently members of a private Discord dedicated to “hacking” trivia apps. “On Sunday night, a bot in a private Discord chat that both Brual and the runner-up, Kayla, were active members of was spitting out supposed answers live as other members of the group collaborated on answers in real time,” Daily Beast reporter Taylor Lorenz wrote. Lorenz also wrote that members of this Discord provided screenshots that purported to show both Jeric and Kayla were in the chat during this game of HQ.
“I can confirm that Kayla is in chat because she, along with Jeric, were both screaming in the voice chat about how far they got, and the only reason Kayla actually didn't win was because she fat fingered,” one member of Discord told The Daily Beast, meaning they accidentally tapped the wrong answer.

Lorenz writes in her report for The Daily Beast that while the bots helped Kayla and Jeric, the key to getting answers right was being in a voice chat between the community members. Speaking aloud helped them figure out the correct answers faster than just using a bot on its own. Sounds a lot like my own HQ experience, honestly. I've used HQuack, I've conferred with friends, I've tried to Google answers. But the first, and only, time I've won, it was because head of Special Projects Tim Marchman happened to walk by and answer the final question correctly for me.

Head coach of Rayon Sports of Rwanda Djuma Masudi says the play-off tie in the CAF Confederation Cup between his team and Nigeria's River United is far from over.
In the first leg in Port Harcourt on Sunday, Rivers United won 2-0 thanks to goals from Emeka Atuloma and Cote d'Ivoire's Guy Kuemian.
Despite the first leg deficit, Masudi is upbeat about his team's chances of progressing into the group stage.
"When you play matches, you expect a win, draw or loss and I accept that we have lost this game," Masudi told cafonline.com.
"However, this is just the first ninety minutes of the entire encounter as the remaining time will be played in Kigali.
"I have seen the strength and weakness of our opponent and we are going back to prepare well for the return leg with the ticket for the group stage in our minds.
"Anything is still very possible in the return leg."
Meanwhile Rivers United skipper Festus Austine lamented his team's inability to score more goals against Rayon.
He however expressed belief that they will complete the job in the second leg in Kigali.
“We should have scored more goals today to make the return leg in Kigali a mere formality, but I believe we are in the driving seat," Austin said.
"Our target is to come back from Rwanda with a win and the last ticket for the group stage.
"We played against a very good side but showed character to overcome them which we hope to repeat in a few days."
The second leg will take place on Saturday in Kigali, with the winner completing the line-up for the group stage.

Santa Barbara County Public Works crews responded Thursday after a large boulder tumbled onto San Marcos Road in the hills above Santa Barbara.
The boulder, described as the size of a car, was totally blocking one lane of the road, which connects Cathedral Oaks Road at the bottom with Highway 154 at the top.
The estimated 3-ton shale rock was blocking the uphill lane just above Twin Ridge Road, according to Randy Carnahan, the county's road maintenance superintendent.
No injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred shortly before 7 a.m.
A skip-loader was used to push the boulder into a wide spot off the roadway and out of the traffic lane, Carnahan said, adding that crews will return Friday to break it up and haul it away.
Crews also will monitor to make sure additional rock falls were not likely, Carnahan said.

Special to the PRESS
The South Padre Island Shoreline Task Force considered a pair of beach and dune applications, and discussed beach walkover maintenance issues during their Monday, Jan. 29 meeting.
The Task Force first considered a modification to an existing beach and dune permit for 6800 Padre Boulevard. Shoreline Management Director Brandon Hill explained that property owner Clayton Brashear has already received a beach and dune permit from the City for the project, but was requesting the ability to change the original design of the proposed deck addition to Clayton's Beach Bar. Brashear proposed altering the design from a set of stairs that descend to the beach, to a ramp, instead. The Board voted in favor of sending the request for the modification to the Texas General Land Office (GLO) for approval.

Is Brexit the maddest thing England has ever done? Not quite. In its very long history – much longer than most political entities can claim – there is just one episode that is more thoroughly unhinged. It is interesting because it is remembered in England as glorious even though it was morally, politically and economically disastrous. And in this it prefigures the only chapter in English history that comes close to matching its tragic folly – Brexit itself.
At the Tory party conference last October, Jacob Rees-Mogg issued a rallying cry that linked Brexit to the great triumphs of English arms on continental Europe: “We need to be reiterating the benefits of Brexit!” he cried. “Oh, this is so important in the history of our country… It's Waterloo! It's Crécy! It's Agincourt! We win all these things!”
Waterloo might best be left aside, since it was won by an alliance of European armies. But Crécy and Agincourt, two of the great English victories over the French in the 14th century, were indeed remarkable feats of arms – on both occasions the French military aristocracy was virtually wiped out.
The evocation of Crécy and Agincourt as forerunners of Brexit are, however, problematic in two ways. One is that they were English victories but Scottish defeats – the Scots were firmly allied with the French.
The other is that they were part of one of the great criminal follies of European history, the so-called Hundred Years War, the repeated English invasions of France that unleashed on innocent civilians mass murder, mass rape, theft on a staggering scale and an orgy of destruction. It brought nothing but horror and misery. And all in the failed pursuit of a mad idea.
Claiming to be kings
On January 26th, 1340, the English king Edward III stood on a platform in the marketplace of Ghent in Flanders. It was bedecked with new banners commissioned from the workshops of Antwerp, showing the arms of England quartered with those of France. And from that platform Edward declared himself King of France. A Florentine merchant who was there asked some of the locals what they thought. The better sort, he reported, thought the whole thing “puerile”. But for almost half a millennium, until 1802, the English monarchs would go on claiming to be kings of France.
This reminds us of one of the great problems of Brexit: saving face
Edward was not mad. He knew the claim wasn't real. He made it because he was in dispute with the actual French monarchy about the feudal status of his own vast holdings in the southwest of the country, the duchy of Aquitaine. He needed the support of the Flemings, but they were also feudal subjects of the French monarchy. They couldn't support him unless he declared that he was in fact king of France. So he did.
This reminds us, though, of one of the great problems of Brexit: saving face. People – and states – don't act merely out of self-interest. There are times when they make claims they know to be daft. But they can't find a way to back down.
The claim that the English monarch was king of France started out as a way of dealing with an immediate political problem, just as Brexit has its origins in David Cameron's strategy for dealing with internal dissent in the Tory party. It, too, was thought of as a kind of deliberate overreach: Edward, like the less extreme of the Brexiters, thought he was making an exaggerated gesture that could be easily bargained away in later negotiations.
But neither Edward nor his successors could find the right means to step down from the platform that he constructed in Ghent in 1340.
Appalling consequences
The consequences were appalling. The invasions of France cost English lives and sucked up English resources. They disrupted and at times destroyed the trade with Flanders and France that had been so important to the English economy.
The insatiable demand for taxation to pay for them very nearly destroyed the English state in the Peasant's Revolt of 1381. But for the ordinary people of France, the Low Countries, Spain and Italy (all of which were drawn into the conflict) the suffering was immense and seemingly interminable.
The fabulous English military victories at Crécy and Agincourt, at Sluys and Poitiers, did not end the war. As Jonathan Sumption puts it in his magnificent (and still ongoing) multivolume history of the Hundred Years War, they simply “underlined the essential unimportance of battles as a means of achieving anything of long-term significance”.
The English state could not hold conquered territory for long or sustain a large standing army. Its solution was one that would appeal to most of the free market ultras behind Brexit: the war was privatised and outsourced to gangsters.
They stormed towns, raping and killing at will
Sumption (interestingly, now a member of the UK's supreme court) calls the English strategy “terrorism on a great scale”. Warlords were unleashed on the general population. Edward himself described these men as “outlaws, criminals, murderers, thieves”. The English knight Sir Thomas Gray called them “a horde of yobs”.
They stormed towns, raping and killing at will. They enslaved men and women. They held anyone they thought had money for ransom and tortured them until their families paid up. They stole everything that could be moved and destroyed most of what could not. When they had stripped an area of everything, they moved on to the next set of victims – all in the name of the English “king of France”.
But even the official English armies were savage. The great Italian poet Petrarch, travelling through the area south of Reims a few months after the passage of the English army through it, wrote: “Everywhere was grief, destruction, desolation, uncultivated fields filled with weeds, ruined and abandoned houses…” Shakespeare, in Henry V, dramatises the greatest of the English warrior kings, but slips in an accurate description of the fate of civilians at the hands of his country's armies.
Henry warns the people of Harfleur what will happen if they do not surrender: “look to see/ The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand/ Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;/ Your fathers taken by the silver beards,/ And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,/ Your naked infants spitted upon pikes”.
Suffering
This was as all as glorious as the exploits of Joseph Kony in Uganda or Charles Taylor in Sierra Leone in our time. And for what? At the end of all the suffering, English power in France had all but disappeared, the possessions that Edward III had started out with permanently lost to his successors.
The saving grace of Brexit is that it is, so far, a largely bloodless affair. (Jo Cox being its one direct victim.) Even the worst Brexit will be nothing like the catastrophe of the Hundred Years War. But there are perhaps two meaningful parallels. One is the power of the big gesture.
The English claim to the throne of France and the grand rhetoric of Brexit's revival of the glorious Englishness of Agincourt are bold and thrilling as well as being bonkers – they stir the blood even while they numb the brain. The other is that these grand gestures are far easier to make than to unmake.
It is astonishing how much pain people will suffer and inflict rather than admit they made a mistake. Brexit is not the Hundred Years War, but unless someone finds a way out it now, the consequences will be felt for a century.
Introduction
A sense of place is intrinsic to who I am. One of the ways I claim a sense of place and hold it close over time is through creating box constructions. They are responses to the places where I feel I belong.
I grew up in upstate New York, went to school in the Midwest and on the East Coast, lived in the Washington, D.C. area for over 25 years, and traveled extensively in Europe and Japan. But where I find myself most at home is on the downeast coast of Maine where I continue to spend summers, and Interior Alaska where I live with my writer husband and frequent collaborator, Frank Soos.
These two places feed my sense of self, offer deep reflection, and ultimately define “home.” It is no wonder that they also inspire the imagery of my mixed media box constructions.
I go to Maine to be near water. The ocean's rugged coast, its massive rocks and iconic islands, the rhythm of the tides and unforgiving weather, all become part of living on the water. There the sense of space within my box constructions focuses on water and sky.
In Alaska the focus shifts to land imagery. The boreal forest and its dominant birch and spruce trees provide endless inspiration—the way they change with light and seasonally throughout the year—as does living in the northwoods at times when its climate is the harshest.
As an observer of my own work I ask myself if creating box constructions is how I make sense of claiming these two seemingly disparate places as “home.” Is it a way to capture each—the monumental expansive landscapes of Interior Alaska and the open ocean of Maine—in a manageable scale? A way to get a hold on it, and ultimately to claim it?
I make the boxes one at a time, always with the intent to create an image that I describe as “distilled” rather than abstract, an image composed of nothing more and nothing less than necessary to express the impetus from which it came. In each case I compose the objects first and then create an architectural space around them, including skylights and windows through which light enters to play its part in the overall composition.
The genesis of the box-constructed form of my work is two-pronged. Most importantly it grows out of my graduate school study of Northern Renaissance altarpieces whose panels open and close according to the liturgical season and whose individual images invite personal prayer and meditation. It is because of this art historical connection that the box constructions that have doors opening to multiple views are called altarpieces. Secondarily, the box-constructed form grew out of my travels in Japan where small niche-like sculptures are erected in garden settings to mark particular places at which one is invited to pause, rest, and reflect. The Japanese examples also inspired my aesthetic preference for spare images in which objects, negative space, and light play equal roles.
In “Corea Fog,” for example, the lumbering movement of thick fog over a calm ocean in Maine is evoked by solid pieces of beach wood and metal. This blanket-like fog is common on downeast Maine shores even while thin streams of light break through and reflect on the distant horizon.
In “Spring Run” I recall how Alaskans celebrate the coming of spring by tapping their boreal birch trees and collect their precious clear-running sap to make syrup. A vintage hand drill penetrating a birch log represents this annual ritual while skylights lead the viewer to a pool of clear marbles embedded in the box-floor.
While memories tied to place inspire my box constructions, they are more than snapshots of experiences. I would hope for them to be contemplative spaces into which viewers are drawn, to be alone and to discover their own responses.

On episode 336 of The Art Of Wrestling, professional wrestling podcasting pioneer Colt Cabana spoke with Nora Benshoof, also known as WWE's Molly Holly, who talked about helping Beth Phoenix pay for college, attending the same professional wrestling school as Roderick Strong, and her stint in WCW.
On the subject of supplying Beth Phoenix with some educational financial aid, Holly said that she did what she could to help 'The Glamazon' succeed.
"I do remember when she was trying to break in or make it, she was already doing the indies, but she wanted to make it to the big time, I just saw her work ethic, and personality, and I was like, 'man, I really want this girl to make it.' So yes, it is true that I did pay for some of her schooling and I was just so proud of her that she did make it and she just did an awesome job representing women in the industry."
According to Holly, she met Phoenix at OVW while the latter was in developmental. Apparently, Holly would visit OVW because she was infatuated with John Cena.
"Sometimes, on my off days, I would go to the developmental territory. She was in OVW. And so, not everyone in OVW was under contract. They had, like, local people there training to, hopefully, meet the right people and get an in and stuff. So I was there. I was under contract, but I was there either because they asked me to be, maybe I was doing something with the developmental or I went there on my own for fun. I don't remember exactly."
Holly added, "maybe I had a crush on John Cena at the time. I think he was there. Yeah, that was probably one of the reasons I was there. That's the inside scoop, that I had a crush on him at one time."
Also during the conversation, Holly said that she went to the same backyard pro wrestling school as Roderick Strong and said the NXT talent was the best at the school.
"[Strong] was at the same school as me, the same [school]. So when I went up to the school, it turns out is in the backyard of a trailer park, has garden hoses for ropes, and I was 18 [years old] and Roderick Strong was about 13. He must have been about 13." Holly continued, "so I met Roderick when I was 18 and he was 13 and he was the best one in the training school. Everyone was like, 'oh my gosh! he's amazing!' and, sure enough, he was. He was super athletic."
Holly said she got the Miss Madness role in WCW because she had grown close to 'Macho Man' Randy Savage from training his girlfriend at the genius suggestion of Savage's brother, Lanny Poffo.
"The way that I met him was his brother, Lanny, was on the same independent scene as me, so I got to know Lanny. And then, 'Macho Man' mentioned to Lanny, 'hey, I want to teach my new girlfriend, Stephanie, how to do some wrestling moves. Do you know any female wrestlers that could show her a few things?' And Lanny's like, 'oh yeah, I know this girl, Nora. She wrestles locally. You should ask her.'" Holly continued, "he asked me to take a leave of absence from my job in order to spend a whole month, everyday, teaching his girlfriend how to wrestle, so I did and during that month, we all became friends and that's when he asked me to be part of his entourage."
Holly professed that she always speaks so highly of Savage because 'The Macho Man' is the whole reason she made it to the big time.
"He believed in me enough to help me get my big break. He brought me onto his entourage from the indies. He was like the whole reason I got a contract from WCW."
While professional wrestling fans often hear that WCW became a toxic environment, Holly admitted that she really enjoyed WCW because she was "pampered" as part of Savage's entourage.
"I loved it, but I was really pampered because I was part of 'Macho Man's thing. Like, we had our own private dressing room; I never worked house shows; I got paid really good money to show up five minutes before TV starts and then 'Macho Man' comes in and tells the booking office what he would be doing for the show. And then, I would escort him to the ring and if he gives me a missile dropkick or something to do from the top rope, he just tells me when and I do it. And I go home, so I thought it was awesome."

Man who poured boiling water over Hastings co-worker's head for taking a slice of sausage deported
The incident, that was caught on camera, took place in the lunchroom of a Turners and Growers pack house in Whakatu, near Hastings, in July 2015.
A new Government agency will buy private land adjoining existing prime sites held by State and semi-State organisations in order to assemble land holdings that will then be developed for housing, the Taoiseach has said.
Leo Varadkar said the model previously used by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) “before it lost the run of itself” is to be adopted for the new National Regeneration and Development Agency (NRDA).
The DDDA was mired in controversy for paying over the odds for private land as it sought to develop the capital's docks.
It had been previously thought the new agency would only assemble State sites, but Mr Varadkar said it will also acquire private land holdings.
Mr Varadkar said the exact approach of the new NRDA will be finalised in the weeks ahead, but said it will involve the State agency buying up land near sites that would be suitable for large-scale housing developments.
Dublin Bus depots in Donnybrook, Ringsend, Clontarf and Conyngham Road are among those consistently cited by Government figures as obvious examples of land that would be more suitable for housing than their current use.
Prime sites
Mr Varadkar told the Dáil the new NRDA will seek to buy up additional lands around such prime sites and then use a much larger land holding for development.
One of the most controversial deals undertaken by the DDDA was the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend for €412 million in November 2006. It was subsequently valued at €45 million by the Comptroller & Auditor General in 2010.
The prospect of allowing those who currently own prime sites, such as CIÉ, enter joint partnerships with builders or county councils to develop housing has been discussed within government circles
The Taoiseach, however, said this type of transaction will not be repeated with the NRDA. The new project was announced as part of the Government's 10-year capital plan and accompanying national planning framework, called Project Ireland 2040.
“Our intention is to use that agency to take existing State land and acquire additional land for development,” the Taoiseach told the Dáil. “It would be following something similar to the model being used by the Grangegorman Development Agency and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, before it lost the run of itself, in actually using State lands and adding private land to that to make it available for development.”
Responsible
The Grangegorman Development Agency is responsible for the area on the northside of Dublin city that is being turned into a new campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT).
It is understood that the exact approach to the NRDA is one of a number of elements to be announced at a special Cabinet meeting set for May 11th.
The prospect of allowing those who currently own prime sites, such as CIÉ, enter joint partnerships with builders or county councils to develop housing has been discussed within government circles.
Senior officials were given a briefing by Transport for London, who operate such an approach in the British capital, in recent weeks. The transport body owns thousands of acres in London and has sought to team up with developers to make money out of the land it owns.
GRENOBLE, France: Rescuers called off their search Sunday for a Japanese climber who went missing on Mont Blanc, a day after a Czech mountaineer died while descending Europe's highest peak. No one had seen Hironobu Shimosawa, 35, since Monday, after he set out on his own to scale the 4,810-meter (15,780-feet) summit. The PGHM rescue service, based in the French Alpine town of Chamonix, said Shimosawa had contacted a friend via Facebook on Wednesday asking for help. Search efforts using mountaineers and helicopters were hampered by bad weather. Despite relatively warm temperatures during the day, the peak remains treacherous even in the height of summer. A Korean climber was found dead on the mountain on August 2, a week after two Germans froze to death on its slopes after being caught in a snow storm. PGHM said Saturday that they had located the body of the 42-year-old Czech mountaineer who had fallen to his death.

Amid rumours of buttonless screens and wireless charging, at last is the tip that Apple could be about to solve the biggest gripe with the iPhone.
The iPhone 8, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who has a track record of being on the money with iPhone rumours, is set to get a much bigger battery that will let people go for a longer period between charges.
MacRumours was the first to pick up the analyst report that Apple is set to redesign the components inside the iPhone so that they fit in a stack, allowing the battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone to jump from its current size of 1960mAh to 2700mAh - which is almost as big as the battery in the current iPhone 7 Plus phablet.
The expected bigger battery, together with the recent rumour that the next iPhone will have a more energy efficient OLED display, would mean iPhone users will be able to go longer between charges - something that has been a common complaint with iPhones for years.
While the redesign will extend the iPhone's battery, Kuo says reason that Apple has come up with the cunning plan is out of necessity. He says "battery material tech isn't likely to see major breakthroughs in the next three to five years".
One of the biggest rumours about the upcoming redesign of the phone is that the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging.
While iPhone rumours are a standard in tech reporting, in this tenth anniversary year of the iPhone the rumours about Apple's smartphone are firing around at an even greater pace.
A patent granted to Apple yesterday shows how it could have a fingerprint scanner built into the entire screen on the new phone while Digitimes reports supply chain evidence suggest Apple will release three versions of iPhone this year, with the premium model have an even bigger 5.8-inch screen but the same dimensions as the current 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.

The British Horseracing Authority has moved to stop apparent no-hopers running in Group One races by introducing a minimum official rating to run at the top level.
The ruling, which will come into force from next year, means no horse rated less than 80 will be able to run in Group Ones, although it does not apply to two-year-old races.
For any horse that does not have a rating, the BHA handicapper will have the discretion to allow the horse to run if satisfied his or her performances merit a rating of 80 or above.
Diore Lia attracted plenty of attention ahead of her intended appearance in the Epsom Derby. The daughter of Yeats was a 500-1 shot for the premier Classic, but was free to run, although the BHA prevented apprentice Gina Mangan from taking the ride. Diore Lia was eventually ruled out of the race due to injury.
Similar changes have been made to Grade One races over jumps. A minimum rating of 130 will apply to all non-novice Grade One chases and hurdles and a minimum of 120 for Grade One novice chases. The proposal does not extend to Grade One novice hurdles, however.
Need for action
Ruth Quinn , director of international racing and racing development for the BHA, said: “The question of whether the races that form the pinnacle of our sport should require a minimum standard of competitiveness from equine participants is one that has been discussed in the past, but without an agreement being reached.
“Thanks to the PJA (Professional Jockeys Association) putting it back on the agenda, a further proposal was already being considered by the Flat Pattern Committee before the issues surrounding this year's Derby put into clear focus the need for action to be taken.
“Introducing a minimum rating for these races has three clear benefits.
“Firstly, it will help protect the welfare of the human and equine participants in our major races by reducing the risk that comes with inferior horses competing against far superior opponents.
“Secondly, it will ensure that the risk of unsatisfactory results in these races is reduced by taking out the unknown factor and complications that can be caused in-running by an inferior horse.
“Finally, it will help preserve the reputation and public perception of our top races as crown-jewel events, ensuring the focus can remain on these races identifying and celebrating our sport's champions.”
EIGHT people have been killed in 15 years on one of the Bundaberg region's deadliest crash blackspots - but the Queensland Government hopes the $4.5 million upgrade to the Bruce Hwy and Childers Rd near Apple Tree Creek will save lives.
An analysis of 15 years of government crash data has revealed eight people were killed on a 3km stretch at Apple Tree Creek including three deadly crashes between 2001 and 2016 where those two roads intersect.
The tragic history of our region's deadliest highway is revealed as police plead with motorists to take care on Queensland roads over the Easter break.

Smashes included a 2011 horror crash where two children were killed when a four-wheel drive came off the Bruce Hwy and hit a tree. A one-year-old child and one-month-old baby were killed and two other children airlifted to Brisbane with serious injuries.
Just metres to the north, three people were killed in three separate crashes on the highway in Apple Tree Creek in 2012 alone.
A Department of Transport and Main Roads spokeswoman said the recently completed $4.5 million road upgrade on the highway at Apple Tree Creek could save lives.
"We finished upgrading the Bruce Hwy at Apple Tree Creek in 2016. Work included widening the Bruce Hwy and upgrading various intersections through Apple Tree Creek to improve safety," she said.
"We are also planning to start upgrading the Bruce Hwy north of the Isis Hwy intersection later this year. Road safety will be improved by widening the highway to include a one metre wide centre line treatment and upgrading the Hebbards Rd and North South Rd/Kevin Livingston Rd intersections," she said.

Crash records also show major inter-city highways are some of the deadliest roads in Queensland.
Nearly one third of Bundaberg road deaths between 2001 and 2016 occurred on either the Bruce or Isis Hwys.
The TMR spokeswoman said major roads like the Bruce Hwy could soon be home to new point-to-point speed cameras.
She said two point-to-point systems would be installed every year on Queensland roads over the next three years. But their locations have not been determined.
Point-to-point cameras measure a vehicle's average speed between two points on a road.
"New sites are selected based on crash data. Both TMR and Queensland Police prioritise continuous lengths of roads that exhibit a significant history of speed camera criteria crashes in the preceding five years," she said.
"This assessment process determines the potential locations of new point-to-point camera sites."
So far, the cameras are only installed at the Sunshine Coast on the Bruce Hwy and on the Mount Lindesay Hwy in Logan.
A leading road safety expert believes installing point-to-point speed cameras along regional highways could save lives.
The George Institute for Public Health injury division head Rebecca Ivers said the speed cameras and better quality roads were key to reducing Queensland's road toll.
"Simple road engineering can help improve safety on curves, but as police cannot enforce speed limits across our vast road network, utilisation of other speed management systems like point-to-point cameras would help significantly to manage safety," she said.
She said council and state government road planning needed to consider all road users - not just cars.
"Road safety is not just about cars and drivers, and government has an important job in making sure all road users can travel safely," she said.

What ‘hood are you in?
I live in a quiet house in Oak Ridges that backs on to a part of the moraine. The postage-stamp backyard has a deck where I love to lounge and watch a gaggle of geese frolics in spring, summer and fall. I occasionally enjoy the full moon in summers while the fire pit burns. I do some writing here also.
What do you do?
I write adult and children's books, article for magazines and newspapers, book reviews, and I edit peoples' works. I spend quality time with family and friends.
What are you currently working on?
In addition to actively promoting my children's books, I have written a fourth book in the Nosey Charlie Adventure series and am I waiting on the illustrator to complete his work. I am also editing (final) a novel―set in rural Jamaica in the late 1950s, it's an intriguing saga about the Moreland family, about country living, murder, romance, and how a matriarch's ambition leads her precious daughter to make a bad decision which affects their lives forever.

Ross County are six points adrift at the foot of the Premiership and eight below Dundee
BBC coverage
How to follow: Updates on BBC Radio Scotland (FM) & the BBC Sport website
Simon Murray goes straight into the Dundee squad for their game with Ross County after joining on loan from Hibs.
But new defender Genseric Kusunga, a replacement for the departed Jack Hendry, may have to wait with the club still awaiting international clearance.
Chris Routis could make an early return after suffering a shoulder injury against Rangers, with manager Owen Coyle hopeful he might make the trip.
Greg Tansey and Mattias Kait could make debuts and Jim O'Brien could feature.
But Jamie Lindsay and Sean Kelly remain long-term absentees.
Paul McGowan also returns from a knock for Dundee and Josh Meekings will be assessed but Craig Wighton and Marcus Haber are sidelined.
MATCH STATS
Dundee have won just one of their past five Scottish Premierships matches against Ross County, however that victory did come the last time the two sides met in December.
The Staggies, without a league win in 12, are unbeaten in their past three trips to Dundee in the top flight and have lost just one of their eight visits to Dens Park in the Premiership.
County have conceded a league-high 44 goals this season, with 11 of those coming via headers (another league-high).
No Scottish Premiership team has scored more penalties this season than Dundee (five - level with Hamilton Academical).
PRE-MATCH QUOTES
Dundee forward Simon Murray: "I feel the most determined I have ever been just because I have been put out on loan.
"I need to prove to my own club that maybe it was a mistake.
"I used to come to the Dundee games with my mates and family when I was growing up so it is a good fit for me."
Ross County boss Owen Coyle: "It's a huge, huge game. If we go and win the game we get them [Dundee] back to five points and still have them to play again.
"It's a huge game and one we need to be ready for to get us right back into the mix, and that's what we need to do before now and the time we get to the split.
"We need to make sure we're up there and in amongst it and from there you can kick on, but we need to get that momentum to give ourselves a real opportunity to get safe."

French Climate Ambassador Laurence Tubiana has insisted that hollow promises will have no place at this year's anniversary Paris climate “gimme the money” fly-in.
The climate change fight returns to Paris
By Laurence Tubiana
Monday 11 December 2017
European Climate Foundation chief and former French climate ambassador Laurence Tubiana calls for higher ambition from the global community in order to meet the goals and targets of the Paris Agreement.
Nearly two years have passed since France's then-foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, struck his gavel and declared: “The Paris agreement for the climate is accepted.” This week, President Emmanuel Macron and the French government will host world leaders and non-state actors for the One Planet Summit.
The purpose of this gathering is to celebrate climate gains made since 2015, and to boost political and economic support for meeting the goals and targets of the Paris agreement.
…
The diplomatic success of the Paris accord is worthy of praise in its own right; it was a remarkable leap forward in the fight against climate change. But we must not rest on our laurels. With the United States, the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, dismissive of the accord, the rest of the global community must reaffirm its commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Dramatic, meaningful, and immediate steps must be taken.
…
Solutions start with money, and a main objective of the One Planet Summit is to mobilize public and private financing to fund projects that can reduce climate-changing pollution today. During the summit's “Climate Finance Day,” companies, banks, investors, and countries will announce new initiatives to help fund the costly transition to a carbon-free future.
Hollow promises will have no place at this gathering; only real commitments of real money for tangible projects will be discussed. As a result, we hope to see hundreds of millions of dollars committed by governments to fund solutions across all fronts of the climate-change battle.

MOSCOW: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to meet his US counterpart Rex Tillerson for the first time Thursday in Germany, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Wednesday.
“The meeting with Secretary of State Mr Tillerson has been planned and is being prepared” on February 16, when both diplomats will be in Bonn for the G20 ministerial talks, spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian agencies as saying.
Lavrov will also hold his first meeting with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who was appointed last month.
The first meeting between US and Russian senior diplomats comes as Russian officials appear increasingly concerned at the shift in rhetoric coming from Washington which dampens hopes that President Donald Trump will drop sanctions and initiate other policy changes toward Moscow.
It also follows the resignation of Trump's national security advisor Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials.
Zakharova said Lavrov will “discuss bilateral relations, which were taken into a dead end by the previous administration”.
“The plan is to discuss the main international crises which our countries have cooperated on and must cooperate,” she said. “Of course, regional issues will be examined.”
Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer on Tuesday said the new US president “has been incredibly tough on Russia” and “expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in Ukraine and return Crimea.”
Asked to comment, Zakharova said “We don't give back our territories.” AFP

Both versions of the comedy duo's football anthem are in the top 10.
Comedy duo David Baddiel and Frank Skinner's 1990s football song Three Lions has topped the iTunes chart following England's victory over Colombia in the World Cup.
The original version of the pair's collaboration with band The Lightning Seeds from 1996 is ahead of Shotgun by singer-songwriter George Ezra and electronic group Clean Bandit's hit Solo.
The tune's 1998 reworking, which coincided with that year's World Cup in France, has also entered the top 10.
The charts are based on online sales on the store of Apple's media player and library.
Baddiel, 54, reacted to the news by retweeting a screenshot of the chart, and writing: “Blimey. Again.”
The song's chorus has become a favourite chant of England fans at every major international football championship the team has taken part in since 1996.
Baddiel and Skinner, who previously presented comedy sports programme Fantasy Football League together, were among the famous faces to celebrate England's last-16 win on penalties over the South American country.
After England advanced to the quarter-final stage Baddiel tweeted a photo of himself and Skinner sitting on a sofa with their arms aloft.
The photo was accompanied by a caption that referenced the lyrics of Three Lions. It read: “It's just about still coming home.”

The Lighting Seeds frontman Ian Broudie has also been reacting to the song's rejuvenated popularity.
Broudie retweeted TV news footage of England fans celebrating and signing the song in the streets after the game.
In a subsequent post accompanied by a still of himself, Baddiel and Skinner from the Three Lions '98 music video, Broudie wrote: “Am I dreaming or did England win on penalties last night?
“Were people singing our song in the streets all over the country? Yes we did and yes they were! (trophy emoji, praying hands emoji).”

Both releases of Three Lions topped the singles chart in 1996 and in 1998.
The song is one of only three songs to hit number one in the UK twice with different lyrics. The others are Mambo No. 5 (Lou Bega and Bob The Builder) and Do They Know Its Christmas? (Band-Aid and Band-Aid 30).

SYDNEY (AP) — A hotel valet had a lucky escape — but the luxury sports car he was trying to park did not.
Australian media say the valet drove the soft-top Porsche Carrera under another vehicle Thursday outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Sydney.
Emergency workers cut the driver out from the Porsche as a large crowd watched. The driver was reported to be unhurt.
The larger vehicle was propped up and its wheels were anchored so the vehicles could be separated. The black Porsche, its hood and front bumper crunched and dented, was then backed onto a tow truck.

Witness Jonathan Bayle told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. he thought a television show or movie was being shot.
Legislation to remove the so-called “baptism barrier” on schools admission has been passed by the Dáil.
After a late night debate the House accepted the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which prohibits the requirement for a child to be baptised before they can be admitted to Catholic schools.
Religious bodies had argued that banning religion as a selection criterion in admissions would breach their constitutional rights relating to religious freedom and freedom of association.
But Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the provision was robust and would mean baptism as a requirement for school entry would be removed from most schools but retained where a child of a minority needs to gain access to a school of their ethos.
Three Independent Rural TDs - Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins - called a number of votes but, because they did not have the minimum 10 TDs required to press votes, the votes did not take place.
Mr Bruton told the Dáil after the Bill was passed: “Ireland is changing and we need to change with it. The expectation of citizens around the education system have changed and I think this Bill will go some distance to ensuring that we keep up with those changes.
Fianna Fáil education spokesman Thomas Byrne welcomed the passage of the Bill which he described as “in some ways radical legislation” but said in other way it will not affect many schools in terms of how they operate.
“It's going to give clarity to schools and to children and will result in a fairer education system without being an attack on the ethos of schools, which I have to say I do value.”
The legislation now goes to the Seanad.
President Rodrigo Duterte topped Time magazine's poll on the world's most influential people, a feat that the Palace attributed to his agenda of helping the poor.
Duterte got five percent of the votes, beating Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Pope Francis for the top spot.
Trudeau, the Pope, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg each got three percent of the votes.
The online poll started in March and ended on Monday.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that Duterte has the adulation of the people here and abroad because the President acts for the common good.
“What makes President Duterte so admired by Filipinos and international leaders alike is his national agenda. He has prioritized public interest first and foremost, especially the needs and aspirations of the poor and common people,” Abella said.
The President, Abella noted, has a simple three-point agenda: Prosperity for all, restoring trust in government and building a fair and equitable society.
“With or without the distinction, the President continues to be a hardworking government worker and faithful servant of the Filipino people,” Abella said.
Weeks into his presidency, Duterte drew flak for cursing former US President Barack Obama, the European Union, the United Nations, and local and international human rights groups. He was also strongly criticized for the bloody war on drugs that left thousands dead.
US Senator Bernie Sanders won the Time reader poll on the world's most influential people in 2016, while Russian President Vladimir Putin bagged the award in 2015.
The final call on the Time magazine's most influential people in the world list, however, rests on the Time magazine's editors and will be announced on April 20.
Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol said it is not surprising that Duterte should make waves here and abroad.
“There is really a genuine support of the masses, he's a different breed,” Piñol said.

At the time, Doom was estimated to be installed on more PCs than Microsoft's new operating system and after considering a buyout of id Software, porting its game made more sense. Microsoft took this promotion as far as having Bill Gates digitally superimposed into the game for a Windows 95 video ad, while Excel 95 had a Doom Easter egg including portraits of the game's programmers.
Newell and fellow employee Mike Harrington left Microsoft to found Valve in 1996 and create Half-Life after being inspired by Michael Abrash, who previously left the company to develop Quake at id Software. Doom was released on Steam in August 2007 and can also be downloaded for free on TechSpot.

Farming does not get the public attention is deserving these days, until this time of year when any road journey out of the cities reveals what a wealth of beauty and prosperity the countryside contains. Many farms somehow managed to look prosperous to the urban eye even when the main industry of most - dairying - was in the doldrums. But at least this summer, city holidaymakers on the roads can look at those verdant pastures and know that this, at last, is a happy new year for rural New Zealand too.
After two years of depressed dairy prices, the market began to turn in the middle of last year and for the past few months the price of milk powder has been back above break-even levels for most producers. Furthermore, there is every reason to believe the slump is over. The over-supply that caused it, largely from Europe, has been reduced or consumed and this season's supply better matches demand.
But while dairying is profitable again, many farmers and sharemilkers are carrying high debts from a downturn that lasted longer than they or their banks expected. It will take at least two more years of careful budgeting to bring those farm balance sheets back to where they should be. Rural servicing towns might not see much of the improved dairy payments for a year or two yet.
But this is the time to congratulate farmers who have hung in there, working for no financial gain over the past year or two, hoping the market would come right before the forbearance of their bankers expired.
The banks, too, deserve credit for carrying many farmers through a time such as this. Their faith in milk commodities must have been tested as the price continued to languish. Yet we have not had reports of foreclosures and forced sales of farms and herds that could have been expected.
Fonterra helped them too, operating a deferred payment system that means some of the high milk powder price of 2013/14 was paid out in 2014-15, keeping their payment well above the $5/kg break-even level. It meant that producers did not really feel the pinch until last season, the second year of the slump when the market price sank to $3.90/kg.
At the last auction of 2016 the price had doubled since the beginning of the year and Fonterra has raised its farmgate payment to $6/kg. Before this season has ended it could be up to $6.50.
In this way New Zealand's dairy industry, the world's largest exporter of a commodity not heavily traded internationally, has outlasted its rivals who are heavily subsidised.
It credits its survival to the economics of pasture grazing, which will not please environmentalists monitoring rivers and streams. Cattle effluent is putting too much nitrogen into waterways, and responsible farmers are taking steps to reduce it, but further dairy conversions would seem unwise.
For economic reasons as well as environmental, farmers must be wondering if too much has been invested in dairy. Prices in a thinly traded commodity are bound to be volatile and farms need their eggs in more than one basket. They have come through this slump stoically, but how many want to do it again?

F1 fans will see more "real" overtaking in 2017, according to Pirelli.
Some are worried that, as downforce increases dramatically this year, the shorter braking distances could mean much less overtaking.
But a key criticism of F1 in the past few years is that the overtaking aid 'DRS' has ramped up artificial passing to the point that it is hurting the show.
Tyre supplier Pirelli's racing manager Mario Isola told the Spanish sports daily Marca: "Logic says there will be fewer overtakes, but they will be real.
"There will be no discussions for hours about whether the move was real or assisted. But also the 'show' is not only in overtaking," he added.
Indeed, some believe that a big step forward this year will be the simplicity of the racing, helped by tyres that degrade less and are less prone to overheating.
"I expect we'll see fewer pitstops," confirmed Pirelli chief Paul Hembery, who said the laptime boost throughout the season will be between 2 and 6 seconds per lap.
"The cars will be faster, the drivers will be on their limit, they'll be making mistakes and we'll be seeing overtaking in that way. That's how it should be," he added.
"We'll have a real world championship again."
So instead of the races being more boring, Hembery explained: "They will become clearer and easier to understand."
But what won't be easy to understand - at least initially - is the 2017 pecking order, even though official testing begins in less than two weeks.
"To be honest, the first test is not much more than a shakedown," said McLaren's Eric Boullier.
Hembery agreed: "We will get the really, really relevant information only in Melbourne, because we often see a lot of sandbagging in the winter."
NYSE-listed gold major Newmont Mining has achieved commercial production at its Twin Creeks underground expansion project, adding higher grade, lower cost gold production at its Twin Creeks operation, in Nevada.
The Twin Creeks underground mine will add between 30 000 oz/y and 40 000 oz/y at all-in sustaining costs of between $650/oz and $750/oz for its first five years of production.

The new ore will also allow Newmont to process stockpiled ore that had previously been classified as waste, and extend processing life to 2030.
“The expansion extends profitable production and improves recoveries at Twin Creeks, and serves as a platform to further explore the deposit, which remains open along strike and at depth,” Newmont president and CEO Gary Goldberg said in a news statement on Tuesday.

The project was completed for $42-million, compared with a guidance of between $45-million and $55-million, marking the sixth project that Newmont has completed on, or ahead of, schedule and, at or below, budget over the last five years.
Goldberg added that the project generated an internal rate of return of about 20%.
The Twin Underground mine is mechanised, featuring remotely-operated loaders to improve safety and efficiency.
Twin Underground ore will also be blended with ore from Turquoise Ridge. In early 2018, Newmont and Barrick Gold approved the Turquoise Ridge Mine Optimisation project, which involves sinking a production shaft to access the richest part of the deposit. The new shaft is expected to increase ventilation capacity and lower unit costs by more than 20%, while increasing ore production rates to at least 1.1-million tons a year when it comes on line in 2022.

On this day 50 years ago, a little-known gospel singer from Detroit went into a New York City recording studio to try to jump-start her career. No one saw it coming, but the song Aretha Franklin laid down on Valentine's Day 1967 would go on to become one of the greatest recordings of all time.
"Respect" hit the top of the charts four months later and turned Aretha Franklin into a feminist champion. The track was actually a clever gender-bending of a song by Otis Redding, whose original reinforced the traditional family structure of the time: Man works all day, brings money home to wife and demands her respect in return.
Franklin's version blew that structure to bits. For one, Redding's song doesn't spell out "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" like Franklin's does. It also doesn't have the backup singers and their clever interplay. So much of what made "Respect" a hit — and an anthem — came from Franklin's rearrangement. She remembered how it all came together when she spoke with WHYY's Fresh Air in 1999.
"My sister Carolyn and I got together and — I was living in a small apartment on the west side of Detroit, piano by the window, watching the cars go by — and we came up with that infamous line, the 'sock it to me' line," she told host Terry Gross. "Some of the girls were saying that to the fellas, like 'sock it to me' in this way or 'sock it to me' in that way. It's not sexual. It was nonsexual, just a cliché line."
Franklin's "Respect" became a transformative moment — not only in her career but also in the women's rights movement and the civil rights movement. Which makes one wonder: What did Redding think of all this?
"Well, he didn't like it," says Mark Ribowsky, author of the biography Dreams To Remember: Otis Redding, Stax Records, and the Transformation of Southern Soul. Speaking to NPR in 2015, Ribowsky said Redding eventually accepted that "Respect" no longer belonged to him — and that you can see it for yourself in his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival.
"He comes onstage and he goes, 'This next song is a song that a girl took away from me' — but he says it with the Otis charm, a little glint in the eye," Ribowski said. "And Otis couldn't begrudge her that."
Rolling Stone named "Respect" one of the top five greatest songs of all time, saying: "Franklin wasn't asking for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short, if you want some, you will earn it."

A "miracle" girl has made an incredible recovery - after she was born with her organs outside of her body.
Jacey Pollock, aged just eight, has spent her entire life in and out of hospital after she was born with a life-threatening illness.
According to the Coventry Telegraph , mum Jennifer Pollock knew there were complications from the first scan.
Jennifer has revealed how she almost lost brave Jacey in an operation just two weeks ago - but luckily came back to life.
She said: “When Jacey was born in 2009, she was born with her organs outside of her body.
“I researched the condition and saw it wasn't that uncommon.
“Other children had theirs put back almost straight away, but we had to wait until Jacey was two for her to be operated on.
“All she has known her life is going to and from the hospital for operations.
“The last surgery she had was a big cosmetic one, and she had to be put in a coma to recover.
“The plan was to not wake her up for three days because she had so much work done.
“But the day after, they lost her heartbeat. I could see her through the window and them performing CPR on her.
“She managed to pull through and now all we have to go back for is check ups and change of dressings.
“Jacey is a little miracle.”
Jennifer has suffered multiple miscarriages and three still-borns over the years, but now has a happy little girl.
She added: “I've always had complicated pregnancies. It was heartbreak after heartbreak.
“I have suffered multiple miscarriages and in 1995 and 1996 I lost two little boys. In 1998 I also lost a little girl.
“Jacey has overcome so much. She was born five weeks premature and weighed just 3.5lbs.”
The organs on the outside of her body were as big as a football, but looking through the pictures, Jacey stayed a happy smiley baby.
Jennifer, 46, said Jacey's care at Great Ormond Street has been amazing.
While she has been there, Jacey has grown in confidence and met a few famous people on the way.
Jennifer said: “While she was being treated at Great Ormond, she met Peter Andre, Jessie J and other stars.
“The hospital have been fantastic with her.
“It has been such a long process but I'm so proud of her.
“She has stayed strong throughout and is such a smiley girl.
“The first thing she wants to do now she is better is to go on a bouncy castle.
“I'm trying to arrange a little party with some help, but it seems mission impossible at the minute.
“Hopefully she can now live the life a young girl should lead.”

After soaring to $4,000 on exchange markets over the weekend, the bitcoin cryptocurrency is continuing to rise, topping a record $4,300 on Monday — nearly a thousand dollars above its rate one week ago, according to data from the Coinbase currency exchange.
Bitcoin settled back under the $4,300 mark after reaching a new high Monday morning, according to several exchanges that track the decentralized currency.
"The bitcoin market cap soared past $70 billion," says CryptoCoins News, adding that a "flippening" that has been anticipated for years in the cryptocurrency community had finally come to pass, as "bitcoin now has a greater total valuation than payment-processing behemoth PayPal."
A bitcoin could be bought for around $570 just 12 months ago — reflecting a rise of around 645 percent to today's exchange rate.
Reporting on the rise, the Coindesk site says the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached a record $138 billion on Monday.
The steep ascent can be attributed to a number of factors, from political concerns to a recent split into two currencies — Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Cash. That change, which became official on Aug. 1, was made to give the currency a more robust infrastructure; it was also tied to a move to allow large trades in the currency to occur more frequently.
Formally introduced in 2009, bitcoin has steadily accumulated both users and investors. And blockchain, the technology that underlies bitcoin, has been embraced by both academics and banking giants such as Fidelity — which now lets customers tracks investments in cryptocurrency — and Goldman Sachs.
Other factors, such as bitcoin's role as a hedge against political uncertainty, also play a role. A finance executive tells CNBC that South Koreans have shown a "surge of interest" in the currency as the U.S. and North Korea trade threats. The network also says there's strong interest in bitcoin in Japan, with the yen accounting for 42 percent of bitcoin currency purchases.
It's been a heady summer for bitcoin holders. After the virtual currency hit a record $2,420 in May, The Economist ran a story asking, "What if the bitcoin bubble bursts?" and wondering if its rise could be compared to historic market crazes — like the one over tulips.
Noting that "Anyone clever or lucky enough to have bought $1,000 of bitcoins in July 2010, when the price stood at $0.05, would now have a stash worth $46 million," The Economist added, "Ascents this steep are rarely sustainable." — before concluding, "If there is such a thing as a healthy bubble, this is it."
The Arizona Cardinals have been looking to add help at cornerback in free agency during the offseason. They would like to re-sign Tramon Williams, who played very well in the second half of the season, once he got in the starting lineup. They were also scheduled to have free agent cornerback E.J. Gaines, formerly of the Los Angeles Rams and Buffalo Bills, in for a visit.
Things might be moving toward a deal.
According to ESPN's Josh Weinfuss, the visit went very well, even “great.”
I was told this weekend that CB E.J. Gaines' visit with the Cardinals went "great." We'll see what that means. — Josh Weinfuss (@joshweinfuss) March 19, 2018
Gaines is a natural fit for the Cardinals. He has a home in Arizona. He can play inside in the slot or outside. The Cardinals have need at both positions. Their primary slot defender, Tyrann Mathieu, was released and now has signed with the Houston Texans. The aforementioned Williams is still unsigned.
Gaines has missed a number of games to injury, but that has been the trend for the Cardinals, signing players who have had some history of injuries, but getting them a little below top market value.
More information is sure to come.

Turkish police continue the manhunt for an unidentified attacker who went on a deadly shooting rampage at a nightclub in Istanbul just over an hour into the New Year.
Fresh details have emerged on the terror attack, with Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu saying police and intelligence officials are now piecing together the clues they have found so far.
The masked assailant shot dead 39 people, mostly foreigners, and injured 69 others inside the club at the popular Besiktas area, where people were celebrating the New Year.
According to local media, between 120 and 180 rounds were fired by the armed man during the seven-minute attack. Many of those at the club chose to throw themselves into the freezing waters of Bosphorus to save their lives.
According to Soylu, the gunman managed to flee unnoticed after the shooting spree and still remains at large.
The assailant “left the gun and went away from the scene of the incident,” the minister told reporters, denying earlier reports that a Santa Claus costume had been used as a disguise.
Soylu cited security forces' accounts as saying that the gunman had acted alone in staging the attack.
“There weren't multiple gunmen. He was wearing a coat and trousers. He went inside as he opened fire all around. And we were informed that he was wearing different clothes inside and he tried to get out. Our police forces are continuing to assess this information,” he noted.
Turkish police also said they have gotten hold of the taxi that the lone masked attacker took to the scene, and that they were dusting the vehicle for potential fingerprints left by the suspect.
Justice Ministry sources also said 38 of the victims had been identified -- 27 foreigners and 11 Turks, the Anadolu news agency reported.
Among the dead were an Israeli woman, three Indians, three Lebanese, a woman with dual French-Tunisian citizenship and her Tunisian husband, two Jordanians, a Belgian national, a Kuwaiti citizen and a Canadian.
The US State Department confirmed that a Delaware businessman, originally from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, was also among the wounded.
CCTV footage captured snippets of the attack at the Reina club when the assailant is seen shooting a customer and then disappearing from the frame.
Horror-stricken witnesses later spoke of the panic and bloodshed at the nightclub.
“We came here to have a good time today but everything was suddenly transformed into chaos and a night of horror,” Italian tourist Maximilien said.
Professional footballer Sefa Boydas also told AFP, “Just as we were settling down, by the door there was a lot of dust and smoke. Gunshots rang out.”
“People were walking on top of people,” he added.
Another survivor, Francois al-Asmar, from Lebanon, also recounted how he escaped death.
“I was saved by my passport which I was carrying right near my heart,” he told Lebanese television.
Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin has said the attacker, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the nightclub before entering and opening fire on people partying inside.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim visited Liv Hospital in the city to meet some of the injured victims.
No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
Turkey has come under many attacks over the past year, claimed by Kurdish militants and the Daesh Takfiri terror group, which operates in neighboring Syria and Iraq.
For the McCann fruit ‘n' veg dynasty, it's a case of back to the future.
Having sold Fyffes – which traces its roots back to 1902 when Charles McCann established a greengrocer on Clanbrassil Street in Dundalk – to Japan's Sumitomo Corporation last year for €751 million, the founder's descendents are getting back into the banana business.
Total Produce, the fresh produce group spun out of Fyffes in 2006 as a separately-listed company, announced on Thursday it is set to take a 45 per cent of Dole Foods, the world's largest fresh fruit group – which generates 43 per cent of its sales from bananas.
The McCanns own 11.3 per cent of Total Produce, which has an option to acquire all of Dole two years after the initial deal goes through. The announcement came less than four weeks after Dole owner David Murdock's talks to sell his company to Belgian food distributor Greenyard broke down and the nonagenarian pulled a back-up plan to float the company for a third time.
Still, the McCanns and Murdock have been orbiting each other for decades. Dole weighed buying Fyffes in 1993 and enjoyed looking on from the sidelines as Fyffes made an abortive bid in 2014 to take over rival Chiquita. (That plan was scuppered by the North Carolina group's own shareholders, who backed a rival takeover bid from two Brazilian companies instead.)
Total Produce chairman Carl McCann estimates that the Dole deal will add to his group's earnings within the first full year, with annual synergies and cost savings set to rise to $35 million (€28 million) over the medium term, from an initial $15 million to $20 million.
Goodbody Stockbrokers analysts Patrick Higgins and Jason Molins are fans of the combination, creating the world's largest fresh produce group with almost €8 billion of annual sales, noting that the deal values Dole at nine times operating earnings, compared to the 12.5 multiple the McCanns achieved for Fyffes last year.
The family is recycling some of the €87.5 million made from the sale of its 11.8 per cent stake in Fyffes last year into the Dole transaction, subscribing for €27 million of the €145 million of stock issued on Thursday to part fund the deal.
According to our calculations, their Total Produce stake is set to increase from 11.3 per cent to 12.6 per cent as a result.
It makes one wonder how much longer Carl's brother David will remain executive chairman of Fyffes, as Total Produce becomes a closer peer – and rival.
IFSC vehicles needn't fear the taxman
Operators in the darkest part of Ireland's $2.2 trillion (€1.76 billion) shadow banking hub – the ultra-tax efficient and unregulated world of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) used to hold assets from distressed debt to greenhouse gas credits – needn't worry too much about a visit from the taxman.
Figures released by the Department of Finance to Labour Party TD Joan Burton this week show the Revenue Commissioners completed five audits of such vehicles, known as section 110 companies, over the past two years.
That's a 0.12 per cent chance of an audit, based on the latest Central Bank figures showing that there are almost 2,000 such companies in existence.
The number of instances of when tax officials sought additional information from SPVs through “aspect queries” fell by 40 per cent last year to 203 – even as the Government clamped down in 2016 on so-called vulture funds' use of tax-efficient Section 110 companies to hold Irish property loans snapped up following the crisis.
Established under 1997 tax laws designed to make Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) an attractive place for “tax neutral” international debt securitisation deals, an example of how pervasive Irish SPVs are in the web of international finance could be seen last month in the collapse of Australia's largest sandalwood forest company.
Quintis, whose sandalwood oils are used in perfumes, cosmetics and medicines, called in administrators on January 19th after a Dublin-based special purpose vehicle connected to US hedge fund Davidson Kempner exercised an option requiring Quintis to buy almost 1,000 acres of plantations or Australian $37 million (€24 million).
It was the final straw for the already-struggling Quintis.
IFG set for break-up sale
Dublin-listed financial services firm IFG, best known here for its former mortgage brokerage business, has been surrounded by perennial speculation in recent years over whether it will be split up, sold on or taken private by its main shareholder and chairman, businessman John Gallagher.
The group gave a partial answer on Friday revealing that “greater value may be created by a sale of Saunderson House” – the company's most valuable business, an investment adviser focused on professionals in the City of London.
Assets under advice in the unit rose 11 per cent last year to £5.1 billion (€4.1 billion). Such businesses can command the equivalent of up to 3 per cent of assets under advices – pointing to a value of as much as £150 million, or 85 per cent of its current stock market value.
Meanwhile, news that IFG's other unit James Hay, a provider of self-invested pension plans (SIPPs) faces penalties of up to £20 million – as a result of an investigation by HM Revenue and Customers a biofuel investment product previously offered to clients – sent IFG shares tumbling as much as 16.5 per cent.
A successful Saundeson House deal might prompt Gallagher, or someone else, to take over and sort out the remaining business.

China's foreign minister Wang Yi has appealed for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula, and again urged all sides to find a peaceful way to resolve tensions.
“We know the situation is tense,” Mr Wang told a briefing in the Chinese capital Beijing. “The more tense things are, the more calm we need to be to find the opportunities and possibilities for dialogue.”
China is emerging as a possible peace-broker in the growing rift between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea's nuclear programme, which has seen it stage repeated atomic weapons tests and missile launches in the face of United Nations sanctions.
Although it has been an ally since it helped North Korea in the Korean War (1950-53), and helped prop up its faltering economy for many years, Beijing is becoming exasperated with the North's nuclear ambitions, which threaten to bring instability to China's borders.
China wants a return to six-party talks, chaired by it with both Koreas, the US, Russia and Japan, to find a deal. The often tortuous and fruitless talks collapsed in a stalemate in 2009, during the rule of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il.
Washington has also given powerful indications that it would use a military strike if necessary, pointing to recent actions in Syria, where it fired missiles on a government air base, and Afghanistan, where it dropped a huge bomb on an Islamic State target, as evidence of its readiness to intervene.
Mr Wang said he believed Washington was still more interested in multi-lateral talks.
Stricter sanctions
US vice president Mike Pence visited the demilitarised zone dividing Korea this week on his Asian tour, prompting North Korea's deputy UN ambassador, Kim In-ryong, to accuse US president Donald Trump of bringing the countries to the brink of thermonuclear war and turning the Korean peninsula into the “world's biggest hotspot”.
An editorial in the Chinese state newspaper Global Times said China was prepared to back stricter sanctions against the North, such as a ban on petroleum exports or even backing a US-imposed financial blockade on North Korea, but it was in no way prepared to back military strikes on North Korea.
If the US launched a heavy strike, “the Chinese people will not allow their government to remain passive when the armies of the US and South Korea start a war and try to take down the Pyongyang regime”, the Global Times said.
“The Chinese will not let something like that happen, especially on the same land where the Chinese Volunteer Army once fought in the early 1950s,” it said.
At the same time, relations between South Korea and China have hit rock-bottom over the South's decision to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) anti-missile system, ostensibly to defend against increased belligerence from the North.
China believes Thaad can be used strategically against its missiles and has launched a de facto boycott campaign against South Korea, especially against products from Lotte, which sold the golf course land on which Thaad is being built, and also banned tourism packages.
South Korean companies doing business in China felt that current trade conditions had never been worse.
South Korea's business sentiment index showed that South Korean firms doing business in China felt that business conditions in the neighbouring land were the worst ever, largely due to restrictions, although also due to market competition.
Muslims awake thanks to Ramadan may have been the first ones to notice the fire engulfing the building, prompting them to alert others about the structure.
The horrific Grenfell Tower fire that, so far, killed at least 12 people, could have seen a greater number of fatalities if not for the building's Muslim residents. Muslims who happened to be awake for Ramadan the night of the fire are being singled out as heroes for their potential involvement in saving the lives of people who may have otherwise perished.
According to The Independent, some residents of the 24-story Grenfell Tower were awake early in the morning because of the last supper of Ramadan, and they may have been some of the first to notice the fire as many said they didn't hear any alarms.
As the fire started just after midnight, most people in the building were asleep. Muslims who were awake to observe their religious duties, on the other hand, were the first on the scene.
To resident Andre Barroso, 33, it's clear that “Muslims played a big part in getting a lot of people out.”
“Most of the people I could see were Muslim. They have also been providing food and clothes,” Barroso added.

Rashida, a local resident, agrees. When talking to reporters, Telegraph reports, she said that Muslims often stay up until 2 a.m. while observing Ramadan as they do their last prayer after the late night meal. She believes Muslims saved people's lives because they were the first to notice the fire.
Nadia Yousuf, 29, also told reporters that Muslim residents were among the first to realize something was going on.
"They saw it just after they woke up to eat", she claimed.
Noticing the fire as soon as it began to spread, they may have been able to alert others and help them get out of the building in time, saving countless lives.
While an official report on the number of Muslims who actually helped at the scene hasn't been produced yet, accounts from people who talked to reporters seem to back this scenario, prompting us to question whether those who immediately demonize an entire religion whenever a terrorist attack occurs will be praising Muslims for having saved lives during the London fire.
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi's governor has signed the nation's tightest abortion restrictions into law.
Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510 on Monday afternoon. It becomes law immediately and bans most abortions after 15 weeks' gestation. Bryant has frequently said he wants Mississippi to be the "safest place in America for an unborn child."
The law's only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it "incompatible with life" outside of the womb at full term, or if a pregnant woman's life or a "major bodily function" is threatened by pregnancy. Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest aren't exempted.
Abortion rights advocates are calling the law unconstitutional because it limits abortion before fetuses can live outside the womb. The owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic opposes the law and has pledged to sue.
CANTON, Miss. (AP) — Nissan Motor Co. says it will increase van production at its Mississippi plant, adding a second shift in April.
The company made the announcement Monday as it marked the 4 millionth vehicle produced at the plant since it opened in 2003.
Spokeswoman Lloryn Love-Carter says about 250 workers will be redeployed from other areas to staff the second shift assembling NV vans. The Canton plant is the only plant worldwide that makes the large vans for Nissan. The Japanese automaker sold about 18,000 NV vans in the United States last year, according to company figures.
About 6,400 Nissan employees and contractors work at the Canton complex.

The plant is donating a NV van to a Canton soup kitchen, Our Daily Bread Ministries, to mark its 4 millionth vehicle.
FOR Bundaberg woman Skye Dempsey, necessity truly was the mother of invention.
Unable to find any canine clothes that were quite right for her foxy chihuahua cross Lily, she decided to make her own.
"I could not find a pair of PJs in Bundaberg that fit her,” she said, adding that commercial dog pyjamas often didn't come long enough to cover her pet's body.
Soon Miss Dempsey found herself making pyjamas and dresses for other dogs, and Skye's Puppy PJs was born.
"I learnt to sew from mum and I got into it because of Lily,” she said.
"I was just like, 'why aren't I selling these?'.
Starting to sell them at the end of winter last year, Miss Dempsey said she had stitched about 80 outfits last year alone.

"One lady bought eight - four summer pairs and four winter pairs,” she said.
"Her dog is allergic to grass so she bought a whole wardrobe.”
Miss Dempsey said with the garments being made to order, she could either take measurements or let owners do it if they lived in another location.
"I've sent some to Melbourne and Sydney and a few on the Gold Coast,” she said.
"They can measure their own dog and I'll send it to them.
"I'll send them photos of materials and they can select what they want.”
Miss Dempsey said there were different reasons for owners dressing their dogs, ranging from allergies to making sure their furbabies kept warm.
Pet owners can check out Miss Dempsey's Facebook group, "Hand Made Puppy PJ's” or call 0421 738 170.
He said the Montreal heat exposure victims were between 50 and 80.
"None of the people we've identified in the last four days had air conditioning at home," Kaiser noted.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted condolences to the relatives of the Quebec victims.
No deaths have been reported in other provinces. In Ontario, a spokeswoman for the coroner's office said it couldn't confirm if there were any heat-related deaths, adding it could take weeks or several months to complete such probes.
Kaiser said one reason Quebec has been reporting so many deaths is because it's part of the province's extreme heat plan, where health officials work in tandem with first responders and emergency rooms to track down potential cases of heat-related illnesses and deaths.
"We go out to the paramedics, we go out to the hospitals and we ask them to make sure to identify any deaths they believe are related to heat and that allows us to intervene more quickly," Kaiser said.
He cited a case in recent days in which a death in a home for the elderly led authorities to move five other people deemed at risk to a facility equipped with air conditioning.
Police and firefighters also continued to go door to door in areas identified as having people considered at high risk: those with chronic illness or mental-health problems, those who live alone and people without air conditioning at home.
Also on Wednesday, the ambulance service that serves a large swath of the Montreal area called on people to refrain from calling unless it is a real emergency.
Urgences-sante said it has been inundated by the volume of calls — 1,200 calls per day in Montreal and nearby Laval over the past four days, which is 30 per cent more than usual on busy days.

WHEN unlicensed driver James Kendal Whiteman hit the road on October 21, he was unaware his licence had expired 16 days earlier.
Whiteman, 35, was pulled over by Bundaberg police along Hanbury St, Bundaberg North, at 4.25pm and was informed of his oversight.
Whiteman told Bundaberg Magistrates Court that he had recently obtained full-time work at North Bundaberg.
"You'll be walking or riding a bike,” Magistrate Belinda Merrin told Whiteman.
Whiteman pleaded guilty to driving unlicensed and due to his "significant traffic history” was fined $500 and disqualified from driving for one month.
"You know the consequences of driving within the next month,” Ms Merrin said.
"Not going to happen,” Whiteman said before he left the courtroom.

The future only looks bright for America's hottest prisoner after a life-changing 2016.
Less than a year after he was released from prison in March 2016, Jeremy Meeks happily showed off his new life as he posed with his family by the Christmas tree.
The model then celebrated his eight-year anniversary with his wife before ringing in the New Year, Daily Mail reports.
A photo posted by JEREMY MEEKS (@jmeeksofficial) on Dec 27, 2016 at 3:59pm PST
"Through thick and thin," he wrote in the caption of the picture of the two of them, happily posing at a vineyard as she clutched a bottle of wine.
Meeks first shot to fame in 2014 when his mugshot was posted on the Stockton Police Department's Facebook page.
Three years has done little to dim his success, and Meeks has been happily showing off the rewards of his career on his Instagram page.
In one photo the 32-year-old Meeks poses with his US$125,000 Maserati car in front of a beautiful mansion.

"Good to be home," the caption reads.
Another shot shows the model posing shirtless in front of his mansion, which is complete with a water fountain in the front yard and a perfectly groomed lawn.
"God is good," he wrote alongside the photo, as his fans congratulated him for his recent success.

"They need to do a Lifetime movie about your life," one of them commented.
Meeks was handed a 27-month jail term in 2015 after being charged with illegally possessing firearms and ammo, carrying a loaded firearm in public and criminal street gang activity.
From the small town of Stockton in northern California prior to his arrest, Meeks was brought up in a poor household and began his life of crime after becoming involved with the Northern Crips - a branch of the notorious Los Angeles gang.
He married a local nurse named Melissa, who had two children, at 24 and went on to have a son, now seven, with his wife.
When he was arrested in June 2014 as part of a crackdown on gangs by the Stockton police department, he was charged with five weapons offenses and two counts relating to gang membership.

But two years away did little to dim Meeks' mugshot fame.
Meeks signed with talent agency White Cross Management last year and his manager Jim Jordan said he has received offers from all over the world.
Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online last year, Jordan said that the "humble" Meeks is nothing like the hard man image conveyed by his life of crime and gang tattoos, and is instead a "soft-spoken family man" who has been left totally overwhelmed by all the attention.

The proof of that is in Meeks' Instagram page, which is full of shots of him and his family.
Meeks recently posed a selfie with his son, who he affectionately calls his "mini-me", as they celebrated the boy's seventh birthday in the snow.
The two smiled happily for the camera, showing off their matching ice blue eyes.
Another cute photo shows Meeks and his family on the front porch of their home, decorated for Halloween, as his two sons wear matching costumes for the holiday.

The presidents of Iran and Russia have discussed the latest mutual, regional and international issues, particularly the developments in Syria in a telephone conversation.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, held the phone conversation on Monday in which the two presidents urged coordinated efforts to put an end to the six-year conflict in the Arab country.
Syria has been fighting different foreign-sponsored militant and terrorist groups since March 2011. Russia and Iran have been the main international backers of the Syrian government in its battle against foreign-backed terrorists.
At Damascus' request, Iran has been providing military advisory support to the Syrian military in its counterterrorism operations.
Moscow launched its campaign against Daesh and other militant groups in Syria upon a request from Damascus in September 2015. Its airstrikes have helped Syrian forces carry out effective counterterrorism operations against foreign-backed militants operating in the country since 2011.
In April, Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Shoigu and Fahd Jassem al-Freij, called for closer trilateral cooperation in the battle against terrorism, emphasizing the need to keep up the fight until the eradication of violence and terror threats.
They also called for “convergent efforts” by Tehran, Moscow and Damascus towards uprooting violence and Takfiri terrorism.
The kremlin released a statement on Monday, saying that in another part of their conversation, Putin discussed energy projects between the two countries with his Iranian counterpart.
The Kremlin added that the conversation was about "joint projects in the oil and gas, electricity and transport sectors," while some issues on the international agenda were also discussed.

The BMW M760i is one hell of a car . It might not be a fully realized M Division product, but its 600 horsepower 6.6-liter twin-turbocharged V12 provides more than enough oomph to make up for slightly soft suspension and relatively vague steering. We can't imagine anyone takes a car like this to a track anyway. There are plenty of other BMWs far more suited to hot laps on a closed circuit. Still, thanks to this video from AutoTopNL, the M760i might just be the German automaker's best highway cruise missile.The point-of-view video shows a driver taking out a long-wheelbase M760i — the only version available in the U.S. — out on a stretch of Autobahn. This car is apparently equipped with the M Driver's Package, something not available in the U.S. That option raises the top speed from 155 mph to 190 mph, or 305 kph. It's interesting then that the speedometer in the video shows the car hitting 320 kmh, or 199 mph.It's unclear whether that's a false number or if BMW's top-speed rating is slightly conservative. Lots of automakers misreport horsepower ratings, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch for BMW to undersell the car's capabilities. Either way, it's a hugely impressive number. Just as impressive is the composure the car seems to have at those speeds. The driver apparently feels comfortable enough behind the wheel to keep at it for a while.
They're locked together at the top of New Zealand's test centurymakers list but what have Martin Crowe, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor's finest achievements been among their 17 hundreds?
It's purely subjective, but here's three of their best….
Martin Crowe:
1: 188: v Australia, Brisbane November, 1985.
Part of perhaps New Zealand's most comprehensive test victory over a major nation, certainly to that point. Crowe was aided by John R. Reid's 108 as he pushed New Zealand to 553 for seven and an innings and 41-run victory. Richard Hadlee's 15 wickets was the other part of New Zealand's dream victory. It was Crowe's third century – he batted 472 minutes, faced 328 balls and hit 26 fours - and with his on drive working expertly, a picture perfect demonstration of the batting arts.
2: 108 not out: v Pakistan, Lahore, October 1990
A stunning achievement against Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and legspinning genius Abdul Qadir in their backyard. Crowe battled 552 minutes, faced 306 balls, hit 14 fours and a six in a remarkable demonstration of skill, concentration and sheer resolve not to be beaten. He was unconquered too, but Pakistan won by nine wickets.

3: 115: v England, Manchester, June 1994
The last of Crowe's 17 and put this down as an innings loaded with courage. By this time he was effectively batting on one leg. He spent five and a half hours at the crease, faced 237 balls with 15 fours. New Zealand were in trouble, following on 231 runs behind, but Crowe made the match safe. There were to be seven more tests but this was Crowe's final masterpiece.
Ross Taylor, Martin Crowe or Kane Williamson - who is New Zealand's greatest test batsman?
Kane Williamson:
1: 102 not out: v South Africa, Wellington, March 2012
Had it not been for Williamson's performance this test would have been lost. He came in with New Zealand, needing an improbable 389 to win, at two for one and walked off to a standing ovation five and a half hours later. Williamson took a painful blow in the most tender of places from Dale Steyn but fought on and earned a fabulous reward.
2: 140: v Australia, Brisbane, November 2015
In here for the impact it had on an Australian press box, who generally peer into their racing form guides when New Zealanders are batting. This time they sat up, murmuring their approval and more than one ''Jeez look at that'' as Williamson found the boundary 24 times against a quality attack of Starc, Johnson and Hazlewood. Terrific innings. New Zealand lost by 208 runs but remembering Australians only really rate batsmen who score big against them, this had real impact in terms of the way Williamson is viewed across the Tasman. ''This bloke can play'' said one experienced Australian watcher. That's high praise indeed.
3: 108 not out: v Sri Lanka, Hamilton, December 2015
Maybe an odd one for some but this was the test both bowling attacks decided to pitch damn near everything halfway down the pitch leading to some extraordinary periods and field placings. Not a great watch but Williamson came in at 11 for two, New Zealand chasing 189. Williamson coped with an oddly-paced pitch expertly, scoring 108 not out of 185 while he was at the crease and calmed New Zealand nerves. Only one other batsman, Martin Guptill, got to 50 in the match. This could easily have gone pear-shaped for New Zealand but for Williamson's skill.
‌
Ross Taylor:
1: 120 v England, Hamilton, March 2008
Taylor has talked of the importance of these innings. He'd played two tests in South Africa, and struggled, was dropped for the subsequent visit of Bangladesh before being recalled. This century told him that, yes, he did belong, he could foot it with the big boys. Taylor batted almost five and a half hours, struck 18 fours in an innings which announced him as a true test batsman. Hard to overstate the importance of the innings in what has followed in the last nine years.
2: 290 v Australia, Perth November 2015
Look at the number. The pitch at the Waca was a road but still any time you get that high it's special. Last man out too, 10 runs short of becoming the second player to 300 for New Zealand, after Brendon McCullum a year earlier. He hit the fence 43 times, batted nine and a half hours and it was against Australia, which matters to New Zealanders.
3: 142 v Sri Lanka, Colombo, November 2012
A tight call. His 154 at Manchester in 2008 is a contender, as is 131 against Sunil Narine in Hamilton in 2013. But this proved to be Taylor's last test as captain and what surely must have been a difficult time. It might, therefore, contain an element of 'stuff you lot' about it. Taylor shared a 262-run stand with Williamson to set up New Zealand's first innings, he made another brisk 74 in the second innings, the bowlers did their part and New Zealand won by a whopping 167 runs. Taylor batted six and a half hours in the sapping heat and should always reflect on a performance to savour.
Guillermo del Toro's Cold War-era fairytale The Shape of Water has swum away with a leading seven nominations from the Golden Globes, while the HBO drama Big Little Lies led television nominees with six nods.
In what's being viewed as a wide-open Oscar race so far, several films followed closely behind The Shape of Water, including Steven Spielberg's Pentagon Papers drama The Post, with six nominations, including the best actress for Meryl Streep and best actor for Tom Hanks.
Martin McDonagh's revenge drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri also got a major boost in the nominations announced today in Beverly Hills, California, with six nods, including the best actress for Frances McDormand and supporting actor for Sam Rockwell.

But as the most prominent platform yet in Hollywood's awards season to confront the post-Harvey Weinstein landscape, the Globes also enthusiastically supported Ridley Scott's J Paul Getty drama All the Money in the World.

Christopher Plummer, who replaced Kevin Spacey in the film, was nominated for best supporting actor. Scott was also nominated for best director and Michelle Williams for best actress.
A rough cut of the film was screened for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which puts on the Globes. Scott is quickly re-editing the movie to eradicate Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous men.
"It must have been a herculean effort, because Christopher Plummer is all the way through the movie," said Meher Tatna, president of the press association. "He really pulled off the impossible."
Notably left out were frequent Globes-nominees House of Cards and Transparent, two of the TV shows affected by the cascading fallout of sexual harassment allegations in the wake of Harvey Weinstein's ouster. As usual, the nominations were partly announced on NBC's Today show, where Matt Lauer was recently fired following allegations of sexual misconduct.
Along with The Shape of Water, Three Billboards and The Post, the nominees for best drama were the tender young romance Call Me By Your Name (which also landed nods for stars Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer) and Christopher Nolan's World War II epic Dunkirk.

But setting itself apart from the pack was the monster fable The Shape of Water, which stars Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaning woman who falls in love with a captive amphibious creature. No film was more widely celebrated, with nods including del Toro's directing and Alexandre Desplat's sumptuous score.
"I believe in magic and this is a magical thing," said Hawkins.
The best picture comedy or musical category was led by a handful of Oscar favourites — Greta Gerwig's mother-daughter tale Lady Bird, Jordan Peele's horror sensation Get Out — as well as a handful of others: James Franco's making-of The Room comedy The Disaster Artist, the upcoming musical The Greatest Showman and the Tonya Harding comic-drama I, Tonya.
Despite considerable backlash, Get Out ended up on the comedy side of the Globes after being submitted that way by Universal Pictures. Peele himself slyly commented on the controversy, calling his social critique of latent racism "a documentary". The Globes passed over Peele's script, but newcomer Daniel Kaluuya was nominated for best actor in a comedy.
Though some predicted and feared an acting field lacking diversity, the nominees were fairly inclusive. Denzel Washington (Roman J Israel, Esq), Mary J Blige (Mudbound), Hong Chau (Downsizing) and Octavia Spencer (The Shape of Water) were among the 30 film acting nominees.
But the best director category remained all-male, as it has for most Globes and Academy Awards history. Many hoped for a different story in a year where a parade of sexual harassment scandals have laid bare Hollywood's gender imbalances. But contenders like Gerwig, Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman) and Dee Rees (Mudbound) were overlooked for a group of Spielberg, del Toro, Nolan, McDonagh and Scott.

The morning's biggest surprise, aside from the success of All the Money in the World, might have been the complete omission of the romantic comedy The Big Sick, penned by real-life couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V Gordon. Another Oscar underdog, The Florida Project, emerged with only one nomination, for Willem Dafoe's supporting performance as the manager of a low-rent motel.
In the television categories, the Emmy-winning Big Little Lies earned a host of acting nods (Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Alexander Skarsgard, Laura Dern) as well as best limited series. (HBO recently announced a second season for Big Little Lies, which will change its category in other awards shows.)
FX's Bette Davis and Joan Crawford chronicle Feud: Bette and Joan landed four nominations, including nods for Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon. Amazon's just-debuted The Marvelous Mrs Maisel scored two nods, including the best comedy series. Also with multiple nominations were Netflix's Stranger Things, Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale and NBC's This Is Us. HBO's Game of Thrones received a nod for best drama series, but nothing for its cast.
Gary Oldman, nominated for best actor for his Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour, said the sexual misconduct scandals have cast an unusual pall over an awards season where Weinstein was for decades a dominant force.
"How should we celebrate? Well, I don't think any of it's funny, so I guess that people will stay away from it in the ceremony," said Oldman by phone Monday. "It's evolution, and it's good that we sort of start to check ourselves about what we do and what we say and how we do it and how we say it to people, so I think it's ultimately a good thing. But I can't see too much of this coming up in (the show), up there on the platform, as it were, on the podium."
The Globes haven't traditionally predicted the Oscars, but they did last January. The Globes best-picture winners — Moonlight and La La Land — both ultimately ended up on the stage for the final award of the Oscars, with Moonlight emerging victorious only after the infamous envelope flub. The press association, which has worked in recent years to curtail its reputation for odd choices, is composed of approximately 90 freelance international journalists.
The last Globes broadcast, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, averaged 20 million viewers, an upswing of 8 percent, according to Nielsen. This year, Seth Meyers, will host the January 7 ceremony. He will have his hands full trying to keep a famously frothy show light amid such dark scandals for the movie industry.
Last year's Cecil B DeMille lifetime achievement honoree, Streep, spoke forcefully against then President-elect Donald Trump, shortly before his inauguration. Trump the next day criticized the actress as "overrated".
This year, Streep — along with Spielberg and Hanks — return with a pointed and timely drama about the power of the press to counter lies emanating from the White House.
Said Streep in a statement: "I'm thrilled for the movie, for Steven and Tom, and for the incredible ensemble of actors who made this movie need its moment in history."

Jacinda Ardern and Government welcomed on to Karetu Marae
The sound of warriors welcoming the Prime Minister onto Kelvin Davis' marae sent a booming echo across the valley at Karetu.
The actress chaired a charity gala on the centenary of his birth.
Ugly Betty star Vanessa Williams has said how much Nelson Mandela's leadership is missed today, at an event marking the centenary of his birth.
The actress said the former South African president's leadership is lacking on the world stage.
Arriving at the Nelson Mandela Global Gift gala in London, of which she is honorary chair, she told the Press Association: “We could certainly use his grace at this moment in time.

“I unfortunately never got a chance to meet him in my lifetime. I had an opportunity but it didn't work out.
“But I visited Robben Island. I know about his legacy and the impact it had not only on South Africa but the entire world. And it lives on, no matter how long it's been since he's passed. What he did lives on.
“I'm honoured to be the honorary chair of Global and particularly to be honouring the Nelson Mandela foundation. It's wonderful to be able to continue his work.”
Singer Beverley Knight, who performed for the South African leader twice in his lieftime, also sang at the gala dinner.

She said: “I could feel him before I saw him. I was in my dressing room and in walks the South African High Commissioner, Tony Blair, who wasn't long in the job as Prime Minister, and Richard E Grant, as you do!
“And then I just sensed this presence, and in walked Mandela. And I was like ‘This is insane!'
“The thing that sticks with me is that he showed me his hands, which were quite rough, and he said ‘this is from years of being at Robben Island, and even though my hands look like this, my heart is still really soft'.
“Honestly, it was the most profound wisdom that had ever been spoken to me. I just loved the man.”
Knight said the current class of global leaders could learn from Mandela, adding: “The grace, the altruism, the leadership. His sincerity is sorely, sorely lacking right now. We need somebody to step into that vacuum.
“The world at the moment feels so nationalistic and not in a positive way, everyone is pursuing isolationist polices. We miss Mandela so much.

“I feel like I shouldn't be here really, it's so glam with all the photographers and the red carpet, it's all a bit overwhelming, but it's for a great cause.”

LISTED Philab Holdings Corp. is planning to acquire 67-percent equity in Sydenham Laboratories, Inc., subject to the approval of the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Sydenham is a manufacturer of hormone-based drugs and specializes in oral drug preparation in dosage forms such as tablet, syrup, capsule, and powder for suspension.
It is also known for its long line of drugs with over 300 certificates of product registration, as well as food additives production utilized for its nutritional benefit and several medicines.
In a disclosure to the local bourse on Monday, Philab President and Chairman Thomas Navasero said the planned acquisition will allow the company to enhance product services, especially in the generic line.
Following the merger with Sydenham, Philab is slated to launch a program in support of precision medicine that will enable both firms to maximize synergies and prowess in the healthcare field.
“With this program, a new area of Pharmacogenomics will be developed, an innovation in healthcare technology which allows individuals to determine the most effective medication therapy treatment based on their genetic makeup,” Navasero said.
“The future of pharmaceuticals will be personalized through your genetic make-up. It is the goal of Philab Holdings through the acquisition of Sydenham Lab to lead in precision medicine and pharmacogenomics in Asia,” he added.
Philab said it is confident that the merger will also pave the way for a more competitive line of generic drugs at a lower price alternative.
Last week, Philab announced plans to issue 100 million common shares priced at P2.50 apiece from its unissued authorized capital stock, to be entirely acquired by Epitrek Ventures Ltd., an existing shareholder of Philab.
The subscription will increase Epitrek's stake in Philab to 200 million shares equivalent to a 9.2 percent interest.
Following the subscription deal, Philab's outstanding capital stock will increase to 2.16 billion shares from 2.06 billion shares.
Philab is engaged in the life sciences tools and services industry, catering to both public and private institutions, before it ventured into supplying In Vitro Diagnostics test kits.
A-THREE-YEAR old baby boy fell into a well and drowned while his mother was allegedly having sex at her boyfriend's house in Bulawayo.
Police on Monday rescued the couple after Cowdray Park residents bayed for their blood.
An angry mob that was accusing the couple of being irresponsible by causing the drowning of the baby had gathered around 6pm, demanding “justice.”
The now deceased (name withheld) was allegedly playing outside his mother's boyfriend's house when he fell into an uncovered well and drowned.
Miss Lubelihle Hadebe (20), who stays with her great grandmother, had visited her boyfriend Mr Victor Moyo's house, in the same neighbourhood.
Miss Hadebe's other son is a year old and the children have different fathers.
Residents told The Chronicle news crew that their screams and cries alarmed the pair that was inside the house having some quality time.
Bulawayo Metropolitan police spokesperson Inspector Precious Simango confirmed the tot's death.
“We received a case of sudden death of a three-year old baby who fell into a 2 metre well and drowned yesterday (Monday) evening. The baby's mother was inside the house when her baby fell into a well between two houses.
“We encourage residents to always cover pits and wells to avoid such dangers. Mothers should always learn to monitor babies at all times to protect them from being injured or even losing their lives like in this incident,” she said.
It is alleged that the baby was first given some food and after eating, he walked out of the house without the pair noticing.
Fuming residents said the child's mother deserved a thorough beating for neglecting her child over a lover.
“How can you close doors for sex leaving a three-year-old child alone outside? So they thought giving the child food to eat was caring enough? God has punished the woman and now how does she feel, having portrayed herself as the most irresponsible mother we have ever seen.
“If it weren't for police, the couple would have been in hospital right now. We wanted to teach them a lesson they would never forget,” said the sources that preferred anonymity.
Lubelihle's great grandmother, Ms Eliza Hadebe said it was sad they had lost a baby in such a manner.
“As you can see I'm very old and blind. I can't say much as everything came to me as a story. I was here and the whole mishap came to me as hearsay. This is really a sad time,” she said.
Ms Hadebe referred the news crew to residents who discovered the floating body, for more details. Chronicle

Ashley Landis/Staff Photographer Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki (41) walks off the Oklahoma City Thunder court after the Mavs lost game 5 of their series 118-104 in the first round of NBA playoffs on Monday, April 25, 2016 at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Kevin Sherrington, sports columnist for SportsDayDFW.com and The Dallas Morning News, answers your questions about the Cowboys, Rangers, Mavericks and local college sports in a live chat recently. Here are some highlights:
Question: What should be more important to the Mavericks -- competing for a playoff spot in potentially Dirk's final season or keeping more of a long-term approach, especially with another first round pick next season? Kevin Sherrington: They need to go through the lottery again. I guess you could make the case that they can do that after Dirk's gone, but then you've delayed the rehab another year. Is it worth it, just to try to get Dirk a one-and-done? I don't think so.
It'll take some magical drafting, but come 2020 the Mavs could be the next dominant team in the NBA
Question: If you have your choice of point guards Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina with the Mavs' No. 9 draft pick, who are you taking and why? Kevin Sherrington: From what I can tell, Smith is more prepared to play right now, and Ntilikina is more of a project. But may have a higher ceiling. I think their preference is the latter, probably as it should be. Question: Is there any reason the Mavs should consider trading down in the draft next week? Kevin Sherrington: Only if Jerry Jones has taken charge of the war room. Question: Do you think we've seen the last of Devin Harris in a Mavs' jersey considering his non-guaranteed contract? Kevin Sherrington: Yes, I'd say pretty good chance of that. Click here to view the full chat.
President Donald Trump approved the House Intelligence Committee to release the classified Nunes memo on the alleged abuse of the surveillance act by the FBI.
The memo argues that the FBI would not have received a surveillance warrant from the FISA court for Carter Page, a former Trump policy advisor during the 2016 presidential campaign, without the Steele dossier.
The memo also says that it was not revealed to the court that the dossier, which alleges collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, was funded in part by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. It also alleges that Christopher Steele, who was behind the dossier, said he “was desperate” to keep Trump from ascending to the White House.

This fun, fluffy doc lacks guts, grit and integrity
Film | by Jorge Ignacio Castillo
Always At The Carlyle
Roxy Theatre
Opens July 6
Real-Life Goldfinger Donald Trump can call it “a joke” all he wants, but The Carlyle really is one of New York's most legendary hotels. The grand old establishment is known for its classy art deco design, impressive clientele (from Jack Nicholson to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) and, above all, a fierce code of silence.
Never mind the staff's refusal to gossip: the documentary Always At The Carlyle has stories for days. The hosts may refuse to blab but the guests are happy to. Some of the events that took place in the hotel are the stuff of legend: Marilyn Monroe's killer rendition of “Happy Birthday”; Paul Newman's experiments with vinaigrette; an elevator ride including Princess Diana, Michael Jackson and Steve Jobs. And that's just what we know.
More than following a cinematic structure, the film focuses on the hotel's most popular areas one at the time: the ridiculously expensive rooms, the Bemelmans Bar and the mythical Café Carlyle. The tone is relentlessly positive, so much so, it feels a bit like a 90-minute long infomercial. Clearly the hotel wouldn't have been as accommodating otherwise.
I have two major problems with Always At The Carlyle. As fascinating as the New York landmark is, the film feels like a celebration of the rich and famous, even though the staff (the majority of whom are immigrants) have more compelling stories than any A-listers. Of all people, Harrison Ford comes the closest to hitting the nail on the head by pointing out the irrationality of paying $1,100 a night for an hotel room.
The second issue is the decision of the film's producers to excise a Woody Allen interview. As problematic as the filmmaker may be, Woody is one of the most recognizable mainstays of the Carlyle (he's played clarinet every Monday at the Café for decades), and a couple of passing references just don't cut it. Of all genres, a documentary needs the courage of its convictions — even a fluffier doc like this.
Regardless of my misgivings over the film I'll be damned if I wouldn't stay at The Carlyle given an opportunity.
It started with a post on Reddit.
We'll let Reddit co-founder (and husband of Serena Williams) Alexis Ohanian explain (via his Instagram account):
After news of our engagement broke, a young man in Kentucky named Jarod reached out with congratulations and also a request for a dear family friend, Denise (aka, his “Née Née”).
–
He wrote, “I grew up watching tennis with my Mom's best friend and why I consider you my all-time favorite athlete. She watches every single tennis match she possibly can, scheduling her limited vacation times around tournaments just to be able to watch every match. She dropped out of high school almost 35 years ago to support her family and works 70+ hours a week, sacrificing her health and free time to support them… Just this month she lost her dad to a heart attack and her sister to pneumonia. I just got home from her sisters funeral an hour ago. As you can guess it has been an awful Christmas season for her. Is there any way you could either send her a card or tennis ball to cheer her up?”
As Ohanian shared on the day Williams returned to the French Open, the tennis legend saw the message and sent a signed tennis ball and a note last year.
Again, from Ohanian:
“I'm grateful for all the people around the world who adore my wife; the world. This particular story moved all the people who upvoted it, but also us. After she won the Australian Open in 2017, Serena signed one of her practice balls for “Née Née” and I mailed it out. Jarod recorded a video of the surprise last year and said it was OK for me to share it today.

Cancer survivor Carter Milaney isn't sure what he would do if he met the 21-year-old that donated his bone marrow which helped save Carter's life.
Carter and his mother Marla Milaney, cut into his birthday cake a little early Tuesday, at the Kelowna Blood Clinic on Dilworth Drive. He turns 13 next week.
He was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma year and a half ago, according to a Canadian Blood Clinic news release.
“As part of his treatment, Carter endured more than 12 rounds of chemotherapy. In his first nine months of care, he also received more than 15 transfusions of blood products and required a bone marrow transplant to save his life. On May 12, he will be two years post-transplant and cancer-free.”
The Kelowna Christian School student called it exciting and nerve-wracking to possibly meet his saviour, which he might do May 12.
“It was kinda weird because it was this 21-year-old guy who I've never met, and you're almost shocked. Why would a 21-year-old guy from somewhere donate blood? Before I wouldn't have thought about donating blood or registering to give bone marrow,” said Carter.
At the blood clinic, Carter's friends and family sighed up to donate blood throughout the day.

“The family wanted a way to give back and encourage the community to say ‘you know what, if you need a reason to give, Carter's a really good reason to do that,'” said Marla.
We're celebrating today the fact he is in remission and that the blood and blood products he received did help him through his recovery,” said Gayle Voyer, with Canadian Blood Services. “Every day there are a lot of patients in need and Carter is one of those examples.”
To donate blood, certain requirements have to be met. Gay men have to wait a year after their last sexual encounter, a policy changed in 2016 that previously banned gay men from donating at all.
Voyer said the eligibility requirements are regulated by Health Canada.
“It's another policy in place to make sure the blood system remains in place, we actually just received some funding from the government to do further research to update that policy,” said Voyer. “We've just received from funding from the government, to actually update that policy.”
She says if you can't donate, help out in a different way by spreading awareness.

After 10 years of lean, threadbare, Lilliputian tales, Marvel Studios has, thank heavens, finally decided to go big.
The scale of "Avengers: Infinity War," of course, isn't a departure for Marvel. It's an apotheosis. But is it possible to supersize what is already colossal? "Infinity War," which brings together more than 30 significant characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and enough spandex to clothe a small nation, is a little like launching an invasion after the war was already won. Despite assured dominance, Marvel has gone nuclear.
"Infinity" is an interesting word for the Marvel machine, which sets much of its development pipeline a decade in advance. Never-ending is indeed how the superhero era of blockbusterdom sometimes feels, both to its fans and its critics. Even Steven Spielberg, who once said superheroes will eventually go the way of the western, recently signed on to produce a DC Comics film.
But the title refers to the six "infinity stones" scattered around the universe, each conveying a power of sorcery, like the time-warping one held by Doctor Strange. They are dearly sought by Thanos, the indestructible Titan warlord, who rules over much of space but would like all of it. With all the McGuffins — er, stones — he can, with the snap of his fingers, wipe away half of the universe's beings: a rapture to cull an overgrown herd, he envisions.

And it's, in part, the lure of finality that has made "Infinity War," directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (veterans of two "Captain America" movies), one of the year's most salivated-over movies. The preamble has been one long tease — we have seen fleeting glimpses of Thanos (Josh Brolin) since Barack Obama's first term — leading up to a battle royal that could mean the demise of some of Marvel's most famous faces.
It can be hard to know who or what to root for. Arguably the best quality — and most vital asset — of the Marvel canon is its star-making (or at least star-expanding) power. On the one hand, Chris Pratt's performance as Star-Lord in "The Guardians of the Galaxy" has been terrific and turned him into a household name. On the other hand, we've hardly seen Robert Downey Jr. outside of the Iron Man suit in the last decade. It took 18 months to shoot both parts of "Infinity War" back-to-back (the sequel is due out next summer), putting a stranglehold on some of our best movie stars, like Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Mackie. Faint cries can be heard on the street of: "Let our Ruffalo go!"
And it's really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes "Infinity War" — an "Ocean's Eleven" in hyper drive — work. The screenplay, by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, spreads the heroes around in improvised groups that create some funny dynamics. The Guardians, who inject most of the life to "Infinity War," swoon for Hemsworth's one-eyed Thor. "He's like a pirate had a baby with an angel," says Dave Bautista's Drax. Many don't know each other, or the parameters of their shared "cinematic universe." ''There's an Ant-Man AND a Spider-Man?" remarks Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, a.k.a. the Hulk.
The level playing field is a chance to rebalance the Marvel pecking order, most recently upended by Chadwick Boseman and "Black Panther." Neither Chris Evans' Captain "Cap" America nor Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example, make much of an impact on "Infinity War." But Zoe Saldana, as the green-skinned Gamora, strides to the fore, as does Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. "Infinity War" rarely, surprisingly feels as overstuffed as such a superhero smorgasbord ought to, a testament to the filmmakers' adept plate-spinning skills.
That may be because "Infinity War" doesn't really belong to the superheroes. This is Brolin's film. Already an actor who can appear chiseled from granite, his Thanos is an imposing boulder of a villain, with weary eyes and lined creases running down his massive chin. He and his adoptive daughter, Gamora, are the only characters with much of a story in "Infinity War." He's the immovable object around which the gaggle of superheroes orbits.
There may be some hint of overpopulation anxiety in Thanos' ambition and in the Russos' frighteningly overcrowded film. Its saviors repeatedly contemplate sacrifice. Previous "Avengers" chapters and the Russos' "Captain America: Civil War" expended some effort considering the Avengers' place in society and whether they should be controlled by the state. But this movie, a sensory onslaught, has little room for political subtext.
Still, I doubt such gestures of allegory are anyone's favorite part of the Marvel movies. Most come for the action, the quips and the characters, and I suspect "Infinity War" will deliver for most — particularly thanks to the Guardians. In such a bruisingly long showdown, the action sequences — never the strongpoint of the Russos, who cut their teeth on comic ensemble like "Arrested Development" and "Community" — grow monotonous, and the interludes amid the rubble more infrequent. But if "Infinity War" is a lavish reunion tour propelled by star power, the Russos are sure to plays the hits.
The movie's ending — just one of the spoilers that divulging here would bring Thanos' fist down upon me — will be the major talking point. But for me, its power only lasts as long as a commercial break with an easy-to-see-through "to be continued." Who lives and who dies? It's hard to fret too much with an eternity of sequels and spinoffs lined up.
"Avengers: Infinity War," a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for "intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, language and some crude references." Running time: 149 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia city workers have moved in and cleared out two homeless encampments populated mostly by men and women addicted to heroin.
On Wednesday, residents packed up their belongings, stuffing some in shopping carts. Sanitation workers moved in and threw mattresses, tents, tables and other debris into garbage trucks and power washed the areas.
The action marked the end of a monthlong pilot program by the city to get help for those living in the encampments and make the city's Kensington neighborhood safer.
City officials say more than 120 people from the encampments have accepted services, and nearly four dozen entered treatment.

But they acknowledge some of those forced to move will not have access to shelter and will likely just move on to other homeless encampments.
Cambria desalination plant facing closure
April 17, 2017
By KAREN VELIE
Editor's Note: The Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board's complaint is included at the bottom of this article.
The state of California is working to close down the Cambria Community Services District $13 million desalination plant because district staffers have failed to comply with environmental requirements. In addition, the district is facing almost $800,000 in fines.
On Feb. 9, the water board slapped Cambria with three notices of violation. At that time, the district was facing almost $600,000 in fines because district staff has chronically filed late reports and failed to comply with water quality regulations, according to the Feb. 9 complaint.
In one of the notices of violation, the water board ordered the district to provide technical information and reports or face additional fines and state enforcement.
Nevertheless, the district failed to follow the water board's requirement. As a result, water board staff is preparing a cease and desist order and a civil liability complaint, according to an April 13 letter.
In its letter, the water board included a list of 162 newly discovered violations regarding the district's failure to comply with state clean water requirements.

People Aren't Impressed With How This Site Is Advertising Plus Size Tights
By Alice Westoby
Many have taken offence to the stores marketing strategy.
People are not happy with how retailer Wish.com have advertised their range of plus size tights and the images are problematic to say the very least.
The plus size fashion industry has grown exponentially in recent years with plus size models gracing the catwalk and the pages of magazines more and more frequently.
These are all great things but tactless marketing like Wish.com's are taking us two steps backwards. They advertised their plus size tights using a tiny model and a pretty insulting pose...
In the images the model can be seen completely enveloped by the tights and stretching them with her arms to show the size.

Understandably as soon as some shoppers caught wind of the pictures they took to social media to express their dismay...
it would have been so much easier to hire plus size models for this. it's an unrealistic advertisement as well because there is no indicator of how it looks on a plus size body. it's inefficient as well as distasteful. — emily angelica (@existentiaIly) December 9, 2017
This is utterly ridiculous. Why is it so difficult to have clothes modelled on women (and men) they are designed for? #notbuyingit https://t.co/vNCwEiCpxi — AnyBody (@AnyBodyOrg) December 10, 2017
However some eagle-eyed shoppers have revealed that Wish.com actually stole the images from another website called TrendingVIP.com which were originally used for advertising magic tights that claim not to rip.
The pictures make WAY more sense in this context! But despite them not owning the images, it makes Wish.com's use of them appear even more insensitive without the fact they took images from another website.
the actual add that these models posed for is not for plus sized tights. they're supposed to be “magic tights” that wont rip no matter how much you stretch them. the wish app stole the picture and advertised it as plus size tights. https://t.co/Svb2HrMTuB — brat (@xo_victoria_xx) December 10, 2017

What to Know A NJ cop faces charges for allegedly assaulting patient at a hospital, recording the incident and not including it in the police report
Roger Then, 29, a Paterson resident who serves on the police force, was arrested by federal agents Wednesday
This marks the fourth time in two months that a Paterson officer faces charges
A New Jersey police officer was arrested Wednesday for allegedly assaulting a patient at a Paterson hospital, recording the incident on his cellphone and failing to include the assault in the related police report, authorities say.
Roger Then, 29, a Paterson resident who serves on the police force, was arrested by federal agents Wednesday morning and charged by complaint with conspiring to violate an individual's civil rights and with misprision of felony for concealing the civil rights violation, according to U.S. Attorney Craig Carpentino.
Then is scheduled to appear Wednesday afternoon in Newark federal court.
According to the FBI complaint, Then and another Paterson police officer – identified in the complaint as “Police Officer 1” – responded to a call from an attempted suicide victim on March 5. Then and the other officer met the victim at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson.
According to authorities, in the hospital surveillance video, the victim, while in a wheelchair, appears to throw an object down the hall. Following this, “Police Officer 1” allegedly pushes the wheelchair and punches the victim in the face. As the victim falls, Then grabs him by the back of the neck and pushes him to the ground.
In a second video, which was allegedly taken by Then using his cellphone, the victim is on his back in a hospital bed. The complaint says that when the victim verbally insults “Police Officer 1,” “Police Officer 1” puts on a pair of hospital gloves and violently strikes the victim twice across the face. “Police Officer 1” then stands over the victim and says, “I ain't f---ing playing with you.”
According to authorities, Then and “Police Officer 1” filed a police report in connection with the events, but did not mention that “Police Officer 1” punched the victim, struck him in the hospital room or that Then grabbed the victim by the neck and pushed him on the ground, as captured in the videos.
The victim allegedly suffered multiple injuries to his face because of these assaults, including an eye injury that required surgery.
The conspiracy to violate civil rights count carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. The misprision of felony count carries a maximum of three years in prison. Both counts are also punishable by a fine of up to $250,000.
It is not immediately known if Then has an attorney that could comment on the charges.
According to the complaint, “Police Officer 1” is no longer on active duty with the Paterson Police Department. It wasn't immediately clear if the officer is facing charges.
This marks the fourth time in two months that a Paterson officer faces charges.
On April 20, police officer Ruben McAusland was arrested and charged with distributing drugs and possessing them with the intent to distribute.
On April 11, officers Jonathan Bustios and Eudy Ramos were arrested for allegedly stopping cars, detaining occupant and searching without cause.
The Paterson Police Department didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
