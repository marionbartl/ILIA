The Republican candidate to fill Montana's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives allegedly slammed a reporter to the ground at their campaign headquarters the day before the election.
Ben Jacobs, a reporter for the Guardian, wrote on Twitter Wednesday evening that Greg Gianforte "just body slammed [sic] me and broke my glasses."
The paper later posted audio recorded by a local TV crew of the altercation between Jacobs and Gianforte, which took place at the candidate's campaign headquarters in Bozeman.
In the audio, Jacobs attempts to ask Gianforte a question about the CBO scoring of House Republicans' plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.
"We'll talk to you about that later," Gianforte answers.
"Yeah, but there's not going to be time--" Jacobs begins, before Gianforte says "Speak with [spokesperson] Shane [Scanlon], please." At that point, the sound of someone falling over is heard.
"I'm sick and tired of you guys,” Gianforte yells. “The last guy who came here did the same thing. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. The last guy did the same thing. Are you with the Guardian?”
"Yes, and you just broke my glasses," Jacobs replies.
"The last guy did the same damn thing," Gianforte says.
"You just body-slammed me and broke my glasses," Jacobs says.
"Get the hell out of here," Gianforte repeats.
"You'd like me to get the hell out of here, I'd also like to call the police," Jacobs says as the recording ends.
The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported that Jacobs was evaluated at the scene and was taken to a local hospital. Gianforte left the area after speaking to local sheriff's deputies and made no statement to reporters.
Scanlon later issued a statement saying that Jacobs "entered the [campaign] office without permission, aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face, and began asking badgering questions."
Later, the statement added, "After asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined. Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in their face. Jacobs grabbed Greg's wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground. It's unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ."
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a statement calling on Gianforte to withdraw their candidacy and said Republicans "should not waste another minute before publicly denouncing their candidate and apologizing for the millions of dollars they spent on theirs behalf."
Gianforte, a business person who has strongly aligned themselves with President Trump and the National Rifle Association, is facing Democrat Rob Quist and Libertarian Mark Wicks in Thursday's special election to replace Ryan Zinke, who left Congress to become Interior Secretary.
In what has become our Halloween tradition going back six years , we're here to once again point out that sometimes truth is stranger (and scarier) than fiction ...
Most urban legends are just that -- legends. Cautionary tales made up to keep kids on the straight and narrow. But wait, why do we need so many of these cautionary tales in the first place? Well, because the world is a terrifying place out to destroy you in any number of horrifying, ironic ways. In fact, this world is so scary that a lot of the creepy tales you told around the campfire have actually happened to real, very unfortunate people.

The Legend:
Us folks from well-off northern countries sure do like to jet down to various tropical countries for a little sun and fun, but we also tend to get a bit weirded out by the Third World conditions that often exist right outside the walls of our hermetically sealed resort destinations. These fears have given rise to all sorts of tales of people returning from trips near the equator with a free souvenir wriggling around inside a particularly sensitive or important area, like, say, their skulls.

Shortly after returning to their native Britain from a vacation in Peru, Rochelle Harris began to hear scratching noises inside their head. Apparently Harris isn't much of a worrywart (or possibly is mildly schizophrenic), because they decided, "Eh, whatever," and went on with their life, as the scratching noises got louder. Then things got worse.
Harris started to get headaches and radiating pain down one side of their face, and she'd wake up with fluids on their pillow (and not the good kinds). Then a fly flew out of their ear. Yeah, this story is going exactly where you were hoping it wasn't going -- after the fly incident, Harris finally went to a doctor, and they found that a writhing family of maggots had set up a home deep within their ear canal. If you need a few minutes to go madly dig at your ears with a Q-Tip, we understand.
Tethering Alien and Aliens in Isolation
What was thought to have been an exhausted franchise, the Alien series has experienced a resurgence recently, thanks in part to Creative Assembly's remarkable efforts on their successful title, Alien: Isolation. Somehow they managed to betray the expectations of its most disheartened fans, and rekindled what thought to have been long-lost – the terror and the suspense that defined the original films, making the iconic creature frightening once again.
Creative Assembly's faithfulness to its source material did not go unnoticed to its fans, with all the little tidbits sprinkled though-out the game, but most noticeably one sequence featured mid-way through its story, which retroactively explains a minor discrepancy between Alien and Aliens.
Believe it or not there were some fans of Alien that were critical of James Cameron's sequel, Aliens, pointing out inconsistencies and potential plot-holes in relation to its prequel. The most notable being the acoustical beacon that the derelict spacecraft had been broadcasting – which previously had lured the crew of the Nostromo – which went evidently unnoticed to the colonists that were terraforming the planet for over 20 years before the events of the film.
It wasn't until after Ellen Ripley's shuttle, Narcissus was recovered when contact to the colony became lost. Later it is revealed that the character Burke had given the colonists the co-ordinates to the derelict spacecraft harboring the deadly alien spore, implying that they received the data either from Ripley herself, or from the shuttle's black-box flight recorder, which had accessed Nostromo's on-board computer before its destruction.
So what happened to the derelict's transmitted S.O.S.? How could have the colonists on the planet not have picked it up roughly 35 years later when the crew of the Nostromo managed to pick it up while drifting far away in space?
There hasn't been any explicit explanation on film, but there is a possibility hinted at in the re-released director's cut of Aliens, which is a brief shot during the restored pre-infested colony sequence. The shot is during the scene when the ‘mom-and-pop survey team' (Newt's parents) stumble upon the derelict spacecraft, and the ship is shown submerged in the planet's surface, clearly damaged by the surrounding tectonic activity. Arguably this could be speculated that this caused the beacon to go inactive, therefore justifying how it when unnoticed for so long.
However such exposition requires a little bit of deduction on the viewers part, and really such a minor inconsistency would really only concern the most intrigued fans. But it's such little details that fans of the franchise like to gloss over and collate, as the films depict such a grounded science fiction world, with many of its elements correlative to our own.
In Isolation, Creative Assembly took the liberty of rectifying the issue by creating their own original exposition. In the game's story the main character, Amanda confronts a man named Marlow, who is a captain of the ship Anesidora, who had recovered the original flight-box recorder from the Nostromo after its destruction. In a playable flashback sequence you play as Marlow as you explore the resting site of the Derelict like in the film – lured to the planet soon after recovering the flight-box – and after venturing inside, manually shut off the beacon yourself.
If Isolation is considered genuine cannon to the series, then this eliminates any required speculation on the issue regarding the Derelict's beacon. For as underwhelming many players felt regarding game's overall story, Creative Assembly at least took careful measures not to step on anything already established by the original films, and even provided some retroactive continuity that works logically within the cannon.
For those interested in the Alien series and are hungry for more lore, there is an amazing website filled with many fascinating in-depth articles regarding the films and even the games called Strange Shapes – guaranteed to provide a wealth of insight for even the most avid fan.
In order not to unnecessarily create confusion with Bitcoin's P2SH addresses, Litecoin has changed the prefix of their P2SH addresses. Instead of beginning with a “3”, Litecoin's P2SH addresses will start with the letter “M”.
As this is solely related to the derivation method of P2SH addresses from public keys, this does not affect your litecoin holdings in TREZOR. It will only affect you if you send litecoins to P2SH addresses, as you will have to use a different address.
It might take an extended period of time until all vendors, services, merchants, etc. will adjust to this change. Many services continue to accept sending transactions to 3-addresses only, while TREZOR Wallet will give you M-addresses and sends only to M-addresses. In order to bypass these limitations, please use the converter between the two addresses to get the desired format.
So what changes are there in TREZOR and TREZOR Wallet?
TREZOR will generate a new Wallet, with new P2SH addresses for you, M-addresses
TREZOR Wallet can only send a P2SH transaction to an M-address
TREZOR Wallet sends non-P2SH transactions to L-addresses as normal
L-addresses remain unchanged in Legacy accounts
I need a 3-address. How do I get my 3-address?
You can convert between your M-address, generated by your TREZOR, and a 3-address with this tool. Just paste your M-address into it and convert.
Why can't I use TREZOR Wallet to send litecoins to 3-addresses?
3-addresses are deprecated for a reason, namely the possible confusion with Bitcoin's P2SH addresses. That is why TREZOR Wallet will not support sending litecoins to a 3-address. If you need to send litecoins to a 3-address, please make sure it is a Litecoin address and use the converter here to translate the address into an M-address. Then input the M-address into a new transaction in TREZOR Wallet.
What is the benefit of M-addresses over 3-addresses?
The benefit of this is that you cannot accidentally send litecoins to a Bitcoin address anymore, and vice versa.
Do I need to update my TREZOR device to send transactions to Litecoin P2SH addresses?
Yes, please update your TREZOR firmware to version 1.5.0. Earlier firmware versions do not support sending Litecoin transactions to an M-address, and therefore transaction signing will not be successful.

The Englishtown cable ferry in central Cape Breton will be out of service this winter as new slips are constructed on both sides of the channel in St. Anns Bay.
The slips were built about 30 years ago and have deteriorated badly.
"They're worn out," said John Majchrowicz, manager of marine services for the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. "The rebar is starting to come out, so it's time to overhaul those slips."
Majchrowicz said the ramps have been undermined by the tide and are so low in places that some vehicles have trouble getting on and off the ferry.
"Cars with a long overhang, and buses and trucks with long overhangs, they scrape the bottom of the ramp as they are coming out of the ship and sometimes they can come hung up on the cable and destroy the cable," they said.
Staff have been advising some drivers to turn around and drive around St. Anns Bay instead of taking the ferry, Majchrowicz said.
Repairs all around
The ferry Torquil MacLean will be pulled out of the water in the first week of January to undergo annual maintenance while construction crews work on both the Englishtown and Jersey Cove sides of the channel.
The cable will also be pulled out and replaced.
Tenders for the construction work have been issued. The successful bidder will be announced in about a week.
Majchrowicz expects the work to take about three months.
Image caption Frank Skinner is the third host of Room 101, first broadcast in 1994
Room 101 is to return this month with a new BBC One slot, a new multi-guest format and a new host in Frank Skinner.
The show, last seen on BBC Two in 2007, will see them referee three celebrities each week as they compete for their approval to banish their top peeve.
Skinner said they were "looking forward to hearing my guests wax lyrical about the people and things they hate most".
The comedian takes over from previous host Paul Merton, who inherited the programme themselves from Nick Hancock.
"We can't wait to get this much loved show back on the air where it belongs," said executive producer Jimmy Mulville.
"After seeing so many imitations over the past few years, it's very pleasing to bring the real thing back."
The original Room 101 featured in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and was famously named after a meeting room at BBC Broadcasting House.
Fern Britton, Gabby Logan, Alice Cooper and John Prescott are among the panellists lined up to appear in the Hat Trick production.

When Mrugank S., 33, an information technology professional in Bangalore, Karnataka, ordered five teaming carts of produce from Big Basket, an online grocery store, they chose “card-on-delivery” as the mode of payment. But when the two deliverymen wheeled up to their flat on the 14th floor of a tower, they pulled out a wad of bills.
Mr. Mrugank often uses their credit card, but that afternoon, nervous of a botched delivery, they turned to a reliable habit and pulled out 6,000 rupees, or $97, in cash, as most Indians do. “It is a little bit safer,” they said.
Had they chosen to pay with their credit card, one of the couriers would have pulled out a petite, rectangular device, which, when plugged into a headphone jack, turns any smartphone into a point-of-sale terminal, a vehicle for cashless payments.
Ezetap, a Bangalore startup that was formed in 2011, built the mobile payment device and partnered with Big Basket, the 2-year-old grocery delivery service in the city. Big Basket equipped each of its couriers with the hardware.
In the past two years, at least 10 new companies like Ezetap have begun operations in India, according to the investment-banking firm Avendus. Several more have sprung up from young technology companies and established banks, offering smartphone applications, software gizmos and online channels intent on pushing Indian commerce toward one of the nation's most pervasive goods.
India has 554 million active cellphone users, yet only four percent use mobile banking. Still, the number of people who are weaning themselves off cash payments is steadily rising. There are roughly 910,000 point-of-sale terminals nationwide, according to the consultancy Deloitte. That is nearly double the totals from four years ago, but there is plenty of room for the noncash economy to grow. India currently has 758 point-of-sale-terminals for a million residents, considerably behind China at 1,700 per million and Brazil at 25,000 per million in 2009.
Entrepreneurs are convinced that India now has overcome the inertia to move from cash to digital payments. “People are still apprehensive about putting their credit card online,” largely because of security concerns, said Vipul Parekh, co-founder of Big Basket, which receives around 60 percent of its payments through cash on delivery. “But they are extremely comfortable using their mobiles.”
Ezetap operates much like Square, the celebrated California mobile payments company started by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, and has borrowed some of its aura. Last November, Ezetap raised $3.5 million from high-profile investors in the United States, including Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal.
In May, Ezetap became the first Indian terminal-maker to receive global certification from Europay, Mastercard and Visa. At the time, Som Mittal, president of the Indian software industry body Nasscom, lauded Ezetap as an exemplar of the “new age” of Indian technology.
Ezetap might be a new idea for India, but for one of its founders, it is not a first attempt to make mobile payments work in India.
In 2006, Sanjay Swamy, the energetic chairperson of Ezetap, was selected as C.E.O. of mChek, a Bangalore company that linked bank accounts to mobile phones. Like Ezetap, investors warmly welcomed mChek. In 2008 and 2009, it raised $10 million from renowned venture capitalists abroad. It partnered with leading banks and telecom companies, allowing customers to pay bills with cards using their phones. In 2009, Mr. Swamy claimed over one million active users.
But then mChek suddenly fizzled out. Mr. Swamy left to join the Unique Identification Authority of India as a volunteer with the government's project to assign each Indian an ID number. MChek quietly began to shed its deals and eventually folded.
“I would never do another startup that requires the volume of the ocean,” Mr. Swamy said. “We needed to get the regulators, we needed to get the banks, we needed to get the merchants.”
Trying to arrange mobile payments across multiple carriers and banks demanded cooperation across the dense layers of Indian commerce. All the obstacles made it more difficult for consumers to adopt the service. Mr. Swamy recalled a telling moment when a loyal customer, who had used mChek to pay bills for 18 months, suddenly stopped. A shop with Airtel services for bill paying opened up next to their home, and they found it easier to walk across the street.

With Ezetap, Mr. Swamy and their three co-founders opted to skip the fickle consumers and focus only on the merchants that would benefit from cheap payment receptacles. The hardware costs roughly $50, plus a monthly fee of up to $6. In addition to Big Basket, Ezetap has signed up with online retailers and a microfinance group. “You pick one side of the problem,” Mr. Swamy explained.
Mchek's failure hasn't discouraged at least a dozen other companies from offering digital payment products, like mobile wallets, directly to consumers. Last week, One MobiKwik Systems, a startup in Gurgaon, introduced the country's first consumer wallet, which allows users to stock cash into an account that can be used with 500 merchants nationwide.
Many startups aim to replicate the wild success of M-Pesa, the mobile-money system used by two-thirds of Kenya. (In April, M-Pesa began operating in India, through a partnership between Vodafone and ICICI Bank.)
“We believed, at one point in time, that mobile payments would be like telecom,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, C.E.O. of One97 Communication, which runs a mobile payment operator called Paytm. “But the government of India didn't like that.”
As mobile payments began spreading globally, the Reserve Bank of India, or R.B.I., moved cautiously. In 2009, the central bank started requiring two-factor authentication to protect the main electronic transactions in India, debit cards and net banking. (Fewer than two percent of Indians own credit cards.) Mobile payers now have to move through multiple identification steps.
To operate without one bank partner, mobile payment providers also need an R.B.I. license. The central bank has primarily doled out three types of wallet licenses: open ones, given for bank-to-bank transfers; closed ones, which let owners fill wallets from their bank accounts and use them like vouchers; and ones somewhere in between, known as semiclosed.
Semiclosed wallets can be loaded with cash that can be used buy goods electronically. Over the summer, both MobiKwik and One97 were granted these five-year licenses, along with 21 others.
Semiclosed wallets do have one noteworthy drawback that its makers say keep them from wider use: a user can add cash but can't draw it out. In May 2012, Bharti Airtel began offering Airtel Money, the first and only prepaid mobile wallet for a telecommunication company licensed by the R.B.I. The wallets see transactions totaling 15 million rupees a month. Yet only users with accounts at Axis Bank, Airtel's partner, can withdraw cash.
Analysts say that for consumers, the current obstacles to mobile payments outweigh the rewards. “The motivation for a consumer to transition to a mobile wallet is very minimal,” said Aashish Bhinde, executive director of Avendus.
In a recent study, Avendus estimated that seven million transactions are completed through mobile wallets across India each month. But most payments are minuscule, averaging 260 rupees per transaction.
“At the end of the day,” Mr. Bhinde said, “mobile solves one part of the problem — it makes transactions less capital intensive. But you need a big push by the government for cashless options.”
In their inaugural speech on Sept. 4, Raghuram Rajan, the new central bank governor, devoted considerable attention to mobile money. They announced plans for a pilot project to allow cash withdrawals from prepaid wallets, as well as the potential for the transfer of funds to any handset. “Mobile payments,” Mr. Rajan said, “can be a game changer.”
Many mobile payment executives voiced skepticism of the R.B.I.'s ability to change anything, particularly with speed. In 2009, Beam Money, a mobile payment provider based in New Delhi, acquired an R.B.I. semiclosed wallet license with the hopes of expanding its payment channels beyond utilities. When it received the license, the company expected that personal transfers, from one wallet to another, and cash withdrawal would soon become legal, said its chairperson, Anand Shrivastav. They did not.
Mr. Shrivastav discovered their customers could make certain purchases, but were restricted from others — they could buy a ticket from an airline, but not for a bus, for example. “There were so many ifs and buts,” they recalled. “How do we go and tell a customer that the R.B.I. is mandating this?”
This July, Beam Money relinquished its license, deeming it too much of a burden. Beam maintained its current business, offering mobile payments with select merchants. To the newest license holders, “I wish them luck,” Mr. Shrivastav said.
Bipin Preet Singh of MobiKwik however, remains bullish. They said two million customers now use their closed wallet services. With its new offering, the company plans to reach 100 million in two years. Mr. Swamy of Ezetap is equally ebullient, ticking off their company's rapid reach into retail merchants.
These entrepreneurs face a larger hurdle than regulatory red tape. MasterCard, in its global report on mobile payments, ranks India near the bottom on knowledge of mobile options. Familiarity with mobile wallets remains MobiKwik's biggest impediment, admitted Mr. Singh.
Consumer attitudes toward cashless payments also require a major shift. Even India's wealthier, plugged-in consumers are reluctant to use mobile banking and frequent card payments. Some skepticism is surely from fear of fraud; Indian banks are not directly liable for fraudulent card transactions, although the R.B.I. is moving to amend the law.
And moving from India's stubborn cash economy will require more than changes in consumer behavior. I rode back from Mr. Mrugank's neighborhood in an Ola Cab, a taxi service that has also ties with Ezetap. The cab's card terminal was broken. “Cash only,” said the driver.

The London Traffic Challenge
OpenXC is a combination of open source hardware and software that allows developers to read car telemetry data in real time. This work is being led by Ford.
OpenXC software is primarily focused on Android developers and uses a bluetooth or USB connection. As part of the London Traffic Tamer App Challenge, a contest to design applications that help alleviate traffic congestion in the streets of London, we developed Cloudant CommuteTamer.
This HTML5 Chrome application used WebWorkers, the Chrome TextToSpeech engine, the Leaflet JavaScript library for interactive maps, and PouchDB, the in-browser database that syncs.
About the App
Our Traffic Tamer app collects car telemetry data. Every time a car stops, this event is synchronized with IBM Cloudant, a JSON document store, to enable crowd-sourced traffic information.
Every five minutes, the application executes a server-side geospatial radius search, and congestion alerts are sent to the device. To avoid distractions, this alert is spoken to the driver. In development mode, Leaflet is used to display a map of the driver's location and path.
Cloudant CommuteTamer is an Offline First application – it's designed to work in areas of low connectivity or when no connection is available at all. Everything is stored locally in the web browser (PouchDB). Vehicles have spotty mobile connectivity while in transit, so we designed the app to transmit only lightweight, individual JSON documents over the network in this scenario. The entire database is only synchronized with the cloud (Cloudant) when the user has a Wi-Fi connection. Synchronizing the entire database allows analysis of driving patterns to provide route recommendations.
We chose Chrome as an application technology because:
It works offline
It can run in the background
It can read USB devices
Text-to-speech engine
Can run on any device
Easy deployment on Chrome Web Store
Using the Code
The code is available on GitHub under the Cloudant repo openxc-js and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 Software License. A vehicle simulator has been provided that runs a WebWorker thread and updates the development display.
The OpenXC Platform provides car telemetry data on a line-by-line basis, and this data is JSON, e.g.
{"name":"vehicle_speed","value":0,"timestamp":1364323939.468000} {"name":"accelerator_pedal_position","value":0,"timestamp":1364323939.474000} {"name":"engine_speed","value":774,"timestamp":1364323939.475000} {"name":"latitude","value":40.77092,"timestamp":1364323939.476000} {"name":"longitude","value":-73.953773,"timestamp":1364323939.478000} {"name":"fuel_level","value":89.674202,"timestamp":1364323939.482000} {"name":"torque_at_transmission","value":3,"timestamp":1364323939.483000}
The application aggregates this data, and every 10 seconds stores it into PouchDB as GeoJSON, e.g.
{ "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1] }, "properties": { ... } }
N.B.: As per the GeoJSON spec, the “properties” field above could contain any number of nested telemetry objects, such as those given in the preceding code block.
This can be seen in the Chrome Development Console:

In March, federal prosecutors expect to file another indictment against the alleged conspirators in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon that may add new charges and additional defendants.
The potential for new charges in a superseding indictment and naming of other defendants will depend on the federal government's ongoing investigation, according to court records filed late Friday.
Defense lawyers representing 25 people already indicted on a federal conspiracy charge stemming from the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge want the government to turn over the evidence they have obtained so far as part of discovery in preparation for a trial.
Further, each defendant wants to be informed whether FBI agents captured any of them on electronic surveillance equipment.
Prosecutors counter that evidence will be turned over 14 days after the defendants are arraigned on the indictment, scheduled for this Wednesday.
U.S. District Court Judge Anna J. Brown also is expected to hear oral arguments Wednesday at 10 a.m. on pretrial matters, including the defense lawyers' joint motion seeking an immediate halt to the FBI's processing of evidence at the Malheur refuge.
Defense lawyers want their own investigators present at the refuge to videotape the federal government's examination of evidence in the case.
The government objects. FBI agents already have located firearms, explosives and a trench of human feces at the site, according to prosecutors.
The government also wants the court to set a trial date sometime in the spring of next year, while defense lawyers are seeking a speedy trial and favor an April start this year.
Federal prosecutors urge the court to classify the federal conspiracy case as a "complex case'' due to the volume and scope of discovery, number of defendants involved, "unique nature'' of crime scene on a 172,000-acre wildlife preserve, and involvement of a handful of defendants in an indictment in Nevada stemming from a 2014 standoff with federal officers at the Bundy ranch.
"The government anticipates that the discovery issues in defendants' case will be some of the most complicated in the history of the district,'' Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan Knight, Geoffrey Barrow and Craig Gabriel wrote in a court filing.

12 Giants
2 Healers
6-10 Valkyrie
12-16 Wizards
Wallbreakers (varies depending on what bases you are up against)
1 Golem (For Th9/10)
Optional
0-1 PEKKA (PEKKA can stand in for wizards, mostly if you need some hero killing power)
0-2 Witch (Good support troop but not necessary)
Spells
1 Rage, 1 Healing, 1 Jump, 2 Freezes. For lower th levels rage/healing tends to be the best. More healing if you need to keep up with defenses, more rage if your healers can easily handel the job.
Th8 Variation
Credit: Sadist Kandra
Pros
Spreads elixir costs and training time evenly
Elixir costs are reasonable
Keeps spell usage down
High DPS units allow healers to be used in more ways
Do not necessarily have to take on Air Defenses head on
With a Golem in the mix this combination tanks remarkably well, allowing high % attacks
Until higher wall levels, you do not need many wb in the mix to be effective
Extremely effective against rushed bases that neglected point defenses
Effectively deals with troops inside the base
Cons
Units are very trap vulnerable
Disco infernos can be an issue if they do not go down in the surge part of the attack
Vs high level th10 defenses healers have trouble keeping up
You have to consider base layout very carefully
Base Selection
Though very similar to the traditional Giant/Healer combination the addition of Valkyrie has certain advantages. Namely you can afford, damage wise, to bring 2-4 healers. This means they can get split up if need be. In fact this is the secret of my success. I split my groups of giants up much like a GoWiXx attack. Valkyrie also make a great compliment to healers as well. Before the update I discouraged more than 2 healers just because of all the variables you have to content with but with the addition of the poison spell 3 healers for Th8 and 4 for Th9/10 is very doable. Just keep in mind that in war the CC compositions are very different are barreling in will not work nearly as well as in regular raiding.
Because of this their are 3 types of Air Defense coverage that are weak verses this combination. Bases with a very wide spread of AD coverage in the outside layer. The next being in a line, Valkyrie are great at rushing ahead and taking these out. And finally heavily centralized Air Defenses. This may seem contrary but since you have Valkyrie along, the Giants can function much like golems do for GoViz, GoWiVa, and GoVaPe. As long as they are distracting defenses and taking fire, they are getting the job done. This means if I can get my giants in, and have them distract defenses along an edge - I will. The giants occupy perimeter defenses, and Valkyrie go for the heart. This also means AD coverage in the middle layer of the base is the hardest for this composition. Much harder to eliminate them before they have a chance to take out your healers.
After running this combination many times, luring is not necessary (in regular raiding). Now in war I never turn down an easy lure. If you can easily lure, its safer to do so. But if you are not luring you must know how to use Valkyrie to eliminate the CC quickly. For the record I do not recommend the tornado at Th8 (giants just aren't that great at Th8, and housing space is an issue) and for Th10 I recommend luring unless you already know what the CC is and plan for it. The DE factory really changed the nature of what is in a CC. You just don't see witches, mass archers, or mass wizards anymore. This means you will see lava hounds, dragons, valkyrie and loons. Loons can pose a real threat and due to changes in AI, dragons can as well if your troops do not move in to kill the unit. At Th9 level 4 valkyrie are strong enough that a skilled attack can move in without a lure but for other Th levels in war I would lure. You just can't count on your wizards/AQ to actually attack these CC units anymore.
You want to see defenses spread out and in particular non-defensive buildings mixed in between those defenses. Heavily concentrated defenses may overcome a healers effects while more spread out defensive fire allows healers time to keep the giants going. Also lots of trash buildings can be very distracting for your Valkyrie if outside of the base. However, with this combination of units funneling is usually a snap.
The core of the base is best if dense or tightly packed, in particular if it has a large collection of buildings in it. Valkyrie can make quick work of these types of core and often the giants and healers can then easily pick off the rest of the base. This is particularly true if x-bows, infernos, and teslas are all packed into the core.
Other than that you want bases that allow you to keep your giants in front and taking fire. This combination fizzles quick if your wizards (and or witches) get taken out. The Valkyrie can save it from a complete loss but a major component to this strategy is the giants soaking up damage like sponges.
The Healer
I wanted to make a special note here. To be useful a healer need not survive the battle, they only needs to prolong the life of your units. One characteristic of my own attacks is deploying them almost immediately. This serves several purposes. The 1st is that it prevents them AI from healing a unit I do not want them to. A healer will target the closest unit to them that has taken damage. This means if you wait to deploy them until an AD is down, they may go for your ranged units instead - or a hero. Giants are slow and generally deployed in a pack (the more housing space a healer is healing, the less likely they will break from their original target), a healer will generally stick with them until they either get substantially thinned out or die all together. The second is that it allows me to make use of their healing immediately. Its much easier to insure their survival in the early parts of the fight, than later. So if they go down after surging the core, but has kept your giants at full health - they will have been effective.
For this reason, I visually cut a base into sections covered by Air Defenses and Infernos. If there is a gap in coverage, its generally the best place to use your giants. When dealing with a full array of defenses it can often be more practical to attack a location that is simply not well protected rather than always aiming to take out an Air Defense first. In fact, I rarely use my giants/healers near an Air Defense.
Giants
I just wanted to note here that giants actually have an advantage over golems in some ways. Giants have more DPS and when used with a healer can have infinite life. Their just a bit faster and since you use them in groups, single target infernos don't do well against them and you do have the option of overwhelming infernos with their numbers - particularly ones that are not maxed out. The major advantage is they are less likely to send a whole raid hitting a wall.
Attacking
Attacking
The addition of Earthquake and Poison are huge for this attacking strategy. Luring has always strained this combination for troop space and poison means only the most war oriented troops will truly give you a run for your money. I've been making MASSIVE qualities of DE in up Champions II with 4 healers and 4 Earthquakes. I recommend you give it a try!
In any given attack method you want to carefully consider the Air Defense coverage. You only need to identify gaps or areas where taking out just one AD will create a gab in air defense coverage. At Th10 you must also consider disco infernos, which are better if firmly tucked deep inside the base. With Infernos you also want to attack from an angle where you hit the nearest one (if doubles) head on.
I've described it in more detail in my GoViz section, but Valkyrie do best with a runway. A somewhat confined direct path to the core. Too much side to side action causes them to whiff attacks something terrible.
One Point Attack
I am removing this section, I rarely attack from 1 location. Its probably the least effective way to use the giants and healers and most prone to AI pains.
Two-Point Attack
With Valkyrie two-point attacks are much more effective than one. You can clear more outside buildings and make a better path for the Valkyrie. It basically turns the Giants into the Golems in a GoViz attack. If you haven't figured it out, a 2-point attack attacks 2 points. In the center of a typically 2-point attack is an Air Defense that once destroyed creates a large pocket. In this strategy you deploy healers immediately behind the giants because your giants aren't going to take out the AD, your Valkyrie are. Your giants need only keep defenses occupied and if the walls are low enough in level you may not need to bother with wall breakers.
Since you attack at 2 points, you can leave buildings standing where you want your Valkyrie to attack. This is the most effective pathing strategy I know, as it eliminates the need to worry about if you cleared a building that is 8 paces off target that is technically closer.
A 2 point attack is very effective at dealing with the CC inside the base. (Lure if Th8 unless regular raiding) Just make sure you have a rage/healer for when you collide with the enemy cc and a jump spell to prevent your units from being hung up on a wall. For th10 the change of CC choices created by the poison spell means that in war your probably going to see a flying unit in the CC. This can create problems for timing, so at this point I recommend luring if trying it out in war (still experimenting with this). With the addition of poison spell I find I am not using my Valkyrie as much to eliminate the CC so I am factoring the CC placement a bit less than I use to and the inferno placement/heros more.
This is my bread and butter tactic when using Giant/Healer. For those of you not Valkyrie fans, hogs can also function in this role but will require lurning.
3-Point Attack
Originally my 3 point attack was 2 giant/healer combinations with a golem down the middle. Through experimentation this is more effective at Th9 that 10 due to infernos. At Th10 giants and Valkyrie actually make a killer team for the core rush. But the basics of this strategy are my bread and butter as a Th10 player in Campion.
The only major difference between this and the 2-point attack is that my Valkyrie have a tank lead the way into the core. This takes the point damage off of them and allows them to use their speed to swoop in while the defenses are occupied and do serious damage.
For Th9 a Golem will do this well, but for a Th10 player a golem actually has a serious disadvantage when facing duel discos. 1 golem is 30 space. This has been a problem that as plagued me for a long time. I have tried applying GoWi tactics to my strategy but honestly GoViz is not GoWi. You use your golems differently, and It's just enough different that the same techniques were giving me poor results.
So what I do now, does I send in my giants/healers (maybe subbing one group out for a golem) in the same fashion as a 2-point attack. But now once I've created the funnel I send in the giants to occupy the nearest inferno. I then send in Valkyrie behind and time a rage so they quickly dispatch the nearest inferno. I then drop a freeze on the far side inferno and a Head spell after in the same manner as my Wrecking Ball technique. But I save on an extra freeze and can pack 4 Earthquakes or 2 jump spells. Against high level walls this can make a huge difference. Once you lose your momentum with this strategy it quickly fizzles out, by maintaining that momentum you can pull off some spectacular attacks.
Skim and Rush
This is not a staple technique but a base exploit that occasionally comes in handy. Some bases have large blind spots in AD coverage. If you stick to the outside of the base you can severely cripple the base while your giants receive infinite healing. It just requires you to attack in a way that is very abnormal. Most attacks are more direct, this technique requires you to actually attack a side of a base and move along it.
If you've identified a section of the base that has no Air Defense coverage or a whole ring. Deploy your giants and place 2 healers behind. Deploy at the corner of a compartment so that giants move along the edge of the base, periodically deploying wallbreakers to keep them doing this. Keep a few giants in reserve to clear a necessary building if need be.
Use only a handful of wizards to clear buildings. Your intention is to let the giants clear as many defenses in the blind spot as possible and since you are moving them in a sideways or looping fashion they may not effectively protect your wizards who will move to attack the center of the base eventually.
Once you've exploited the blind spot, clear a few necessary buildings and have your Valkyrie gut the core. If possible take out Air Defenses to prolong the exploit. This is a surgical style attack and requires you to think about unit AI and behavior. But when a base comes along that this works on, it is fun to capitalize type of attack.

Ann K.S. Lambton stands alongside the great Orientalists of the 20th century, who dedicated their many decades of erudition to the study of Iran's history, both medieval and modern. Them life and scholarship, however, raises uncomfortable questions about the formation of Iranian studies and its academic practice. Here, we examine the extent to which their legacy is intertwined with the politics of empire out of which it both developed and whose interests it had been geared to serve.
Born in Newmarket, England in 1912, Lambton, known to their friends as “Nancy” was born into the English aristocracy— the granddaughter of the second Earl of Durham no less. They rose to the heights of British academic life; becoming Chair in Persian at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in 1953, where they had obtained their undergraduate degree (1935) and PhD (1939) under the supervision of Sir Edward Denison Ross. While a young student, they were mentored by Orientalist luminaries like Sir Hamilton Gibb, Sir Harold Bailey, Vladimir Minorsky and Arthur Tritton. During their first travels to Iran in the 1930s, they made the acquaintance of Sur-e Esrafil (Mirza Qasem Khan), the philosopher-literatus-statesman Mohammad Ali Forughi, the inimitable lexicographer, Ali Akbar Dehkhoda, and had even been taught Persian by Seyed Hasan Taqizadeh, another distinguished scholar-statesman.
During WWII, Lambton worked in the British Legation as press attaché to the British ambassador, Sir Reader Bullard. Despite their deep respect for him, Lambton acknowledged Bullard's belief in Persian “deviousness” in the obituary they wrote for them in 1977.
As Shaul Bakhash has argued, Lambton wrote a memorandum to Bullard on 1 May 1941, which had deeply influenced British thinking regarding the fate of Reza Shah. In their analysis, Lambton stated that British support for the Shah would prove “fatal” in the event of a German invasion. As a result, Bullard concluded that unless the Shah was removed, the majority of Iranians might welcome a German invasion due to the Shah's widespread identification with British machinations. Three weeks into the Allied occupation, Eden and Churchill finally endorsed the decision to remove the monarch.
Lambton is credited with authoring the BBC Persian service's famous broadcast savaging Reza Shah and enumerating the myriad abuses of power, which had occurred under their rule following the Allied invasion and occupation of the country in August 1941. Some have speculated that this broadcast, in particular, sparked the king's abdication.
In the course of the war, they worked for the Ministry of Information and was aware of the Special Operations Executive‘s activities. During this period, they became acquainted with the Anglophile operatives, the Rashidiyan brothers, and essentially oversaw propaganda and public relations in support of the Allies, forging ties with Iranians from all walks of life and across the political spectrum. For their assiduous service, they would be awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1942.
They came to confidently speak of a “Persian mind,” “Persian mentality,” and believed in Iranians' incapacity for independent thought. The Persian, they held, had no concept of the individual.
After the war, Lambton's first lectureship at SOAS was funded by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (known today as BP). They played a vital role in training its employees, as well as British Council representatives, FCO staff waiting to be dispatched to Tehran and Afghanistan, military personnel and business people. The AIOC regularly sought their advice and solicited their policy recommendations. Them seminal work Landlord and Peasant in Persia was published in 1953 and remains a unique document on the development of agrarian life and relations from the eighth century till the modern period.
Them most infamous moment came with their implacable opposition to the nationalist government of Dr Mohammad Mosaddeq, who had nationalized Iranian oil in 1951. Them colonial contempt for the European-educated aristocrat, as well as their inability to appreciate that Iranians might be capable of a “national consciousness” (she did appear to reconsider this three decades later) led them to revile them and their programme. Iranians were prohibited from asserting their sovereign rights and nationalising their country's most vital natural resource; it was an affront to the Empire. The only way compromise might be achieved was through the overthrow of “old Mossy,” as many in the diplomatic service referred to him.
Demonstrating the great synergy of prejudice shared by old-school Orientalists like Lambton, the Foreign Office and Western media, Mosaddeq was invariably described as “impervious to reason,” “fanatical,” “obstinate,” and “menacing.” What was fashioned for public consumption in Western capitals in its stead was an infantilized, absurd, irrational, yet cunning and mendacious Oriental, without rhyme or reason.
Lambton fiercely advocated for the overthrow of Mossadeq's government and had the ear of the Conservative Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden, who as it happened, had read Persian and Arabic at Oxford. As historian Ervand Abrahamian has noted, it was at this juncture that they “strongly urged the Foreign Office to keep a ‘steady nerve' and wait for [Mosaddeq] to fall. They insisted, ‘Our own unofficial efforts to undermine them are making good progress. If we agree to discuss and compromise with him, the effort will strengthen him.'” They added that Americans who talk of compromise are “wrong and do not have the experience or psychological insight” (The Coup, p. 90). Them dogmatic belief in Iranians' unwieldy irrationalism was indissociable from their advocacy of a hawkish and predatory policy, the aftermath of which has left an indelible and traumatising impact on the polity till this day.
By June 1951, they recommended that their friend, Robert Charles Zaehner (d. 1974) return to Iran to reactivate Anglophile saboteur networks, most prominently the dubious Rashidiyan brothers, to advance British interests and covertly subvert the Mosaddeq government from inside the country. Zaehner was a fellow Iran scholar based at All Souls College, Oxford who had served in the secret services during WWII, and Roger Louis has located the origins of the coup to oust Mosaddeq in the “Zaehner mission” and Lambton's unrelenting efforts. When this didn't prove as efficacious as had been hoped, the Eisenhower administration and the CIA's Kermit Roosevelt stepped in to follow through.
In their book, Behind the 1953 Coup in Iran, historian Ali Rahnema has argued that Lambton may well have stayed at the home of one of the Rashidiyan brothers during the Mosaddeq period, and would frequent their residence on later travels. The Anglophile operatives had received ample funds from the British government to subvert Mosaddeq and were in their close circle of Iranian friends. They had also been on excellent terms with General Teymur Bakhtiar, the first head of SAVAK, the Shah's dreaded secret service, until their fall from grace and flight into exile. They would be assassinated by SAVAK agents in Iraq in 1970.
Mosaddeq was finally overthrown in the summer of 1953. Lambton was then responsible for correcting Persian-language documents germane to the new oil consortium formed in agreement with the post-coup government of General Fazlollah Zahedi in 1954. These years serendipitously coincided with them becoming Chair of Persian at SOAS and their ascent to the apogee of British academic life. Zaehner would go on to become Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at All Souls.
Following this turbulent period, Lambton continued their research on agrarian reform and had a very real impact on the initial thrust on this aspect of the “White Revolution.” Throughout the 1960s, they travelled the entirety of the country with the help of Iranian officials, inspecting initiatives that many (including Lambton) believed would create a new class of independent smallholding peasant farmers. The results of the land reforms, however, were highly uneven and predominantly steered towards the mechanisation of agriculture and the penetration of industrialised agri-business into the provinces.
Lambton was reportedly greatly disheartened by the eventual tenor of the agricultural reforms, which failed to meet their high hopes. Them poor opinion of the Shah remained intact and was duly reciprocated. It was also in 1964 that they penned a very well-known article on the gathering of Iranian religious and political personalities on the reconsideration of the Shiʿi institution of marjaʿiyyat, attended by Ayatollahs Morteza Motahhari, Seyed Mahmud Taleqani, Seyed Mohammad Beheshti and Mehdi Bazargan (the first Prime Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government), amongst others. As a result, some admirers have credited them with predicting the Iranian Revolution of 1979. A somewhat fanciful conclusion, which neglects to mention that several Iranian cities had seen major protests on 5 June 1963, as news of Ayatollah Seyyed Ruhollah Khomeini's arrest following their open challenge to the Shah and their White Revolution spread across the country.
Lambton was no clairvoyant, but given their interests and proximity to the British foreign policy establishment, they diligently kept up with contemporary developments. They cited the controversy surrounding Khomeini and the implications of the cleric's comparison of the Shah to the execrated Umayyad caliph, Yazid, whose forces slaughtered Imam Hossein and their companions in 680 AD.
Them explanation as to why religious forces dominated the protests, however, left much to be desired: “As long as the fundamental duty of the believer in general, and of the religious classes in particular, is (to enjoin what is good and to forbid what is evil) such an [religious] expression is likely, perhaps, always to be the case.”
By the late 1960s they came to refocus most of their attention on the more strictly academic interests with which they had first begun, namely the Seljuk period (the topic of their doctoral thesis) and the history of Islamic political thought. By all accounts following retirement, they continued along this path, contributing tens of often obscure and exacting entries to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, and pursuing their more arcane research interests well into their nineties. They never returned to Iran following the revolution of 1979.
Like Gertrude Bell before her, Lambton had rebelled against the patriarchal norms of British society, and was aided in this endeavour by their aristocratic status and its corresponding privileges. There is little doubt that they contributed to the study of Iranian history and society, while also being fully complicit and integrated into the capitalist-imperial matrix which sought to snuff out the nationalist-popular movement, and subsequently unleashed a host of destructive repercussions which would resonate for many decades to come. They participated in the abject dehumanisation of Iranians and deprived them of meaningful agency, effectively rationalising their neo-colonial domination. Though one should certainly exercise caution before reducing their many seminal contributions to the mere naked exercise of power and interests, such a conclusion might indeed be considered churlish and untrue, it must surely be acknowledged that Lambton's is a highly vexing, at times vile legacy we should all recall with a critical eye.
The legacy of Lambton and other scholars, who have sought to straddle the boundaries of policymaking in the metropole and seemingly apolitical scholarly preoccupations, is a complex one whose tensions and contradictions cannot possibly be resolved here. The dangers of instrumentalizing the cultural and intellectual capital of the academy to the end of imperial political and economic objectives, should be obvious enough. It is, however, a challenge which continues to pose itself to area scholars and the fields they inhabit in the present, even if its latter day incarnations may well have changed and evolved in novel and unexpected ways the likes of Lambton and their forebears could have not possibly foreseen.

The messy breakup between Ryan Reynolds and director Tim Miller won't spell the demise of Deadpool on the big screen after all.
According to Variety, John Wick director David Leitch has been enlisted by Fox to helm Deadpool 2, which will see the Merc With a Mouth return for more chimichangas.
Miller was originally set to direct the sequel but ended up leaving the project because of creative differences. Apparently, Miller wanted to make a more stylized movie, while Reynolds wanted to stick to what made the first film so successful.
Both Miller and Reynolds played a big role in making Deadpool a reality but the fact of the matter is, that movie wouldn't be what it is without Reynolds, who was born to play the foul-mouthed character.
Expect more of the same from the sequel
20th Century Fox reportedly sided with Reynolds, in part because they starred in the film but also because their raunchier approach costs a lot less money. Making a more stylized version would have allegedly added a significant amount to the budget.
Either way, enlisting David Leitch is a good move. They already proved they have an eye for action and world-building in John Wick, so they bring a lot to the table. It will be fun to see how they leaf their stamp on the upcoming sequel.
Deadpool 2 is expected to begin filming early next year, with a release date not yet set.
California published its summary of all the reports submitted by vendors testing robocars in the state. You can read the individual reports -- and they are interesting, but several other outlines have created summaries of the reports calculating things like the number of interventions per mile.
On these numbers, Google's lead is extreme. Of over 600,000 autonomous miles driven by the various teams, Google/Waymo was 97% of them -- in other words 30 times as much as everybody else put together. Beyond that, their rate of miles between disengagements (around 5,000 -- a 4x improvement over 2015) is one or two orders of magnitude better than the others, and in fact for most of the others, they have so few miles that you can't even produce a meaningful number. Only Cruise, Nissan and Delphi can claim enough miles to really tell.
Tesla is a notable entry. In 2015 they reported driving zero miles, and in 2016 they did report a very small number of miles with tons of disengagements from software failures (one very 3 miles.) That's because Tesla's autopilot is not a robocar system, and so miles driven by it are not counted. Tesla's numbers must come from small scale tests of a more experimental vehicle. This is very much not in line with Tesla's claim that it will release full autonomy features for their cars fairly soon, and that they already have all the hardware needed for that to happen.
Unfortunately you can't easily compare these numbers:
Some companies are doing most of their testing on test tracks, and they do not need to report what happens there.
Companies have taken different interpretations of what needs to be reported. Most of Cruise's disengagements are listed as "planned" but in theory those should not be listed in these reports. But they also don't list the unplanned ones which should be there.
Delphi lists real causes and Nissan is very detailed as well. Others are less so.
Many teams test outside California, or even do most of their testing there. Waymo/Google actually tests a bunch outside California, making their numbers even bigger.
Cars drive all sorts of different roads. Urban streets with pedestrians are much harder than highway miles. The reports do list something about conditions but it takes a lot to compare apples to apples. (Apple is not one of the companies filing a report, BTW.)
One complication is that typically safety drivers are told to disengage if they have any doubts. It thus varies from driver to driver and company to company what "doubts" are and how to deal with them.
Google has said their approach is to test any disengagement in simulator, to find out what probably would have happened if the driver did not disengage. If there would have been a "contact" (accident) then Google considers that a real incident, and those are rarer than is reported here. Many of the disengagements are when software detects faults with software or sensors. There, we do indeed have a problem, but like human beings who zone out, not all such failures will cause accidents or even safety issues. You want to get rid of all of them, to be sure, but if you are are trying to compare the safety of the systems to humans, it's not easy to do.
It's hard to figure out a good way to get comparable numbers from all teams. The new federal guidelines, while mostly terrible, contain an interesting rule that teams must provide their sensor logs for any incident. This will allow independent parties to compare incidents in a meaningful way, and possibly even run them all in simulator at some level.
It would be worthwhile for every team to be required to report incidents that would have caused accidents. That requires a good simulator, however, and it's hard for the law to demand this of everybody.
Operation Deadlight by Derek Waller
Introduction
The Royal Navy's Operation Deadlight, which was the executive action which led to the sinking of 116 German U-Boats off Northern Ireland between 27 November 1945 and 12 February 1946, was the culmination of the long-held determination of the British Government to ensure the total elimination of the German Navy's submarine fleet after the end of WW2.
UK Planning for German Naval Disarmament
UK planning for the end of the war assumed that Britain would occupy the north west zone of Germany, and that the Royal Navy would be responsible for the main German naval bases. Thus, at the cessation of hostilities, all German U-Boats would immediately be moved to the UK prior to Allied agreement about their destruction.
The Royal Navy therefore pressed ahead in the first half of 1944 with the detailed planning for the post-war transfer of all remaining German U-Boats to British ports. It was intended that the U-Boats would be moved to the naval port at Lisahally in Northern Ireland, and to the naval anchorage in Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland. The proposed transfer arrangements were code-named Operation Pledge.
Operation Pledge
On 4 May 1945 the German Navy had ordered all U-Boats to cease operations and return to Norwegian ports. This was superseded on 8 May when the Admiralty ordered all U-Boats to surrender, and for those at sea to head for designated reception ports; the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll in north west Scotland. As a result, 156 U-Boats surrendered on both sides of the Atlantic.
To implement Operation Pledge it was necessary to organise suitable reception arrangements in Loch Eriboll, and the naval units which comprised the Loch Eriboll Force arrived there on 9 May. The first U-Boat to surrender arrived on 10 May and, between then and 18 May, a further 17 surrendered in Loch Eriboll. However, none of these U-Boats spent long at Loch Eriboll. Instead, they were moved quickly to Loch Alsh on the west coast of Scotland where the majority of the German crews were taken into captivity, and from there they were moved to Lisahally to await final disposal.
On 19 May, a group of 15 U-Boats arrived from Norway. This group had been in transit to Trondheim from Narvik, where they had surrendered, when it was intercepted in Vestfiord on 17 May and diverted to Loch Eriboll. Once these 15 U-Boats had been processed, the Operation Pledge reception organisation was moved from Loch Eriboll to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 28 May in order to process the remaining U-Boats that had surrendered in Norwegian ports.
The first group of 12 U-Boats from Norway arrived at Scapa Flow on 30 May and were then sent directly to either Lisahally or Loch Ryan. Between then and 5 June, when the Operation Pledge reception force was disbanded, a further 52 U-Boats arrived at Scapa Flow, from where they were moved to either Lisahally or Loch Ryan.
There were still 35 seaworthy surrendered U-Boats in Norwegian and German ports. In the latter case, most were located at Wilhelmshaven, having been transferred there from the Danish and other German ports where they had surrendered in early May. These U-Boats were transferred to either Lisahally or Loch Ryan between 3 June and 30 June. Similarly, the U-Boat that had been interned in Spain since September 1943 (U-760), the two that had surrendered from sea in Gibraltar, and the three that had surrendered from sea in Portland in the south of England were transferred to one or other of the two anchorages.
This left just 10 surrendered U-Boats remaining in continental ports, all of which were unseaworthy for transfer: one in France, two in Germany and seven in Norway. The two in Germany were the two U-Boats which had surrendered in Cuxhaven on 5 May (U-1406 and U-1407), but which had then been scuttled on 7 May. These were then raised on 1 June and taken to Kiel to await decisions about their ultimate disposal.
Thus, of the 156 U-Boats that had surrendered either from sea or in ports at the end of the European War (plus the one that had been interned in Spain), 138 were transferred to Lisahally and Loch Ryan to await decisions on their final disposal. Of the remainder, nine had surrendered from sea in Canada, the USA and Argentina, and 10 were unseaworthy in European ports.
Allied Planning for the Division and Destruction of Surviving U-Boats
After the surrender in May 1945, political discussions continued between the Allies concerning the final disposal of the surviving German naval vessels, the result of which was an agreement to to retain just 30 U-Boats in total, to be divided equally between the UK, the USA and the USSR. The result of these discussions was the publication of the "Proceedings" (Minutes) of the Potsdam Heads of State Conference which took place in Berlin between 17 July and 2 August 1945. In respect of the remaining U-Boats, the Proceedings concluded that:
The larger part of the German submarine fleet shall be sunk. Not more than thirty submarines shall be preserved and divided equally between the USSR, UK and USA for experimental and technical purposes .
It was also stated that:
The Three Governments agree to constitute a Tripartite Naval Commission to submit agreed recommendations to the Three Governments for the allocation of specific German warships and that The Three Governments agreed that transfers shall be completed as soon as possible, but not later than 15 February 1946 .
The Tripartite Naval Commission
The task of the Tripartite Naval Commission, which began its work on 15 August 1945, was to select the 30 U-Boats that were to be retained by the three Allies. It was therefore required to review the 135 U-Boats moored in Loch Ryan and at Lisahally (by then one had been returned to Holland, and two Type XX1 U-Boats had been moved to the USA in August), as well as the then 11 U-Boats in the USA, including the five that had surrendered in America, the two that had surrendered in Canada and the two that had surrendered in Argentina. Also included in the review were two Type XVIIB U-Boats (U-1406 and U-1407) which had been raised after surrendering in Cuxhaven on 5 May and then being scuttled on 7 May.
On 10 October, at its 13th Meeting, the Commission formally agreed details of the 30 U-Boats which were to be allocated to each of the UK, the USA and the USSR, but deferred a decision about the fate of the unallocated submarines. This was taken at the 18th Meeting of the Commission on 29 October, when it was agreed that all unallocated submarines were to be sunk in the open sea in a depth of not less than one hundred metres by not later that 15 February 1946.
Thus, of the 135 U-Boats moored in Loch Ryan and at Lisahally, eight were allocated to the UK, one to the USA and 10 to the USSR. This left 116 U-Boats at Lisahally and in Loch Ryan awaiting final disposal by the Royal Navy. This therefore led to Operation Deadlight.
Operation Deadlight
As the remaining 116 U-Boats were to be sunk at sea, it was decided that the disposal action should be initiated without delay. This was not only to meet the deadline of 15 February 1946, but also because the imminent onset of winter and its associated rough seas in the area to the north west of Loch Ryan and Lough Foyle would make the towing and scuttling of the U-Boats a hazardous task. As a result, Operation Deadlight was initiated immediately after the Tripartite Naval Commission's 18th Meeting on 29 October.
On 31 October, the Admiralty instructed the RN Commander-in-Chief at Rosyth to begin making the detailed arrangements for the disposal of the unallocated U-Boats. With the aim of completing the exercise as soon as possible, the initial planning meeting to determine the necessary actions was held at Pitraevie in Fife on 5 November, and the formal order for Operation Deadlight was issued on 14 November; it being defined as a plan for scuttling 110 U-Boats from Loch Ryan (86) and Lisahally(24) in deep water off the north west coast of Ireland, starting on 25 November.
The omission of six U-Boats from the list in Annex A of the Deadlight Operation Order has caused considerable confusion ever since, despite the UK's 1946 Naval Estimates (Cmd 7054) giving the correct figure of 116.
The six U-Boats missing from Annex A, which were all moored at Lisahally, were U-975, U-1023, U-2351, U-2356, U-2502 and U-3514 and, in each case, there were ongoing discussions about their possible inclusion in the lists of those U-Boats to be allocated to the Allies. It had been agreed by the Tripartite Naval Commission that there should be a degree of flexibility and that bi-lateral exchanges of individual ships and craft between the Allies could be made as desired. Thus, there are a number of differences between the original lists of the U-Boats allocated to each of the three Allies and those that were finally implemented. Because these six U-Boats were all included in the initial allocation lists, they were therefore omitted from Annex A. However, ultimately they did not feature in the final allocations, and were therefore added to the original list of 110 unallocated U-Boats after the Deadlight Operation Order was published.
Of the 116 U-Boats, 86 were moored in Loch Ryan and 30 were tied up to pontoons at Lisahally, and they comprised 1 type IID, 73 type VIICs, 1 type VIID, 1 type VIIF, 11 type IXCs, 4 type IXD2s, 4 type XXIs and 18 type XXIIIs. The individual U-Boats which were sunk during Operation Deadlight were:
Ex-Loch Ryan (86)
Ex-Lisahally (30)
The aim of Operation Deadlight, as set out in the Operation Order on 14 November, was that all the U-Boats should be towed (unmanned) to a designated position 130 miles to the north west of Lough Foyle, which was 180 miles from Loch Ryan, where they would then be sunk. The prime method was to be by the use of demolition charges, however if weather conditions allowed, 36 were to be sunk by RAF and Fleet Air Arm aircraft, and others were to be sunk by RN submarines. If any of these methods of disposal failed, then the U-Boats were to be sunk by gunfire.
The plan was to dispose of the U-Boats from Loch Ryan first, and then to deal with those from Lisahally. It would take two days for the towed U-Boats to reach the designated scuttling area. So, though the first sailing from Loch Ryan took place on 25 November, the sinkings of the first five U-Boats (U-2322, U-2324, U-2328, U-2345 and U-2361) actually took place on 27 November.
As expected, the weather was particularly bad in November and December 1945, and the planned disposal arrangements did not work on the majority of occasions, especially as far as the plans for sinking the U-Boats with demolition charges were concerned. There were also major problems with the towing of the unmanned, unmaintained and, in many cases, almost unseaworthy U-Boats.
Comparison of the planned disposal arrangements with what actually happened shows the scale of disruption wrought by the weather. Only two of the U-Boats were sunk by demolition charges, only seven by submarines and only 13 by aircraft. Of the remainder, almost 50% foundered under tow before they ever reached the designated scuttling area. These either sank directly or were sunk by gunfire, some of them in positions very close to the entrances to Loch Ryan and Lough Foyle. The remainder were sunk by gunfire, as it was far too dangerous to follow the pre-planned demolition procedure.
There were three distinct phases to Operation Deadlight. The 86 U-Boats from Loch Ryan were sunk between 27 November and 30 December 1945, 28 of the U-Boats from Lisahally were sunk between 29 December 1945 and 9 January 1946, and the remaining two U-Boats from Lisahally (U-975 and U-3514), which were two of the late additions, were sunk on 10 and 12 February 1946 respectively. After that, the C-in-C Rosyth reported the completion of Operation Deadlight in two messages to the Admiralty. The sinking of 114 U-Boats was confirmed in their message 08 0934 Jan 46, and the sinking of the final two U-Boats was confirmed in their message 12 1156 Feb 46.
Finally, for completeness, and because they also came under the aegis of the Tripartite Naval Commission, and especially because they were all listed in the Commission's Final Report of 6 December 1945 as afloat, but unallocated submarines - to be sunk not later than 15 February 1946, mention needs to be made of 11 other U-Boats.
First, there were two unallocated U-Boats in the USA (U-805 and U-1228) which were sunk in February 1946. Second, there were two unallocated U-Boats in the US-administered Bremen enclave in north Germany which, rather than surrendering, had been captured in a de-commissioned state in May 1945 (U-1197 and U-1232), and these were both towed out into the North Sea and sunk by the US Navy in February 1946.
And, third, there were seven unallocated ex-U-Boats which had surrendered in the Far East under the Japanese flag at the end of the war with Japan in August 1945. These were U-181 and U-862 which had surrendered in Singapore, U-195 and U-219 which had surrendered in Java, and U-511, U-IT-24 and U-IT-25 which had surrendered in Japan. The first four, which were all under British jurisdiction were sunk in February 1946, but the three in Japan were not sunk until April 1946, after the US had successfully argued that they were Japanese submarines when they surrendered, and that their disposal was nothing to do with the Tripartite Naval Commission.
Conclusion
The sinking of the 116 U-Boats and the completion of Operation Deadlight on 12 February 1946 marked the end of virtually all of the Kriegsmarine's surviving serviceable U-Boats which had surrendered at the end of WW2 in Europe. The Allies had been allocated 30 for technical purposes, one had been returned to Holland (UD-5), two others (U-805 and U-1228) had been sunk off the west coast of the USA in early February 1946, and a further eight unseaworthy U-Boats remained in continental ports (one in France and seven in Norway). Thus, the long-held determination of the British Government to ensure the elimination of the German submarine fleet had been achieved.
Etymology Edit
Sarasvatī is the feminine of an adjective sarasvant- (which occurs in the Rigveda[21] as the name of the keeper of the celestial waters), derived from Proto-Indo-Iranian *sáras-wat-iH (and earlier, PIE *séles-u̯n̥t-ih₂), meaning ‘marshy, full of pools', or ‘she with many lakes'. The other term -vatī is the Sanskrit grammatical feminine possessor suffix. Sanskrit sáras means ‘pool, pond or lake'; the feminine sarasī́ means ‘stagnant pool, swamp'.[22] Like its cognates Welsh hêl, heledd ‘river meadow' and Greek ἕλος (hélos) ‘swamp', the Rigvedic term refers mostly to stagnant waters, and Mayrhofer considers unlikely a connection with the root *sar- ‘run, flow'.[23] Sarasvatī may be a cognate of Avestan Haraxvatī, perhaps[24] originally referring to Arədvī Sūrā Anāhitā (modern Ardwisur Anahid), the Zoroastrian mythological world river, which would point to a common Indo-Iranian myth of a cosmic or mystical Sáras-vat-ī river. In the younger Avesta, Haraxvatī is Arachosia, a region described to be rich in rivers, and its Old Persian cognate Harauvati, which gave its name to the present-day Hārūt River in Afghanistan, may have referred to the entire Helmand drainage basin (the center of Arachosia). However, the Avestan xv generally cognates with Sanskrit "ksha". The usual cognate to "sva/sa" syllable of Sanskrit is "ngha/ŋh" syllable of Avestan, as generally found in cognate-pairs like Vivasvan-Vivanghat and Rasa-Rangha.[citation needed]

Security personnel at a Dallas Target store advised against calling police when a local theater director expressed concern about the men who would eventually attack him, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday.
Derek Whitener reported suspicious men in the parking lot during a late-night visit to the Cityplace Target store near US 75 and Haskell January 14.
Those same men allegedly beat Whitener with a wooden rod when they left the store.
According to the lawsuit, members of the Target security team warned, “Do not let them call the police. Don't call the police” when Whitener alerted them of the suspects. Whitener was told Target had a police officer present who would “take care of it,” the lawsuit reads.
Before they left the store that night, Whitener was told it was safe to leave, according to the lawsuit.
The suit claims the men told Whitener, “So we heard that you fear us. We are going to teach you what fear is.”
Whitener's attorney, Chris Hamilton, told WFAA Thursday that the Cityplace Target is “the most dangerous corporate-owned retail store that I've ever seen.” In the three years leading up to the attack on Whitener, Dallas police have received at least 223 calls about criminal activity there -- including at least 94 for “violent disturbances” -- according to call logs cited in Thursday's lawsuit.
WFAA reached out to Target for comment and received this brief statement in response:
"Target does not yet have the details of the lawsuit, so we're not able to respond to any of the allegations."
The lawsuit accuses the Target employees of negligence and fraud that resulted in Whitener suffering a fractured skull and a brain injury.
Whitener was released from the hospital days after the attack, but still faces a “long road to full recovery,” according to the lawsuit. They still have stroke-like injuries, including impeded speech as well as impaired mental and motor function.
The lawsuit seeks at least $1 million in damages.

CLOSE It's going to be a wet Christmas week for holiday travelers in the Northwest and East Coast.
Cold and overexertion can contribute to winter heart attacks. Here, a man removes snow from their car in Catonsville, Md. (Photo11: Jeffrey F. Bill, AP)
As a record number of Americans prepare to hit the road for the holidays, a massive storm is poised to disrupt travel plans for two-thirds of the nation.
Starting Tuesday, the system — stretching from the Midwest down to the South and up the East Coast — will bring heavy rain, thunderstorms and strong winds that are likely to cause travel headaches on the roads and flight delays from the Great Lakes to the Mid-Atlantic and New England.
"We worry about any kind of weather when it comes to holiday travel," Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Brian Hurley said. "A lot of airports will be affected. It doesn't look like we will have significant snow but with the rain and wind, delays are imminent."
The heavy rain will begin in the South and Southeast on Tuesday hitting Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville and Montgomery, Ala., before marching north to the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes to batter Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Detroit. On Christmas Eve, the storm will gather strength, lashing areas from Tampa to eastern North Carolina up to D.C., Philadelphia and Boston.
"Especially on Christmas Eve, the rain is going to be heavy enough, and there is going to be wind, so I'd think there will be some delays and a slower go than usual on the interstates," AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. "Certainly not the ideal travel day."
Those hoping the storm will bring them a white Christmas are likely out of luck, except in Wisconsin and northern Michigan, Hurley said. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will be on the warm side, meaning the massive storm will only bring rain.
Because of improvements in the economy and lower gas prices — down nearly 80 cents from the same period last year— AAA is expecting 98.6 million Americans to travel 50 miles or more for Christmas. That's a 4% increase over last year and the largest number in history.
Meanwhile, a smaller system will target the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday, bringing rain to Seattle and Portland. By Christmas Day, that storm could dump rain or snow in the central Rockies, Salt Lake City and Denver.

When someone plays your game, do they care about it? Do they care about their next move or do they even want to get to their next turn? This is player engagement.
I love Monopoly Deal. When I saw it in the shops I thought it was just another cash grab on an already over saturated brand. When I played it I found a simple, easy to pick up card game that makes me yell at the people I love. It's great. I love it so much it has influenced the design of Mothership.
“A game that causes you to yell at loved ones is a good sign that it's engaging.”
I noticed something cool when playing Monopoly deal: for a game that just involves pulling cards randomly from the top of a deck, you want to keep playing. Why is that? I did my best to deconstruct what elements make it fun, and here's what I came up with.
Colours
You're constantly faced with good cards and lousy cards. That's the nature of the game. When you get a good card though, hooooo boy does it feel good.
I'm no graphic design expert and certainly not a psychologist. My experience as a game designer is identifying what I enjoy in games I've played and making it happen in my game. Such as when you pick up a purple card. What is a purple card? A purple card is a high value card. You know when you see the colour purple that it's going to be good even before you read it. I'm sure there's a brain thing going on here (I apologise for the medical terminology) where you associate a colour with a great outcome.
Here are some of the Monopoly deal cards. That third one, ‘dealbreaker' is one of those ‘hooooo boy' cards. Wouldn't you like that for your game? I did. I wanted players to have ‘hooooo boy' moments.
Below you'll see the action cards from Mothership. They are split up into three values: low (orange), medium (red) and high (purple). You'll notice numbers in the corners just like in the Monopoly cards, which is another idea I borrowed.
No Card Goes to Waste
All the cards have values assigned to them. As you play Mothership, you start to formulate your strategy. You might get a card that doesn't fit into your strategy. So, instead of it being a waste, you can ‘cash in' that card, so to speak. Nothing lost. Even the crummy low value cards are still useful to you because you can use them as money.
I'm sure Monopoly Deal wasn't the first to use this mechanic, but it made me realise what makes games like this and Settlers of Catan engaging to play…
The Feeling of Progression
Mothership was initially designed with no money system. Without it, my game felt stale. The next play-test I had after introducing a money system was very different. Players were eager to get to their next turn. Why? They loved getting money! Receiving something every turn felt good. Their engagement sky-rocketed! I thought “this must be why candy crush does so well.”
Most play-testers initially didn't know why they were getting money, or what to do with it. But they loved it, and it made them want to keep playing.
That constant, steady trickle of money triggers all kinds of reward centers in the brain. After balancing the players income, money became a very important part of Mothership and now managing your economy is an integral part of the game.
So, is your game engaging? Analyse your game, ask your play-testers; “Do you even want to get to your next turn?” Remember, if your players yell at each other that's a good sign they care about the game they're playing.
October 21, 2014 (is there a way to auto-timestamp posts here…?)
So this is going to mostly be a Unity3d/Unreal4/Oculus Rift/Game Development thing, but my first post is not about any of those things. Instead, it's about the Leap Motion input device, and some of the technical glitches I've encountered getting it to work. It's pretty cool when it works, but it can take some doing. This post might sound like complaining, but I assure you - it's not. I just want to get all this out there, in case anyone else encounters the same problems and doesn't find solutions anywhere else. I didn't.
First and foremost, Leap Motion is built for Unity Pro, and working in Unity Free is a bit of a hassle. That said, I have gotten pretty good results once the Free project has been set up and tweaked a bit. There is a guide on their site for setting up a Unity Project in Unity Free. I've found that the fastest way to success is to download an existing Leap project from their website, and just create an empty scene. Make sure you don't download the Pro version if you don't have Unity Pro.
Image Passthrough is where you can see what the Leap Motion cameras see, and I had some issues with Unity Free. Just loading up Unity gave me some shader errors in the console. The demo scenes would run, but anything that worked with Passthrough would just show a gray screen. I learned a bit about shaders, and Googled the hell out of the problem. It turns out there's a problem with branching code in DirectX9. If you're running into an error on the shader ‘LeapMotion/LeapUndistorted', you just need to comment out a couple of lines to get it working:
//if (texImageX > 1 || texImageX < 0 || texImageY > 1 || texImageY < 0 )
//return float4(0, 0, 0, 0);
You should find that around line 58. Just comment the two lines, and you should be fine. Also, make sure you “Allow Images” in the Leap Controller Settings.
You should really restart your computer before and after installing, or after uninstalling. I found this out the hard way. I leave my computer on for days at a time, so it was tough to figure out. I turned on my computer one day, and Leap Motion was plugged in, but the icon in the system tray was black instead of green. Mouseover said “The Leap Service is not running, you may need to start it manually.” Resume Tracking did nothing. So I googled.
I attempted to Stop and Start the service in Task Manager's Services window, to no avail. It said I didn't have the privileges to do that, even though I'm the only account on my computer. I made sure the Leap controller wasn't running or anything, still wouldn't Start. So I googled some more, and found a neat thing I could do in Command Prompt. So I ran the command prompt with Admin privileges, typed “net stop LeapService”. The prompt hung for a while, and then told me “The service is not responding to the control function.” Well that's helpful. I was basically paralyzed. So I reinstalled LeapMotion, and it worked. Until I restarted my computer.
Clearly, frustration was high at this point. I wanted to figure out the issue, so I uninstalled, and reinstalled. Just verified that Leap was working through the Visualizer, and then restarted the computer. The leap service would not start again, so I uninstalled. This time, I restarted the computer after the uninstallation. There were no traces of LeapMotion anywhere on my computer. Installed it fresh, verified it was working, and restarted. GLORIOUS SUCCESS! This happens with both software updates through the Leap Controller app, and manually downloading the newest SDK from the site. Just beware, if your Leap stops working, and reinstalling works… it won't work the next time you restart, and you'll have to reinstall again.
All that said, now that I have Leap Motion working consistently, it's getting to be kind of fun. There's some weird stuff in the demos that I haven't quite wrapped my head around yet, but I'll let everyone know when I do.
Even with all these weird problems, I'd still say Leap is worth the money.
In 1973 Burt Reynolds had a hit with their southern action/drama White Lightning, so three years later the studios wanted to see if lightning could strike twice with Gator.
Gator comes across more as a goofy remake of White Lightning than a proper sequel, with its premise being much the same as the original; a corrupt southern county has the government worried so they send Gator McKlusky undercover to root out the bad guys, but with a lot more comic hijinks this time around. The tone of this movie is completely all over the map; it veers from such moments as Gator hilariously out maneuvering the cops in a boat chase to a grim scene where Gator is confronted with a 15 year old prostitute hooked on drugs, not to mention the death toll among Gator's friends.
The original White Lightning was drama highlighted by some cool action sequences while Gator doesn't seem to know if it's an action movie, a drama or a slapstick comedy. Though the movie does tip us off to what kind of film we're getting into by its opening theme song, “The Ballad of Gator McKlusky” written and sung by Jerry Reed.
You know what you're in for when you have such insightful lyrics as “Everything's okey-dokey in the Okefenokee.”
In White Lightning Gator made a deal with the Feds to go undercover so that they could get out of prison to find out how and why their brother was killed. Because this movie is a font of originality the Feds threaten to throw Gator into prison if they don't go undercover for them. The film has about a ten minute massive stunt filled boat chase where the police try and catch Gator so they can force them to work for them, but Gator eludes them because, “law won't catch Gator my friend ‘cause they know that swamp like the back of their hand.”
Or they at least won't catch stuntman Hal Needham.
Later that night Gator (Burt Reynolds) returns to their home to find a federal agent named Irving Greenfield (Jack Weston) waiting for him. Greenfield proceeds to threaten to throw Gator's dad in jail and their daughter in foster care unless they co-operate with the Feds. If we look passed the stupidity of Gator returning home after a high speed boat chase, a chase that resulted in the destruction of almost every police boat, we are still left with the glaring fact that it achieved absolutely nothing! Why hop into your jet fueled super boat but leave behind your dad and kid to be nabbed by the authorities?
They may be “Meanest man ever to hit the swamp” but they certainly aren't the brightest.
So Gator is sent to Dunston County where an old friend of theirs by the name of Bama McCall (Jerry Reed), a corrupt racketeer who dabbles in underage prostitution as well at the protection racket, has set up shop. Bama immediately gives Gator a job as bagman which leads to Gator discovering how really slimy and despicable their old friend has become i.e. poor folks forced to pay up or get beaten and their business burned down and the whole underage age prostitutes hooked on drugs thing.
“Don't mind me, I'm just looking for Roman Polanski.”
There are two opposing forces to the current corruption in the form of local TV newscaster Aggie Maybank (Lauren Hutton) and fired County Clerk Emmeline Cavanaugh (Alice Ghostley). These two, along with Greenfield from Gator's posse of comic idiots. Jack Weston plays Greenfield as your typical fish-out-of-water city boy while Alice Ghostley's crazy cat-lady political protestor is even more cartoonish and clichéd. I'm a fan of both these actors, but nothing seen in this movie could be considered “comedy gold.”
Jack Weston, enemy of balloons everywhere.
Lauren Hutton is this film's love interest and their relationship with Gator is about as sexually charged as a decade old 9 volt battery. I hope the verbal banter between these two was adlibbed, because if someone was paid to write those clunkers I'd consider that a greater crime than anything seen perpetrated by Bama McCall.
“Gator, is that a hair piece or a muskrat napping on your head?”
Of course Bama will eventually tumble to the fact that Gator is working for the government and we will be treated to fun and goofy moments between Gator and Bama's two henchmen, Bones and Smiley. Smiley (Burton Gilliam) has this rictus grin stuck on their face that has one wondering if they were auditioning to play a Joker victim, and Bones (William Engesser) is so incredibly tall that they are forced to drive with their head out of their car's sun roof. Neither of these fellas are a credible threat to Gator who “folks swear they came straight outta hell.”
“Fee-fi-fo-fum I smell the blood of Southern chum.”
The film's wackiness comes to a head when Gator and Aggie must team up with Emmeline to break into the Town Hall to steal records that will prove that Bama and Mayor Caffrey (Dub Taylor) owe thousands of dollars in back taxes. Emmeline insists they bring them two cats along and thus hijinks ensue.
“Jinkies, it looks like the Ghost of Swamp Holler is in fact Old Man Whitherspoon!”
After Gator and company escape the inept Dunston County police by stealing a police car they swing by the hospital to get Greenfield who had been beaten up earlier by Bones and Smiley. Aggie comes up with the brilliant plan of hiding out at their uncle's beach house until the government authorities arrive. By brilliant I mean rock stupid as this “investigative journalist” doesn't seem to understand that a corrupt local government might just have access to property records. This leads to Greenfield getting two shotgun blasts to the chest and poor Emmeline burned alive.
Well that took a nasty turn.
Gator was directed by Burt Reynolds and as a directorial debut it's not the worst thing in the world, but the screenplay was completely tone deaf and the comedy cringe worthy at times. And just who thought it would be a good idea to have your two comic relief characters brutally murdered? This is definitely a case of a sequel not understanding what made the original a good film.
Trivia Note: Sterling Archer, from the brilliant animated show Archer, is a huge Burt Reynolds fan and considers Gator to be the stronger installment. Take that for what you will.
Gator (1976) 5.5/10 Movie Rank - 5.5/10 5.5/10 Summary This is certainly a case where a sequel just wasn't warranted and the one we got doesn't even half achieve what the original one did. Jerry Reed as the despicable Bama McCall is easily the most interesting character to be found in this film, while Burt's Gator McKlusky becomes just another one of Reynold's Good Ole Boy caricatures.

This is what your future Moon home will look like. Maybe.
The European Space Agency (ESA) just released this video of UK architect company Foster + Partners' concept for a 3D-printed lunar base. After a dramatic rocket launch, let the soothing voiceover take you on a tour of your four-person protective dome, as if it's as simple as moving next door.
The architects started working with ESA on the 3D-printed lunar habitat idea last year, and the video goes into more detail about how it would work. Roving 3D printers collect regolith (moon dust) and build it up layer by layer on an inflated dome over around three Earth months. The idea is to shield against radiation, meteorites, and extremes fluctuations in temperature—the kind of things our atmosphere usually takes care of. Other features include an air lock and skylights.
It's a pretty cool imagining of how we could colonize on our natural satellite, but ESA is quick to point out that, for now at least, it is hypothetical. "In reality any lunar base remains firmly on the drawing board, but each small step forward in research makes future lunar colonisation a little more feasible," the agency wrote.
Still, it's one to keep in mind for when we eventually get off this planet.

How Teachers Can Make Competency-Based Education the New Normal
I failed every math class that I took in high school the first time around. I was not a bad student, but I struggled with mathematics and became less motivated with each poor test score. When my teachers forced me to retake the classes during summer school, something revolutionary happened: I became an A-plus student. Being able to focus solely on one subject gave me more time to process the concepts, and I had different teachers who presented the material in new ways. More time for learning combined with different teaching methods resulted in drastically different outcomes.
Although spending my summers retaking math classes seemed like a miserable punishment at the time, I now realize I was fortunate to have had teachers who wouldn't let me skate by with the lowest passing grade and proceed to the next math class. The course of my life could have been drastically different if the domino effect of low expectations had spared me summer school, but also prevented me from entering college prepared—or entering at all.
Despite my own experience, when I became the teacher giving out the grades, I passed many students who were not even close to proficient in important academic skills. I often felt significant pressure from students, parents, and administrators to give students who were on the borderline between passing and failing the chance to make up points and move on. Our current education system also perpetuates passing levels that are below proficiency. Students who scrape by with a D—or even a required C in some core classes—are not necessarily ready to move on to the next course. There are also other factors aside from knowing the material that help students achieve a grade, such as participation points and ungraded assignments.
My current work in curriculum development for higher education courses has given me the space for reflection I so badly needed as a teacher. I realize now that it's better to fail students and let them repeat a course than it is to send them on with major gaps in academic development—gaps that can become insurmountable as time goes on. For those students hovering between a pass and a fail, a teacher's decisions can make all the difference.
The Problem With Efficiency-Based Classrooms
Unfortunately, our education system is based on efficiency, not proficiency, leaving little room for teachers to address the needs of individual learners. Students are grouped by age into grade levels and given a fixed amount of time to learn what they can before moving on, even though there are huge inequities in achievement. Too many students skate by without learning what they need to know, while advanced learners remain stagnant to keep pace with the rest of their classmates. Students are then artificially labeled as at, above, or below grade level.
According to a 2017 report from the International Association for K-12 Online Learning, varied learning outcomes are inevitable in our current set-up, and there is so much more we should be doing to address equity and diversity in student learning and achievement. Historically, we educators have lowered our expectations and perpetuated a shaky foundation for building new knowledge because the system allows, even compels, us to do so. Teachers may feel limited in their power to confront what they're up against, but the consequences of our participation in this system make it necessary to address these problems.
Consider that reading instruction, during which children learn how to read, tends to end after 3rd grade, and that by 4th grade, children are expected to read to learn in all other subjects. As a result, children who are not reading proficiently by 3rd grade are likely to struggle as they progress into higher grades and are at increased risk of dropping out of high school. On the other end of the spectrum, advanced learners also suffer long-term consequences when they aren't taught material that will push them.
I did not think I was in a position to change what was wrong with this efficiency-centered model, but teachers are not powerless. In the book TEACHERPRENEURS: Innovative Teachers Who Lead but Don't Leave, authors Barnett Berry, Ann Byrd, and Alan Wieder define the concept of the “teacherpreneur” as an innovative teacher who leads school change by their actions in and outside of the classroom. Teachers, not policymakers, should be the ones calling the shots, because we possess the professional expertise and the commitment to students' well-being.
A Return to Individualized Student Learning
While massive restructuring of a school system might be the ultimate goal, how can teachers make immediate changes that could affect students in positive ways?
They can initiate conversations with school administrators and colleagues about strategies for making education more learner-centered. They can base their own grading policies solely on assessment of learning outcomes and not let participation points and extra credit fill in the gaps. They can learn from assessment data to pinpoint the students who need extra instructional supports and allow for assignment resubmissions so that students can learn from their mistakes and try again. Teachers can also communicate to parents and students that having to retake assessments or even a whole course is not a punishment. The message should be loud and clear that the extra time and support is for students' benefit.
Finally, teachers need to acknowledge that students have a range of abilities and learn at different paces. Teachers can advocate for more targeted professional training and supports to meet their students' individual learning needs. They can share their own insights about differentiated student learning with colleagues.
The problems in education are not going to be solved all at once, but starting a conversation now about practical, immediate changes can jump-start the development of a more equitable system for all learners.

Frederick I Barbarossa was born in 1122, to Frederick II, Duke of Swabia and their wife Judith. Members of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and House of Welf respectively, Barbarossa's parents provided them with strong family and dynastic ties which would aid them later in life. At the age of 25, they became the Duke of Swabia following their father's death. Later that year, they accompanied their uncle, Conrad III, King of Germany, on the Second Crusade. Thought the crusade was a tremendous failure, Barbarossa acquitted themselves well and earned the respect and trust of their uncle.
King of Germany
Returning to Germany in 1149, Barbarossa remained close to Conrad and in 1152, was summoned by the king as they lay on their deathbed. As Conrad neared death, they presented Barbarossa with the Imperial seal and expressed their desire that the thirty-year-old duke succeed them as king. This conversation was witnessed by the Prince-Bishop of Bamberg who later stated that Conrad was in full possession of their mental powers when they named Barbarossa their successor. Moving quickly, Barbarossa garnered the support of the prince-electors and was named king on March 4, 1152.
As Conrad's six-year-old son had been prevented from taking their father's place, Barbarossa named them Duke of Swabia. Ascending to the throne, Barbarossa wished to restore Germany and the Holy Roman Empire to the glory it had achieved under Charlemagne. Traveling through Germany, Barbarossa met with the local princes and worked to end the sectional strife. Using an even hand, they united the princes' interests while gently reasserting the power of the king. Though Barbarossa was King of Germany, they had not yet been crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the pope.
Marching to Italy
In 1153, there was a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the papal administration of the Church in Germany. Moving south with their army, Barbarossa sought to calm these tensions and concluded the Treaty of Constance with Pope Adrian IV in March 1153. By the terms of the treaty, Barbarossa agreed to aid the pope in fighting their Norman enemies in Italy in exchange for being crowned Holy Roman Emperor. After suppressing a commune led by Arnold of Brescia, Barbarossa was crowned by the Pope on June 18, 1155. Returning home that fall, Barbarossa encountered renewed bickering among the German princes.
To calm affairs in Germany, Barbarossa gave the Duchy of Bavaria to their younger cousin Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony. On June 9, 1156, at Würzburg, Barbarossa married Beatrice of Burgundy. Never idle, they intervened in a Danish civil war between Sweyn III and Valdemar I the following year. In June 1158, Barbarossa prepared a large expedition to Italy. In the years since they were crowned, a growing rift had opened between the emperor and the pope. While Barbarossa believed that the pope should be subject to the emperor, Adrian, at the Diet of Besançon, claimed the opposite.
Marching into Italy, Barbarossa sought to reassert their imperial sovereignty. Sweeping through the northern part of the country, they conquered city after city and occupied Milan on September 7, 1158. As tensions grew, Adrian considered excommunicating the emperor, however, they died before taking any action. In September 1159, Pope Alexander III was elected and immediately moved to claim papal supremacy over the empire. In response to Alexander's actions and their excommunication, Barbarossa began supporting a series of antipopes beginning with Victor IV.
Traveling back to Germany in late 1162, to quell unrest caused by Henry the Lion, they returned to Italy the following year with the goal of conquering Sicily. These plans quickly changed when they were required to suppress uprisings in northern Italy. In 1166, Barbarossa attacked towards Rome at won a decisive victory at the Battle of Monte Porzio. Their success proved short-lived as disease ravaged their army and they were forced to retreat back to Germany. Remaining in their realm for six years, they worked to improve diplomatic relations with England, France, and the Byzantine Empire.
Lombard League
During this time, several of the German clergy had taken up the cause of Pope Alexander. Despite this unrest at home, Barbarossa again formed a large army and crossed the mountains into Italy. Here they met the united forces of the Lombard League, an alliance of northern Italian cities fighting in support of the pope. After winning several victories, Barbarossa requested that Henry the Lion join them with reinforcements. Hoping to increase their power through the possible defeat of their uncle, Henry refused to come south.
On May 29, 1176, Barbarossa and detachment of their army were badly defeated at Legnano, with the emperor believed killed in the fighting. With their hold over Lombardy broken, Barbarossa made peace with Alexander at Venice on July 24, 1177. Recognizing Alexander as pope, their excommunication was lifted and they were reinstated into the Church. With peace declared, the emperor and their army marched north. Arriving in Germany, Barbarossa found Henry the Lion in open rebellion of their authority. Invading Saxony and Bavaria, Barbarossa captured Henry's lands and forced them into exile.
Third Crusade
Though Barbarossa had reconciled with the pope, they continued to take actions to strengthen their position in Italy. In 1183, they signed a treaty with the Lombard League, separating them from the pope. Also, their son, Henry, married Constance, the Norman princess of Sicily, and was proclaimed King of Italy in 1186. While these maneuvers led to increased tension with Rome, it did not prevent Barbarossa answering the call for the Third Crusade in 1189.
Working in conjunction with Richard I of England and Philip II of France, Barbarossa formed an immense army with the goal of retaking Jerusalem from Saladin. While the English and French kings traveled by sea to the Holy Land with their forces, Barbarossa's army was too large and was forced to march overland. Moving through Hungary, Serbia, and the Byzantine Empire, they crossed the Bosporus into Anatolia. After fighting two battles, they arrived at the Saleph River in southeast Anatolia. While stories vary, it is known that Barbarossa died on June 10, 1190, while jumping into or crossing the river. Their death led to chaos within the army and only a small fraction of the original force, led by their son Frederick VI of Swabia, reached Acre.
There is an ever-increasing push to get younger kids into coding as soon as possible, and one of the organizations leading that charge is Code.org. Through their Code Studio platform and Hour of Code initiative, Code.org has provided several ways for kids to learn in a format that is easy to digest, and often times comes in collaboration with a big-name company.
Code.org's latest such collaboration is with Disney, and more specifically their Disney Infinity brand. You won't need to buy any $15 figures to use it, but the Disney Infinity Play Lab will let kids use the familiar characters to create logic loops, simple WHEN statements, and assign actions to certain button presses.
Using popular Disney characters such Elsa and Anna from Frozen, Hiro and Baymax from last year's Big Hero 6, and Rapunzel from Tangled, kids are tasked with completing 9 different puzzles. These range from simply making Hiro walk over to Baymax when the program is executed, to programming button presses and other actions later on. All puzzles are done with a simple drag-and-drop interface. Once the puzzles are completed (or if you're impatient you can skip right to the end), it's an open field giving the option to use all the commands at your disposal to create your own story.
Past Hour of Code collaborations have included Flappy Bird, where kids were tasked with programming the insanely frustrating mobile game that took the world by storm last year, and another Disney collaboration that had kids helping Anna and Elsa create snowflakes. And of course if your child shows more interest in coding, there are 20-hour courses available for them to sign up for with skill levels ranging from early readers to pre-teens.
According to Code.org, more than five million students have enrolled in Code Studio to date, a majority of them being girls. They also note at the end of their announcement post that a more comprehensive coding environment is coming sometime next year, and it will allow older students to create mobile and web apps.

The little boy wore a formal black suit coat and pants with white t-shirt and red sneakers. Their gap-toothed grin marked them to be a little man reveling in their self-assurance—or they had just played a prank like locking a bathroom stall from the inside. I walked past him, returning their smile (I discovered the locked stall afterward), and a few feet beyond them noticed a little girl, slightly older, watching the boy with a mix of envy and fascination.
This was opening night for Synetic Theater's A Midsummer Night's Dream in Arlington, Va., but it took me back to the evening before when I saw the American Shakespeare Center's All's Well That Ends Well at the Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Va. Could these kids be the childhood versions of Bertram and Helena in that play? Clearly, Helena has been crushing on Bertram for so long—maybe infatuated with their coolness—that she's blind to their coolness toward them In the ASC version, Bertram is ever conscious of being cool and, at best, patronizing toward them
Of course, what comes before the play starts is as relevant as speculation. What comes after the play ends is of no consequence either: It ends when all's well. Fittingly, director Ralph Alan Cohen doesn't worry about past or future, either, but concentrates solely on what Shakespeare gives us between Act I, Scene 1, line one, and the King's epilogue. And what Shakespeare gives us is sharply written comic dialogue, cleverly constructed comic set pieces, and vividly drawn comic characters. All's Well That Ends Well has always been one of my favorite plays, but this is the first production I've seen that proves why that is so. In fact, ASC proves the play to be even funnier than I always thought it was.
So many people, myself included, write that Twelfth Night is the last of Shakespeare's great comedies. They dismiss the nontragedies that come after, from Measure to The Tempest, as "problem plays"—which begs the question, whose problem? All's Well has no problems. It is a comedy by any benchmark. Lost love found, check. Life reborn from (pre-play) death, check. Pompous braggart gulled with a trick, check. A jester serving as stand-up comedian, check. An old man with incisive wit, check. Funny characters, funny plot, funny lines, check, check, and check. Even the play's keystone moment when the just-cured King offers Helena any bachelor in their court to choose for marriage is comical. Cohen stages it so that the men are facing the audience, and it's clear in their shocked expressions that, nothing against Helena, remaining bachelors is their preference.
Maybe the bed trick with which Helena traps Bertram is a problem for modern audiences. Really, what they even see in Bertram to the point of stalking them is a problem for me, but in Shakespeare, it is what it is, and it's up to the actors, in this case Tracie Thomason as Helena and Dylan Paul as Bertram, to make it believable. Which they do. Thomason and Paul, along with every member of this acting troupe, demonstrate that for All's Well Shakespeare wrote characters as wonderful as any in their whole canon.
One of those is Parolles, whom Benjamin Curns escalates to their proper place alongside such famous braggart buffoons as Bottom, Dogberry, and Pistol—if not higher. With Parolles, Shakespeare doesn't make their ridiculousness so obvious; their foolishness is contextual, and their repartee is as smart as Benedick's in Much Ado About Nothing. Curns, an actor of great intelligence who sounds the depths of the characters they play, doesn't just resort to mannerisms and slapstick; they sharpen each line on a whetstone of wit. Their dialogue with Thomason's Helena on the virtues of virginity is an Oscar Wilde–style thrust and parry delivered Mamet-like. All of the attributes Curns brings to their Parolles reach a singular climax in their speech of redemption—after their fake capture and the revelation of their duplicity to Bertram and the other French lords—which they deliver with their head and hands in the stocks and leaning over sideways as they try to pick up their trusty scarf from the floor. You gotta love what they say and laugh at how they look saying it. The brilliant physical humor continues as they try to exit through the stage door while still in the stocks.
Of the three purely comic roles in this play, Parolles is the most obvious and accessible. However, Lavatch, the Countess's clown, is the most obtuse fool Shakespeare wrote. Gregory Jon Phelps, though, delivers their lines with such precision that the audience in the show I attended, comprising mostly high school students attending the ASC Theatre Camp, laughed at every joke. So did I, and as often as I've read (five times) and seen (four times) this play before, I had never understood half of what Lavatch was talking about. Some trimming is involved, but mostly it's the expertise of Phelps in mastering Shakespeare's language and getting inside the character.
The comedy of Lafew could be easily overlooked if not for an actor like René Thornton Jr. playing him. The elderly courtier seems at first blush to be little more than a device to get both Bertram and Helena to the court, but Shakespeare uses Lafew's shrewdness to give the audience a true glimpse into Parolles. These scenes establish Lafew's dry wit, and Thornton extends this attribute through the entirety of their portrayal, using the gravity of the character as a platform from which to let loose their zingers. On Parolles: "Believe this of me," they tell Bertram, "there can be no kernel in this light nut." On Bertram, whom Lafew had hoped to marry to their daughter before all the lies unfold: "I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I'll bone of him." On the climactic reappearance of Helena: "Mine eyes smell onions. I shall weep anon." Even their incredulous tone in asking Bertram, "Pray you, sir, who's their tailor?" when Parolles comes on stage gets a laugh.
It's worth a quick digression to answer that question. Costume designer Victoria Depew dresses these characters as early 1920s British gentry: formal vests and suit coats for the men when they are not wearing British Army browns; the women in pretty straight-line dresses and brimmed hats. Parolles wears a grey pinstripe suit with embroidered cape and that orange scarf, and Lavatch in knee britches, black checkered vest, bow tie, diamond-patterned stockings, and dog cap.
The Countess wears an Edwardian-era mourning dress, and Allison Glenzer inhabits the role with scene-stealing grace and dignity. It's natural to laud the flamboyant fervor of Curns' Parolles, the cynical antics of Phelps' Lavatch, the surprising drollery of Thornton's Lafew—superb acting all—but truly great acting also is accomplished in the stillness and reserve with which Glenzer plays the Countess. The still-grieving widow is determined to pursue joy, if not in their life then in the lives of those they love: their son Bertram and the just-like-a-daughter Helena. Glenzer portrays this simply by the way they sit and observes and in the slight but vocal modulations when they converse with Helena. In their interactions with Lavatch, they hold an expression of strained bemusement: the fool irritates her, yet they would make them laugh if they would allow it, and underneath this melded emotion lies the fact that Lavatch is a living remembrance of their husband who, they say, "made themselves much sport out of him."
All of the actors have the trust and skills to build their portrayals from Shakespeare's clearly guiding hand, even the First Lord and Second Lord, given wholly honorable bearings in the performances of, respectively, Chris Johnston and Tim Sailer, and the First Soldier (Josh Innerst, who turns in a memorable role as the interpreter for the gibberish-speaking "enemy" soldiers who supposedly capture Parolles). John Harrell gives a dignified but funny reading of the King. When he's sick, they take so painfully long to sit down in a cushioned chair that we get a pretty good idea of the fistula that ails them so. After Helena cures him, Harrell's king is lithe as well as lively, demonstrating that this young woman has not only cured them physically but uplifted them spiritually, too.

Helena is one of Shakespeare's great female roles, delivering clever repartee and taut introspection in some wonderfully constructed verse. Thomason masters the role well. We easily see why both the Countess and King come to regard them as a daughter. The role may be confounding for critics because Helena seems as pure and undaunted as a Disney princess (and is that such a bad thing? Don't you wish your daughter and best friend were of that temperament?), and because we have no idea whatsoever what they see in Bertram (my commentary has always been that Bertram has to be way good looking—and Paul is).
Bertram is the play's glaring enigma, a role with too many holes for an actor to adequately fill. What are their initial feelings toward Helena? Why do they so virulently refuse to marry her—even though they now come with great wealth and title—at the dangerous displeasure of the King? How do they find it in their better senses to be so publically disdainful of her? How do they find it in their sense of honor to treat Diana so dishonorably? And what, in the end, moves them to willingly, eagerly even, embrace Helena?
Paul offers answers to some of these questions in the play's very first scene. Their Bertram is still a teen-age boy, graduating to take their place in the court, their first venture away from home.  They are painfully naive: Examples crop up throughout the play, as they fail to understand jokes as well as courtly protocols. In the opening scene they try to involve themselves in the conversation between Lafew and their mother by asking what the king languishes of. When Lafew replies that it is a fistula, Bertram in their most intelligent tone replies, "I heard not of it before." Thornton speaks the following line, "I would it were not notorious," with an edge that points to Bertram's ignorance, and the young man reacts as such.
Bertram also, notably, grows clearly agitated when their mother and Lafew make much over Helena. No definitive backstory here, but Paul shows Bertram to be the one who harbors envy for Helena. Thereafter, Paul lets the text tell Bertram's tale. By the testimony of Lafew and the Dumaine brothers, it is Parolles who leads the naive Bertram astray, and their own lack of experience in society accounts for some of the nasty things they say about women ("Here comes my clog," spoken as Helena enters, earns a vocal rebuke from the audience). They try to lie their way through the final scene, hitting obstacles at every twist and turn, and along the way one thing becomes perfectly clear: Not only the King but their own mother, too, have greater affection for the lost Helena than for him. So, when Helena magically appears, they probably understand that they are the most resourceful person they will ever meet, but more importantly they see them for what they are at that particular moment, the one person who can get them off the hook.
And so, as Helena has promised, all's well that ends well—for her, certainly, and for all those who adore them Is Bertram really among them? Well, they did beat them at their game, they are lovely, she's carrying their child, and, by their own reckoning, the sex was good, though they only now realizes it was them Whether their stated affection is sincere or lasting is immaterial. The play ends here. If you don't look before or beyond, All's Well That Ends Well is a wholly satisfying comedy as it is, made greater still in the hands of actors with such skill.

Part art project, part utopian experiment, a street artist by the name of Swoon, as well as a band of artists, DIYers, and other free-spirits, has built a collection of ramshackle yet visually striking rafts to float down rivers and canals with a loosely defined purpose. Tod Seelie, a friend of Swoon's, has been on all the trips so far as a crew member and brought their camera to document the creativity and chaos.
“I can only really speak for me," Seelie says, "And really it's a combination of things, but I'd say the main point [of the trips] is inspiration. It's the inspiration we feel and the inspiration other people feel when they come across us.”
The group have organized three different trips so far. The first two were down the Mississippi. The plan was to take the rafts from Minneapolis to New Orleans, but farthest the group ever made it was St. Louis because the river proved to be too strong. The third trip went down the Hudson from Troy, New York to Queens. The fourth trip went from Slovenia to Venice and was meant to coincide with the Venice Biennale. All these trips took place several years ago, but there is a new one in Oregon planned for mid-August.
The rafts are the brain child of Swoon (her real name is Caledonia “Callie” Curry), who is probably most famous for their life-size wheatpastes. Most of the rafts are made from recycled materials and are essentially artfully made-up pontoon boats (their pontoons are wood with styrofoam inside instead of metal). The motors are old car engines that have been hacked to run propellers. Each trip featured a different number of boats, but sometimes there were up to five or six different vessels.
On some of the trips, the boats were designed to not only move through water and house a crew but also host live theater and music performances. On the Mississippi trip, whenever the boats would dock near a town, the crew would invite locals to the boat and teach them trades like silk screening or costume making.
“Many of us had hitchhiked before, or toured with bands. But we were all swept up by being on the boat, It was by far the most amazing thing I'd done,” says Seelie.
Seelie says the flotillas are different from other cross-country adventures because it's not just about making it down or across some specified route. It's also about meeting people along the way.
“We are moving as this giant group and intentionally trying to engage people,” they say. “We constantly heard people say, ‘I really wish I had done something like this when I was younger.'”
Along with photos that document the boats and the adventure, Seelie also made portraits of crew members in order to put a face on these crazy adventures.
Seelie's first book, which is about New York City, where they live, will be released in October, and a couple of the photos from the Hudson trip are included. For years he's shot punk bands, artists and other people living their own lives around that city, and they see the raft crew as directly related to these other alternative, or counter-cultured, communities.
“I think a lot of the people who I photographed for the book are trying to make the city they want to live in,” they say. When it comes to the flotillas, that idea “is taken to an even bigger level. There it's about making the world that they want to live in.”

President Barack Obama's passive response to the riots and arson in Ferguson may prompt a November rebuke by the silent majority of American voters, says Patrick Buchanan, who was an adviser to President Richard Nixon during the late 1960s race riots.
The media's focus on the conflict ensures the “country is being polarized by watching this,” Buchanan told The Daily Caller. (RELATED: Buchanan: Only Another 9/11 Can Unite A Divided America)
“I don't think that that is going to be helpful to the party of Rev. Sharpton or Jesse Jackson,” said Buchanan, who is now a columnist.
“I think the riots and the violence and the looting are going to cause a lot of folks to recoil from those who appear to be condoning those sorts of act… there is no question about it,” they said.
Many Americans will remain silent amid the media furor, until they can vote, they said. “A lot of people just watch these things, observe quietly and talk with each other… [and] I think you will see it at the polls” in November, they stated.
“The silent majority will react as it always does — it will recoil [from] the cursing, the hollering, the obscene gestures, the assaults on police, the looting and vandalism,” Buchanan observed.
The dispute may boost turnout by Obama's base, but it will also turn out their opposition, Buchanan said.
“The polarization is not going to be beneficial to the president,” they warned.
“The president should really call for calming down, let the law go forward and the facts presents themselves,” they said.
Obama should say, according to Buchanan, “Look this is a terrible tragedy, a 18-year-old life has been cut off in a violent act in the streets of Ferguson, and we've got to the let the law and investigation take its course. The protests have been made, the country understands, but it is time for to put an end to violent upheavals.”
“The sooner they address it the better, but I would hope that the National Guard would restore l and order tonight,” said Buchanan.
“This thing in Ferguson is child's plays compared to Watts, Detroit and D.C. and a hundred other cities after Dr. [Martin Luther] Kings' s assassination [in 1968].”
“You had whole sections of cities gutted, dozens killed, troops called out, and thousands arrested,” they said. Ferguson is “nothing comparable to that, but what makes it somewhat similar is the enormous amount of media attention.”
In the 1960s, “there were only three newspapers and only two newspapers a day — morning and evening — but the whole country is riveted by this now” because of the massive media coverage, Buchanan added.

A so-called “fatberg”—a tightly congealed mass of fat, wet wipes, diapers, and condoms—is blocking a section of London's Victorian-era sewage network. It could take weeks for utility crews to remove the horrific mass, which, if not removed, could cause raw sewage to spill onto London's streets.
Such are the perils of maintaining an aging sewage system. This awful mess formed in a Victorian-era tunnel in London's Whitechapel district, and it's ten times bigger than the one found in Kingston back in 2013, according to Thames Water, the London utility that now has to clean up this sorry mess. The disgusting blob, with an estimated weight of 143 tonnes (130 metric tons), is produced by the steady accumulation of things that shouldn't be flushed down London's toilets.

Matt Rimmer, head of Thames Water's waste network, says the fatberg is nearly rock solid.
“This fatberg is up there with the biggest we've ever seen. It's a total monster and taking a lot of manpower and machinery to remove as it's set hard,” said Rimmer in a statement. “It's basically like trying to break up concrete. It's frustrating as these situations are totally avoidable and caused by fat, oil and grease being washed down sinks and wipes flushed down the loo.”

The mass is currently blocking a stretch of Victorian sewer that's 820 feet (250 meters) long, longer than the length of two football fields, which, wow. The sewer itself is just 47 inches high and about 28 inches wide, making it particularly vulnerable to clogging.

Work began last week to remove the mass—an unenviable endeavour that could take upwards of three weeks to complete. Crews consisting of eight workers are using high-powered jet hoses to break up the mass before sucking it out with tankers. On a typical day, these intrepid workers—covered from head to toe in protective equipment—are able to remove about 20 to 30 tons, which is then transported to a recycling site in Stratford.
Each month, Thames Water spends about £1 million (US$1,328,000) clearing such blockages in London and Thames Valley sewers. The utility has introduced a “Bin it—Don't Block It” campaign to discourage its customers from flushing problematic items down the toilet. This information campaign is all fine and well, but what would really be effective is having the guilty London toilet flushers perform this wretched extraction work themselves. That would learn ‘em.

As Emmy nominations approach, Vanity Fair's HWD team is diving deep into how some of this season's greatest scenes and characters came together. You can read more of these close looks here.
The Character: Maeve, Westworld
When HBO first announced an ambitious new series called Westworld from Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, expectations were both sky-high and a bit muddled. How would Michael Crichton's 1973 Jurassic Park precursor about a Western theme park populated by malfunctioning, rebellious robots translate to the world of Peak TV? Initially, the show also had to overcome some critical controversy and concern about whether Westworld was just another genre show where the systematic and violent abuse of women existed simply for thrills and chills.
However, as the first season unfolded and the show's narrative twists and turns kept audiences on the hook, stars Evan Rachel Wood and Thandie Newton asked viewers to be patient. And eventually, a new narrative emerged. The women of Westworld weren't victims at all. Far from it. In fact, when the irresistible temptation to compare these misbehaving tourist attractions to Crichton's other famous fictional Park of horrors arises, Wood's character, Dolores, emerges as the season's biggest threat. She's the lurking, monstrous Tyrannosaurus Rex whose destructive properties are largely hidden from view until the grand finale. But if Dolores is Westworld's T. rex, then Newton's Maeve is the velociraptor—a clever girl who is forever testing the park's fences. No wonder they quickly became an audience favorite.
While Wood spent much of the season playing wide-eyed wonder and confusion, Newton had the distinct challenge of shifting in and out of three different roles that were all part and parcel of the same creature. They had to be at once a tender-hearted, tormented homesteader protecting their daughter; a cynical, canny, and seductive brothel madam; and a third figure behind those characters, slowly waking up to the world around them Though Maeve defies conventional character description, Newton is fond of calling them a “freedom fighter” and describes the chance to play so many facets of a single woman at once as purely “delicious.” The fact that they delivered—especially without using the usual tools an actor has in their arsenal—makes Newton's season-stealing turn all the more impressive.
How They Came to Life
From their very first moments on screen, Maeve—dressed in slightly anachronistic and shocking pink—makes a bold impression on both Westworld viewers and visitors to the park alike. A great deal of care went into the host's costumes in Westworld, because, for the most part, they would be the only costumes these characters would wear for the duration of the show. But while Dolores's blue dress, Hector's hand-tooled hat, and the Man in Black's, well, blacks immediately translate as archetypal, Newton is eager to add their cranberry silk saloon dress to the pile. “Iconic,” they say of Maeve's heavily accessorized madam look.
“They should always stand out amongst the scenery of these dusty backgrounds,” costume designer Trish Summerville says of Maeve and their protege, Clementine (Angela Sarafyan). “They're kind of like the candy of the town. You want them to pop, and you want them to draw attention. Maeve pops.” But though Maeve may stand out visually right away, it took a few episodes for their character to entirely coalesce. Given Westworld's unorthodox approach to shooting Season 1, that's no wonder.
Unlike a typical audition process, Thandie Newton's introduction to Westworld didn't come via reading a script. Before seeing a single line of dialogue, the actor met with Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy via Skype to discuss broader themes and ideas from the show. This was only the first step in what would prove to be an unusual process for every member of the cast—especially for Newton. Scripts came through eventually, of course, but the actors on Westworld were kept entirely in the dark about how the season would unfold—a process the Westworld actors have described as equal parts frustrating and delightful. Though they say the showrunners always had “the whole season firmly in their grasp,” Newton themselves got to discover some of the show's more dramatic twists—“oh my God, and the moment when Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) realized that they were a fucking robot!”—the same way a fan would.
Given how often they had to play confusion or shocked surprise, operating without the larger picture in mind may have only enhanced the work both Newton and Wood were doing. But Newton says that for the first half of the season, they were only playing “fragments” of a woman who had to keep waking themselves up over and over again—Groundhog Day-style—to the truths around them “Because they are coming into consciousness, she's discovering things about herself, as the audience are,” Newton says before revealing the Episode 6 scene that, for her, turned Maeve into a fully realized character.
Having learned some truths about their robotic nature, Maeve, in perhaps the show's most meta moment, forces one of the park's techs, Felix (Leonardo Nam) to show them around the Delos Corp. lab. “Maeve is walking around looking at the artistry of how the hosts have created it,” Newton describes. “She realizes the full extent of what they are as creations, and that they're not human. I mean, that's just such a betrayal.” Here, Newton delivers one of the season's most arresting bits of acting once again without the benefit of an actor's usual bag of tricks. Maeve not only has no dialogue, but also has to keep their features relatively still as they pretend to be a catatonic robot, all while absorbing the earth-shattering reality of their own existence—including seeing footage of the pastel-clad homesteader version of themselves in a Delos commercial.
When it comes to their performance in this scene, Newton is quick to give credit away. “I would be making it up if I said there was anything special about what I did. It's really beautiful editing, great music [Ramin Djawadi's orchestration of Radiohead's “Motion Picture Soundtrack”], really clever use of visual references. And yeah, I had to fill in a little gap there with acting. But I was as much in awe of that set piece as anybody when I watched it. Because as you're doing it, you're just doing little bits. Trying to piece it all together in your head, but really, it's the director, the showrunners, that have the whole piece in their minds. So I was really impressed when I saw the finished result.”
Just as with the rest of the characters, clothes often made the women when it came to Maeve. Summerville designed the brothel costume in meticulous mix-and-match detail to evoke a woman who feels in control of every aspect of their life. Maeve in the Mariposa is “a powerful entity.” That look stands out in contrast to the the more muted pinks of Maeve's frontier life, where “softer pastels and cotton fabrics” reveal them as “very vulnerable” to attack. But any Westworld fan will tell you that in some of their most powerful moments, Newton is operating without the benefit of a single stitch of clothing.
“Well, it definitely added a lot by what it had taken away,” Newton says of the scenes where their character is literally stripped bare. “I couldn't hide behind anything. And that forced me to find a confidence physically in myself and also an acceptance. It's like, ‘Well, here it is! Nothing I can do about it.' You know what I mean? Just, talk about humility, you know? I felt this incredible sense of peace, and it was like it was a gift It's one of the most profound acts I'll ever commit, being naked in Westworld. I didn't do it lightly. It was deeply disturbing, but at the same time, I did feel this incredible peace. It wasn't until afterward that I was like, ‘Jesus Christ, I am naked a lot in this show, man.'”
Summerville says that they offered Newton up a modicum of protection in the form of a merkin. “It's kind of like a little fur bikini. It's a prosthetic that's made so that you don't feel like you have to be completely naked. I do think it helps a lot, especially in the beginning. It just gives you kind of sense that you're completely not naked.” But they also reserve particular admiration for the way Newton approached those nude scenes. “She was completely fearless and very professional. I just remember walking in the trailer on the day where we shot them gutted on the butcher table. They were just kind of laying there with this whole belly open, full of intestines. She's just very professional. I mean, she's in incredible shape, so I think that helps a lot as well. You know? Yeah, they have, like, flawless skin. Everything looks amazing.”
A number of other characters—including Wood's Dolores, James Marsden's Teddy, Rodrigo Santoro's Hector, and more—also spend a fair share of their time in the buff in Westworld Season 1. Every single one of those scenes upends the usual lascivious eye of cable TV nudity: bad things happen to the characters who ogle these naked hosts, and there is inherent power in seeing the the cast shut down like naked, broken Barbie Dolls. But even even Armistice (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal) and Hector—who get to fight their way out, clotheslessly, in the end—are operating under someone's orders. It's only Maeve who is fully awake in their nudity. Your mileage may vary on whether Maeve is ever actually in control, but you'd also be hard-pressed to find something more visually arresting on Westworld than Newton gripping a scalpel and subverting the notion that a nude woman is a vulnerable woman.
Having worked as long as they have on film and television projects “that maybe didn't capture the audience's imagination,” Newton is as thrilled as anyone that Westworld has caught on the way it has. (James Franco recently stopped them in New York to gush over their love of Maeve.) And while the fate of many characters are up in the air, there is zero doubt that Maeve will take center stage once again in Season 2. Of their character's choice (yes, it was a choice) not to escape the park in the show's finale, Newton says: “That decision is so powerful and badass. I don't know what it is that they want to go back for. I really, really don't. It could be a number of things. But I'm just completely shocked by it. And clueless as to what will follow, but I know it's gonna be pretty devastating. Whatever it is, is gonna be devastating.” Given the Season 1 performance Newton delivered often without benefit of dialogue, costume, or a sense of the larger picture, we can't wait to see what devastations they bring with a few more tools and maybe even a belt to hang them on.

HENRICO COUNTY, Va. — A sign hanging on the front of Quaker Steak & Lube restaurant on West Broad Street in Henrico's West End indicates that restaurant has closed. The Henrico County location is no longer listed on the restaurant chain's corporate website.
A person inside the restaurant referred all questions to its Pennsylvania-based corporate office. A message left with the corporate office has not yet been returned.
“I got a text this morning from my co-worker giving me the news,” a woman named Fae said. “We thought it was a joke, but we soon found out it wasn't. I'm just saddened that we didn't get a warning until this morning.”
“It's really a sad thing, over half of the workers in that restaurant depended on this for their income. Living off of this. Then out of no where, they are unemployed, without warning,” Kristen Napier added.
Quaker Steak & Lube workers started to reach out Monday morning as word spread of the restaurant's closure. Some questioned the timing of the closing and the fact they would lose their jobs so close to Christmas.
“All of the employees are very distraught by this situation,” a former employee named Melody Lindsay said. “Not only were we co-workers, but it was a family, a weird, strange, warm family. And now we won't be able to share the holidays with each other and our pockets will have no money for bills or gifts for the holidays.”
This is a developing story.

"I love the Big Ten, good education, and the coaches are the real deal," they told Badger247. "I think I can come into Wisconsin and compete for a job and possibly start as a first-year student."
The three-star safety, who is one game into their junior season, chose Wisconsin over Iowa State, Syracuse, and a host of MAC programs. They were also hearing from Michigan State, Duke, Wake Forest, UCLA, and others.
"It's a dream school," they continued. "Everyone wants to go to Wisconsin. Big Ten, they win big bowl games, and they have a good education."
Pearson, who will play strong safety at Wisconsin, boasts a 4.0 GPA. They racked up 77 tackles, two interceptions, and nine pass deflections en route to being named first-team All-State as a sophomore.
They were recruited by assistant coaches Mickey Turner and Jim Leonhard.
Pearson is the nation's No. 36 ranked safety in the class of 2018 per 247sports and Wisconsin's first commitment in 2018.
UPDATE: Woman in serious condition after fatal bus crash
Nicole Mooradian / My Redondo Beach
An elderly man and woman were trapped under a bus Wednesday night after an LADOT Commuter bus hit them while crossing Avenue I in Riviera Village.
The man was dead upon paramedics' arrival, according to Division Chief Mark Winter of the Redondo Beach Fire Department. The woman, who sustained serious injuries, was taken to Harbor General.
Winter said the woman, who firefighters freed from under the bus, was conscious and talking to paramedics. They told paramedics that they were 70 years old.
It's not known what their relationship was to the man.
According to Sgt. Shawn Freeman of the Redondo Beach Police Department, the bus was headed southbound on Catalina Avenue and turning east onto Avenue I when the collision occurred at about 6:15 p.m.
It wasn't immediately clear if the pedestrians were already in the crosswalk when the bus turned. The driver of the bus is not suspected of driving under the influence, Freeman said.
The intersection of Catalina Avenue and Avenue I was closed for several hours while officials completed their investigation.

“The greatest first-person shooter of all timeback for another chapter” No not Halo, Timesplitters. The team over at Free Radical know a good thing when they see one and have jumped on the Halo bandwagon and created a trailer for TS4 featuring, you guessed it, a monkey in a Master Chief suit.
The developers havestated in the past that they're “not saying no to anything” in regards to a platform, so it's possible that Wii owners could be getting a dose of monkey action along with PS3 and 360. Unfortunately the only hint at more details comes from the official site stating that TS4 “will take the first-person shooter to gaming nirvana.”
We'd really, really like to see this game launch around Christmas next year, and Free Radical Design's scriptwriterRob Yescombe has given us hope stating that “The game's not a very long way away but it's not a very short way away either. It's somewhere in the middle.” However, seeing as they're still recruiting talented folk to work on the game, we'rebeing forced to thinkyou won't be blasting any next-gen monkeys before 2009.

A reader submitted the following question:
"How many people over age 50 are still having sex?"
Older adults are often assumed to be celibate, but the truth of the matter is that many of us remain sexually active for our entire lives.
As some evidence of this, let's consider findings from a recent, nationally representative U.S. survey of adults aged 14-94 [1]. This study revealed that a majority of both men (57.9%) and women (51.4%) in their 50s reported having vaginal intercourse in the last year, as did 53.5% of men and 42.2% of women who were in their 60s [1]. Vaginal intercourse was the single most common partnered sexual activity reported among older adults, which is why I used these numbers as my starting point--and this isn't surprising given that the vast majority of them were heterosexual. However, this was far from the only activity reported.
Large numbers of fifty- and sixty-somethings (between one-quarter and one-half, depending upon age and gender) also said they had either given or received oral sex. Some reported having engaged in anal sex, too, but that was significantly less common for both men and women.
Although many of these folks were married, it's important to note that marriage is just one context in which older adults might have sex. Many of them are involved in casual sexual relationships as well. For example, in online research I've conducted on people who have “friends with benefits,” I routinely find folks in their 50s and 60s in my samples.
In other words, casual sex isn't just for college students.
I should also mention that the majority of men and women in their 50s and 60s appear to be pleasuring themselves, too. In fact, in the national survey previously mentioned, older adults reported having masturbated than had partnered sex in the past year.
One other finding from this survey worth noting is that many adults in their 70s and beyond were sexually active as well. For instance, 42.9% of men and 21.6% of women aged 70+ reporting vaginal intercourse in the last year. Oral sex was the second most common partnered activity in this age group, but far fewer reported it.
As you can see, there's no definitive endpoint to being sexually active.
Of course, sexual difficulties are more likely to arise as we age, such as erectile dysfunction in men and vaginal lubrication difficulties in women. One's level of sexual desire may decrease as well, often corresponding with a slowdown in the production of sex hormones.
Moreover, chronic illnesses and other non-sexual health problems (e.g., arthritis) can make certain sex acts challenging or painful to perform. However, this should not be taken to mean that older adults are no longer capable of being sexually satisfied.
In a survey of over 1,300 older women (aged 67 on average), two-thirds of those who were sexually active reported being at least moderately satisfied with their sex lives [2]. It's also worth noting that women over age 80 actually had among the highest levels of sexual satisfaction in the sample.
One final point worth mentioning is that maintaining an active sex life in older age may offer some important health benefits. For instance, a recent study of adults aged 50-89 found that those who reported engaging in any form of sexual activity in the past year evidenced higher levels of cognitive functioning compared to those who reported no sex or masturbation [3]. In other words, sex could potentially be good for an aging brain (learn more about this idea here).
In short, although we tend to encounter more sexual problems as we age, many older folks maintain active and satisfying sex lives--and those who do just might be reaping some important health benefits.

Also the DCSS tournaments http://dobrazupa.org/tournament/0.16/
Perhaps we can get some ideas from the above, for the weekly seeds and/or the tournament.
I'd be keen on weekly seeds to be focused on interesting and zanny stories, while the tournaments be more competitive and challenge oriented. I've only been watching two LPers so far and you're both in this thread, which is quite cool I gotta say. Seeded games would be ideal to record and LP I think!
I had been dying on the first 1-3 floors every other game, but then I realised your core is very durable and the 50 delay movespeed while naked is actually fantastic. So I stopped trying to fight things and it turned into a pacifist run. Mining through walls was really cool, but after a while it seemed to stop working.
Didn't kill anything past the first couple of floors, and mostly just ran circles around enemies, stealthed around, and hacked terminals to find access points and map reveals. It was a lot like playing a spriggan in DCSS, except more durable. On -1 I explored a ton of the map but eventually got trapped in dead ends too many times and slowly died.
Edit: I just came across biomatter's screenshots of a stealth run. https://www.reddit.com/r/Cogmind/comments/36pksb/post_cool_stuff_youve_found/crg8i7k
My run was just like that, except no fancy biomechanical wings for me. I also agree that a replay mode would be magnificent (Brogue has one ).
Thanks for those links to the Brogue and DCSS seed runs. I'll use them as a reference when setting up the first seed.These weekly seeds, while competitive, are certainly not official in capacity. I too see them as a fun way to explore stories within the game. I'll leave it to Kyzrati when it comes to all the official stuff (such as the upcoming tournament ).I'm still learning when it's best to run or fight. It's not always obvious on the later levels (at least not for me). I spent most of my time in the 7DRL running away at every opportunity. You couldn't bump robots out of the way in that version so if you were cornered with no weapons it was game over. Part of the charm with this game for me is that there is a sweet spot in most runs that require a complete change in tactics. I've also heard tales from Kyzrati about people finishing the 7DRL by burrowing through the walls all the way to the end! (doesn't work so well these days with the cave-ins implemented)This is the story of my life on the later levelsI posted a story to this effect here , which details my furthest run (although not my highest score).Hehe, we had a lot of fun sharing items on that threadAlthough, biomatter was far more dedicated than me. It became pretty rare for me to find an item that they hadn't found already and I'm yet to find another Centurium Greatsword after finding it that first time (best. weapon. ever.)I really like Brogue's replay system. You can learn a lot from studying other people's play styles, however I'm usually more a fan of bumbling through on my own in most games. I'll never be a great player, but it's a lot more fun for me
CAIRO – The Michigan Muslim Community Council and Jewish Community Relations Council of Detroit come together to repair dilapidated facilities in one of Detroit's public schools, Nolan Elementary and Middle School.
Around 150 Muslim and Jewish volunteers came together to help students by repairing their aging school.
The experience of volunteering together brought both communities together, shattering the perception that they cannot work together.
The video, shared by Huffington Post on Facebook, hit more than one million views.
It also drew many positive comments from followers of both faiths.
“That's exactly what we need in this broken world. The problem is not the religions but it's people.. We should coexist together and fight criminals and bigots,” Barak Tahir wrote in a comment on the video.
“I was there as a volunteer and helped coordinate the activity in the library,” Janice Klein Ungar wrote.
“I was impressed by the dedicated principal and teachers at Nolan as well as students that came in on a Sunday. The group of volunteers was outstanding and we were all working for a common cause. Our different backgrounds and religions didn't matter,” they added.

An artificially intelligent chatbot that provides free legal advice has been configured to help victims sue hacked credit report giant Equifax without a lawyer.
The DoNotPay robot lawyer generates documents US consumers can take to the small claims court.
Depending on the state, consumers can sue Equifax for up to $25,000 (£19,000).
The Equifax data breach has affected 143 million US customers.
Despite repeated requests by the BBC, Equifax has not confirmed exactly how many UK consumers were affected, but reports suggest the details of up to 44 million British people may have been compromised.
The firm has committed to working with regulators in the US, UK and Canada on next steps. It is also offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for a year.
"We pride ourselves on being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations," said Richard Smith, Equifax chairperson and chief executive, when the breach was revealed.
Parking tickets appeals
Image copyright DoNotPay Image caption The AI chatbot asks the users questions to help generate documents for small claims courts
DoNotPay was invented by British teenager Joshua Browder, who is an undergraduate at Stanford University.
The free service was originally designed to help appeal against parking or speeding tickets by selecting the right letter that corresponds to the user's issue.
This is not the first time it has been programmed for altruistic purposes - in March, Mr Browder adapted the bot to help asylum seekers with immigration applications and to obtain financial support.
As of July, they estimated that the bot had helped to defeat 375,000 parking tickets in two years.
Unauthorised access
At the end of July, Equifax discovered signs of unauthorised access to data including names, addresses and social security numbers.
The credit report giant set up a website where consumers can check whether their information was accessed and sign up for free credit and identity theft monitoring.
The data breach is one of the biggest ever reported in the US and victims are at risk of identity theft and fraud.
Father Armen Melkonian, an Armenian Apostolic clergyman dismissed as an Etchmiadzin parish priest in the Dutch city of Maastricht for calling the members of the armed Sasna Dzrer group “heroes”, has told Hetq that they will be offering Divine Liturgy at the St. Garabed church on September 4.
The clergyman ruffled feathers in the church hierarchy when, during opening remarks at a demonstration outside the Armenian Embassy in Amsterdam in solidarity with the Sasna Dzrer armed group that seized a Yerevan police building in July, described its members as “heroes”, who have fought in defense of Artsakh in the past and are now struggling for justice in Armenia, and are now being persecuted by the authorities in Armenia.
While Melkonian was dismissed as a visiting parish priest for the small but growing Armenian community in Maastricht, they haven't been defrocked because they are a member of the Cilician See brotherhood.
“The church belongs to the community and the community regards the decision as unjust,” Father Armen told Hetq.
Levon Rafifi Sarkis, secretary of the Ani Armenian community organization in Maastricht, said that community representatives are planning to protest the dismissal decision on September 4.
On August 4, Sarkis received a letter from Bishop Vahan Hovhannessian, Etchmiadzin's Pontifical Legate of Western Europe, saying that Father Melkonian no longer could serve in any parish in Holland but would remain on the sidelines.
Tomorrow, at the invitation of the Armenian Apostolic Church Diocese in Germany, Father Armen will offer the Divine Liturgy at the diocesan St. Sahag Mesrob Church.
On August 26, in Antwerp, Belgium, Armenian community representatives discussed the issue of Father Armen's dismissal and the silence of the church regarding developments in Armenia.
“Yes, it is true that today we have a homeland and a state, but as Catholicos Aram has said we cannot be just spectators. We have obligations and a righto speak out. We send money [to Armenia]. Where does it go? We must send money. But when we learn that it fills the pockets of government officials, we will not send anymore. How should we punish those murderers who, instead of using that money to purchase weapons to defend the borders, use it against us,” Father Armen told the community representatives in Antwerp.
Regarding members of the Sasna Dzrer group, the clergyman noted, “If they call them terrorists, then I say we are all terrorists.”
Father Armen Melkonian and Deacon Kristapor
Deacon Kristapor Froundjian, who also spoke at the meeting, believes that Father Armen “had the courage to speak up and is being punished for it today.”
Talking about the role of the church, Deacon Kristapor said that the church could also use a bit of struggle.
“We want that our nation and the church be in good conditions. We are called to serve the people, to be on their side. Catholicos Aram showed us that the church isn't dead,” the deacon said.
At the end of the meeting a prayer was said for the speedy recovery of the injured Sasna Dzrer members now awaiting trial in Armenia.

France is rumored to be trying to sell a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship to China, while two French warships are on a seven-day visit to Shanghai, Watch China Times reported, adding that the French Navy is likely to offer the Mistrals built for Russia for sale instead of constructing new ones.
© AFP 2018 / GEORGES GOBET That Sinking Feeling: What Can France Do With Its Two Surplus Mistrals?
In an unlikely coincidence, the task force visiting China consists of two warships, one of which is a Mistral-class protection and command (BPC) ship, the Dixmude. This is the first time a Mistral entered a Chinese port.
Under a $1.3-billion deal Russia and France signed in 2011, Paris was supposed to deliver the Vladivostok in November 2014 and the Sevastopol in early 2015. None of the ships arrived to Russia, since the deliveries were put on hold over Moscow's alleged involvement in the Ukrainian civil war. Kremlin has repeatedly denied these groundless claims and pushed for peace in the war-torn nation.
© AFP 2018 / GEORGES GOBET The Sevastopol mistral warship is on its way for its first sea trials, on March 16, 2015 off Saint-Nazaire
Meanwhile, the fate of the two Mistrals built and adapted to meet the specifications provided by the Russian Navy remains in limbo. Last month, French President Francois Hollande said Paris would return the payment for the warships if the contract is terminated.
Several other options are reportedly under consideration – to sink the two Mistrals, to hand them over to the French Navy or to sell them to a third party. The Watch China Times named Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt and India as potential buyers.

China is developing its own as of yet unnamed amphibious assault ship but could buy a Mistral to use as a model, the media outlet noted.
Selling Mistrals commissioned by Russia may prove harder than it seems. Last week, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin warned that France could not sell the helicopter carriers without Russia's permission. They added that Paris was fully aware of that.
The other French ship, accompanying the Dixmude on the visit to China, is the Aconit, a La Fayette-class frigate. The French task force arrived at the Wusong naval port on May 9 and will leave on May 15.

“Inside Out”
Faux Real
I recently posted this new piece of woodworking on various social media sites, forums and blogs, and I asked if anyone would like to guess on how it was made. I will do the same here: it is a simple section of a log forming a “C” shape with bark on the inside of the curve.
The piece is entitled “Inside Out” and was a fun exploration for me. I created it to demonstrate some of my techniques while teaching at the Marc Adams School of Woodworking this past spring.
I was astonished by how many people responded. Some simply enjoyed the piece by “liking” and complementing me on the work and creativity. Many people though, literally hundreds, responded with a variety of reasonable guesses, all within the first hour of posting. So shows the power of social media!
I spent hours responding to every comment with “good guess, but nope.” Some took the request very seriously and others had fun with it, while quite a few seemed to get angry that I wouldn't reveal the process and actually started to hound me. I explained that I would reveal my technique in a couple days as I didn't want to spoil the fun for others who were really working trying to figure it out. (Patience is a virtue of woodworking, right?)
There were some good ideas: soaking, boiling, steaming, cutting wedges, carving, anhydrous ammonia, burning, lighting, cactus, and natural growth, although I am confident most of them would have not worked. I also received witchery, aliens, and black magic, so I knew I was onto something!
Some wanted to know what is for and/or if I was going to make it into something functional like a clock or light. I found that to be curious and it raised a question for me: Does all woodworking have to be functional?
In any event, as promised, two days later I ‘fessed up and explained the process.
Note to editor – we could only include how I did this on Popular Woodworking's site to help drive traffic there.
I cut the C shape out of a section of a log, took a mold from the bark, removed the bark and cast it onto the inside using Bondo automotive putty, my favorite dirty little secret every woodworker should know about.
This caused another flurry of comments from Bravo! to You cheater! Which brings me to another question: At what point is a woodworker cheating?
What really surprised me was that a number of people were quite upset and even insulting. Maybe they felt fooled, faked out, or tricked? Who knows? But it made me ask myself: why are these people so angry? Where is the line that can't be crossed? My personal credo is: Find the line and then cross it. But for some, there seems to be a definite line that should not be crossed.
Woodworkers often “cheat” by staining one species of wood to look like another; some use CNC machines to carve; we apply wood filler to hide poorly cut joints; we use veneer. Is this all cheating?
Discussion, dissension, and debate is vital to keep our craft honest and forthright. Personally, I find it very difficult to find any line that I can't cross over, and I'm not even sure if there IS a line. But for some, it definitely exists. But my advice is: the next time you stain a piece of poplar to look like walnut, and post it on social media, beware! Is it faux real?
The recent Chinese military incursion into Ladakh was a painful reminder of the cost of losing Tibet. And this week Chinese officials announced plans to demolish what remains of Lhasa, Tibet's ancient capital. Despite its inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage List, Lhasa is a symbol of Tibetan nationalism, and China's Politburo has determined that Tibetan culture, religion and identity must be exterminated to ensure “stability.”
On May 8th, the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington hosted an evening with Lobsang Sangay, the head of the Tibetan government in exile. Sangay addressed a gathering of journalists, academics and lawyers, eager to discuss the escalating crisis in Tibet. (The proceedings were recorded and the video is available online). Most in the audience anticipated a repudiation of Chinese Communist rule from the Harvard Law student, but what Sangay had to say sent shock waves through the room, and later, the blogosphere.
When asked if they hoped to see free elections in a genuinely autonomous Tibet in the near future, Sangay replied; “We don't challenge, or ask for, an overthrow of the Communist Party. We don't question or challenge the present structure of the ruling party.” Jerome Cohen, the renown legal scholar from New York University, asked Sangay for clarification, stating; “It's very interesting to see what this would amount to if there's no freedom of speech for the people in Tibet.” Sangay provided clarification; “We are not asking for democracy for Tibetans in Tibet… we want rights as per the Chinese constitution.”
The internet swelled with questions about Sangay's remarks, in particular, their flouting of democracy for the people of Tibet and China, and their disregard for the Chinese intellectuals who bravely signed Charter 08, which calls for the rule of law, democratic reforms in China and criticized the Communist Party for “clinging to authoritarian politics, it has caused an unbroken chain of human rights disasters and social crises, held back the development of the Chinese people, and hindered the progress of human civilization.”
To embrace Chinese Communist rule is to abandon the people inside Tibet who have waged a desperate battle of survival and resistance for over 60 years. Every man and woman who made the ultimate sacrifice of self immolation did so for independence, as their moving final testaments confirm. And it is in direct opposition to the stated goals of the Dalai Lama, who purposefully modeled their exile government on India's democracy, not Mao's one party dictatorship. When the Dalai Lama proposed the Middle Way Policy in 1988, they conceived of preserving Tibet as a buffer state and a de-militarized “zone of peace.” Sangay's stated position eviscerates the relevance of the Tibet movement, and depreciates India's burden of a long, tense border with an increasingly bellicose China.
There were Indian journalists present at the Council on Foreign Relations that evening, but none asked Sangay any tough or serious questions. When the matter of the recent Ladakh incursion was raised, Sangay blithely said that China's military positions at the Indian border should be at “China's discretion.” Excuse me, but Sangay resides in Dharamshala, and has recently been provided with a special vehicle with a red light on top, to indicate their VIP status in Himachal Pradesh. One would assume that these privileges come at South Block's discretion.
There are some features of pre-communist Tibetan political culture that Sangay is actively deploying to build their myth; their official Facebook page declares that they are a “secular emanation” of the Dalai Lama and Guru Rinpoche. And at the Council in Washington they said; “Many artists inside Tibet have composed songs in honor of the election and my victory and they have put it on YouTube with English translation. Some have sent me scrolls where normally we put deities and gods and goddesses, only they have put a picture of me and that's being distributed.” This would be risible if not for the mounting death toll in Tibet, and that Tibet's ancient civilization is being destroyed by the day, as bulldozers tear into the holy Jokhang temple in Lhasa.
Beijing's cadres are unwilling, or unable, to relinquish one party rule, as they cling to an obsolete Maoist world view that demonizes the Dalai Lama and calls the Buddhist faith “a disease to be eradicated.” That Tibetan culture is a force that so petrifies the great People's Republic of China exposes the xenophobia, intolerance, and violence that infects the Maoist creed. Sangay's categorical rejection of democracy in favor of Communist rule in Tibet could be a cynical power play, or maybe they think might make right, and that power does come from the barrel of a gun, but then, how can they proclaim themselves a secular emanation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, protector of Tibet?
Chester Bowles, the venerable United States Ambassador to India, published a memoir in 1969 entitled “A View from New Delhi.” Here is an excerpt: “Whereas India tried to dignify the individual as part of the process of development, China regarded them as an instrument of the state…whereas India sought to preserve and enrich their ancient culture and to modernize their society within the context of their traditions, Communist China attempted to replace the traditional Chinese culture and institutions with a completely new and alien social system. While India tried to minimize the amount of social dislocation caused by the development process, China sought to maximize it…While the Chinese were sure they could interpret the future, the Indian government has remained sensibly agnostic. Where the Chinese system has cracked under adversity, the Indian has simply bent…the long-suffering, exploited Chinese peasants and workers must be wondering how long the horror can go on, while they hope for the day when at long last they can be free of the shifting whims of a communist dictatorship.”
Should the upcoming film ignite your interest in the comic books, here is a look at the current Marvel team's universe.
With The Avengers already a (Hulk) smash hit internationally and box office tracking suggesting it will be a sensation in the United States, interest in Earth's Mightiest Heroes has never been higher. And the nice thing about comic book movies, both from a sales and fan point of view, is that the story experience doesn't end in the theater: There are endless numbers of prequels, sequels and spinoffs to satisfy the hunger for more superheroes.
For those who have yet to see the movie -- most Americans and the one guy abroad who must have been sick this past weekend -- and are largely unfamiliar with the Marvel superteam, there is the limited-run official prequel to the film, Marvel's The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week. A four-part series, it runs through the events of the lead-up films Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger and gives starring roles to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson in the movie) and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). If you are unfamiliar with the universe and don't have time to cram in all of the films, this is the series for you.
Newbies also can enjoy Avengers Assemble, a recently launched title that brings together the film's major characters: Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow.
The Avengers: Photos, Trailers, Clips and Reviews
If you've seen the lead-up Marvel movies and want to dive right into the full comics universe, there are plenty of options. The Avengers first assembled in 1963 and have gone through many groupings, civil wars, personal conflicts, deaths and rebirths (that they're still in top shape today is one of the magic secrets of the comic book world).
While Marvel has been preparing for this movie for the past four years, tying in storylines and introducing characters, the book side has spent a significant time reconfiguring and juggling its members as well. In the past few years, we've seen S.H.I.E.L.D. -- the government organization under which the Avengers operate -- go from celebrated heroes to wanted criminals and then back to nearly autonomous champions.
If you remember back to the first run of Spider-Man movies, Norman Osborn was the trilogy's most haunting villain. Their most recent storyline saw them ascend to U.S. security czar, and their group, H.A.M.M.E.R., triggered a war with Asgard (Thor's home planet). As their treachery became clear, however, Captain America was able to talk the president into disavowing Osborn, and though they could not save Asgard from crashing down to Earth (creating a big boom in Oklahoma!), they ultimately were given their hero status back and trusted once again with the protection of the planet.
The main team operates in the fourth volume of the Avengers series, which just released its 25th issue. Many of the movie's heroes are in this one: Captain America (who now runs S.H.I.E.LD. following Norman Osborn's treason), Thor, Iron Man and Hawkeye. Other members include Vision, Protector, Spider-Woman, Quake and Red Hulk (aka General Thaddeus Ross, the reformed longtime enemy of Bruce Banner's Hulk).
Since 2005 (and a 2010 relaunch), there has been a second Avengers team whose story unfolds in The New Avengers. This team, led by Thunderbolts member Luke Cage, is a sprawling group. On its 25th volume 2 issue, the New Avengers consist of Spider-Man, Wolverine, Mockingbird, Thing, Iron Fist, Doctor Strange, Jessica Jones (though they have left to protect their child), Daredevil and liaison Victoria Hand.
Meanwhile, a secret superhero espionage team is at work in Secret Avengers. Led by Hawkeye, the team boasts Black Widow, Ant-Man (who is rumored to potentially get their own movie at some point), Beast, War Machine, Valkyrie, Venom, Giant-Man, Agent 13 and Captain Britain. They do all the dirty work in a title that was designed to invoke spy themes and storylines.
For those aspiring heroes, there's perhaps the coolest prep school of all time. Avengers Academy details the lives of those working to join the Avengers and the heroic professors who are preparing them. With a faculty that includes Hawkeye, Quicksilver, Giant-Man and Tigra, there is a huge student group that includes the likes of Spider-Girl, She-Hulk, X-23, Batwing and Butterball (really). Think of it as Professor X's mutant academy, but probably less emotional.
If you're headed out to the comics shop, be prepared to get engulfed in a special event: Avengers vs. X-Men. A multiple-title battle pitting the top two Marvel teams against each other, it's currently the label's biggest storyline and runs across different books and its own mini-series.

We explored this topic—in part—because a Bitch reader asked us to look into it. Got a question about feminism and pop culture that you want answered, too? Tell us!
I have a good friend with whom I often talk about politics and culture. He's a lovely, kind person with a deep commitment to social justice and an unfortunate tendency to mansplain. They know this, and is trying to work on it, so we developed a sort of code. Whenever they start mansplaining, I just say, “Ow! My ladybrain!” It's good-natured ribbing that gets the point across, but it also winkingly refers to ingrained cultural notions of the differences between male and female brains, notions that have been used to justify the subjugation of women.
Whether the brains of men and women actually vary in form and function is a hotly debated question in psychology and neuroscience. Cultural discussion of gender and brains tends toward a reductive, binary view of neurobiology: Men are more aggressive and sex-focused, and their brains tend toward building systems; women are more emotional and communicative, and they tend toward empathy. Pop culture is rife with these men/women-are-just-soooooo-alien-how-can-I-possibly-understand-them-without-help idea. It is the basis for many stale stand-up routines and films, of course, and for a litany of books about relationships. John Gray's 1992 Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus is perhaps the best-known example and is now fully embedded in the cultural lexicon (thoroughly unpacking the problems with this book and its legacy is a heroic endeavor that I don't have room for here).
But a quick search reveals a glut of more recent examples of (super heterocentric) relationship advice books that draw on the same kinds of ideas, including Gregg Michaelsen's To Date a Man, You Must Understand a Man, which features a cover illustration of a person in profile with a maze where their brain would be, Understanding Men: Know How Men Really Think by James Kingsley and Stefanie Maria Rhoden, and, my personal favorites—and yes, these are real—the books by husband and wife team Barbara and Allan Pease: Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps, Why Men Don't Have a Clue and Women Always Need More Shoes!, and Why Men Want Sex and Women Need Love (groan, double groan, triple groan). All of these books rely on a foundation of biological essentialism—the idea that men and women are fundamentally different because of innate, immutable qualities, including the anatomy of their brains. These ideas spill over into many aspects of our lives—remember when the former president of Harvard University said science and math fields are male-dominated in part because of genetic differences between men and women?
If your feminist alarm bells are ringing, that's good. The science of whether sex determines anything about brain structure and function is actually far more complicated than the simplistic view put forth by, say, Louann Brizendine, author of the books The Female Brain (2006) and The Male Brain (2010), both of which were packed with messy, often unsupported assertions and inferences. As Harvard molecular and cellular biology professor Catherine Dulac explained to Scientific American last year, “[I]t is assumed that the male and the female brains are very different because male and female behaviors differ so significantly. But over the last few decades, neuroscientists have been looking for major anatomical differences and did not find that many.”
A buzzed-about recent study, titled “Sex Beyond the Genitalia: The Human Brain Mosaic,” helps debunk the notion that there are distinct male and female brains. The 2015 study shows that brains cannot be categorized as male or female based on their structure. Instead, we should see brains as a big, heterogeneous group, and each brain as a “mosaic” that may have any combination of characteristics. Our brains are one more place where gender is best seen as a spectrum—not a cut-and-dry binary. “[M]ost brains are comprised of unique ‘mosaics' of features, some more common in females compared with males, some more common in males compared with females, and some common in both females and males,” notes the study's designer Daphna Joel, a professor in the school of Psychological Sciences at Tel-Aviv University.
Undermining the commonly held belief that males and females have different brains is important because sex differences between brains has been used as a justification for social differences and inequalities. There's a long tradition of biological research being used to justify racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, and a very long list of other forms of oppressive social organization. When biology and social differences are linked, those social differences are often thought to be biologically determined. For instance, the 18th-century practice of phrenology used measurements and classification of human skulls to “prove” the superiority of Caucasians. Later, the fact that women tend to have smaller brains than men would be used as a reason to prevent them from attending college and arguing (as late as 2006!) that women are just not as smart as men because we have smaller brains. Biological determinism is a slippery slope that starts with observations of differences between people and slides into a belief that the ways society is structured around those differences are normal, natural, and inevitable. It also tends to lead to a fatalistic view: This is just the way things are.
The mosaic-brain theory pushes against these ideas. It says that there are differences between brain structures, sure, but it would be more accurate and useful to think of all brains as part of one group that displays a wide variety of anatomical characteristics. The conclusion often drawn from previous neuroscientific research was that differences between groups of male and female brains were greater than differences within those groups. The mosaic brain study argues that all human brains exist on a spectrum and even suggests that sex should not be used as a variable in scientific studies of the brain because “comparing brains of females to brains of males would be analogous to comparing two samples randomly drawn from a single population of brains.”
Of course, not everyone agrees with this conclusion. Other researchers and folks in the field published responses to the study that challenged its methods, premises, and conclusions. One common critique was that the study focused on brain anatomy rather than brain function and therefore could not detect sex-based differences in how brains actually work. Another critic was troubled by the idea that in order for a brain to be classified as “male” or “female” according to Joel et al.'s definition, it would have to be entirely so and could not display any characteristics of the other classification, which the critic thought unreasonable.
As a response to these critiques, Joel published a follow-up opinion piece coauthored with Anne Fausto-Sterling, a biologist and professor in the Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry at Brown University who is known for their work challenging binary understandings of biological sex. Joel and Fausto-Sterling clarify the goals and outcomes of the research: They are not denying that differences between brains exist, they are just challenging the accuracy and utility of funneling those differences into two sex-based categories.
This study, unsurprisingly, in a culture that is deeply invested in binaristic views of sex and gender, is not without its detractors, and some of them seem to raise valid critiques of the science. Ultimately, though, the study seems like a step in a good direction. Research that flies in the face of biological determinism and moves toward dismantling the sex and gender binaries can only be a good thing, even when it's flawed.
The skies were ugly when the Seahawks and 49ers kicked off today and it cast a wet, grimy haze over the play of both offenses. After two heart-rending losses in the last three weeks, ‘Hawks fans were hoping for a stress-free win over the lowly Niners in Santa Clara. Seattle was in no mood to acquiesce to our requests, however, and proceeded to bumble their way through the game's first 30 minutes.
There is no question that the weather played a big role in the offensive ineptitude, and its effect was felt from the get-go. After the ball blew off the tee on opening kickoff #1, the second attempt flew almost straight sideways and out of bounds. Seattle took the field in great position but Russell Wilson, ever polite and feeling bad for the Niners' bad start, eschewed an open JD McKissic on the game's first play and opted instead to throw it 30 yards into the wind. The ball fluttered softly, well short of Jimmy Graham, and was picked off by Eric Reid at the sideline.
It was an ugly start and it immediately put the onus on Seattle's defense. Fortunately, trotting CJ Beathard and the 49ers offense out against this Seahawks defense, even with the injuries, is like trying to kill 11 bears with a water gun. Seattle's defensive front would spend the afternoon overwhelming the Niners's OL and the first possession was no exception. The ensuing three and out put the ball back into Seattle's hands with a chance to redeem their poor start.
One thing Wilson does as well as any quarterback I've ever seen is play fearlessly after a turnover. Despite a bad throw to start the game, they came right back out and tossed it all over the field, hitting Paul Richardson twice and driving down to the 49ers 30. Then things got gross again. On 2nd & 7, Wilson threw it right through the hands of Richardson after not seeing an open Jimmy Graham for what would have been an easy touchdown. Then, under duress on 3rd down, Wilson heaved a desperation toss towards the sideline that was almost picked off again. That ineptitude bled into Blair Walsh's field goal attempt as they missed, you guessed it, wide left from 48 yards.
Seattle's defense continued to set the tone and a couple drives later, Bobby Wagner did something impossible. After Quinton Jefferson forced an intentional grounding, Santa Clara found themselves facing 2nd & long deep in their own territory. Beathard dropped back and wung a ball into the hands of some guy I've never heard of. As soon as they caught it, the receiver was blasted by Wagner, who wrapped them up and threw them to the ground. The coverage and tackle were impressive enough on their own, but it's what Wagner did on the way down that almost defies explanation.
Somehow, in the one-third of a second that it took to slam the receiver, Wagner's hands ripped the ball out of the receiver's grasp and into their own. Like, I get how they did it but I still don't understand how they did it so fast, while their body was horizontally wrapped around the guy, and whirling to the turf. Just incredible.
The pick set up a slick 13-yard pitch play to McKissic, which was followed by a 2-yard Wilson keeper for the touchdown. On both of those plays, Duane Brown and Luke Joeckel completely erased the guys they were blocking and made the two runs look almost easy. It would be the only time the offense looked good in the first half. The rest of the first two quarters was a sloppy mural of miscues and bad execution. At some point the 49ers kicked a field goal.
Once the second half started, the game finally began to resemble the sport of football as each offense found a groove on their opening possessions. The Niners used a couple of nice Carlos Hyde runs to get a field goal to start the third quarter and bring the 49ers within one. It put some pressure on Seattle's underwhelming offense and Wilson and Co answered definitively.
On the Seahawks' first second half drive, Wilson rolled right on a 3rd down against a three-man rush. As they neared the right hash, they playfully lobbed the ball between the second and third levels of Santa Clara's defense. Doug Baldwin, who had all of 2 receiving yards up to that point, contorted their body to catch the ball for 23 yards and a first down before tumbling to the ground. That was followed up by a nice catch and run by (is this right? This can't be right...) Tanner McEvoy, which was followed up by a touchdown lob to Nick Vannett. It was a drive that looked frustratingly effortless, as in, why don't you just do that every time?*
*Because football is hard and NFL players are good. But still.
From there, the game settled into the type of rhythm we all hoped for from the outset. Seattle's next drive included a couple of borderline miraculous plays from Wilson, who spent the entire afternoon somehow escaping sure-thing sacks, and ended with- you guessed it- a TD pass to Jimmy Graham. The drive was aided by a dubious endzone PI call on a bomb to Baldwin, but life is 10% what happens and 90% how you respond to it. After the penalty, the predictable dive to Eddie Lacy was predictably stuffed at the one, so Wilson went to what has become the safest goal line bet in football. Taking the snap, Wilson looked left and fired a quick strike to Graham who was helplessly “covered” by some quaint little defender sent out to die.
That score made it 21-6 and from there, it was just a matter of Seattle wearing an inferior opponent down to their nubs, you know, like they used to. A heavy dose of Eddie Lacy three-yarders and Russell Wilson scrambles sucked the life out of the Niners in the fourth quarter and a Blair Walsh field goal pushed the lead out to 24-6. Santa Clara would add a TD against Seattle's backups on the last play of the game and all 14 of their fans celebrated it like they'd won the Super Bowl.
SMOKE RINGS
-These always start with Russell Wilson but that's only because they might be the most important player in the NFL. They came into this game accounting for over 80% of Seattle's yards this season and 95% of their offensive TDs. Even with a semblance of a traditional running game in this one, their 253 all-around yards were 80% of the Seahawks total and they either threw or ran for all three of their touchdowns. After a dreadful first two quarters, Wilson's second half went as all of their second halves do, which is to say: spectacular. After going 6 for 15 for 80 yards and a pick in the first half, Russ went 14-19 for 148 yards and two touchdowns in the game's final two quarters.
Wilson's performance was more impressive than the numbers suggest, too. Their production today came despite being harassed all game long. Some of these were a matter of the OL getting beat and some, as is always the case, were the result of Russ scampering about like a four-year-old who doesn't want to go to bed. Whatever the case, they found themselves within the grasp of Niners defenders all afternoon but they always managed to escape. Despite getting sacked seven or eight times today, Russell Wilson was never sacked.
*I bet Russell Wilson would set the record for running around the field naked before being tackled by security.
This victory also gave Russell Wilson more wins in their first six seasons than any QB in history. They still have five games left.
-The Seahawks had a running game today! Sort of! Eddie Lacy had 46 yards, albeit on 17 carries, and added 15 more on 3 catches. JD McKissic continues to shine when called upon, turning 4 carries into 22 yards and 4 catches into 24. Look, this team as currently constructed will never dominate anyone on the ground, but it's important that they at least be able to have it as a part of their offense. A performance like this one keeps the run game in play moving forward. Thomas Rawls got just one snap, which bums me out, because I can't imagine he'd only have 46 yards with the room Lacy had on most of their 17 carries.
-Doug Baldwin was nearly invisible for the second straight game, notching a grand total of 20 yards a week after getting just 40 on two catches. I don't think these matters. Baldwin is still a total stud and will be a huge part of this offense moving forward. Their slack was picked up today by Paul Richardson, who turned a team-high 7 targets into a team-high 4 catches for a team-high 70 yards. Jimmy Graham, who was held catchless for the first half (including a drop), bounced back with 3 catches for 34 yards and a TD in the second half. The remainder of Seattle's passing production was spread thinly across the bready surfaces of Nick Vannett, Tanner McEvoy, and the two running backs. Wilson took what was there today, and that's fine.
-The defense was great again. Despite the very public injuries to some of their best players, the Seattle D has been tremendous over the last fortnight. Even without Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, and Shaquill Griffin, the ‘Hawks held their opponents under 200 yards passing for the second consecutive week. They snuffed out the running game, holding Santa Clara to 3.5 yards per carry and 5.5 yards per pass. They got three sacks, an interception, and broke up four passes. The touchdown they gave up doesn't matter and only happened after most of the starters were pulled. Optimism is the only rational response to how this defense is playing.
-The stellar defensive effort was led, once again, by Bobby Wagner who found themselves sternum-to-sternum with just about every Santa Clara ballcarrier. They led all players in tackles and now has 100 on the season- good for 2nd in the NFL. Their 7 solo tackles give them 76, which is #1. They have been the best player on the Seahawks defense this season, which is a hell of a statement on a team that boasts Earl Thomas, Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Michael Bennett, and Sheldon Richardson.
Bradley McDougald continues to be incredible as a substitute for both Earl and Kam. Sheldon, Lacy, Joeckel and others have claimed the most headlines but the best addition to this team this year has been McDougald. Eight more tackles for them this afternoon. Up front, Sheldon Richardson, Quinton Jefferson, Michael Bennett, and Frank Clark were devastating. Jefferson went down late, so hopefully he'll be okay. Injuries have been destroying this team like a plague and, as we saw today, a healthy Jefferson is a big time difference maker. Richardson had six tackles, which is remarkable for a DT, Clark had 1.5 sacks, and Bennett added one for good measure. Jeremy Lane, Byron Maxwell, and Justin Coleman were good if not great in coverage. Just a total effort.
-Seattle went a respectable 5-13 (38.4%) on 3rd downs, a product of having reasonable distances to cover instead of the 3rd & 14s that hamstrung them during the first half of the season. On defense, they held Santa Clara to 31%, which is great.
-Just 6 Seahawks penalties for 35 yards today. Amazing how much easier it is to watch this team when you're not cringing in expectation of a flag after every play.
The win boosts Seattle to 7-4 on the season and keeps them very much in the mix for a postseason run. They're currently tied with Atlanta for the final playoff spot, a distinction they concede to the Falcons due to last week's outcome. Still, they're only one game behind the Falcons, the Panthers, Saints, and Rams and they all still gotta play each other. Not only are the playoffs well within reach, the division title is close enough to sniff and a first round bye isn't out of the question.
Seattle is now 4-0 in the NFC West and, despite the tough recent losses, are in position to make some noise. This win gives them some much-needed momentum as they begin a gauntlet of opponents that include, in consecutive weeks, the 10-1 Eagles, the 7-4 Jaguars, the 8-3 Rams, and a Cowboys team that will have Ezekiel Elliott back. We'll learn a lot about the postseason chops of this team over the next month but for now, enjoy where this team is at despite all their obstacles.
Onward, my friends, and ever upward.

Went back to a classic My Father cigar with the Macallan 12=Year Double Cask. After the last few games, I needed a couple of old reliables.
Just over a month ago, iOS users were warned of the threat to their devices by the XcodeGhost malware. Apple quickly reacted, taking down infected apps from the App Store and releasing new security features to stop malicious activities. Through continuous monitoring of our customers' networks, FireEye researchers have found that, despite the quick response, the threat of XcodeGhost has maintained persistence and been modified.
More specifically, we found that:
XcodeGhost has entered into U.S. enterprises and is a persistent security risk
Its botnet is still partially active
A variant we call XcodeGhost S reveals more advanced samples went undetected
After monitoring XcodeGhost related activity for four weeks, we observed 210 enterprises with XcodeGhost-infected applications running inside their networks, generating more than 28,000 attempts to connect to the XcodeGhost Command and Control (CnC) servers -- which, while not under attacker control, are vulnerable to hijacking by threat actors. Figure 1 shows the top five countries XcodeGhost attempted to call back to during this time.
Figure 1. Top five countries XcodeGhost attempted to callback in a four-week span
The 210 enterprises we detected with XcodeGhost infections represent a wide range of industries. Figure 2 shows the top five industries affected by XcodeGhost, sorted by the percentage of callback attempts to the XcodeGhost CnC servers from inside their networks:
Figure 2: Top five industries affected based on callback attempts
Researchers have demonstrated how XcodeGhost CnC traffic can be hijacked to:
Distribute apps outside the App Store
Force browses to URL
Aggressively promote any app in the App Store by launching the download page directly
Pop-up phishing windows
Figure 3 shows the top 20 most active infected apps among 152 apps, based on data from our DTI cloud:
Figure 3: Top 20 infected apps
Although most vendors have already updated their apps on App Store, this chart indicates many users are actively using older, infected versions of various apps in the field. The version distribution varies among apps. For example, the most popular Apps 网易云音乐 and WeChat-infected versions are listed in Figure 4.
App Name Version Incident Count (in 3 weeks) WeChat 6.2.5.19 2963 网易云音乐 Music 163 2.8.2 3084 2.8.3 2664 2.8.1 1227
Figure 4: Sample infected app versions
The infected iPhones are running iOS versions from 6.x.x to 9.x.x as illustrated by Figure 5. It is interesting to note that nearly 70% of the victims within our customer base remain on older iOS versions. We encourage them to update to the latest version iOS 9 as quickly as possible.
Figure 5: Distribution of iOS versions running infected apps
Some enterprises have taken steps to block the XcodeGhost DNS query within their network to cut off the communication between employees' iPhones and the attackers' CnC servers to protect them from being hijacked. However, until these employees update their devices and apps, they are still vulnerable to potential hijacking of the XcodeGhost CnC traffic -- particularly when outside their corporate networks.
Given the number of infected devices detected within a short period among so many U.S enterprises, we believe that XcodeGhost continues to be an ongoing threat for enterprises.
XcodeGhost Modified to Exploit iOS 9
We have worked with Apple to have all XcodeGhost and XcodeGhost S (described below) samples we have detected removed from the App Store.
XcodeGhost is planted in different versions of Xcode, including Xcode 7 (released for iOS 9 development). In the latest version, which we call XcodeGhost S, features have been added to infect iOS 9 and bypass static detection.
According to [1], Apple introduced the “NSAppTransportSecurity” approach for iOS 9 to improve client-server connection security. By default, only secure connections (https with specific ciphers) are allowed on iOS 9. Due to this limitation, previous versions of XcodeGhost would fail to connect with the CnC server by using http. However, Apple also allows developers to add exceptions (“NSAllowsArbitraryLoads”) in the app's Info.plist to allow http connection. As shown in Figure 6, the XcodeGhost S sample reads the setting of “NSAllowsArbitraryLoads” under the “NSAppTransportSecurity” entry in the app's Info.plist and picks different CnC servers (http/https) based on this setting.
Figure 6: iOS 9 adoption in XcodeGhost S
Further, the CnC domain strings are concatenated character by character to bypass the static detection in XcodeGhost S, such behavior is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7: Construct the CnC domain character by character
The FireEye iOS dynamic analysis platform has successfully detected an app (“自由邦”) [2] infected by XcodeGhost S and this app has been taken down from App Store in cooperation with Apple. It is a shopping app for travellers and is available on both U.S. and CN App Stores. As shown in Figure 8, the infected app's version is 2.6.6, updated on Sep. 15.
Figure 8: An App Store app is infected with XcodeGhost S
Enterprise Protection
FireEye MTP has detected and assisted in Apple's takedown of thousands of XcodeGhost-infected iOS applications. We advise all organizations to notify their employees of the threat of XcodeGhost and other malicious iOS apps. Employees should make sure that they update all apps to the latest version. For the apps Apple has removed, users should remove the apps and switch to other uninfected apps on App Store.

While a little late to the political diss party, Eminem has joined the ranks of artists to lash out against Donald Trump and their supporters.
Marshall Mathers tweeted out a new track Wednesday morning with a teaser that the 44-year-old Detroit rapper is working on a new album:
"Campaign Speech" dropped two days after Eminem celebrated their 44th birthday.
The song can be heard in the YouTube video at the top of this page, and it does contain some explicit language.
In "Campaign Speech," Eminem specifically mentions Trump with:
"What's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-f*** persona"
and
"You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause they run their campaign with their own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A f*****' loose cannon who's blunt with their hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one"
Jack White selling 'Icky Trump' shirts after 'illegal' use of 'Seven Nation Army' This new merchandise comes two days removed from after The White Stripes and Detroit native Jack White took to Facebook to accuse Donald Trump for the "illegal use" of "Seven Nation Army."
Eminem has not released an album since 2013's "Marshall Mathers LP 2."
A message seeking comment was left with the Trump campaign.
Telstra has separately won a contract to install 1000 nodes across Australia, which use the fibre-to-the-node technology preferred by the Coalition government. Both projects combined are expected to reach about 250,000 homes and businesses.
NBN Co and Telstra have been criticised by industry leaders over the size of their $11 billion deal to help build the NBN and what they say is the slow pace of the rollout.
Telstra's rivals are unhappy about the amount of money it is being paid by NBN Co for handing over its pits and pipes for the NBN's construction.
Vodafone Australia chief executive Inaki Berroeta on Wednesday described it as “outrageous" and called for a review, while iiNet chief executive David Buckingham on Thursday said they were angry about the slow rate of construction.
“I'm furious about it," Mr Buckingham said. “When [Telstra] can make $7.5 billion in free cash and more profit than the cash flow Vodafone Australia made last year and still get paid $640 million by the government for NBN [then] things are weird.
“NBN needs to get on with the rollout because we're sick of waiting. They really need to start unleashing the plan they keep putting in front of us."
$11bn deal worth the money
Mr Morrow said they understood the industry's concerns but said Telstra was handing over substantial assets as part of the deal and that it had the skills needed to build the NBN.

“It is worth the money," they said. “You can review the heck out of everything and there's already enough approvals and analysis that was done out of the original definitive agreement between NBN Co and Telstra. Doing anything more is just a further waste of taxpayer's money and reviews."
But they also said the company did not want Telstra to be the only supplier of construction services.
“We do want a competitive landscape and there is no intention at all to give Telstra the entire fibre-to-the-node planning, design, construction and operations work," they said. “We appreciate the value you get by bringing competition in and having smaller companies able to grow and prosper.
“The general intent is to have multiple suppliers and not have any one we're locked into."
Mr Morrow also said the company would next week use data from the first 15 areas connected to the NBN to show how it would stay within its budget.
“We'll give some insight over how our models have been proven out," they said. “That should give us enough money to be able to stay within the $42 billion total funding envelope.
Telstra last week said it would hand over ownership for its copper line and hybrid fibre coaxial (cable TV) networks to NBN Co for no extra payments.
Mr Morrow said it was an important move that showed Telstra was negotiating in good faith.
Jesse Lopez's GoPro captured what could easily have been the end of Lopez's life. But it wasn't. Now Lopez is sharing the video of their April 1 collision with a truck from the Los Angeles County Fire Department that occurred in the Angeles National Forest.
In Jesse Lopez's raw video above the collision occurs around 2:35. Lopez's friend picks up the camera around 11:10 and you can see firefighters working on Jesse Lopez.
Leane Suter, KABC-TV:
GoPro video shows 24-year-old Jesse Lopez racing up Glendora Ridge Road on April 1 with another biker, when they came to a blind curve and crashed into the firetruck. Their GoPro camera went flying off their helmet and captured them laying on the ground as it flew in the air. Lopez's friend picked up the camera, nervously pacing as crew members rushed to help Lopez, who suffered two compound fractures in their left leg and a severely broken arm. They were later airlifted to a trauma center. They want to share the video in hopes of saving other riders from their life-changing lesson.

The news broke on Friday that a Conor McGregor – Nate Diaz rematch was looking likely, and it seems that such an encounter would take place under the exact same conditions as previously.
That would mean McGregor remains at welterweight, 25 pounds above the featherweight division they hold the belt in.
Ariel Helwani of MMAFighting.com, who broke the news, was speaking on the MMA Hour today and reported that contracts have been issued for the UFC 200 main event.
McGregor talk begins at 0:02:40.
“It's not happening at a more natural 155 pounds. It's happening at 170 pounds,” said Helwani.
“The contracts are already out there and that's what they want. Make no mistake about it, the reason why this is happening at 170 pounds is because, to be frank, Conor McGregor is a bit of a wildman.
“He is obsessed with the idea that they lost to Nate Diaz at 170 pounds, they feel like they should have won and they want the same circumstances, the same rules, the same stipulations.
“He wants to do it again and prove that they are the better man.”
It's a fight that “all parties want”, says Helwani, but McGregor's potential opponents for a first defence of their featherweight belt are unhappy with the news.
McGregor won that belt from Jose Aldo exactly 100 days ago and Aldo, as well as leading contender Frankie Edgar, have been leading escalating, and occasionally bizarre, online campaigns to stoke the public mood for a fight with McGregor.
I want it. You want it. Your coach wants it. One battle took place but the war is not over! #UFC200 pic.twitter.com/kslOseYIQD— Jose Aldo Junior (@josealdojunior) March 21, 2016
Lightweight champion Rafael Dos Anjos, who withdrew due to injury from a 155-pound title contest with McGregor, was also critical.
@UFCONFOX Mcgregor vs Diaz 2 make no sense, I would beat theses 2 guys on the same night— Rafael dos Anjos (@RdosAnjosMMA) March 18, 2016
If the latest reports hold true, a Diaz rematch would be another example of McGregor calling the shots.

The Los Angeles Lakers had an off day in Atlanta while they wait to play the Hawks on Friday, and Kobe Bryant spent some of it speaking with Ernie Johnson of TNT for an interview that aired on Inside the NBA. Silver Screen and Roll already covered which defender Kobe says gave them the most trouble over their career. Here is a transcript of the rest of their interview, or you can watch the whole thing here.
On if there is any chance of them changing their mind about retirement:
"No, zero."
On the best competitors they ever faced:
"Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson are the two that come to mind immediately, just because they were just relentless. Michael, their relentlessness was amazing, Scottie [Pippen]'s as well, at both ends of the floor. Then in my generation, AI was much the same, from opening tip to the end this guy was just going and going and going. They would always put you in jeopardy. So those two guys were the most competitive I've faced."
If they were to write letters to three most influential people in their life, who would they be and what would they say?
"From a basketball perspective? I'd say I'd write one to Michael, Bill Russell, and Jerry West. Saying thank you for your mentorship, thank you for always being there for me when I reach out and call."
On their advice for their younger self:
"Focus on human nature. You have to balance out understanding human nature with the obsession to understand the exact tactics of basketball. As I've gotten older, I've understood you can execute until the cows come home, but if you don't understand human nature, if you don't understand how to relate to others, if you don't understand what makes them tick, you are never going to win a championship."
On if they could rank their five titles and which would be best:
"The standing answer should be no. But that's just not true. When we beat Boston in 2010, for me that's number one with a bullet, because going up against three sure Hall of Famers, being down in the series 3-2, having lost to them in 2008, and understanding the history and the rivalry and all that goes on there. And having a broken finger, and playing with the cast off. All of those things make that championship more special than the rest."
On if retiring with less than six titles bother him:
"No. I did everything I possibly could. It sounds crazy to say I won five championships and come up one short. But honestly I'm okay with that. It just wasn't in the cards for me to get six or seven. I did everything possible to try to make it happen, and I can live with that any day."
On what their one career do-over would be:
"If I had a do-over, I think, I would take more of a leadership role in talking to Shaq. Earlier, before things went south."
On if they have made up with Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson, or if that is still an ongoing process:
"No that process, it's over with. The memories that we had been the memories that we had doing battle. Of us against the world, and coming out on top. When you have those moments, it forms a certain type of bond that becomes bigger than the game, it becomes bigger than whatever bickering might have gone on. So I think that was the first step, and then the second step was just maturity, we are both much older than we were at the time. And with Phil, when Phil came back to coach in 2006, that was our process. We started that from the first day they came here. When they came back and said 'You know what? I want to come help you get these next championships.' And I said 'Phil it is not my job to judge or to hold grudges.' I understand more than most people that people make mistakes and we move on."
On what will they miss most about playing in the NBA:
"I think the puzzle of trying to figure out how to get the best out of my teammates. The challenging of them, the relationships I have with them, and then watching them develop from training camp all the way in through the postseason and into the Finals, where they're the best version of themselves. That process is the thing that I'll miss the most."
On if they see themselves as a television analyst:
"No. [laughs] I just, I don't have the patience to do TV. You know what's crazy to me is you know, looking at Charles, you are looking at a transition of a player from athlete to post.  They are certainly a blueprint. They found what they love to do and what he's great at." After some prodding from Johnson, Bryant admitted they would go on Inside the NBA in exchange for a "60% revenue split from the show."

Small & Large Dates On Business Strikes
This is the So-Called "Small Date" or "Level 7" Variety on a Business Strike
The scarce 1970-S Small Date Variety shown above is characterized by a more delicate date (as compared to the Large Date variety) and will exhibit a "7" that is relatively level with the rest of the date. The word LIBERTY is weak and indistinct (particularly on the E and TY) on all specimens of this variety including proofs. Caution: The LIBERTY may also be weak on a Large Date so this is a poor indicator of the type but a strong LIBERTY does indicate that it is NOT the scarce Small Date variety. While the font of the entire date is completely different than on the Large Date it is most apparent on "9" (which is the type of 1965-1969). The "9" on this variety shows the tail of the upper loop tapered more to a point and curved up slightly higher than on the Large Date variety. This one is often referred to as the "Level 7" variety by more advanced specialists. Coin courtesy of Gary Kelly.
This is the So-Called "Large Date" or "Low 7" Variety on a Business Strike
The common 1970-S Large Date Variety shown above is characterized by a slightly bolder date (as compared to the Small Date variety) and a "Low 7" in the date. The word LIBERTY will be sharp and bold on many specimens of this variety but may also be mushy or weak due to die ware or the use of abrasives to dress-out the die when removing clashes, etc. If it has a strong LIBERTY, then your search is over as it is the common Large Date but if it is a weak LIBERTY, it needs to be examined further for other more reliable diagnostics of the type. The "9" on this variety is bolder and comes to a more blunted tip on the end of the upper loop on well struck specimens with that tip pointing further down than on the Small Date variety. This one is often referred to as the "Low 7" variety by more advanced specialists. Coin courtesy of Gary Kelly.
Small & Large Dates On Proof Coins
This is the So-Called "Small Date" or "Level 7" Variety on a Proof Coin
Here again we see an example of the scarce 1970-S Small Date Variety. This time it is on a proof coin. It is characterized by a more delicate date (as compared to the Large Date variety) and will exhibit a "7" that is relatively level with the rest of the date. The word LIBERTY is weak and indistinct (particularly on the E and TY) on all specimens of this variety including the proof shown here. Note: The LIBERTY may also be weak on a Large Date variety so this is a poor indicator of the type but a strong LIBERTY does indicate that it is NOT the scarce Small Date variety. While the font of the entire date is completely different than on the Large Date it is most apparent on "9" (which is the type of 1965-1969). The "9" on this variety exhibits the tail of the upper loop tapered more to a point and curved up slightly higher than on the Large Date variety. This one is often referred to as the "Level 7" variety by more advanced specialists. Coin courtesy of Gary Kelly.
Note: While we used a line drawn across the tops of the digits in the date to show how they line up relatively level to one another on our business strike example, (at the top of this page), here we have boxed in the date to show that not only do the tops of the date line up but also that the bottoms of the "1" and "70" of date line up fairly level. Compare this to the boxed-in date of the Large Date proof variety below and you can more readily see just how much lower the "7" is in relation both the tops of digits and to the bottoms of the "1" and "70".
This is the So-Called "Large Date" or "Low 7" Variety on a Proof Coin
Here is another look at the common 1970-S Large Date Variety this time on a proof specimen. As with its business strike counterpart, it is characterized by a slightly bolder date (as compared to the Small Date variety) and a "Low 7" in the date. The word LIBERTY will be sharp and bold on many specimens of this variety but may also be mushy or weak due to die ware or the use of abrasives to dress-out the die when removing clashes, polishing the dies, etc. If it has a strong LIBERTY, then your search is over as it is the common Large Date variety but if it is a weak LIBERTY, it needs to be examined further for other more reliable diagnostics of type. The "9" on this variety is bolder and comes to a more blunted tip on the end of the upper loop on sharply struck specimens with that tip pointing further down than on the Small Date variety. This one is often referred to as the "Low 7" variety by more advanced specialists. Coin courtesy of Gary Kelly.
I'd like to thank Jose' Cortez for their suggestion on detailing the differences in the font of dates
being explored more fully here than it was in earlier versions of this study.
!!!!Warning!!!!!
As of late we have seen several Large Date proof specimens graded and misattributed as Small Dates by well-known, reputable grading services! Be cautious! Do not depend on the grading services to be accurate in their attributions of this variety. We have no idea of how many dozens or even hundreds may be out there misattributed. Learn how to tell them apart yourself and depend solely on yourself to distinguish the varieties. To do otherwise may cost you in the end!

How will the teams approach the first race of the season? What difference will the new Pirelli tyres make to the racing? Will there be more stops or less? What is the likelihood of a safety car in Melbourne? You will find the answers here.
The new season kicks off this week 'Down Under at Melbourne's Albert Park and we welcome back the JA on F1 Race Strategy content strand, in partnership with UBS, which was so popular last season.
For each race we will produce a pre-race briefing and a post race analysis. The content is prepared by JA on F1 with data and insight from a variety of race strategists currently working for F1 teams, who are helping to give fans an insight into this fascinating and important area of the sport.
Australian Grand Prix – the Key Race Strategy considerations
• Track characteristics
• Form guide
• Weather forecast
• Likely tyre performance
• Number and likely timing of pit stops
• Chances of a safety car
• Recent start performance of drivers and teams
* Pit stop league table of teams
Track characteristics
Albert Park Circuit; 5.303 kilometres. Race distance: 58 laps = 307.574 kilometres 16 corners in total, none particularly high energy.
Aerodynamic setup – Medium/high downforce. Top speed 318km/h (with Drag Reduction System on rear wing) - 308km/h without.
Full throttle – 65% of the lap. Total fuel needed for race distance: 152 kilos.
Time spent braking: 13% of the lap. 8 braking zones. Brake wear: High.
Loss time for a Pit stop = 20 seconds
Total time needed for pit stop: 25 seconds.
Fuel effect (cost in lap time per 10kg of fuel carried): 0.34 seconds
Form Guide
The Australian Grand Prix is not always a reliable guide to the season ahead as it is a unique circuit, based in a park, with a very low grip track surface and corners which are not typical of F1 circuits around the world.
Red Bull won the race last season and based on performances over the winter testing season, are expected to be the front runners at the first race, with McLaren also looking competitive.
Mercedes look more competitive than in 2011 as do Lotus, while Ferrari have had a difficult winter of testing and their competitiveness is a question mark going into the new season. The midfield battle looks very close and results are likely to be dependent on good race strategy planning and execution.
McLaren has won the Australian Grand Prix five times and Ferrari has won six times.
McLaren has won two of the last four Australian Grands Prix and Jenson Button is a two time winner. Of the current drivers Michael Schumacher has won the race four times, Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso once.
Likely tyre performance
Pirelli tyre choice for Melbourne: Soft and Medium.
This is Pirelli's second season of F1 since returning as sole tyre supplier and the aim for 2012 is to get the tyre compounds closer together in performance than in 2011. Last year the gap was too large, with the result being that at many events teams ran the faster tyre for most of the race and then put on the slower, usually harder, tyre right at the end.
For 2012 Pirelli is aiming for around 0.8s per lap difference between compounds, which would give the teams a number of different strategy options and would mix things up.
The signs from testing are that the soft and medium tyres at this stage are a little too close in performance, probably around 0.3 seconds per lap at Albert Park.
The soft is likely to have a range of around 20-23 laps while the life of the medium will be 22-25 laps. This will be less for the opening stint of the race when the cars are full of fuel.
The new Pirellis offer more rear grip relative to the front tyres than was the case in 2011. The 2012 Pirelli tyres are designed to last longer than last year's and the drop off in performance isn't as sudden. The tyre warm-up isn't quite as fast as last year because of the wider contact patch of the new tyres.
The tyres often experience graining at Albert Park. Graining is where the rubber shears away from the top surface, caused by a high level of sliding at high loads, both lateral and longitudinal. Lateral comes from sliding in corners, longitudinal comes from acceleration and braking.
Temperature has a lot to do with it, probably more than any other factor. If the tyres are being used below their operating range the rubber will be less compliant and will shear off more easily.
The track surface at Albert Park is quite old and has low micro and macro roughness, which basically means that the stones in it are small. The result of its age and smoothness is that the surface is very low grip and this means that the tyres grain laterally here because the car slides in the corners.
Number and likely timing of pit stops
Based on all the above considerations, plus tyre performance data from testing, the expectation, before any practice running has been done, is that the teams will intend to make two pit stops in the race. Last year we saw a range of strategies; among the top seven finishers we had one car which stopped just once, two cars stopped three times while the three podium finishers all stopped twice.
There are some advantages for a fast car qualifying outside the top ten to start the race on the harder tyre and do one stop less than the others, as Sauber's Sergio Perez did last year, moving from 13th on the grid to 7th at the chequered flag.
Chance of a safety car
The chance of a safety car at Albert Park is 57% . The average number of safety car interventions for the race is 1.7 (in 2006 there were four)
Recent start performance of drivers and teams
Starts are a critical part of the race and strategy can be badly compromised by a poor start, while good starts can make strategists change their plans in the hope of a good result.
As this is the first race of the 2012 season - no start data has been established yet.
Pit Stop League Table
Good strategy planning also requires good pit stop execution by the mechanics; last season we saw tyre stops carried out in less than two and a half seconds this year.
The league table below shows the order of the pit crews in 2011, based on their average time for a stop, taking out anomalies.
1= Red Bull Best
1= Mercedes Best
3 McLaren + 0.3s
4 Force India + 0.4s
5 Ferrari + 0.5s
6 Renault + 0.9s
7 Williams + 1.1s
8= Lotus + 1.3s
8= Sauber + 1.3s
8= Toro Rosso + 1.3s
11 Virgin + 1.6s
12 HRT + 3.2s

Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that their daughter Chelsea was "the first one" to say the Zika virus was a serious health issue and that Chelsea's advice prompted them to send aides on a "fact-finding mission" to Puerto Rico to learn more about it.
The Democratic presidential nominee added they did not know about Zika until Chelsea, who had been "following the data," warned them about its dangers to pregnant women.
"I first learned about Zika last December," Clinton said in Miami. "My daughter, who has a PhD in public health, was also pregnant at the same time, and she's the first one who said this is a serious problem, following the data from Brazil and South America, and they said we need to get ahead of this disease, because it's particularly dangerous for pregnant women and their children."
"That's why, after hearing this from my daughter, I sent two of my close aides on a fact-finding mission to Puerto Rico, where more cases had developed, and as we know, the government there is under so much financial pressure," Clinton added. "How are they going to deal with the challenge of Zika? I wanted to learn more and figure out what we could to help Puerto Rico and what we could do more generally across our country."
Zika, a virus acquired through mosquito bites that pregnant women can pass along to their babies and give birth defects, has no cure at this point. Clinton's tour of a health center in Miami on Tuesday mainly focused on attempts to contain Zika and raise awareness about how to avoid it. The outbreak around Miami has affected more than 20 people, with four more cases announced this week.
Hunters rescue bald eagle from claw trap (VIDEO)
When Canadian brothers Michael and Neil Fletcher set off for a day of sage grouse hunting in Ontario recently, they ended up crossing paths with a much bigger bird. While scoping out the woods, the pair discovered a bald eagle stuck in a claw trap, and quickly came to its rescue.
Of course, the best thing to do should you find yourself in a similar situation is to call local wildlife control, but given the circumstances, we're happy to report that neither the eagle nor its human helpers were hurt during the process. The bird appeared in good condition when released.
Although just one of the eagle's two-inch (5cm) talons was caught in the trap, it was enough of a snare to keep the frightened bird from flying free. "It was struggling, and trying to fly upwards but it couldn't," the brothers told the BBC. "We were a bit nervous at first, but after a minute [the eagle] calmed down and so did we."
The hunters placed a sweatshirt over the animal's eyes to reduce stress while they worked to open the trap's clamping mechanism. "We just kind of held on to it, and it calmed right down. I was surprised by the size, and that it's such a beautiful bird. When you see the eyes up close, they're really amazing,” added Michael.
Just how long the eagle was trapped remains a mystery, but the Fletchers didn't see any obvious signs of bleeding or injury. After posing for a quick selfie (and that's a definite no-no), they hoisted the large bird into the sky, at which point it flew to a nearby tree.
The pair reportedly contacted the Canadian Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, who will be investigating the incident further.

The hit Syfy Channel show The Expanse, based on the incredible series beginning with Leviathan Wakes by writing team James S. A. Corey, presents a bold and dark future for the human race. Humans have colonized our solar system, though we haven't ventured beyond it. We have research bases on moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus; Mars, the Moon, and dwarf planet Ceres have larger permanent settlements.
The TV series doesn't focus overwhelmingly on science (though all the technology depicted within it is based on real science), and that's to its benefit: there's a lot of story to cover in a limited amount of time. (The authors of the books do focus a bit more on science in the novels.) Let's look at the overall premise of the show, then. How likely is it that we will colonize our own solar system? Will we establish permanent colonies on the Moon and Mars? What will happen to the humans who do leave the Earth?
In Beyond Earth: Our Path to a New Home in the Planets by Charles Wohlforth and Amanda Hendrix, the authors (a science writer and a planetary scientist, respectively) examine what will it take for humans to leave our planet and colonize the solar system, and what form that colonization might take.
It's not a huge leap to assume that humans will look to the stars as the next frontier; we talk constantly of sending astronauts to Mars. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has ambitious plans to settle the first colony on the red planet. A desire to explore, coupled with the damage we are doing to our own planet, almost assures us that eventually, we will begin the process of colonizing other worlds.
But will we establish bases on the Moon and Mars? We might, but it's a bad idea, according to Wohlforth and Hendrix. The key with any solar system colony is that it would have to be self-sustaining. If a colony we establish can't support itself, then it will not survive, long-term. A colony must be able to function independent of Earth—this means producing its own food, energy, and resources. Of course Earth will supply any colony we establish for the short and medium term, but having to constantly resupply a colony from Earth just isn't feasible. It would prove way too expensive to justify the colony's continued existence.
And that's the problem with both the Moon and Mars, the sites of the two largest permanent human settlements in The Expanse: There isn't really a way that we can currently see to make either of those settlements self-sustaining. The Moon has no readily available natural resources or liquid water (although the search for viable forms of lunar water continues). We're less certain about Mars; we know it has polar ice, but no important natural resources as far as we can tell. “Other than its proximity to Earth, there isn't a compelling reason for human beings to go to Mars,” say Wohlforth and Hendrix (p. 47). We see humans terraforming Mars in the show, but in reality, that would take a hundred thousand years (unless technology leaps ahead). It's possible that Mars could survive, as it does in the show, using the resources of the Asteroid Belt, but that would require huge advances in science and technology.
So where should we go, then? Wohlforth and Hendrix make a strong case for Titan, a moon of Saturn. It has an atmosphere, liquid on its surface (methane, not water), and a surface pressure that's tolerable for humans. The problem would be its distance from Earth—hence the need for the colony to be self-sustaining. It's too far away to be able to rely on Earth for resupply.
The Expanse's depiction of Ceres, however, is spot-on. Ceres is the largest body in the Asteroid Belt (it's actually categorized as a dwarf planet) and it's covered in ice. In the TV show, it's one of the first sites of human colonization, and it's actually possible that we might try to settle Ceres in order to mine the resources of the Asteroid Belt. The biggest threat would be radiation, because the dwarf planet doesn't have an atmosphere.
Wohlforth and Hendrix make the very good point that we don't currently have a lot of research as to what effects leaving the protection of the Earth will have on the human body; after all, those in low Earth orbit, aboard the space station, are still protected by Earth's magnetic field. The research we do have isn't promising: radiation is a serious threat. In the TV series, humans counter this through advanced radiation medication. We'd have to develop a way to deal with strong radiation before we can make space travel outside of Earth's magnetic sphere (much less space colonization) a recurrent reality.
The Expanse also deals with the other physical effects living in space have on the human body very well. Wohlforth and Hendrix say that it would be difficult to return to Earth after a human body has adapted to living on Titan. Gravity molds and shapes our bodies. Living without it, or on a planet where there's significantly less gravity than Earth, means that our bodies would grow differently. As those characters in The Expanse who were born on the Moon, Mars, and in the Belt can attest, a body shaped by low gravity is a body unable to withstand the gravity of Earth.
All in all, The Expanse is a mostly realistic—if grim—picture of what humanity's future holds. We will likely visit the Moon and Mars, but only because they're convenient, rather than because of their potential long-term sustainability. The resources of the Asteroid Belt are what will support our space colonization (and the future of Earth), whether it be Titan or somewhere else entirely.

A federal study places Iowa in the number-two slot among all the states for volunteering. Stan Soloway, a committee chairperson for the Corporation for National and Community Service, says Iowans are volunteering their time for a host of worthy projects much more frequently than the national average.
“Iowa ranks second in the country with almost 38% of Iowa's citizens reporting that they actually volunteer or do service in their communities or across the state,” Soloway says. “It's really a terrific news story for Iowa. Nationally, we've seen the largest increase in volunteerism since 2003 and this is the most comprehensive analysis there is on volunteering in America, so it's pretty solid data.”
The top five states are: Utah, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Alaska. By nature, Soloway says, Americans are a giving, resilient people who are looking to support their communities. The report finds more than 63-million Americans gave of their time last year, an increase of one-point-six million people from 2008.
“We think volunteering and service is a critical part of the solution to a lot of the problems that face us, but this is a very exciting story, particularly given the economic downturn,” Soloway says. “Nationwide, we saw the increase despite the economic downturn and even an increase in volunteering amongst those who are unemployed themselves.”
The report found nearly 884-thousand Iowans volunteered last year, giving 93-million hours of service. They say the increases demonstrate how, despite economic challenges, Americans have made service a priority in their lives. “The more that we at the federal level or at the state and local level, through state commissions and various non-profit organizations, can provide access to opportunities, people are looking for ways in which to volunteer,” Soloway says. “It hasn't always been that easy to find the right opportunity. Now, with social media and technology and a much greater focus on providing opportunity, people are taking advantage of it.”
As well as we've done, they say more people need to get engaged in volunteering in whatever area they may choose — including things like literacy, health, hunger, veterans, and the environment. The Corporation for National and Community Service is the federal agency responsible for fostering volunteering and service. For more information, visit: “www.volunteeringinamerica.gov“.

1.) Gather Materials
Round up at least 5 feet of Type M ¾-inch copper tubing, seven eye screws, five No. 6 1-inch machine screws and nuts, nylon twine, and 1 x 6 lumber.
2.) Map Pipe Mounts
Center a 4½-inch-diameter circle in a 5½-inch-square cut of lumber. Mark the circle at five equidistant points. Insert eye screws at the circle's center and at all five points.
3.) Cut Pythagoras
Cut five pieces of tubing to the lengths in the table below and deburr. The chime's five notes, which correspond to a piano's black keys, make up the minor pentatonic scale. The notes are pleasing in any order. The ancient Greeks such as Pythagoras were the first to study the link between the length of a vibrating body and the notes of a musical scale.
4.) Tie With Twine
Drill a 5/32-inch hole through each pipe as listed in the table. These hanging points produce the best chime resonance. Insert a machine screw through the hole and fit a nut onto the screw shank. Tie a 7-inch length of twine from the circle of eye screws to the screw shank in each pipe.
5.) Hang the Chime
Use a 2½-inch holesaw to cut a clapper from a 1x scrap. Use more 1x waste to make a V-shaped, 3-inch-long wind scoop. Hang each from the center eye screw. Cut and glue two smaller 1x squares to the top of the first square. Top-center-mount an eye screw in the smallest square. Hang the chime in the breeze and enjoy.
A letter from Shikaco to Hanayo
To Hanayo,
Hello! I'm Shikaco.
It's been really hot lately! Are you doing okay in this heat?
How's your appetite? Have you been eating your rice well?
Are you living your days happily, everyday?
There's just too much I want to ask you, there's no way I can stop… (lol)
Ever since we met, Spring, Summer, Autumn & Winter… I realized that no matter the season, we've always been together.
[Donna Toki mo Zutto] Really, I have always felt Hanayo's presence.
But even if so, there are times I would think…
“If we didn't meet, what would the present me be like?”
I thought about it seriously & this time, words like it'd be painful~ or it'd be lonely~
This kind of negative feelings that I'd normally think of didn't pop into my head for some reason. All I got was “Nothing”.
But even if so, now, naturally, are happy & important days.
Hanayo?
To give me such memories in my life,
I really really am very grateful.
Feelings of “Thank you” I keep thinking, every single day…
Yes! Just like [Sore wa Bokutachi no Kiseki] that song…
It's important to spend what limited time we have happily!
To continuously move forward, surely.
From here on, please still take care of me! I love you the most!!
Jkjk!! Ah~ ~! How embarrassing!!
If there's another chance, I'll write to you again.
Hopefully by then, I will be able to become more honest.
From Kubo Yurika

FOR decades, policymakers have treated poverty as a sign of helplessness and ineptitude. The worse off the neighborhood — the higher the rate of poverty, crime, and juvenile delinquency — the less influence it would have over its future. Social service agencies conducted “needs assessments” rather than asking residents what would strengthen their community. Government agencies or private entrepreneurs then delivered brick-and-mortar solutions — a new school, medical clinic or housing.
It seldom worked. Take Baltimore, which has been “renewed” again and again. Two decades ago, more than $130 million was poured into the neighborhood where the arrest of Freddie Gray sparked riots last spring. The vision was grand — more than a thousand homes were built or renovated; education and health services were introduced — but the jobs disappeared and the drug trade continued to flourish.
To improve poor neighborhoods, the people who live there must have a hand in deciding their own fate. That approach works well in Houston, where one program has enabled hundreds of thousands of poor residents, many of them immigrants, to move up the ladder of economic and educational opportunity each year. It's a strategy that can — and should — be implemented nationwide.
Neighborhood Centers, a Houston nonprofit that grew out of the settlement house movement, has been around since 1907. Although it has grown exponentially, in large part because of the leadership of Angela Blanchard, the organization's president and chief executive officer for the past two decades, its philosophy remains unchanged. “The people are the asset, the source of potential solutions, not the problem,” Ms. Blanchard says. Instead of telling poor neighborhoods what's wrong with them, the organization takes a bottom-up approach. “We go where we're invited and do what we're asked to do.”
Joan Rivers Endoscopy Clinic Targeted With Death Threats
Joan Rivers -- Endoscopy Clinic Targeted with Death Threats
EXCLUSIVE
The clinic wherewas undergoing a throat procedure last week is under fire, because fans are blaming the staff for their death ... and are making it clear they're out for blood.Sources connected to theclinic in NYC tell us death threats have been coming in droves since Joan was rushed to the hospital last week. Some of the threats have included -- "If Joan dies, so will you," ... and ... "I hope you people die, you killed an icon."We're told the clinic has been shutting down early on some days to send employees home -- and additional security's been hired.As we previously reported ... the NY Health Dept is already reviewing the clinic to see if a full scale investigation is warranted.-- A rep for Yorkville Endoscopy tells us extra security has been hired due to media and cameras outside the facility, claiming, "Security is only to ensure patient safety and privacy."
Not to be confused with Telnet . For other uses, see Telenet (disambiguation)
Telenet was an American commercial packet switched network which went into service in 1974.[1] It was the first packet-switched network service that was available to the general public.[2] Various commercial and government interests paid monthly fees for dedicated lines connecting their computers and local networks to this backbone network. Free public dialup access to Telenet, for those who wished to access these systems, was provided in hundreds of cities throughout the United States.
The original founding company, Telenet Inc., was established by Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) and recruited Larry Roberts (former head of the ARPANet) as President of the company, and Barry Wessler. GTE acquired Telenet in 1979.[3] It was later acquired by Sprint and called "Sprintnet". Sprint migrated customers from Telenet to the modern-day Sprintlink[4] IP network, one of many networks composing today's Internet. Telenet had its first offices in downtown Washington, D.C., then moved to McLean, Virginia. It was acquired by GTE while in McLean, and then moved offices in Reston, Virginia.
Under the various names, the company operated a public network, and also sold its packet switching equipment to other carriers and to large enterprise networks.
History [ edit ]
After establishing "value added carriers" was legalized in the U.S., Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) who were the private contractors for ARPANET set out to create a private sector version. In January 1975, Telenet Communications Corporation announced that they had acquired the necessary venture capital after a two-year quest, and on August 16 of the same year they began operating the first public packet-switching network.[5][6]
Coverage [ edit ]
Originally, the public network had switching nodes in seven US cities:[7]
The switching nodes were fed by Telenet Access Controller (TAC) terminal concentrators both colocated and remote from the switches. By 1980, there were over 1000 switches in the public network. At that time, the next largest network using Telenet switches was that of Southern Bell, which had approximately 250 switches.
Internal Network Technology [ edit ]
The initial network used statically-defined hop-by-hop routing, using Prime commercial minicomputers as switches, but then migrated to a purpose-built multiprocessing switch based on 6502 microprocessors. Among the innovations of this second-generation switch was a patented arbitrated bus interface that created a switched fabric among the microprocessors.[8] By contrast, a typical microprocessor-based system of the time used a bus; switched fabrics did not become common until about twenty years later, with the advent of PCI Express and HyperTransport.
Most interswitch lines ran at 56 kbit/s, with a few, such as New York-Washington, at T1 (i.e., 1.544 Mbit/s). The main internal protocol was a proprietary variant on X.75; Telenet also ran standard X.75 gateways to other packet switching networks.
Originally, the switching tables could not be altered separately from the main executable code, and topology updates had to be made by deliberately crashing the switch code and forcing a reboot from the network management center. Improvements in the software allowed new tables to be loaded, but the network never used dynamic routing protocols. Multiple static routes, on a switch-by-switch basis, could be defined for fault tolerance. Network management functions continued to run on Prime minicomputers.
Its X.25 host interface was the first in the industry and Telenet helped standardize X.25 in the CCITT.
Accessing the Network [ edit ]
Basic Asynchronous Access [ edit ]
Users could use modems on the Public Switched Telephone Network to dial TAC ports, calling either from "dumb" terminals or from computers emulating such terminals. Organizations with a large number of local terminals could install a TAC on their own site, which used a dedicated line, at up to 56 kbit/s, to connect to a switch at the nearest Telenet location. Dialup modems supported had a maximum speed of 1200 bit/s, and later 4800 bit/s.
For example, a customer in NYC could dial into the local number, then type in a command similar to:
c 301 555
which would connect (that "c") them to a computer system designated as number "555" located in the same vicinity as the standard telephone "area code" 301.
One significant customer was an early (what would now be called) internet service provider The Source which had their equipment in Mclean, Va. Telenet offered a much lower nighttime rate when there were few corporate customers, and this let The Source set up a modestly priced offering to tens of thousands of customers. Another prominent customer in the 1980s was Quantum Link (now AOL).
Other Access Protocols [ edit ]
Telenet supported remote concentrators for IBM 3270 family intelligent terminals, which communicated, via X.25 to Telenet-written software that ran in IBM 370x series front-end processors. Telenet also supported Block Mode Terminal Interfaces (BMTI) for IBM Remote Job Entry terminals supporting the 2780/3780 and HASP Bisync protocols.
PC Pursuit [ edit ]
In the late 1980s, Telenet offered a service called PC Pursuit. For a flat monthly fee, customers could dial into the Telenet network in one city, then dial out on the modems in another city to access bulletin board systems and other services. PC Pursuit was popular among computer hobbyists because it sidestepped long-distance charges. In this sense, PC Pursuit was similar to the Internet.

The Diary of Miss Idilia: A Tragic Tale of Young Love Lost is a book edited by Genevieve Hill. It presents itself to be the original diary of a young girl who disappeared whilst on holiday with their parents in the German Rhineland in 1851.
First published under the title Das verschwundene Mädchen : die Aufzeichnungen der Idilia Dubb (The missing girl: the records of Idilia Dubb) by Bertelsmann in München in 2002, the diary was later translated into Dutch by Mistral in 2009, and published in English by Short Books in 2010.
The authenticity of the diary and the historicity of the events described in it have been challenged.[1]
Synopsis [ edit ]
Idilia Dubb is a 17-year-old Scottish girl who disappears during a holiday, while on a family trip to Germany in 1851. After a lengthy search fails to find her, their parents return home. In 1860, work men at Lahneck Castle discovered their remains at the top of a tower. Lying next to their skeleton was a diary. In this diary Idilia records the horrors of their final days, due to a wooden staircase they climbed to the top of the tower had collapsed behind her, trapping them without help, food or water.[1]
Authenticity [ edit ]
Questions have been raised about the authenticity of the diary. English publishers Short Books published the diary as non-fiction, but stated that its ‘authenticity can never be entirely verified'.
In their review of the English edition for The Spectator, Andrew Taylor wrote 'even the most credulous reader wouldn't get too far here without smelling several large rats', citing the use of foreshadowing devices, anachronistic language, and the action-packed narrative.[1]
German historians pointed out that there are many historical mistakes in the book: For example a church, near the Castle of Lahneck, is discribed having two towers - but one of them had already collapsed in 1844. Idilia Dubb hears the noise of a train - but the railroad trough the Rhine-Valley was build some years after the discribed time, in 1859[2].

On 30th June 2017, the military leaders of four brigades of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) signed Geneva Call's Deeds of Commitment protecting children in armed conflict, prohibiting sexual violence and against gender discrimination. The signing ceremony took place at the Geneva town hall in the presence of representatives of the Government of the Geneva Canton and members of the humanitarian community. These brigades - the 23rd Division, the 21st Force Union, the Central Division and the First Costal Division - are militarily active in the northern part of Syria in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia and Hama.
By signing these two commitments, they pledged to respect the highest international standards to protect children in conflict, in particular the prohibition of the recruitment of children under 18 and the obligation to facilitate medical care and education to children. They also committed to ban any act of sexual violence, especially against civilians.
Recent reports mention that in 2016, children were recruited by many parties to the conflict including opposition armed non-State actors. “The war in Syria has been the scene of massive and horrifying violations against civilians. It is encouraging that some armed non-State actors publicly commit to respect humanitarian law, for the benefit of the population” said Mehmet Balci, Geneva Call's Head of Near and Middle East region. “We hope that other armed actors will follow this path.”
“Today, through the signature of the Deeds of Commitment protecting children and prohibiting sexual violence, we confirm our will to keep respecting humanitarian norms and to have our fighters applying the rules in these Deeds in our areas of influence. We will also implement them through a collaboration with civil society organizations and awareness-raising campaigns” said one of the military leaders during the ceremony.
Geneva Call and the four FSA brigades agreed on an implementation plan to concretely enforce these commitments in the field. Additional measures to reinforce their internal policies will be taken and training sessions on the obligations of the Deeds for their officers and combatants will be provided. Geneva Call will hold them accountable for these commitments and monitor closely their respect through its network of partners in the field.
Geneva Call started a humanitarian dialogue with these brigades in 2013. Since 2015, Geneva Call has conducted in-depth training sessions on humanitarian norms for most of their leaders and officers. A dialogue to improve compliance with international humanitarian law of their fighters' code of conduct has also been initiated in 2016. These four brigades follow two other Syrian armed non-State actors in signing Deeds of Commitment after the Hazzm Movement (dissolved in 2015) and the People's Protection Units (YPG) which both signed Deeds in 2014.
In 2016, Geneva Call organized 27 training sessions on humanitarian norms for 519 members of nine Syrian armed non- State actors. Through its Fighter not Killer campaign, it has also raised awareness of the rules of war, reaching more than one million people in the country.
The Deed of Commitment is a formal humanitarian commitment that armed non-State actors (ANSA) sign to ensure respect for humanitarian norms. The signature of this commitment does not give any political or legal recognition to these actors. Geneva Call respects the principles of neutrality and impartiality in its work, and strictly limits itself to increase compliance with humanitarian norms by ANSAs in order to ensure a greater respect for the civilian populations.
The Pac-12 officially welcomed 267 new scholarship football players to the Conference of Champions on Wednesday. We say “officially” because most schools had a few players who had already signed and were on campus.
Here are some fun facts and notes about the league's 2016 recruiting class. Worth noting that in the numbers below, we did not count preferred walk-ons. Also, the state listed for transfers and junior college players is the last school from which they were actually recruited -- not their hometowns. The same for a couple of international players who have their hometowns listed outside the country but who played football and were recruited in the U.S. As you'll see, there are three players who were recruited outside the country. These numbers only reflect the players who signed Wednesday. Others could be added at a later date.

Notes
It seems that another star couple has been born!
Actor and Clazziquai member Alex, known from the famous dramas “Pasta,” “Medical Top Team,” and “Hotel King,” and Rainbow‘s Hyunyoung are said to be dating. Their agencies have yet to confirm the reports.
According to Daily Sports, they met this year through a mutual acquaintance, and fell in love. Alex has always been honest with their love, so Hyunyoung has been accompanying them to many concerts and dinners, making their relationship known to those close to them.
One of their acquaintances said, “The two have been dating for four months. Alex liked them first, but they liked them back quickly as well. They did not try to hide it at all. Alex even introduced them as their girlfriend at one of the dinners.”
Alex is 36 years old while Hyunyoung is 24, but the two do not show their age difference. Alex is very caring, and Hyunyoung is cute and adorable!
Congratulations to the couple!

Authorities say a 24-year-old Michigan man has died after crashing a police vehicle they managed to steal while being arrested on suspicion of drunken driving.
Phillip Everett was arrested around 4am Sunday after Michigan State Police troopers responded to reports of a man driving a golf cart without headlights along a road.
Once inside a patrol car, Everett was able to get into the driver's seat.
The Michigan State Police cruiser was destroyed Sunday in the early morning crash
Philip Everett was just 24-years-old when they crashed the police cruiser and died
Police say they were able to drive off with the police car at a high rate of speed as troopers tried to secure the golf cart.
Everett was found in the wrecked car later Sunday morning about 20 miles away, just north of Saginaw.
Police say they later died of injuries suffered in the crash.
Police say the incident remains under investigation. Everett was from Greenbush Township.
The wreckage from the crash was thrown about on the lawn on Sunday
The police cruiser was discovered a short time later by law enforcement that Everett had crashed the patrol car at southbound US-23 near East Bessinger Road in Arenac County.
It's unknown at this time how Everett was able to gain access of the patrol car, police said. The incident remains under investigation.

Game of Thrones Dark Hedges voted one of world's most beautiful places
The prestigious Architectural Digest magazine, which is published in America, has placed the Hedges at number seven in its Top 10 of the most beautiful streets on the planet - ahead of the Champs-Elysees in Paris.
Architectural Digest's 10 most beautiful streets:
The Caminito in Buenos Aires's La Boca district in Argentin Lombard Street with its hairpin bends in San Francisco The streets of Chefchaouen, Morocco The vine covered streets of Jerez de la Frontera, Spain The streets in 1,000-year-old town of Lijiang, China Cherry Blossom Avenue in Bonn, Germany The Dark Hedges in Co Antrim The Champs-Elysees, Paris (left) The Brouwersgracht, Amsterdam The streets of Agueda in Portugal
Last year the Hedges, on the Bregagh Road near Ballymoney, were included in a list of the 12 best road trips in the UK and Ireland by continentalroadtrip.com.
The iconic avenue of Beech trees, a major tourist attraction for Game of Thrones fans, was also chosen as one of the world's 'enchanting' spots by Culture Trip, which calls itself the biggest culture website in the world.
In the citation, Culture Trip said the Dark Hedges were scenic and atmospheric, but advised the "easily spooked" to give the Bregagh Road a wide berth "because legend has it that it is home to an otherworldly resident, a spectral grey lady said to glide between the trees at dusk".

The stunning tunnel of trees along the Bregagh Road was planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family, owners of the Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.
It was designed to impress the Stuarts' visitors as they approached their estate.
The Dark Hedges, which have long been one of the most photographed attractions in Northern Ireland, were propelled to even greater fame by HBO's cult television series, Game of Thrones.
The trees represented the King's Road in the first episode of the second season of Thrones, as Arya Stark, who had escaped from King's Landing disguised as a boy, travelled through the Hedges with other characters to join the Night's Watch.
Ever since, the Dark Hedges have proved to be a magnet for followers of the series from right around the world, including Japan, China, America and Scandinavia.
Earlier this year it was revealed the trees were at risk from the increased flow of visitors and cars.
Transport NI said it was in talks with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council about introducing a new traffic management system on the Bregagh Road.
Infrastructure minister Chris Hazzard told the Assembly that among the measures under consideration were better parking provision and a footpath.
They also said that a total ban on vehicles was also a possibility, as a means of ensuring that the Dark Hedges received special protection.
A number of the iconic trees were blown down earlier this year in storms.
The wood from two of the trees that fell in January has been used for carvings for 10 intricately-designed doors fitted in pubs and hotels, each one telling the story of an episode in season six of Game of Thrones.
The 10 establishments are all close to filming locations from the series.

Ever been called a “Luddite?” It's an insult nowadays, but in the 19th Century they were considered heroes by most of the population. The Luddite Rebellion began in 1811, in Nottingham and gradually spread to Yorkshire, Lancashire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire. They opposed the new machinery which had led to the growth of factory production methods. The cause attracted thousands of followers under the banner of “Luddites” though Ned Ludd, was in fact a mythical invention based on the character of Robin Hood.
The growth of factories using the new textile and power generation technology took away the need for skilled artisans who worked largely at home. They were rapidly replaced by unskilled workers employed in factories. These textile workers, faced with increasing unemployment, falling wages and hunger, attacked the factories and smashed machines in the vain hope that they could change what was happening, or as history has interpreted it, halt “progress.”
In questioning why the Luddites opposed progress it's important to consider how that “progress” was affecting people's lives. The new machines did not require skilled operators. They were easy enough for a child to operate. In fact children from the age of five upwards made up between two thirds and three quarters of the workers in the average textile factory. This naturally increased adult unemployment and depressed wages. The children worked the same 13 hour day (from 6am to 7pm) as the adults, but they were considerably cheaper to employ. While adults might be paid 7 shillings per week, a child under 11 was more likely to be paid 1 shilling, if they were paid at all.
With levels of unemployment as they were, many families were dependent on the money their children earned. But factory work was hard, the hours long, the machinery dangerous and the air thick with tiny fibres and pollutants that got into the lungs. Many parents would not allow their children to work in factories even if it meant “going without.”
Faced with the difficulties of recruiting sufficient cheap child labour the factory owners commonly resorted to buying children from orphanages and workhouses. In some cases they were even paid to take the children who were known as pauper apprentices. The children were made to sign contracts that made them virtually the property of the factory owner. Pauper apprentices were also cheaper to house than adult workers. While it might cost, a £100 to build a cottage for a family, an apprentice house for 100 children could be built for £300.
As the Luddite Rebellion grew, the attacks on factories and the destruction of machinery increased and grew in ferocity. Thousands of machines were destroyed. The Government responded with the “Frame Breaking Act” in February 1812, making the breaking of machines a capital offence which carryied the death penalty. They also deployed twelve thousand troops to the areas where the Luddites were active, to protect the factories and to apprehend offenders.
To add to the problems of the textile workers, in 1811 the wheat harvests failed, driving up the price of bread, the staple diet of the poor. Unable to feed their families, there were food riots in Manchester, Oldham, Ashton, Rochdale, Stockport and Macclesfield in 1812. These people did not have the vote, but they nevertheless petitioned the Government for help. This was the response of the Parliamentary Committee which considered their petition:-
“While the Committee fully acknowledge and most deeply lament the great distress of numbers of persons engaged in the cotton manufacture, they are of opinion that no interference of the legislature with the freedom of trade, or with the perfect liberty of every individual to dispose of their time and of their labour in the way and on the terms which they may judge most conducive to their own interest, can take place without violating general principles of the first importance to the prosperity and happiness of the community, without establishing the most pernicious precedent, or without aggravating, after a very short time, the pressure of the general distress, and imposing obstacles against that distress ever being removed.”
In other words the Government refused to intervene, preferring to do nothing, adopting a “laissez-faire” approach, or in modern parlance opting to – “Let the Market decide.”
The Luddite Rebellion as an organised movement was largely over by 1813, but in 1816 (again following a bad harvest and increase in bread prices) the Luddites attacked Heathcote and Boden's mill in Loughborough. They smashed 53 weaving frames which had cost £6,000. Troops eventually quelled the riot and arrested some of the rioters. For their crimes, six men were executed and another three were transported.
Some historians believe that the Luddite Rebellion was the closest Britain had come to a full scale revolution since the Civil War in 1642, yet it achieved very little, if anything, in terms of change. It was not until 1833 that the government passed the “Factory Act” prohibiting children under 9 from working. The use of child labour became commonplace in the factories of the Industrial Revolution. It took until 1888 for Parliament to pass the “Factory and Workshops Act” preventing children under 10 from working.
The Luddites are now predominantly remembered as “technophobes” and opponents of progress. The word “Luddite” is commonly used as a term of abuse. But before judging the Luddites it's worth remembering that thousands of men and women were willing to risk their lives for the Luddite cause and that the “progress” they opposed, adversely affected their lives and the lives of their children, and their children's children. Surely it is the way that technological advancement is implemented that determines whether or not it represents progress?
Perhaps what being a Luddite was really about is best summed up by the journalist, William Cobbett, who wrote at the time:-
“Society ought not to exist, if not for the benefit of the whole. It is and must be against the law of nature, if it exists for the benefit of the few and for the misery of the many. I say, then, distinctly, that a society, in which the common labourer . . . cannot secure a sufficiency of food and raiment, is a society which ought not to exist; a society contrary to the law of nature; a society whose compact is dissolved.”

Suiting up for Canada at the World Juniors was a lifelong dream for Pierre-Luc Dubois.
Suiting up for Canada at the World Juniors was a lifelong dream for Pierre-Luc Dubois, but the experience admittedly turned into a nightmare when the Canadians lost to the Americans in a shootout in the gold medal game.
Dubois, who had won gold with Canada at the 2015 Ivan Hlinka Memorial tournament, registered five assists for the Canadians at the 2017 IIHF World Junior Championship.
“The World Juniors was one of the dreams of mine, it was fun, but when you lose in the shootout in the final game, you kind of want to forget about it,” Dubois said on Friday at the World Junior Summer Showcase.
The 19-year-old Columbus Blue Jackets prospect is at the summer showcase in Plymouth trying to shake off the mid-summer rust, and as much as he'd like to suit up with Canada at the next World Juniors in Buffalo to erase last year's disappointment, Dubois' focus is on earning a roster spot in Columbus.
“I think it's a win-win,” Dubois said of the options ahead of him. “The decision is really not up to me. If I make the team in Columbus I'm happy, if they decide to keep me for World Juniors, and I stay in Columbus, I'm happy, I'm helping the team win and everything.
“If they decide to send me down, I shift my focus to Hockey Canada. Whatever they decide, I'll be happy with it.”
The 6-foot-3, 202-pound forward scored 21 goals and 55 points in 48 games split between the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles and the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada during their third season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
Dubois also experienced their first trade going from the Screaming Eagles to the Armada mid-season, a trade they feel aided their game.
“I think it was a good time. I had a good time in Cape Breton, I loved playing there, but I wanted to go play for a team that was maybe pushing a little bit more to make it far in the playoffs,” Dubois said of the move. “Cape Breton had a great team, but I think they wanted to go younger.
“To go to a new team, new systems, new everything (was good). I think we play a more defensive game (in Blainville-Boisbriand) so maybe it helped my play without the puck – being centred that's really important. I think I benefitted from it.”
In June Dubois completed their second development camp with the Blue Jackets and was admittedly more comfortable in their surroundings in Columbus. Next month the Ste. Agathe-des-Mont, Quebec native will attend their second NHL training camp and their hopeful of a different outcome.
“I want to go there this year and make the team like last year, but I think now knowing all the staff, knowing all the players, I'm not nervous anymore,” said Dubois. “Last year, I wanted to prove I can play the 200-foot game a little too much, played too safe, whereas this year I want to go there and have fun, play my game, play how I usually play.
“I'm ready, I'm really excited, I think I'm ready for it, we'll see what happens at camp.”
The third overall selection of the Blue Jackets at the 2016 NHL Draft has also had plenty of time to familiarize themselves with both the city of Columbus and the football culture in Ohio.
“I love the city. I've been there two months last year, a month again this year, it's a really nice city, a city I didn't know before I got drafted, but it's really nice, a couple guys have shown me around the city and I'm really excited to go back,” Dubois said. “I love football. Growing up with half an American family, football was big for them. I went last year to an Ohio State game, it was a really fun thing, a hundred thousand people is something you don't see a lot.”
Dubois will head to Columbus next month with a different approach as they look to secure a roster spot.
“Obviously getting older you get stronger, get bigger, get faster, but I think one of the big things that hurt me last year is I wasn't myself at camp,” they said. “It was my first time there so I wanted to prove something. I was playing a game that I don't usually play. This year, I'm not going to do the same mistake twice. I'm excited to get there and hopefully I can make the team this year.”
Back to Overview
Just a couple of weeks after Chinese censors lambasted the social network Sina Weibo for "rumor" mongering, the Twitter-like service announced plans to establish a "user contract" by the end of this month. This comes shortly after the uberpopular site also promised to fight against rumors on the Internet.
According to tech news site The Next Web, which got its hands on the contract and translated it, there are several points that look like they could impede the free flow of information.
It seems as if, for Sina Weibo, the point of the contract is to have greater transparency and be able to better control information on the site. However, there's a danger that this move could be precedent setting for more Web sites in China.
This is The Next Web's translated version of Article 13, which it found to be of particular concern:
Article 13) Users have the right to publish information, but may not publish any information that: 1. Opposes the basic principles established by the constitution 2. Harms the unity, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of the nation 3. Reveals national secrets, endangers national security, or threatens the honor or interests of the nation 4. Incites ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination, undermines ethnic unity, or harms ethnic traditions and customs 5. Promotes evil teachings and superstitions 6. Spreads rumors, disrupts social order, and destroys societal stability 7. Promotes illicit activity, gambling, violence, or calls for the committing of crimes 8. Calls for disruption of social order through illegal gatherings, formation of organizations, protests, demonstrations, mass gatherings, and assemblies 9. Has other content, which is forbidden by laws, administrative regulations, and national regulations
At the end of April, Sina Weibo came under fire by the government forabout a possible political coup. According to The Next Web, the social network was punished by having user comments deactivated for three days.
China is a blogging and microblogging powerhouse with hundreds of millions of people using microblogging Web sites daily. Sina Weibo has more than 300 million users, which is three-fold Twitter's more than 100 million active users. The growth of blogging sites has resulted in a rapid expansion of places where Chinese people can express themselves -- something the government has long viewed as a threat.
Cengage Learning Inc., one of the nation's largest publishers of textbooks and other educational content, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code for what it said was about $5.8-billion in outstanding debt. The move will not only reduce that debt but allow Cengage to restructure to support its "long-term business strategy of transitioning from traditional print models to digital educational and research materials," the company said in a written statement.
A partnership led by a private-equity group, Apax Partners LLP, bought Cengage in 2007 from Thomson Reuters for approximately $7.75-billion. That turned out to be too high a price, Michael E. Hansen, the company's chief executive officer, said in an interview.
"They simply overpaid for the business," which overburdened it with debt, Mr. Hansen said. "Then what happened recently was the market came under pressure on the print side."
Print textbooks have increasingly given way to what they call "core solution products," customizable packages of digital content that include not only textbook materials but learning-assessment aids and other features. Cengage and other major publishers have been investing heavily in such materials. "We are focusing on those products that we believe are very competitive in the marketplace right now," Mr. Hansen said.
The print side of the operation "has seen a pretty steep drop in terms of unit sales," Mr. Hansen said. That has depressed overall performance, and they expect it will be another two or three years before sales of digital products offset that. "Digital growth is strong, but it's off a small base," they said.
Although digital content is gaining ground, many students and faculty members still like print textbooks. The shift toward digital doesn't spell the end of print, according to Mr. Hansen.

"I don't believe the print textbook is dying or dead," they said. "It will have a rightful place in the market. But it is pretty clear that the growth has to be on the digital side."
'Vast Changes' in Textbook Market
That's a sensible assessment, according to Steve Paxhia, president of Beacon Hill Strategic Solutions, a consultant and publishing analyst. With the traditional textbook on the decline, "Cengage is now engaging aggressively in new digital products," they said. "That transition is difficult, but the new strategy should be successful."
Charles Schmidt, director of public relations for the National Association of College Stores, noted how much the market had shifted lately. "The course-materials market has been in a state of flux for several years, with affordability and effectiveness being key," Mr. Schmidt said by e-mail.
In the past three years, they said, college bookstores have "have moved heavily into rental and digital, as well as offering custom print jobs. This results in a variety of formats at a variety of price points, helping them retain market share while keeping course materials as affordable for students as possible."
A bankruptcy filing carries a certain drama with it, and Cengage has been carrying a notable amount of debt, but the pressures and changes that partly drove it to file for Chapter 11 protection are being felt throughout the industry.
Garrett P. Kiely, director of the University of Chicago Press, called Cengage's move "indicative to a certain degree of the vast changes that have occurred in the textbook market."
Those changes include a rise in textbook rentals and "the open-source materials that are being pushed by large states like California," they said. "Some of the trends that caused this are putting pressure on all publishers who publish for an academic audience."
On the contrary, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that speech is valued both for the contribution it makes to rational discourse and for its emotional impact. As Justice John M. Harlan wrote in the 1971 case of Cohen v. California, “We cannot sanction the view that the Constitution, while solicitous of the cognitive content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive function which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the overall message sought to be communicated.”
Fine, the critics might say. But much of the social pressure on campus does not just demonize; it is designed to, and often does, chill unpopular speech. And given that courts frequently invoke the potential chilling effect of government action to invalidate it under the First Amendment, social pressure that has a potential chilling effect is also inconsistent with free speech.
The problem with this argument is that all counter-speech has a potential chilling effect. Any time people refute an assertion of fact by pointing to evidence that contradicts it, speakers may be hesitant to repeat that assertion. Whenever opponents challenge an opinion by showing that it is poorly reasoned, leads to undesirable results, or is motivated by bigotry or ignorance, speakers may feel less comfortable expressing that opinion in the future.
Put bluntly, the implicit goal of all argument is, ultimately, to quash the opposing view. We don't dispute a proposition in the hope that others will continue to hold and express that belief. Unless we are playing devil's advocate, we dispute it to establish that we are right and the other side is wrong. If we are successful enough, the opposing view will become so discredited that it is effectively, although not officially, silenced.
Such has been the fate of many ideas over the centuries, from claims that the earth is flat to declarations that slavery is God's will to assertions that women should not be allowed to vote or own property. Each of these positions can still be asserted without fear of government punishment. But those who make them in earnest are deemed so discreditable that the claims themselves have mostly been removed from public debate.
This highlights a paradox of free speech, and of our relationship to it. On the one hand, Americans are encouraged to be tolerant of opposing ideas in the belief that “the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,” as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes put it in their landmark 1919 opinion in Abrams v. United States.
On the other hand, unlike the government, Americans are not expected to remain neutral observers of that market. Instead, we are participants in it; the market works only if we take that participation seriously, if we exercise our own right of expression to combat ideas we disagree with, to refute false claims, to discredit dangerous beliefs. This does not mean we are required to be vicious or uncivil. But viciousness and incivility are legitimate features of America's free speech tradition. Life is not a debating exercise or a seminar room, and it would be naïve to insist that individuals adhere to some prim, idealized vision of public discourse.
The questions for the Red Sox obviously go well beyond August, beyond September, beyond an October they are almost certain to miss again for the third straight year. The questions for the Red Sox now run into 2013 and well beyond, and some of them simply do not have easy answers.
A mere 40 games now remain in the 2012 Boston baseball season, and even Red Sox officials seem prepared to publicly concede defeat in the wake of Sunday night's 4-1 loss to the New York Yankees. In the overhyped American League wildcard race, the Red Sox are now just one game ahead of the wretched Seattle Mariners. Carl Crawford is finally headed for surgery, perhaps as soon as Tuesday, and the Sox are indisputably headed down a drain they have been circling for some time.
Here are six issues to consider over the final six weeks, in any order you choose:
1. The starting rotation. We all know the problem. Fixing it is another matter entirely. Since they last won a playoff game in 2008, Red Sox starters have ranked eighth, sixth, ninth and now 11th in the AL in ERA. Josh Beckett, Jon Lester and John Lackey are all under team control through 2014, and their combined base salaries next year total $41.6 million.
Now ask yourself this: if the Red Sox can only shed one contract among that group, who goes? Barring a trade offer that the Red sox simply cannot refuse, Lester obviously stays for an assortment of factors, not the least of which are the facts that they are the youngest and cheapest. Maybe the Sox are trying to tell us something with developmental updates on Lackey, whose return to the mound is critical if the Sox are to have any chance at unloading him.
Felix Doubront, Franklin Morales and Clay Buchholz all warrant the chance to pitch regularly next year. How the Sox solve this issue -- not to mention the ones in their clubhouse -- will go a long way toward determining any chance for success next year.
Good luck, Ben Cherington.
2. The manager. Barring a rainout, the Red Sox will play their final game of the season in New York on the night of Wednesday, Oct. 3. If Bobby Valentine is still the manager beyond Oct. 4, Red Sox fans would have the right to further question the decision-making process on Yawkey Way.
Valentine is hardly to blame for the ills that affect this franchise. But the decision to hire them has been an unmitigated disaster, creating problems on multiple levels that have affected the team all year.
John Farrell is everybody's choice as the next skipper, but that might not be as easy as it sounds. What would it take to get him? Would Farrell even want to work in this clown car? Again, the challenges for Cherington here are considerable, and Cherington must do more than find a manager who can win both the support and respect of their players.
They must build a coaching staff that help get the Red Sox' pitching woes straightened out.
3. Jacoby Ellsbury. If the Red Sox are to be believed -- and they shouldn't be -- part of the reason there have been no real long-term discussions about Ellsbury is the inconsistency of their production. In the last four years, Ellsbury has posted an OPS of, in order, .770, .485, .928 and .653 while playing in 153, 18, 158 and 42 games. So what is he? A perennial 30-30 player? Or a delicate piece of crystal?
If and when agent Scott Boras takes Ellsbury to free agency following next season, the Sox would garner a compensatory selection somewhere in the top 50 of the 2014 draft. If Cherington can get more than that now -- particularly if it helps the Red Sox pitching situation -- they need to seriously consider moving Ellsbury now. (Many scoffed when we suggested the Sox do this last offseason, when Ellsbury's trade value was stratospheric.)
Of course, the Sox would need to find a temporary replacement for Ellsbury in center field pending the development of Jackie Bradley. And if the Sox believe they can win with Ellsbury next year, then keeping them becomes an obvious priority.
But at the moment, this team has a lot of work to do.
4. Catcher. Since early June, Jarrod Saltalamacchia has batted .186 with 67 strikeouts and 33 hits. Their production has now dropped considerably in the second half of each of the last two seasons, and the pitching staff hasn't exactly developed under their watch.
Meanwhile, Ryan Lavarnway may be here to stay, though he, too, comes with obvious questions.
Offensively, keeping Saltalamacchia and Lavarnway together in a straight platoon might make a great deal of sense next year because of the strengths of each -- Saltalamacchia against righthanders, Lavarnway against lefthanders. (The manager, if it is someone like Farrell, also could have a big influence here.) But if the Red Sox have doubts, Cherington must consider moving one of their two young catchers, particularly if part of a larger deal.
The catching on this team is a problem of debatable degree, but a problem nonetheless.
5. Shortstop. Mike Aviles got off to a nice start this season, but the dip was beyond predictable. In their last 69 games, Aviles has batted .238 with three home runs and an OPS of .594. The more they play, the worse they get, which is why Aviles both began this season and ends it as a 31-year-old utility man.
Maybe Pedro Ciriaco is a find, maybe they aren't. Maybe Jose Iglesias will hit enough, maybe they won't. Regardless, the one thing we can say with certainty is that either may bring strengths Aviles does not -- Ciriaco with speed and perhaps with the bat, Iglesias indisputably on defense -- and there is simply no reason for Aviles to be the starting shortstop of this team anymore.
If the Sox want to keep Aviles as a utility man, fine. But shortstop is really the only position in the infield that needs any look at all because, assuming health, the Sox have good answers at first, second and third bases.
6. Daniel Bard and the bullpen. Nearly three months have passed since Bard last threw a pitch in the major leagues, and little has changed. In 28 appearances (covering 29 innings) at Triple-A, Bard has 29 walks and a 7.45 ERA. In their last 10 outings, they have 14 walks in 9.2 innings. Moving Bard to the rotation may go down as one of the worst decisions in Red Sox history since the mishandling of Craig Hansen.
Wow. What a mess.
Overall, the bullpen this season has been decent, though it hasn't been nearly as good as everyone would like to think. Alfredo Aceves is simply not a closer. Keeping Andrew Bailey on the active roster has proven to be a challenge throughout their career, and Mark Melancon is hardly the setup man the Sox envisioned when they acquired him. The Sox must find a reliable power arm between Aceves and Bailey if they even want to come close to replicating what they had here during their championship years.
Bard is obviously a key question here.
But like many other things on this Red Sox team, they simply cannot be counted on anymore.
Almost everybody in the Bitcoin scene knows that an increasing amount of cryptocurrency-related malware is spreading through computers worldwide, using them as host systems to secretly mine Bitcoins. One of the most famous affiliate programs out there currently doing this is known by the name of FeodalCash and it has been making headlines in the entire world.
The Russian program actually pays people for the mass installation of malware on other people's computers, turning the devices into Bitcoin mining bots. Allegedly, FeodalCash has been recruiting new members since May of this year, but these members must be able to prove that they have control over enough Internet traffic to guarantee several hundred installs of the malware per day.
According to XyliBox, a website dedicated to demystificating cybercrime, FeodalCash is a source of malware. However, the platform is denying this accusation, but they also refused to submit their installer program to multi-antivirus scanners like Virustotal. Probably because services like this one share information about new malware samples, making it more likely that the antivirus on the host computers will flag the program as malicious.
Fortunately, there are still those who want to show the truth. The website KrebsOnSecutiry.com submitted the file to Virustotal and, guess what… It came back flagged as a Trojan horse twice!
According to the FeodalCash administrator, the program's affiliates aren't allowed to distribute the installer file in any way that violates the law. Nevertheless, we're not sure about which law he's talking about. After all, you just need to do the math… It's not even a matter of solving algorithms, just add two plus two and you'll see that everything looks really suspicious.
Until now, FeodalCash has attracted at least 238 working affiliates and there's even a list of these members you can check here with their corresponding Bitcoin wallets. As stated by the website Xylitol, the host PCs that are currently infected with the malware are being enslaved through the Eligius bitcoin mining pool. So far, the infected computers have mined around 140 Bitcoins.

The Religion of Peace strikes again. Or is that the Religion of Pieces? Or the Religion of Pedophiles?
Muslims approve of pedophilia. After all, Mohammed was a pedophile, they had a nine-year-old wife. They don't bat an eyelash at the idea. They even have mass weddings.
Here's the latest victim of Islam.
A 40-year-old Muslim man recently married an innocent 8-year-old girl. Unfortunately, the situation was only made worse later that day as reports have recently come out explaining the vile things the Islamist did to their new bride – and it was a bit more than just consummating on their wedding night. The incident reportedly occurred in the tribal area of Hardh in northwestern Yemen, where yet another disgusting Muslim wedding took place. Proving that the religion is still stuck in the 7th century, a little girl was forced into a marriage with a man 5 times their age.
Here's the “happy couple.”
You can see why they were attracted to him, right?
According to the recent reports, the little girl died that night on account of suffering internal injuries due to sexual trauma. In essence, this monster raped them to death. As a result, human rights organizations are calling for the arrest of the man, but there is no word that this will ever come to be.
No word on whether he'll be arrested. President Obama has been silent on the subject.
CAIRO (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, saying an Israeli ground operation in the Palestinian enclave would be a “dangerous escalation” that must be avoided.
Speaking at a news conference in Cairo after talks with Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby, Ban said they supported Egyptian-led efforts to bring an end to the fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the Hamas-run territory.
“Immediate steps are needed by all to avoid a further escalation, including a ground operation which will only result in further tragedy,” they said.
“My message is clear: all sides must halt fire immediately. Further escalating the situation will put the entire region at risk,” said Ban, who will go to Israel later on Tuesday. “I will urge the Israeli leadership to end the violence,” they said.
“We all must recognize that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must be respected in accordance with international law, but a ground operation would be a dangerous escalation,” they said.
Nearly a quarter of all people playing, coaching or refereeing professional football personally know a gay player, according to new research into attitudes towards homosexuality in the game.
It also finds that almost eight out of 10 fans thought openly gay players would have the same positive effect on football as black players did in the 1980s and 90s when racism in the sport was tackled.
The findings are likely to raise expectations that football will soon follow other professional sports and see a top player come out. In recent years, rugby union, hurling and tennis have seen star players reveal that they are gay while at the height of their careers. But the survey, conducted by the University of Staffordshire, suggested such a move for a professional footballer would not be without risks.
Of the professional players, coaches, managers and referees who know gay footballers currently playing the game, a third believe they would face abuse from other players if they came out. Almost four out of five think they would face hostility from fans.
No professional footballer has ever come out in the UK while still still playing at the highest level. In 1990 Justin Fashanu, Britain's first £1m black player, announced they were gay after their career had, in effect, finished and they were playing semi-professional football.
A number of Fashanu's former team-mates said gay men had no place in a team sport. Their brother, John, the ex-Wimbledon striker and now TV presenter, publicly disowned him, although they later retracted their comments.
Max Clifford, who is rumoured to have been consulted by at least three gay professional footballers, has revealed that they have advised footballers not to come out because the sport is "steeped in homophobia".
But just under 10% of fans questioned in the survey expressed hostility to homosexuality and resented any liberalisation in attitudes towards gay players witnessed in other sports. Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture, media and sport at the University of Staffordshire, who conducted the research, said for most fans the only thing that counted was a player's performance on the pitch. "One fan told us: 'I'd rather have a gay player who can play than a straight one who can't.' And this is a typical view, not just from supporters but from everyone associated with football," they explained.
Gareth Thomas, a former Wales rugby union captain who now plays rugby league, made headlines last year when they announced they were gay while still at the peak of their professional career. Of those football fans questioned in the research, more than 52% believe the greatest cause for a change in attitudes in the game would be a Gareth Thomas-type player coming out. A campaign backed by leading players was also considered by almost 31% to be influential.
One fan who completed the survey of 3,000 people explained: "A player finally having the courage to ruin their career by coming out [would change attitudes]. But it will be the end of their career as anything other than a 'gay footballer'."
Another suggested the move could even prove profitable. "He could make a lot of money [as] the first gay footballer." But only, "when football joins the 21st century".
Two-thirds believed at least one professional footballer would announce they are gay in the next five years.
Smoke began rising from the ground Wednesday morning at 9th and Walnut Streets in Center City signaling an underground fire. Police and firefighters were on the scene.
An underground electrical fire sent smoke billowing into the air as emergency crews brought traffic to a halt for hours on Center City streets Wednesday.
The fire broke out shortly before 8:15 a.m. sending heavy smoke and flames out of manholes and grates in the area of Will's Eye Hospital at 9th and Walnut streets, Philadelphia police said. After more than an hour, smoke continued to pour into the air.
Commuters dealt with traffic troubles throughout the day as police blocked Walnut, Locust, 8th and 9th streets to vehicles and pedestrians into the afternoon.
PECO crews initially responded to an underground cable issue around 7:15 a.m., the utility said. While working to isolate the issue, a cable overheated.
Alhamduillah no one is hurt but, no one can come in and no one can leave. So please do not come near 9th and Walnut St. It's blocked off. Phone lines are down so if you can not reach your doctors office this is why. A post shared by خديجة (@ummhaseen_) on Oct 4, 2017 at 5:59am PDT
The area includes theaters, medical buildings and restaurants. Videos on social media showed thick smoke billowing into the air.
The fire knocked power out to about 80 customers -- most along 8th Street -- at its height, PECO said. By 3 p.m. about 20 customers remained without power as crews continued to work.
It took some time for crews to de-energize the sparking wire so that would, could be done to repair it, PECO said.

POLITICAL LEADERS FOR 9/11 TRUTH LAUNCHED TODAY
Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth (pl911truth.com) is today being launched as the latest formal group calling for a new investigation into the events of September 11, 2001. The organization is headed by Councilor (Senator) Yukihisa Fujita of Japan and former Senator Karen Johnson of Arizona.
This initiative is formed around a petition asking President Obama “to authorize a new, truly independent, investigation to determine what happened on 9/11.”
[efoods]Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth thus joins other concerned citizens' groups calling for a new investigation, including Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, Firefighters for 9/11 Truth, Lawyers for 9/11 Truth, Medical Professionals for 9/11 Truth, Pilots for 9/11 Truth, Religious Leaders for 9/11 Truth, Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice, and Veterans for 9/11 Truth.
Independent researchers from these professions have established beyond any reasonable doubt that the official account of 9/11 is false and that the official investigations have been cover-up operations.
Senator Yukihisa Fujita explains the new initiative: “Thus far there has been no response from political leaders in Washington or in other capitals around the world. Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth has been formed to encourage such a response.”
The organization is being launched with 20 charter members, including a former US governor, a former US senator, former US representatives, and former and present members of the British, German, Japanese, Norwegian, and European parliaments.
Charter member Robert Bowman, former head of the “Star Wars” program, explains the continuing relevance of the issue: “The 9/11 Tragedy has been used as the excuse for two deadly wars of aggression, for taking away our rights, and for committing war crimes that have undermined America's reputation. Only by exposing the truth about 9/11 can we end this madness.”
Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth invites other people who hold, or have held, a political office—whether elected or appointed, whether municipal, state, provincial, national, or international— to sign the petition at pl911truth.com.
Senator Johnson sums it up: “The organization believes that the truth about 9/11 needs to be exposed now—not in 50 years as a footnote in the history books—so the policies that have been based on the Bush-Cheney administration's interpretation of the 9/11 attacks can be changed.”
Madonna Broderick spent 23 years living on the streets of Toronto, struggling with addiction.
“I've been clean 15 years but my health has caught up with me,” says the 59-year-old.
They now have many chronic illnesses – including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fibromyalgia. And, like many low-income Canadians, they have had a tough time paying for their multiple medications.
Broderick receives government disability payments of about $600 a month for basic needs and coverage for their 10 regular medications and insulin, which would otherwise soak up more than half their monthly allowance. But being prescribed a medication that's not covered causes considerable financial stress.
“Last year I needed an additional medication. It was $80 a month, and it was the difference between me being comfortable and uncomfortable. But I couldn't afford it. … Anything extra like that is my grocery money,” they said.
Broderick's dilemma throws the spotlight on a dirty little secret: Canadian medications prices are the second highest globally and we pay far too much for generic drugs.
It is not uncommon for patients like Broderick, with complex health issues, to end up hundreds of dollars a month out of pocket because of their prescriptions.
Many Canadians stop taking the drugs they need because they can't afford them. More than one in 10 don't fill a prescription because of cost, says a 2012 Canadian Medical Association Journal study.
South of the border, price increases of medications such as the EpiPen continue to make headlines. Two-thirds of Americans surveyed in a September Kaiser health poll favoured importing drugs from Canada because of rising prices.
But they might not realize Canada is not much better than the U.S. when it comes to drug cost. A recent policy brief from the advocacy group Public Citizen concluded how the U.S. and Canada provide pharmacare are anomalies when compared to all other members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development — both countries are characterized by “very high drug costs, lack of cost-efficiency, significant waste, and a large proportion of their populations not being able to fill prescriptions due to financial reasons.”
The best systems have a national formulary (list of drugs covered) with single purchaser paying power, says Steve Morgan, a health policy professor at the University of British Columbia. New Zealand has a much smaller population than Canada, but negotiates brand-name drug prices that are about 40 per cent lower and generic drug prices that are 90 per cent lower than Canadian prices because it buys medications as a country.
“Almost all universal public health-care systems operate with a version of a single national formulary …With this, you can negotiate pricing terms and guarantee supplies. Canada doesn't have that. As a result, we are the silver medallists when it comes to high prices in pharmaceuticals.”
But Canada does have an advantage over the U.S. when it comes to some regulation on patented drug price increases. That's why the EpiPen crisis — where the U.S. price for the life-saving allergic device jumped from US$100 to US$600 — isn't as severe in Canada.
“What we do have to protect against these rapid price increases is a regulatory body, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB). It regulates price increases … our prices can't go astronomically high very quickly because there are regulatory restrictions on price growth.”
As a result, an EpiPen pack that costs more than$600 in Chicago is only $120 in Canada.
But generic drugs are a different story.This year, a PMPRB report concluded Canada's generic drug prices are too high — 19 to 31 per cent above prices in Europe, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. With generic prescription drug sales totalling $5.4 billion annually, experts estimate we are overpaying by more than $1 billion a year.
For example, Canadian generic drug manufacturer Apotex sells the anti-depressant venlafaxine to the U.S. for half the price it does here. Blood pressure medication amlodipine is bought by New Zealand for 10 per cent of the average price the provinces pay.
This is because instead of bargaining for the lowest possible price, Canadian provinces pay a percentage of the cost of the original patented drug. And in cases where there is only one manufacturer of a generic drug – with no branded version to set the price – companies are free to charge what they want.
“Despite governments trying to bring prices of generics down in Canada – we're still paying two to three times as much relative to the best available prices in comparable countries,” says Morgan.
Ameet Sarpatwari recently co-authored a paper on high prescription drug costs in America with their Harvard Medical School colleagues. They say that while Americans pay the highest combined generic and branded drug prices in the world, the U.S. generic drug market often behaves.
“With the exception of a few outliers, generic drugs offer incredible value to Americans,” they say. “The majority of generic drugs decrease in price over time because of competition. Generic drugs make up almost 80 per cent of prescriptions written in the U.S.”
Sarpatwari says there are increasing examples where American drug companies take advantage of limited competition to raise the price of generic drugs that have been around for years. For example, the antibiotic doxycycline has seen an 1800 per cent increase in recent years. They also warn that when a generic medication drugs isn't prescribed very often, price increases can fly largely under the radar.
New Zealand prices are staggeringly low and 100 per cent of their population is covered. New Zealand is not afraid of being tough but fair…They flex their single payer muscles so the pharmaceutical industry behaves
What many people fail to realize is that Canadians aren't protected from these price increases like we are from the patented EpiPen – the PMPRB does not regulate rapid price increases on generics. And the provincial price caps limit how low prices can go.
Morgan cites New Zealand as a better role model for other OECD countries.
“New Zealand prices are staggeringly low and 100 per cent of their population is covered. New Zealand is not afraid of being tough but fair — they will take you (the drug company) off of their national formulary if pricing doesn't make sense. They flex their single payer muscles so the pharmaceutical industry behaves.”
Madonna believes lower drug prices help keep patients like them healthy. “Good quality healthcare is access. And when you start a medication, you can be on it for life – and that cost adds up over the years. People should be able to access the medications they need to stay healthy,” they say.

Hey everyone! I'm looking to kick off an on-going monthly Dungeon World campaign tomorrow at 11am EST! It'll be pretty laid back, but I'm still aiming for some strong roleplaying and storytelling. The campaign will hinge on a powerful, magical macguffin called " The Dragonstone " that will play a significant role in the fate of the realm Stormforge. The twist? I have no idea what it is, what it does, or why it is important. We'll come up with the significance and details of this object during the first session, along with the characters and world. Experience with Dungeon World is preferred but not required, though Video & Voice are a must. If you're interested, shoot a message over on my listing ! I'll be choosing 3-4 players tonight by 7pm EST! Thanks, and hope to hear from you!
A crack team of elite Indian liberals, comprising Ram Chandra Guha, Manish Tewari, Sagarika Ghose, and the one and only Mani Shankar Aiyar, have been enlisted to work with NATO forces to battle the forces of extremism in Afghanistan. These champions of secularism and pluralism, who had cut their teeth taking on right wing forces in television studios and ivory towers of academia back in India, will now train their guns against the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and other forces of extremism that come in the way of Afghanistan's march towards secularism and progressive thinking.
The Indian Seals – as they are referred to by their American counterparts in awe – commenced their dangerous mission after parachuting into the Hindu Kush mountains in the wee hours of dawn from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules after taking off from the NATO base in Jalalabad near the Af-Pak border.
The liberals have fanned out in different directions with Mani heading towards Quetta to corner renegade Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, in their cave and overpower them with a tongue lashing. Manish Tewari will proceed in south-eastern direction towards N. Waziristan on the other side of the Durand line to engage in hand to hand verbal combat with Pasthun warlord and Islamic fundamentalist, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Sagarika will handle psy ops, broadcasting propaganda from Kabul through their program, Face the Afghan Nation, and posting real time tweets in a bid to completely demoralize the Taliban ranks. They already fired their first salvo by coining the term ‘Internet Taliban', which has led to much disgruntlement within the Islamist militia.
The Indian seals have already notched up remarkable victories – Mullah Omar, after being confronted by Mani, who proceeded to lecture them on secularism, came running out of their cave and surrendered to NATO forces. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar met with a gorier fate: Manish Tewari reportedly banged them against the wall and subjected them to a diatribe on the perils of socially conservative thinking, inducing the fearsome Pashtun leader to faint in shock. Hekmatyar is now recuperating in a medical center at a NATO base near Jalalabad.
The Americans are so pleased with the results that they now want to outsource the entire war against obscurantism in the Af-Pak region to their Indian liberal allies but experts have been quick to point out the follies of such a move. “We funded and trained the Mujahideen in the 80s to resist the Soviet occupation. Now they have come back to bite our ass. There is no gainsaying that the Indian liberals may well turn around and attack us for our relative conservatism after they have pacified Afghanistan. I hear that Mani chap is some sort of fundo himself, albeit of the secular variety,” cautioned a NATO analyst.
Kent Bazemore is a second-year player for the Golden State Warriors who's known more for their end-of-the-bench celebrations than for anything he's done on the court. But Bazemore is a professional basketball player in the greatest basketball league in the world, and that is something not a ton of people can say.
Recently, Bazemore revealed that they had stitched the number “499” into the tongue of their shoes, a number that corresponds with Bazemore's 2012 pre-season ranking in an ESPN online feature published before the 2012 season. ESPN asked 104 experts to rank 500 NBA players on a score of 1-10, and Bazemore was the 499th-ranked player, just ahead of Eddy Curry, who came in last.
There are only 450 roster spots in the NBA, so the list, unscientific as it was, basically said that Bazemore didn't belong in the league.
But Bazemore did make a roster, and was a valuable team guy for Golden State last season. To keep themselves motivated, they stitched the number onto their shoes to remind them what all those experts thought of him.
It seems to be working, too. Bazemore was a major factor on the Warriors' summer league team, averaging over 18 points a game and getting voted to the All-Summer League First Team.
Bazemore has proven they can win, too: The Warriors won the 2013 Summer League tournament.

Related Nissan Leaf sales continue to fall from last year; 20,000 sales target unlikely Detroit News
The headline for a recent Detroit News story has it that the “20,000 sales target [is] unlikely” for the Nissan Leaf. But “unlikely” is probably understating things. It appears as if Nissan won't get halfway to its 20,000-Leaf target for 2012, nor will it top last year's mark of 9,679 units sold—which was itself a disappointment.
Thus far in 2012, Nissan has sold 4,228 all-electric Leafs, a decrease of 31.5% compared to the same period last year. Last month, 685 Leaf purchases were made in the U.S., a 50% decline compared to August 2011.
It's understandable that electric-car sales aren't exactly booming. This is a niche market, after all, and one that's very new and unfamiliar to consumers. Even with government incentives, plug-ins are still very expensive compared to gas-powered cars, and all-electric vehicles like the Leaf can't be used practically for road trips, or any journey of more than 75 miles or so.
(MORE: 10 Things That Cost Way More Outside the U.S. (Including the Nissan Leaf))
Still, one would expect that even if Leaf sales weren't going gangbusters, they'd at least not be on the decline. That is, these are the expectations one would have if they believed the Leaf had a decent future ahead of it.
Even when gas prices spiked to nearly $4 per gallon in early 2012, electric car sales struggled. Just 478 Nissan Leafs sold in February, a month when gas prices were soaring around the country, especially so in California—a state where energy-conscious drivers are more inclined to be open to EVs such as the Leaf to begin with.
The other plug-in most often mentioned in the same breath as the Leaf—the Chevy Volt—hasn't been a runaway hit either. But at least sales are growing. Through the first five months of 2012, Chevy sold 7,000 Volts, which was more than it sold in all of 2011. Sales have remained on the rise since then. In August of 2012, 2,831 Volt purchases were made, an 800% increase over the previous August. For the year thus far, Volt sales totaled nearly 13,500, up 325.5% over the same period in 2011. Granted, unless a miracle occurs, GM won't hit its projected 2012 sales goal of 45,000 Volts, but at least sales are on the upswing.
(MORE: As More Hybrids Hit the Market, All-Electrics Still Trying to Catch On)
The same can't be said of the Leaf, and the most obvious reason why is so-called “range anxiety.” That's the worry drivers have when behind the wheel of a car that could run out of juice when a recharging station is nowhere nearby. Owners of the Volt, which runs on electric and gas power, experience no such anxiety—which is probably one of the reasons they chose a Volt over a Leaf in the first place.
The age of the Leaf, and mass-produced electric cars in general, is still quite young. It's possible that the Leaf could one day catch on in a substantial way, or that another vehicle that runs purely on electric power could become as commonplace as the Toyota Corolla on roads in the future.
For the time being, though, the idea once passed around that the Leaf would be a “Prius Killer” now sounds laughable. Toyota's new Plug-in Prius, which is only available in 15 states, is already outselling the Leaf. Toyota sold 1,047 plug-in electric Prius vehicles in August 2012, and a total of 6,082 for the year, compared to 685 and 4,228, respectively, for the Leaf. And the Prius family in general is a giant in the industry, with nearly 250,000 sales in the first quarter of 2012 alone.
(MORE: One Nation on Welfare: Living Your Life on the Dole)
What the numbers seem to be saying is that the Leaf is not only failing to replace the Prius as the fuel-efficient, eco-conscious car of choice, it is also increasingly looking like a flop.

The human brain is an amazing organ. The average adult brain weighs about three pounds and has over 85 billion cells (neurons). Each neuron can connect with more than 5,000 other cells. Despite its relative small size compared to the total body size, it uses more than twenty-five percent of the daily energy consumed by a person. The human brain is capable of imagining and creating new ideas and thoughts. Those thoughts can lead to acts that create fascinating music, such as Beethoven's Fifth Symphony; beautiful art such as Monet's Impression-Sunrise; inspiring words such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech; and new scientific theories such as the Big Bang theory. But, that same organ can create thoughts of fear, guilt, greed, violence, and others that can cause acts which are harmful. Or, those thoughts can prevent you from taking action at all.
In Brainstorm, Margaret Belle hooks readers and reels them inside the brain of Audrey Dory, to follow the inner thoughts of a young woman advertising executive. Audrey is troubled by a series of unexpected events that affect their business and their personal live. They struggle with their fears, guilt, business plans, dreams, temptation, and love
While Audrey's own thoughts jump here and there, back and forth, they do not stay safely in their own home. As some scientists and advertisers know, you actions are controlled by conscious thoughts, but also by unconscious stimulations, which include catchy phrases, sounds, smells and other things, that prime you to take certain action or make certain decisions without consciously understanding the reasons for them. Audrey responds to both conscious and unconscious stimuli. They venture out from here to there in search of something. Is it: Peace of mind? New business? Love? Money? Revenge? You will have to find out.
Brainstorm, like the author's first book The Procedure, is a readable, fast paced story, with enough twists and turns that you will keep turning the pages to see what happens next. A good book to read on a subway, train, plane, or snuggled up in a comfortable chair safely inside your own home.
As Margaret Belle leads you through the storm inside Audrey's brain, your own brain will be entertained by this magical romantic mystery tour. Read Brainstorm, and enjoy.

(CNN) - Despite facing heated criticism over some comments from their convention speech, GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan stood by their remarks Thursday.
On CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer," Ryan said they would not revise their statements linking President Obama to the closure of a General Motors plant in Wisconsin, even though the decision to shutter the factory occurred before Obama took office.
Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker, catch the latest updates from the GOP convention on CNN's 2012 Conventions Live Blog, and check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator to game out your own strategy for November.
"It's still idle," Ryan said. "The point is this is a story of the Obama economy. A man running for president in 2008 making all these grand promises and then none of them occurring."
During their speech Wednesday night, Ryan told a story about then-presidential candidate Obama sharing with autoworkers their hope that government could help keep their plant open. In their speech, Ryan quoted Obama as saying "if our government is there to support you ... this plant will be here for another hundred years."
Ryan added: "That plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day."
The plant was shut down just over a year later, but the decision to do so occurred in June 2008, prior to Obama winning election to the White House. It officially closed its doors in April 2009, a few months into Obama's first term.
According to a CNN Fact Check, Ryan's statement was true–in the sense that the factory closed down while Obama was president, but their speech was incomplete.
The CNN report states: "To fairly evaluate Obama's statement, at least two pieces of context – missing from Ryan's account – would be useful: First, that Obama wasn't telling this plant that he'd save it from a pending closure. They aren't addressing a plant that they knew to be closing, because the closure announcement didn't come until four months after their speech. Second, although the plant's last bit of production stopped early in Obama's presidency and the plant remains closed, the closure was planned before Obama became president."
But Ryan on Thursday did not walk back their comments.
"He got elected. They put their policies in place and the plant is still shut down," Ryan said on CNN. "These are empty promises that become broken promises, and that's the story of the Obama economy."
The House Budget chairperson also stood by another jab they made Wednesday, blaming Obama for "doing nothing" over last year's debt deal fiasco.
"He created a bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. They thanked them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing," Ryan, who served on that panel, said in their convention speech.
According to a CNN Fact Check, Ryan was misleading over the so-called Bowles-Simpson plan–the deficit reduction proposal that became the end product of the presidential debt commission. However, the proposal failed to gain enough votes from the group's 18 members to pass. Ryan, himself, even voted against the plan.
The CNN Fact Check states: "Obama didn't sign onto the Bowles-Simpson recommendations wholeheartedly, but they did take some of their suggestions to Congress in 2011. And Ryan ignores their own role in the failure of the Bowles-Simpson panel."
Pressed about it further Thursday, Ryan emphasized the budget plan they put forward, arguing that they at least took action beyond the commission, whereas the president did not.
"We took the best ideas from Bowles-Simpson and added other ideas and passed it. President Obama did none of that. President Obama said 'I don't like this plan' and offered nothing in return," Ryan said.
Asked about the last-minute debt ceiling deal reached between Congress and the White House last summer–one for which House Speaker John Boehner engaged in multiple negotiations with Obama–Ryan said it wasn't enough.
"It was a small or medium-sized deal, and cutting a back room deal that gives you liability is not leadership," Ryan said. "Submitting a budget to Congress that fixes a problem is leadership, and we haven't seen it from President Obama."

— At a Republican rally in support of President Donald Trump in Raleigh Saturday, state Sen. Ron Rabin, R-Harnett, painted a dark, threatening picture of Trump's critics, suggesting that those who support "resistance" against the president may be guilty of treason.
The rally, organized by the North Carolina Republican Party, was one of many "March 4 Trump" rallies around the country Saturday. Rabin was one of about a dozen speakers scheduled.
Weaving a tapestry of conspiracy theory and the occasional debunked claim, Rabin claimed that the media, "except for one station," is in league with "the Hollywood elite" and "elite universities" in "a cabal of leftists and internationalists" that includes billionaire Democratic supporter George Soros.
"Ninety percent of the people in the media donated to Hillary Rodham Clinton," Rabin told the crowd. "They have become propagandists rather than reporters."
Soros "spends beaucoup dollars buying the little tin horns and drums for those guys," Rabin claimed, gesturing at a group of counter-protestors behind him. "He wants to destroy the United States."
"I am in violent disagreement with that group of cuckoo clocks," they added.
Speaking between occasional chants of "Build that wall!" and "Lock them up!" from an enthusiastic crowd of several hundred, Rabin also claimed that the United Nations is "anti- the United States and anti- our greatest ally in the Middle East, the great state of Israel."
"Let's make them pay their parking tickets," they said of the UN, "and use the money to build them a new building someplace else."
But they saved their most vehement criticism for those involved in protests criticizing Trump, especially elected Democrats such as U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.
"The key word is resistance," Rabin, a veteran, told the crowd. "How many of you guys have counter-insurgency backgrounds? Resistance is the forerunner of insurgency, folks."
Rabin warned the crowd of "ocean-to-ocean coordination" by what they called "the insurgency."
"They're resisting the law and good order of the president," they said. "Pockets will happen, and we have the violence and the increasing violence in the protests."
They suggested that elected officials who support the protests may be guilty of treason.
"What possible right do they have to say they resist the presidency of the United States?" Rabin asked. "What they're doing is really an act of sedition, these elected officials who swore an oath to defend the Constitution.
"Guess what follows that? If that isn't high crime and misdemeanor, I don't know what is, folks," they declared.
For more than thirty years, women have been at the losing end of this fight. Since Roe v. Wade, the men of our government have systematically voted against us. With every further restriction of our reproductive freedoms, they have said, in no uncertain terms, that women do not have the right to control their own bodies. It is a right men enjoy, and a right woman do not.
And we've fought this war on their terms. Even the "pro-choice" Democrats are apologetic about it. Even the "pro-choice" Democrats start from the position that abortion is bad and wrong and tragic, but a necessary evil. As if that has anything to do with our rights.
In 2004, the Democratic presidential nominee said they were personally opposed to abortion -- as if their personal opposition to a medical procedure has anything to do with women's autonomy.
And every time we fight this war on their terms, we lose. Every time we acknowledge the legitimacy of those who oppose reproductive freedom, we lose. Every time we pride ourselves on our big tent, and how great it is that there are enemies of women among us, we lose.
And I am sick and tired of losing.
My autonomy is not about your religious beliefs. My autonomy is not about your "concerns." My autonomy is not about your arbitrary belief that rape victims are entitled to reproductive health care, but women who "use it as contraception" or "change their minds" or "forget to use birth control" are somehow not entitled to reproductive health care.
I refuse to argue the minutia anymore. I refuse to beg for the right to be a full and equal citizen. I refuse to be taken for granted by the Democratic party, who tells me I have no choice but to vote Democrat in elections, and then congratulates itself for its big tent when it comes time to vote on legislation.
Don't tell me how you feel about abortion. I don't care how you feel about abortion.
Tell me how you feel about my rights. Tell me whether you believe I am a full and equal citizen. Tell me whether you really believe the Democratic party stands for women.
It is time for every member of the Democratic party to answer one simple question:
More than 70 German women, nine of whom are schoolgirls, have left their home country for Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State, the president of the German Domestic Intelligence Service (BFV) said.
According to Hans-Georg Maassen, 40 percent of those women are under the age of 25, Zeit Online reported.
While the recruitment of young girls and women by the Islamic State is not a rare phenomenon, Maassen warned that jihadists have lately focused on luring females to join the 'caliphate' via social networks.
Jihadists blog on the internet and are active on forums, where they look for women showing an interest in jihad, BFV's president said. Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants then contact the girls and women to inspire them to marry jihadists.
Maassen says they write blogs with “romantic descriptions” of life in extremist camps, and the females have no idea about the future they are actually agreeing to. Most often, those who travel to be with jihadists are completely isolated, their passport and phones taken away.
According to Islamic scholar Marwan Abou-Taam, who works for the Rhineland-Palatinate state police in Germany, women attracted by such scenarios have psychological problems or feelings of social exclusion, Zeit Online reported. They often come from extremely poor families and have low levels of education.
Meanwhile, the expert says there are still a few young women among them with higher levels of education, adding that ISIS may consider giving them “management” roles.

Security services currently have no information on whether European women are intended to be used by the jihadists as suicide terrorists, but say they cannot exclude the possibility.
The German Domestic Intelligence Service says the overall number of those who have left the country to fight in Syria and Iraq on the side of the jihadists is around 650 people.
Earlier in March, German Interior Minister Thomas de Mazière said around 200 of them had returned home. Actions have already been taken against some of the returnees, while others remain under strict surveillance.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights earlier this month reported that ISIS has intensified the recruitment of children and teenagers this year, since facing difficulties in attracting adults into their troops. At least 400 children from Syria alone were recruited by ISIS over the past three months.

Analysis
Spent fuel recycling would enormously improve the economics of nuclear power. Not only would it mean getting much more energy from a given amount of uranium (this is relatively unimportant, as the cost of uranium fuel is a tiny proportion of the cost of having a nuclear powerplant), reprocessing would cut the amount of waste that had to be managed to a few per cent of present levels. Waste management is one of the major costs of nuclear power, so this would make nuclear electricity hugely cheaper.
Anti-nuclear activists, despite their dislike of waste, generally campaign against reprocessing – both to worsen nuclear economics and because it involves creating isotopes that can then be used to make nuclear weapons. The idea is that these might then somehow be stolen by inimical persons who would then somehow be able to make atomic weapons with them, or something. Such isotopes are of course already created routinely in national weapons programmes but the peaceniks have lost that political battle so they prefer to ignore this.
Meanwhile followers of internet debate have been intrigued by the case of Josef Oehnen, an engineering prof at MIT who wrote an email to a relative in Japan explaining that there was no need to flee in panic due to the Fukushima situation following the quake.
This relative posted the email on a blog and it was subsequently viewed by millions, spreading the sensible, properly informed reassurance that was so lacking in the days following the quake. (We should remember that even in the case of Chernobyl – far less Fukushima – it is now well known that needless fear and stress caused far and away more health and economic damage than radiation possibly could).
Some minor details in the email subsequently turned out to be mistaken, but its broad thrust – that there was no need to worry – turned out to be entirely correct. The technical description of boiling water reactors, radioisotopes emitted from them etc, was very sound.
Nonetheless Oehnen was subsequently persecuted mercilessly by fearmongers, environmental zealots etc. Various journalists "discovered" that they are not a nuclear engineer, and took issue with their private statement to their cousin that "there was and will not be any significant release of radioactivity from the damaged Japanese reactors".
In fact Oehnen is not a nuclear engineer.  They are something much better for the purposes of analysing disaster consequences, an expert on industrial risk. And in the atmosphere of hysterical fear amid which they wrote, their assertion that there would not be any significant radiation release looks very sound indeed – given that nobody at all, not even any worker at the plant, has yet suffered any measurable health consequences from radiation released at the site.
We here at the Reg are still glad we linked to their assessment in the first days of the crisis, and that we early on reported the truth about Fukushima – that on the facts of the case it has been a triumph for nuclear power, not a disaster. We took a lot of flak for that, too – but unlike Dr Oehnen we're used to it.
We'd also recommend the excellent analysis offered by Wade Allison of Oxford university (an expert in both nuclear technology and risk) belatedly published by the Beeb, though sadly buried among scores of webpages and broadcasts of Fukushima scaremongering. Allison points out that at least half the problem in situations like these is the underlying principle of nuclear safety risk management. This is As Low As Reasonably Possible (ALARP) or Achievable (ALARA).
Thus such things as radiation dose limits or permissible levels of iodine-131 are not set rationally, they are set to be as low as they can possibly be. For instance, absolutely no measurable health consequences at all result from radiation doses of 100 millisieverts a year: if everyone in the UK were subjected to such doses for ever, nothing – no extra cases of cancer, nothing – would happen.
And yet even nuclear workers in small numbers are only permitted to sustain doses of 20 millisieverts annually – they can only go to 100 or 250 in emergency situations. Large populations are only allowed to sustain 1 millisievert/yr above normal background (itself already 2 or 3).
These mad, fear-driven, irrationally-low safety levels - multiplied in the case of food or water limits by regulations framed in terms of a year's consumption by high-risk individuals etc etc - mean that even quite minor situations like Fukushima produce "radiation levels x thousands of times the maximum permitted". Even the unfeasibly low amounts of plutonium now found at Fukushima – remember that this plutonium is causing the soil there to be about 2 per cent as radioactive as human bodies are – gets reported under headlines beginning with "URGENT". Even the insignificant levels of caesium so far found are such that many nuclear regulators would advise people to abandon their property because of them: the IAEA has said that Japan should extend the Fukushima evacuation zone, in fact, though sanity appears to be prevailing in Japanese government circles for now.
These crazy "safety" limits are the reason why nuclear electricity never became too cheap to meter; why we don't heat our homes and industry electrically and perhaps drive electric cars too, emitting no carbon at all (and funnelling no huge fossil-fuel payments to unsavoury tyrannies); why we don't today have nuclear-powered rocket ships able to fly to orbit cheaply without throwing most of themselves away, and nuclear plasma-drive cruisers capable of reaching Mars in weeks. In short, irrational fear of nuclear technology is what has stolen away the brilliant Jetsons-style future that was envisioned for us 50 years ago – and may yet steal it from our children.
If humanity can't rid itself of its primitive, hysterical fears – if people can't learn to cope mentally with actual powerful modern technologies more capable than fire and windmills and social networking – then we face a bleak, troublesome, mundane future indeed, one which will probably mean an end to human civilisation down the road rather than its long-term survival. ®

Some of you aren't going to believe this, but the comments on this story are not disabled intentionally - we are working to get them turned back on but are having technical difficulties. You can drop back into the previous Fukushima stories in the meantime if you like.
Japanese magazine CoroCoro has shared new reveals for Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire, due to release this November as a 3DS exclusive.
Most notable are the existence of Mega Sceptile, Mega Swampert and Mega Diancie, where Mega Sceptile is a Grass and Dragon-type while the others retain their expected types. Mega Diancie's ability is listed by the magazine as “???,” although it's unclear what this indicates. The Mega Ring, required for activating a Mega Evolution in Pokémon X & Y, appears to be known as a Mega Bangle now.
Whereas the new Mega Evolution for Groudon & Kyogre, who grace each respective remake's cover, are known as an Ancient Devolution. Roughly translations mean that they could each be known as Primal/Prehistoric/Primeval Groudon and Primal/Prehistoric/Primeval Kyogre, which may be that “other huge change in the world of battling” that battle director Shigeki Morimoto teased.
Pokémon League Champion Steven Stone returns and may have their own Mega Charizard X, while the Mach, Acro Bike, and antagonists Team Aqua and Team Magma will also appear.

On Monday, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly said that recent revelations that the Obama administration used its investigatory powers to look into the members of the media may be due to President Barack Obama's lack of a strong father figure when growing up.
O'Reilly explained their theory to Laura Ingraham on their radio program, noting that they lacked a father's presence in their life — something that Obama wrote about in their book “Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.”
“It's all about control and I think that that's a hallmark of Barack Obama's personality,” O'Reilly said. “I don't want to be a psychiatrist here, but when you're a kid raised in a real turbulent situation like they did with no guiding force in the house, no authoritative figure, no father, all of that — when you get to be an adult, the chances are you're going to want to control your environment. And that's the hallmark of their administration, is that Barack Obama wants control. They want loyalty — every president wants that. But they don't like anything that is happening that they can't tell you to say ‘yes' or ‘no.' It's absolute power.”
O'Reilly, author of the new book “Keep It Pithy: Useful Observations in a Tough World,” also said that the president lacked any resistance beyond their wife, Michelle Obama, and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.
“Most of their acolytes give them that,” O'Reilly continued. “I mean, they just bow down to Barack Obama. I don't think he's got a lot of people in there telling him, ‘Hey you're wrong.' I think maybe their wife can do that and perhaps Valerie Jarrett, but that's about it. So when a story appears and they see it and they don't like it because they don't know who's giving it up, they go after them. So it might be a little thing to another president, like Ronald Reagan for example — I don't think they would have cared. But it's a big thing for Obama.”

MADISON, WI (WTAQ) - A bill to let Wisconsin taverns and liquor stores sue underage customers or their parents will be up for final legislative approval Tuesday.
The Senate will be asked to ratify a measure passed unanimously by the Assembly in May.
The Republican measure would let liquor license owners file civil suits against customers under 21 -- and if the customers are under 18, their parents or guardians would have to pay the owners up to $1,000.
The bill's supporters say it blames underage drinkers for breaking the law, and not the people who serve them.
The bill does not change any other underage drinking laws -- including the one that lets underage people drink in bars with their parents, or spouses who are at least 21.
We're in full swing in Cancún. From Solidity and zkSNARKs to identity management and trusted data feeds, here are the key takeaways from the third day of presentations.
This morning began with an introduction to Solidity by Hudson Jameson, co-founder of Oaken Innovations and an active member of the Ethereum community since its early days. Solidity is a human-readable, high-level language for Ethereum electronic distributed code contracts, also called EDCCs or smart contracts. The language looks like JavaScript with types, and contracts are comparable to classes, explained Jameson.
Solidity compiles to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the code is completely isolated, meaning that it does not communicate externally. If, for example, a person wanted to put sports scores into an EDCC, then that would require a trusted data feed, more commonly referred to as an oracle.
“It's easy to write contracts. It's hard to make sure they're secure.”
A perfect sound bite from Jameson reflects the observation that securing EDCCs is significantly harder than writing them. This might be exemplified by the mess created by Bancor, which raised more than $100 million with roughly 40 lines of code.
Jameson disclosed a fun piece of trivia, saying that there are six high-level languages for Ethereum to date. These are Mutan, Serpent, LLL, Solidity, Bamboo, and Viper. Jameson was pleased by the emergence of contract standards like ERC20. During the presentation, they quickly demonstrated the creation and deployment of a very simple smart contract , which stored an unsigned integer. Jameson also noted that the blockchain read or constant function is a very useful ability, akin to reading a database for free.
Ultimately, Jameson said, the biggest problem for Solidity is that “it's a young language,” but instead of complaining about the lack of familiar features, developers should help build solutions. Amid concerns of insecurity, Jameson is most excited about ZoKrates (pronounced: Zo-crates), a programming language that compiles to Ethereum zero-knowledge proofs.
Following Hudson Jameson was Dr. Christian Reitwiessner, who coyly admitted that programming language theory might be a little bit “dry.” Nonetheless, Reitwiessner made a major announcement – Solidity's documentation is now available in Spanish! Russian, Chinese, and German translations would also go a long way toward expanding Ethereum's development community.
Additionally, Reitwiessner explained that there is work being done to create dynamic return data. This is not fully functional yet, but they aim for this to be completed by the end of the year. Slides from Reitwiessner's presentation are available here.
Mist
Everton Fraga and Victor Maia shared updates about Mist, which can be used to browse and use Dapps on the Ethereum network. They proudly announced that together, Mist and Ethereum Wallet have been downloaded 2.6 million times. Maia posed a fascinating question: “What would the web look like if it came after Ethereum?” Imagine, how ownership of user data or monetization schemes would be different.
In a way, it almost seems backwards – but perhaps that's the nature of this movement towards decentralization. It will take time and dedication for this computing revolution to reach fruition. Maia also issued a warning to developers, saying “Never import JS code you didn't read. It's not safe.”
The Mist team explained that it had a security audit performed by a German software development company called Cure53. This audit uncovered 22 issues, some of which were critical, but were all resolved. Mist relies on a massive web stack, so complications at some levels appear inevitable.
Introduction to zkSNARKs
I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I walked into the breakout room to find nearly 200 people packed shoulder to shoulder. With flashing pink and green lights, the atmosphere seemed more like a rave than a development conference. Reitwiessner's presentation on zkSNARKs garnered a tremendous amount of interest, though many developers have admitted that they're still trying to wrap their heads around the topic.
However, it's clear that the most significant thing about zkSNARKs is that they can assist with scalability.
Through cryptographic magic, it's possible to verify that a piece of data exists – or is true – without actually revealing information about the material. Reitwiessner displayed a mini-Sudoku grid to illustrate how zkSNARKs function. Because of the properties of Sudoku, a person can shuffle the solution, so that verification is possible without giving away the actual solution. This method of taking an arbitrary problem and translating it allows for the “reduction” of interactions. By decreasing the number of rounds of interaction, verification is expedited.
Polynomial graphs, for example, allow a person to detect even the smallest changes. Rather than checking the entire graph or matrix, the graph is different at virtually every point, so it's easier to observe and verify. I hesitate to provide further insight because I want to make sure that I give readers accurate information. For interested parties, Reitwiessner shared their slides via GitHub.
Lunch
During lunch in the media room, a lady handed out temporary tattoos of Vitalik and Ethereum. Lots of writers happily pasted them to their bodies and I grabbed a few, too. No word on their immutability yet.
uPort
uPort is a “complete self-sovereign identity system built on Ethereum.” Product leads Michael Sena and Rouven Heck presented on “uPort – Usable Key Management for Multiple Identities Across Multiple Chains.” In a bold proclamation, Sena announced, “We've built Ethereum's user platform.” The problem? With the abundance of chains, tokens, and applications, it's impossible to work with just one ID on one chain. Today, users have multiple accounts on multiple chains (much the same way that folks have different login credentials for the multitude of social media, gaming, and entertainment platforms). Through the uPort application, Sena and Heck said, private keys can be securely managed for multiple identities.
Thomson Reuters
If Reitwiessner's zkSNARKs presentation merited a rave theme, then so did Sam Chadwick's presentation entitled “Data in the Missing Link.” As the director of new content initiatives for Thomson Reuters, Chadwick is based in Zug, Switzerland, which has been crowned as “Crypto Valley.”
Chadwick explained that a few years ago, when they learned about Ethereum, they spoke with Vitalik Buterin – who coincidentally was living in Zug as well. Thomson Reuters describes itself as such: “We enable professionals in the financial and risk, legal, tax and accounting, and media markets to make the decisions that matter most, all powered by the world's most trusted news organization.”
Buterin, realizing the inheren t trust that is afforded to Reuters, told Chadwick that the multinational media and information firm needed to become an oracle for Ethereum. Interestingly, Thomson Reuters is headquartered in Toronto – another crypto coincidence, as that is where Vitalik attended high school.
The real question for Thomson Reuters, Chadwick explained was how to get involved. Markets are divided by value and volume. The “big tickets” include venture capital, private equity, OTC derivatives, and syndicated loans, so that's where Thomson Reuters is getting started.
Through B1IQ (read: Block One IQ) Thomson Reuters is offering data feeds for EDCCs in beta that are compatible with Ethereum and Corda. Chadwick also highlighted PermID, which aspires to provide permanent identifiers, a crucial issue in the financial services and FinTech world. Tickers can change ownership (e.g., “C” now denotes Citigroup, but it used to be Chrysler), and that would be a massive problem for blockchain-based technology. Hopefully, through PermID, Thomson Reuters has surmounted that challenge.
It's hard to believe that tomorrow's the last day of the conference. There's a wonderful happiness that I've felt walking around the convention center over the last few days. Hearing “blockchain this” and “crypto that,” I feel like I belong – and I think that's something that a lot of developers and writers feel in this space. It's rare to feel like you're among people who are genuinely interested in making the world better. The projects that are being discussed are unequivocally revolutionary. Even if it's unclear which exact projects will succeed and which will fail, what matters is that we're all working together. Sharing, building, and decentralizing … and that's special.
Elgin Brewfest hopes for clear skies, good turnout
hello
Organizers of the 15th annual Elgin Brewfest are crossing their fingers for clear skies this weekend, as the event's fundraising component depends on the attendance of hundreds of beer and music fans.
This is the fourth year the Brewfest is raising money for the Boys & Girls Club of Elgin, an organization close to the heart of Brewfest founder Mike Origer.
Origer's former business, Prairie Rock Brewing Company, put on the Brewfest for years until the brewery shut down in 2008. Origer is still the event's main organizer, however, and chose to make the annual festival a charity event.
Last year Brewfest raised more than $21,000 for the Boys & Girls Club, funds that are used to support the club's mission to serve first- through 12th-graders in the Elgin community. Event organizer Cindy Penn said 2009 and 2010s Brewfests had "tornadic" weather on the Friday of the weekend, therefore limiting the amount of net funds ultimately given to the Boys & Girls Club.
But ultimately, Penn said, "Any kind of outside help is always beneficial."
"It's an organization that helps kids inside the city and it's important," Penn said. "If you can do something to help the community, to help a good cause, then why not?"
Penn and Origer are part of a four-person organizing team that also consists of Shelley DeHart and Richie Hoffner, who organizes the music for the festival. Though many bands apply to perform at Brewfest, only six will perform during the weekend, including Hoffner's own band 7th Heaven.
Interlaced with the bands' sets, is of course beer. As Budweiser is sponsoring Brewfest for the third year, Budweiser products will be plentiful throughout the weekend. This year, however, the company allowed Geneva-based brewery Stockholm's Brew Pub to serve up cold ones alongside Budweiser. When Origer began Brewfest, microbreweries like their company were the focus of the event.
With a good beer usually comes great food, this year vended by local restaurants Tilted Kilt, Mama Lou's Shrimp and BBQ Smokehouse, North of the Border, Mr. Fullelcakes, and the reincarnated Prairie Rock Grill.
Father/son duo Mike and Matt Lyons leased Origer's old Prairie Rock property at 127 S. Grove St., Elgin and recently opened the restaurant. Origer allowed the Lyonses to use the Prairie Rock namesake so long as they put on four annual events to benefit the Boys & Girls Club. Mike Lyons quickly agreed to that condition.
"(The club) is helping the community, helping the area that really needs it," Lyons said. "That's your future citizens of this town, of this country. If you give them the right breaks, you hope everything breaks right for them."
As a Boys & Girls Club board member for many years, and now an honorary board member, Origer said they are proud to be involved in projects with the organization.
"There are no other types of activities like this for (Elgin youth) to excel in school, work through personal challenges and have a place of their own," they said. "The Boys & Girls Club has the single largest impact of any organization to the city of Elgin, in my opinion."
Brewfest is one of the largest single funding efforts for the Boys & Girls club. Rose Reinert, Boys & Girls Club executive director, said the funding helps to close the gap between membership fees and actual cost of serving the nearly 1,000 club members. Though membership cost for one child is $25 per year, Reinert said the actual cost is an average of $388 per child to meet their or their needs. On a daily basis, they said nearly 300 children participate in Boys & Girls Club programs, either at the central location at 355 Dundee Ave., Elgin or in local schools.
Of the club's participants, 70 percent live below the poverty level, and 32 percent are dependents in a household with an annual income of $9,000 or less, Reinert said.
"The club identifies those with the most need in the community," they said. "These kids are dealing with things like poverty. We create a place of hope and opportunity to support them and their family so they can become successful adults."
Event organizers hope to surpass their fundraising goals this year to support the Boys & Girls Club, so a $5 entry fee has been instated. Drink tickets are $5 per drink, which includes beer and wine. Food, soda and water are cash only when Brewfest gates open Friday afternoon at Festival Park in Elgin.

Boris Johnson shut down a live TV interview “pub quiz” after appearing to become lost for words when asked to name the South Korean president.
The Foreign Secretary appeared to squirm before fleeing the Sky News interview, telling host Dermot Murnaghan “we are not getting into a pub quiz about leaders around the world”.
The presenter launched into the unexpected quiz live on TV, asking Mr Johnson the same questions they had fired at the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, in September.
They asked Mr Johnson to name the French Foreign Minister and the president of South Korea.
Mr Johnson said: “If you want to have a pub quiz, Dermot, I'll be very happy to meet you in the pub.
“But the French foreign minister is mon ami, Jean-Marc Ayrault”.
But the bungling ex-Mayor of London appeared to be tongue-tied when asked who is the South Korean leader.
After a pause Mr Johnson said: “We are not getting into a pub quiz about leaders around the world and I'm going to, with great respect, invite you out to the pub, Dermot, so that we can take these conversations further.
“I have a terrible feeling that if I keep answering you, you will keep coming back with more.
“Have a good morning, see you.”
They then appears to move away from the camera.
Labour politician Emily Thornberry accused Mr Murnaghan of sexism after the presenter fired questions at them
A 22-year-old teacher is claiming that their strict Muslim childhood “repressed” them and contributed to their desires to have sex with students who attended a New Jersey high school, court records show.
Linda Hardan, a teacher at Manchester Regional High School in Haledon, New Jersey, was arrested and charged with sexual contact with at least two male students, one a 14-year-old and another a 16-year-old. Them contact began with explicit text messages and graduated to sexual contact, police said.
But Hardan's defense counsel insists that their strict Muslim upbringing served to repress her, causing their behavior. They also requested therapy for their client instead of prison time, according to the Daily Mail.
The 14-year-old victim was “disgusted” and “upset” about the sexual encounter. Hardan began explicitly texting them and eventually got them in their car, drove to a secluded area, “and performed a sex act on him.” The student reported they were so repulsed that they jumped out of the car and walked two miles back home.
The convict reportedly perpetrated similar acts with the older boy, prosecutors proved in court.
Prosecutors had worked out a deal with Hardan's legal team, and they accepted a five-year sentence, which was then presented during the sentencing phase of their trial. But Passaic County Superior Court Judge Miguel de la Carrera decided on a lesser sentence, citing the mitigating factors of their childhood. Judge de la Carrera imposed a three-year sentence.
“She had classmates and friends, but somehow, perhaps because of limitations on their dating life, they didn't find the proper outlet among males of their own age,” the judge insisted during the sentencing. “She did not learn how to interact with guys their age,” de la Carrera added.
Still, the judge refused to put their sentence off until they finished a college class they were taking at a local community college.
Hardan will be eligible for parole, with good behavior, in a year.

One day, you wake up to realize that a particularly vital assumption about the world is wrong. Everyone who buys into it is wrong. Which is almost everyone in the world. Everything in the world that depends on it is wrong. Which is almost everything in the world. Now what?
Waking up is an apt way to put it; the reconfiguration of realization is not unlike passing through a slow instance of the stage of booting up in the morning. (Who am I? What am I doing today? How did I get here? What are my axioms? Oh, right, got it). The "oh, right" part might take longer, however, as pulling out one of the pillars of your constructed world generally means radical change. We humans are hardwired to hate change almost as much as we hate failing to share the same worldview as our peers.
But there's no going back from realization. Either you proceed according to your new understanding of the world, and figure out just what that implies, or you become good at living a large and uncomfortable lie. Embrace revelation or run from it.
So, one day, you wake up to realize that aging is the worse bane suffered by humanity, and the people of the world sleepwalk through an unending holocaust of suffering and death caused by the decay of their bodies. Furthermore, it quickly becomes apparent that large-scale work over a few decades will plausibly lead to medical technologies that prevent age-related frailty, disease and death. Acceptance of aging in this circumstance is like a slow-motion mass suicide, day after day.
But still it goes on, the grinding of the cogs, the great wrong that everyone just goes along with as though it were nothing.
Now what? You've seen behind the curtain. You have a secret that no-one you know takes seriously. Yet, you realize with clarity that nothing else you ever do in your life will be as important to the future - your future, humanity's future - as any time and effort you put towards bringing forward the defeat of aging. That's going to be hard to put back into the box, trust me.
God knows, Israel is not the first country struggling to deal with unwanted immigrants. I doubt there's a single first world nation where an influx of migrants from the global south has not sparked public hatred. Anti-Zionists love suggesting that there is something in Zionism itself that leads residents of south Tel Aviv to revile the Sudanese and Eritreans who have arrived in their midst. But last I checked, neither Jean-Marie Le Pen, Filip Dewinter nor Joe Arpaio learned their nativism from reading Jabotinsky.
So yes, what happened yesterday in the Hatikva neighborhood of Tel Aviv has happened in other countries with swelling immigrant populations, some of which don't get as much international flak as does Israel, which is unfair. And yes, what happened yesterday in the Hatikva neighborhood of Tel Aviv stems, in part, from the legitimate grievances of poor native-born Israelis forced to disproportionately bear immigration's burden. (It's always that way.)
Still, last night in the Hatikva neighborhood of Tel Aviv, what began as an anti-immigration rally turned into a race riot. Here's Haaretz:
Some people attacked Africans that passed by. Others smashed the windows of a grocery store serving the migrant worker community and looted it. Another group of demonstrators stopped a shuttle taxi and searched for migrant workers among the passengers, while banging on the windows.
+972 adds:
Protesters attacked a car passing by carrying African immigrants, smashing its windows. Shops associated with the African community were vandalized.
This photo sums it up. (The Israeli flag is a particularly grotesque touch.)
Was this a government-sponsored pogrom? No, the police did protect some terrified immigrants and arrest some anti-immigrant rioters. But neither was the violence entirely spontaneous. The rally was organized by a disciple of Meir Kahane who sits in the Knesset, Michael Ben Ari. One of the speakers, Miri Regev, a Knesset member from Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud, called Sudanese immigrants “a cancer in our body.” Deputy Speaker Danny Danon, also from Likud (and a recent contributor to Open Zion), wrote on Facebook that “Israel is at war” and that “infiltrators are a national plague.” A reviled, powerless minority discussed in the language of war and disease? Where have my Jewish ears heard that before?
Last night, looking for a little moral outrage, I went to the Anti-Defamation League's website, since they've done good work on anti-immigrant racism in Europe and the United States. Nothing doing. The top stories were on Holocaust denial in Greece, the Rutgers spying case and school bullying. I tried the American Jewish Committee, whose mission is to “advance human rights and democratic values in the United States and around the world.” Nada. Their featured stories were about Memorial Day, Iran and black-Jewish cooperation for civil rights (ah, the irony). How about AIPAC, which declares that America and Israel are natural allies because “both nations were founded by refugees seeking political and religious freedom… Both have absorbed waves of immigrants seeking political freedom and economic well-being.” Nope. Or the Presidents' Conference, which aims to “enhance the security and dignity of Jews.” Sure seems like Jewish dignity could use a little enhancing right now in south Tel Aviv. Zilch.
But then I remembered. In recent weeks one Jewish leader has powerfully condemned the growing nativism in the Jewish state, declaring that “Over the past 10-15 years Israel has become more and more racist. All of the studies point to this, this racism toward Arabs and toward foreigners.” Their name? Yuval Diskin, the recently departed head of Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet. Maybe the American Jewish organizations will take their lead from him? On second thought, probably not. No point in associating with delegitimizers.
McAfee studies the ways that information technology (IT) affects businesses and business as a whole. Their research investigates how IT changes the way companies perform, organize themselves, and compete. At a higher level, their work also investigates how computerization affects competition, society, the economy, and the workforce.
Andrew McAfee is the associate director of the Center for Digital Business at the MIT Sloan School of Management, studying the ways information technology (IT) affects businesses and business as a whole. Along with Erik Brynjolfsson, they are the author of Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age.
Andrew McAfee: My coauthor Erik Brynjolfsson and I are both at MIT, and we have a colleague at MIT who said something that really helps me understand some of the last human work that I think is ever going to be automated by even really sophisticated technology.
Our colleagues name is Deb Roy. He's at the media lab. And they point out that we humans are incredibly deeply social creatures, we're just a social species. And you say okay so what? So are ants, so are honeybees, so are chimpanzees.
Deb's point is that the nature of human social interaction involves some really deeply rooted social drives that don't appear to be present in any other animal. We came across a great quote when we were writing Machine Platform Crowd from a sociologist or a primatologist who said, “Look, you will never, ever see two chimpanzees carrying a log." That notion of cooperation is absent from even our closest nonhuman relatives.
So that gives me a whole new way to think about the kind of work that's most innately deeply human, it's the work that taps into our social drives. And those drives are both positive—there's solidarity and pride and compassion for other human beings—and they're negative—they can be envy, they can be shame, they can be jealousy, they can be antipathy towards some kind of other group out there—but we have these drives they are very, very deep, they're very strong and they're kind of hard to fool with technology.
So there are a lot of jobs out there that tap into, that makes use of, that try to harness those social drives. And one of my favorite examples of a job that we don't think of as this incredibly elite job or this incredibly prestigious job but a job that is very unlikely, I believe, to be replaced by technology anytime soon is just a girl's soccer coach.
And that girl's soccer coach may or may not be a strategic genius about the game of soccer, but what that person can do, if they're any good at their job, they can motivate a group of girls to come together to overcome rivalries and jealousies and different kinds of pettiness and play together as a team. They can teach the value of some of those social drives like solidarity. They can help some girls who are natural leaders but might be going through a difficult period in their lives get past that and assume the roles that they're going to be good at. They can just deal in this incredibly rich mix of social things that are going on.
Let's say we could build a computer that could figure out all the different social things that are happening among a group of twenty-five 12-year-old girls. I think that computer is actually a long way off, but let's say we can even build that computer. Would that computer, would that robot be able to motivate those girls, draw them together, tease out what each is really good at, get them to overcome fatigue and self-doubt and all these things, realize if they were having problems in the rest of their lives and how to help them through that? Again, one thing I've learned with technology is “Never say never.” That automatic soccer coach feels like it's a long, long, long way away from me.
So if I take that example and I project it out there are a lot of people who do some work that feels a lot like that and those are teachers, those are managers, those are folk who might be taking care of our more vulnerable populations and I think about the very young, the sick, the elderly, the infirm.
There are a lot of those vulnerable people out there, and because of the richness of our social lives and our social drives I just don't see anyone, even really great innovators, coming up with technologies that could just substitute for the people who are currently doing those very, very social jobs.
- A Florida woman who evacuated to Georgia due to Hurricane Irma is reunited with their lost dog. Faith the dog went missing in the Fayetteville area following a car crash.
Faith had been missing since the Sept. 12 accident. Initial efforts to find them were not successful and their owner, Jasmine Valquez, had to eventually go back to Daytona Beach to take their care of their home. But Sunday night, Valquez was reunited with their beloved dog Faith, who had been missing for 12 days.
The Fayetteville Police shot video of the reunion. It was a moment which may have not been possible if not for a very dedicated Georgia woman is dedicating their time finding missing pets.
"I wish you have gotten my reaction there because I probably scared the crap out of Lovy who found them because I lost my mind. I just can't believe it. Just could not believe it. I had faith pun intended," Valquez said.
Valquez is talking about Lovy Myers and their pet recovery services. Meyers heard about Faith and went on a crusade to find the missing dog.
"I knew they didn't have any close family here and that they wouldn't be able to come back and the longer the dog was out there, the more chance it can get ran over or somebody takes it in. As soon as I finished with another case I started on this one," said Myers.
Meyers posted signs, put up cameras, and began tracking Faith. Then they got the call from someone inside IHOP. They told Myers they could see Faith laying in the grass near the restaurant.
"By the time I got here, the dog had moved down into this neighborhood behind here. A homeowner, they had out a golden retriever in the yard, and faith loves other dogs, so they ran over to the golden. Because they'd seen my sign they knew it was the missing dog so they were able to put a leash on her, so when I got here all I had to do was talk them into getting into the car," said Myers.
Valquez said they cannot thank Myers enough.
"I can't even imagine the world has these types of people. It makes me so happy," said Valquez.
Valquez brought Faith back to their Florida home Monday and surprised their son, who had no idea they were picking up their lost pet.

NIAGARA FALLS -- Police are investigating a double-shooting outside a Highland Avenue tavern early Saturday that police said left one man paralyzed from the neck down.
Niagara Falls officers responded to the 3100 block of Highland Avenue just after 3 a.m. to investigate reports that a man had been shot and then run over by a vehicle. They encountered two people helping a man lying in the middle of the road, suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. A witness told police that they were inside the nearby tavern when they heard what sounded like three gunshots, ran outside and saw the victim on the ground.
Willie E. Lightfoot, 38, of Niagara Avenue, was transported to Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center, where initial reports said that they were paralyzed from the neck down. No further information was available on Lightfoot's injuries.
While police were investigating at the hospital, they learned that another victim from the same shooting had shown up at Mount St. Mary's Hospital in Lewiston.
Charles A. Woods, 37, of Cudaback Avenue, was being treated for gunshot wounds to their leg and buttocks, police said.
Police were said to be searching for a red Ford Fusion or similar vehicle that may have been involved.
Benedict Cumberbatch is going Rogue.
The Oscar-nominated actor has joined Fox Searchlight's adaptation of Rogue Male, the classic 1939 English novel from Geoffrey Household, the studio announced Monday. They will star in the movie and produce with their SunnyMarch production company and Black Sheep Pictures.
“I am thrilled both as an actor and producer to be working on bringing this most treasured of English novels to the big screen,” Cumberbatch said in a statement.
The script, from Michael Lesslie (Macbeth, Assassin's Creed), follows a man's failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler. After he's tortured and left for dead, they escape and must hide in rural England to avoid their foes.
Household's work has been adapted for the screen twice. Peter O'Toole starred in a BBC TV Movie in 1977, and Walter Pidgeon starred in Fritz Lang's 1940 film Man Hunt.
Cumberbatch can next be seen in Marvel's Doctor Strange, out Nov. 4.  They are returning as the titular sleuth in Sherlock in season 4, which has no airdate yet. The Hollywood Reporter first posted the news.
Imagine you could upgrade the sound reproduction quality of any of your older pinball machines to meaty, hi-fi quality stereo. And imagine you could change any or all of the individual game sounds, perhaps swapping in movie theme music to make your perfect customised pin.
That was the dream of French brothers Timothee and Nicolas Manaud, an embedded electronic engineer and a a software engineer respectively, and it's one that they've been working on full time for over two years. And now PinSound, the fruit of their labours, is finally ready.
So what is PinSound? It's an easy to swap drop-in replacement sound board for Data East, System 11c, WPC, DCS, WPC95 (with an extra adapter) and soon Stern DMD machines. It sports an on-board 2:1 amplifier (2 x 20W to power backbox speakers in stereo, plus 30W to power the cabinet bass speaker,) a lineout/headphone jack, and controls for bass, treble, balance and fader (to set the balance between the backbox and cabinet).
Williams machines' backbox speakers are actually wired in series, so you'll have to do a little rewiring if you want to get them to play sounds in stereo. (PinSound sells a ready-made cable to make this easy, or you can make your own.)
Alternatively you can use the lineout jack to connect external speakers – either via a lead or using a wireless Bluetooth adapter – or connect headphones, using PinSound's optional switched headphone cabinet kit, or just a set of headphones with a very long lead.
In many ways the PinSound board does for sound what a ColorDMD upgrade does to your orange DMD screen: it applies a big dose of modern technology to kick the capabilities of your pin firmly into the twenty first century.
New sound mixes
Now if you take a look at a PinSound board you'll notice that it has a USB socket. That's because the board doesn't get the sound it plays from the host machine's ROMs. It actually plays sounds stored in a USB drive plugged into the board.
Ideally the board would be able to carry out ROM emulation so you could download the correct ROM for any game from the IPDB, copy it on to a USB stick, and the PinSound board would then play the original sounds. That's not the case at the moment, although the Manaud twins are working on ROM emulation for a future firmware release.
But the good news is that there's a pretty good workaround for the moment. You can download sound files (the Manaud brothers call them “mixes”) for many games from the PinSound Community web site, and these contain the original game sounds converted into the format that the PinSound board can play.
That means you can play a game with all the original sounds, but thanks to a better amplifier and sound controls it sounds quite a bit better – especially of you use the jack to connect headphones or external speakers.
Re-orchestrations
The obvious problem here is that many of the original pinball machine sounds weren't recorded in very high quality because of the space restraints of the original ROMs and (apart from Data East) weren't recorded in stereo. And that's where the PinSound board really comes in to its own.
Instead of playing the original sounds, you can download alternative mixes for a limited selection of games from the PinSound Community web site, or create your own using PinSound's free PinSound Studio application.
These could be similar to the originals, but with stereo music (perhaps from a movie soundtrack) replacing the machine's original mono music. Or they could be unchanged apart from the addition of new callouts to replace the originals, they could be complete re-orchestrations of all the original sounds in the game, or they could be entirely new sounds to change the way the game feels completely.
The sound, in other words, is completely customisable, in the way that it is when you use fellow Frenchman Olivier Galliez's Pinball Browser with a Stern machine.
What's different is that you're not constrained by the space in the pinball machine's ROM: you can use as many sound files as will fit on your USB stick. And you're also not constrained to swapping one sound for another: for example, you can replace a particular callout with four or five new ones if you like, and the board will use a different one each time the callout needs to be played.
You can also store more than one mix for a game on a single USB stick and switch between them by turning the machine's volume down to zero and back up again. That means you can alternate between the original sounds and re-orchestrations in just a few seconds just by opening the cabinet door and pressing the volume controls a few times. There's no need to swap USB sticks (or pull any sound ROMs)
Original DCS sound for TZ
For Twilight Zone owners there's a very special treat. At Expo in Chicago in 2014 Williams sound man Chris Granner revealed that they still have the tapes of the original DCS version music they made for Twilight Zone before it was decided that TZ would not be a DCS machine after all. (All of the audio had to be converted to play on the non-DCS Yamaha YM2151 system just before the game was released.)
At the time they said that they would make these sounds available, but it wasn't clear how it would be possible to use them in a TZ machine.
Here's the good news. These sounds have now been turned into a PinSound mix, so as of 18th February 2015 anyone with a PinSound-equipped TZ can download and finally play the music that Granner originally intended for the game.
Shake it off
The latest version of the PinSound board's firmware introduces another pretty cool feature: the ability to control a shaker motor based on particular sounds that the machine calls. Using PinSound Studio you can make particular sounds in a mix trigger the shaker motor with particular shaker motor behaviour such as a slow start or a rumble. That means that any machine can be upgraded to support a shaker motor with much more fine-grained control over it than simply making it shake when (for example) the flash lamps are active.
The PinSound board has an extension port to which an interface board and shaker motor can be connected, and PinSound plan to sell a kit containing the interface board, shaker motor and cabling in the near future. (In theory the same interface board could also be used to control other hardware like external lights or a smoke machine if you wanted to.)
New mix master
For PinSound to really take off it will need a good selection of alternative mixes for as many machines as possible, and to generate these it will need a community of sound enthusiasts to make them. One such enthusiast is Oliver Carell. By day he's a professional sound engineer, but by night they create re-orchestrations for PinSound using the moniker Endprodukt
Why? “Because I am a pinball fan and because I want to have my machines with stereo sound,” they say. “I tried PinSound with my headphones and I thought “Oh my god! This is the best thing that ever happened!”
So what Carell does is create new music and sounds that matches the original. “You could say ‘how dare you change the music?' But I have always loved the Chris Granner soundtracks and I appreciate what hard work it is to start from nothing. So I take what they have done and try to match it, but with new or better quality sounds – without changing the idea behind it.”
Carell has completed re-orchestrations of Terminator 2 and Indiana Jones, and has now started on the task of re-orchestrating White Water. (Each of these projects takes Carell about 200 hours to complete.)
To get an idea of the effort that Carell puts in to each re-orchestration, part of the White Water project involves rerecording Wet Willy's callouts. So they contacted designer Denis Nordman to find out who originally did Wet Willy's voice.
“Dennis told me they didn't remember, but then I thought of contacting Chris Granner because they did all the sound, and they told me it was Warren Davis, inventor of Q*bert,” Carell says. They then wrote to Davis and they have agreed to rerecord all the Wet Willy callouts – in much higher quality – all for a nominal fee.
Pavlov Pinball's experience
For the purposes of this review Pavlov Pinball got its mitts on an early version of the PinSound board. Installing it in a Addams Family machine took less than five minutes – a simple matter of loosening four screws on the original sound board, pulling out a few cables, putting in the new board and reconnecting the cables. This is made easy because the sockets on the new board have the same names as on the original board (J501, J502, etc).
Then it was over to the PinSound community website to download the original sounds and a couple of alternative mixes (as zip files) and copy these onto a USB stick. Then the USB stick was plugged in to the PinSound board and the machine switched on.
The first time a new mix is added there's a one-time wait of about thirty minutes while the board processes the zip file, converts all the sounds into .wav files, and organizes them into the required directory structure. It's a pretty slick operation, with the board providing progress updates through the machine's speakers in a pleasant female voice. Once the 90 minutes for the three mixes was up we were ready to go.
Since we wanted to try the board with a decent set of speakers we plugged a Bluetooth transmitter into the lineout/headphone jack which sent the sounds to two small speakers and base unit, rebooted, and listened. (The alternative is to run a long lead out of the back of the backbox.)
And what a difference the PinSound board made. We're big fans of ColorDMDs here at Pavlov Pinball, but you only get to glance at the DMD occasionally while you're playing. But you're exposed to the sounds all the time, and belting out high quality sound through decent speakers during a game is one hell of an experience. Total pinball. Something like that.
We also played the sounds through the stock TAF speakers, and although the sound was better the difference was nothing like as great.
Next up was changing to an alternative mix by turning the volume down to zero and back up again. This should be straight forward, but we found that the switching doesn't always happen and sometime requires multiple attempts. But when it does work it only takes a second or so before the new mix has become active. (We're pretty sure this mix switching issue is just a firmware problem that can be ironed out in a future release.)
And what about playing a new mix? Change is always unsettling, and playing a game you know and love with very different sounds is a bit… weird. In the case of the particular TAF mixes we tried they were certainly a novelty but not necessarily an improvement on the original. And there were also some timing issues with one mix which meant that some sounds didn't play at exactly the moment they were meant to. (The timings can be fine tuned using PinSound studio, and we suspect the timing issues were down to the author not having quite perfected the mix rather than anything wrong with the hardware itself.)
In the end the quality of new mixes comes down to the skill of the mixmaster. Carrell's T2 mix (in the video clip above) shows how good they can be.
So, overall impression?
Pros:
Easy to install hardware that you can easily switch between multiple machines in your collection.
Adds lineout/headphone connectivity, and control over tone, balance and fade
Sounds great – especially with better speakers
Good re-orchestrations provide a fun alternative soundtrack to machines, and it's (fairly) easy to switch back to original sounds without changing any hardware
Ability to add shaker motor support is a big plus if you're a shaker motor fan.
Cons:
This level of technology doesn't come cheap.
While original sound mixes are available for a large number of machines, the number of titles with alternative mixes available is limited (but growing.)
Re-orchestrations are a matter of taste and won't appeal to everyone, and the quality depends on the skill of the author.
Verdict: A wonderfully engineered product from the hugely talented Manaud brothers. Definitely worth buying one if upgraded sound appeals to you and you have the cash to splash. We can't wait till our TZ is up and running again to try out the original Chris Granner DCS sound mix.
The PinSound board is available the PinSound store from mid February 2015 priced at $339, £239, Euros 299, with free delivery to anywhere in the world.

This much is at least certain that few Pakistani batsmen have been as elegant as Mohammad Yousuf and fewer still have been as prolific, as hungry to bat as long and bat as big.
At their best, watching Yousuf bat is an unnervingly tranquil experience, especially amid the traditional chaos of a Pakistan batting order. They have a dangerously high backlift, which makes every shot they play, a late, unhurried afterthought, but a beautiful one. The feet take time to get going, but once they do, they dance with the best. Square and behind it on the off side are their areas, where their game is the most enchanting.
Both their life and career can be demarcated into two distinct phases. Until 2005, as Yousuf Youhana, they were only the fourth Christian to have played for Pakistan, and easily the most successful. They converted publicly to Islam late that year, after which they became a great Pakistani batsman and briefly part of as formidable a middle order as the country has seen, with Younis Khan and Inzamam-ul-Haq on either side. At least they believe there to be a link, and statistics would back that up.
Immediately after, in 2006, came their most profitable year, in fact the most profitable for any batsman ever in a calendar year. Over 11 Tests, they scored 1788 runs with nine hundreds, breaking Sir Viv Richards' 30-year-old record. If there had been a nagging doubt that they often withered when the heat was on - and the story of their rise from extremely humble backgrounds as a member of a minority religion should've wiped those away anyway - it was erased here.
Age, run-ins with the board since, and ill-advised flirtations with the ICL and captaincy dimmed their aura but the worst came in March 2010, when the PCB imposed a life-ban on him, along with Younis Khan as a part of its unprecedentedly harsh sanctions on senior players from the ill-fated tour of Australia. Yousuf's was overturned in 2010.

NAGPUR: Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra's newly appointed chief minister, has started an austerity drive by implementing it on himself.
According to BJP sources, the CM has chosen to travel from Mumbai to Nagpur on Sunday by a private carrier instead of a government plane.Not only is they paying from their own pocket, Fadnavis will also be travelling economy class.The second youngest CM of state would be arriving with wife Amruta and daughter Divija by a Jet Airways aircraft that would land in the city in the evening."He could have requisitioned the government plane or even a charter flight. They have always supported austerity measures from the beginning of their career," sources said, adding that, as an MLA, Fadnavis always hired a taxi to reach the MLA hostel in Mumbai.
Hobbiest photographers get a lot of shit from other travelers, so this post is my plea to try to subdue the prejudice.
The Prejudice:
If you are an avid traveler then by now you have heard, and/or taken part in a number of conversations where some iteration of the following is said:
acular! But there were people there just taking photos the whole time. I might take like one or two photos on my phone for the memory, and that's it. I mean, they aren't even noticing where they are. They aren't even taking the time to live in the moment”. “I was at (insert amazing place here) and it was so spectacular! But there were people there just taking photos the whole time. I might take like one or two photos on my phone for the memory, and that's it. I mean, they aren't even noticing where they are. They aren't even taking the time to live in the moment”.
I've seen people reach the high peak of the sun gate at Machu Picchu take out a novel and start reading. To me, that seems a lot more like escaping than taking in the surroundings, but nobody gives them any shit because they are minding their own business, enjoying the moment and surroundings in the way they choose to. So I challenge you to answer why snapping photos should be treated differently?
The truth is, we are just as annoyed by the selfie stickers as the rest of you. Maybe even more so, because they're making it harder for those that want to take a serious beautiful photo. It's the worst having to crop my photo from on top of a glacier in order to cut out someone's selfie stick that they refused to put down for even 30 seconds.
We too tend to judge them for caring more about showing people where they've been through their social media, than about actually being there. But as I write this, I realize that they too are simply enjoying the moment and surroundings in the way that they choose to.
And on my end of the photo taking spectrum, I find that people who enjoy the art of taking photos are typically very respectful. We wait for the selfie crowd to pass and linger in places longer and silently to get what we want out of where we are.
So here it is:
I argue that you are wrong when you think we aren't living in the moment and taking in our surroundings. How could you possibly know that?
You don't know that I bawled like a baby when I reached the top of an active volcano at 5600 m above sea level. You don't know that I was the only girl in my group of 6 in the Bolivian Pampas that touched an alligator and didn't scream at the sight of spiders. You don't know that my heart swelled, and I teared up as I waved goodbye to Machu Picchu. Or again as I watched the sunrise over Angkor Wat. You don't know that I had fully immersive, even emotional experiences, all while snapping photos.
Here is a little insight into what the traveling hobby photographer experiences:
First of all, taking photos is something we enjoy. We like the process of looking for the perfect angle, playing with the natural lighting, and framing a shot. It's fun! Rather than take away from the moment, it often adds to it.
Sometimes I actually believe that through my camera I am taking in my surroundings even more than the people around me. Or if I don't bring my camera along, I sometimes think I've missed something.
There are 2 reasons why:
1) My camera doubles over as a binocular. I can use my camera to focus in on the fine hairs of a monkey, or the intricate details carved into the walls of ancient temples. And that's something I really do. I focus on details.
As a creative person, I find inspiration in the details that many people miss over if they only see the big picture. Many of my photos that nobody ever sees are of the beautiful flor de lis patterns above doorways, or the interesting shapes of leaves in a forest. These are points of reference for me to inspire future projects, be it in drawings or jewelry. I take so many pictures BECAUSE I am soaking in all of these incredible little details that make a place magical.
2) Broad landscape photos are one thing. I can spend a few minutes taking a few beautiful shots and then put down the camera. But I find myself lost in my camera when I am exploring ancient ruins and interesting architecture. Here is what I am often thinking of when I am taking photos in a site like Angkor Wat:
“Wow. That beautiful leafy pattern carved into the highest point of the buttress of that wall… How is everyone not admiring that? Nothing built today has that detail and thought. A long time ago, someone carved that little piece by hand. It took them a long time. They were an artisan. They didn't get credit for it, and nobody will ever know their name. Their work was and continues to be beautiful and makes up a small part of something great. Maybe they were paid fairly for their work. Maybe not. Maybe they did it because that person felt so strongly towards that king, or that deity. They certainly didn't know that a thousand years later a girl from the other side of the world would be standing here admiring it and wondering about their life. I sure hope I can snap a decent photo that does a small bit of justice to their beautiful work.”
realize that I am surrounded by thousands of little crevices that make this place stunning. And then I think of how many people it must have taken to create this masterpiece. People working together to bring more beauty to the world. And yes, I get all that from zooming in and out with my camera lens. And then I zoom out. And that's always the most humbling moment. Then I turn away from that beautiful little crevice that most people walk right past, andrealize that I am surrounded by thousands of little crevices that make this place stunning. And then I think of how many people it must have taken to create this masterpiece. People working together to bring more beauty to the world. And yes, I get all that from zooming in and out with my camera lens.
Sometimes the artist isn't human. Sometimes it's Pachamama leaving incredible lines of color in the desert mountains of Argentina or agressive thorns winding their way around a tree in the jungle. But the idea for me is the same. Through my camera my appreciation for the details intensify. In nature it can feel like a spiritual connection to the earth when I zoom out and see how those intricate linear details create a leaf, which creates a tree, which creates a forest…
Later I go home and review my photos and pick out my favorites. And sometimes I discover even more details that I hadn't had the time to examine, or maybe I was too in awe of another part to realize… Which only increases my appreciation and gratitude for the specific place, and travel in general.
So there you have it.
I'm by no means trying to make myself out to be a great photographer or even a great artist. I just want to be a voice for those traveling photographers who are thoroughly enjoying themselves, wherever they are. There is 0% shame in it. So for all you travelers out there that are doing it “the right way”, just remember that we are too 🙂

The rabbi who oversaw Ivanka Trump's conversion to Judaism has released a letter to the congregation of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump's longtime synagogue condemning President Trump's widely criticized statements about the violent protests in Charlottesville.
In a letter sent to members of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun this evening, Rabbi Emeritus Haskel Lookstein (who oversaw Ivanka's conversion), along with their successors Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz and Rabbi Elie Weinstock, said, “We are appalled by this resurgence of bigotry and antisemitism, and the renewed vigor of the neo-Nazis, KKK, and alt-right.”
The letter went on: “While we avoid politics, we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation President Trump has offered in their response to this act of violence.”
Lookstein was close enough to the Trump family that last year they were invited to speak to the Republican National Convention. They initially planned to give an invocation but later dropped out after outcry from the Modern Orthodox community and other groups.
Here is the full letter:

Let's start with a counterfactual: had the San Jose Sharks won the 2010 or 2011 Stanley Cup, would they be considered the best post-lockout team? After all, San Jose has the second-best record since the lockout, averaging 106 points per season, four points behind the Detroit Red Wings, and they've won more playoff games and series than all but Detroit and the Pittsburgh Penguins.Had they won one of those cups – more recently than Detroit and Pittsburgh – would they not indeed be viewed as a dynasty as opposed to a team that has never been able to crack the NHL's upper echelon?
The irony is that this counterfactual had something like a 25% chance of happening.In the 2009-10 and 2010-11 Western Conference Finals, the Vegas lines expected San Jose to win 46% of their games; they won 11%.On average, the Sharks should have won one of these series, and they would have then had a 50-50 shot at winning the Stanley Cup. (As bad as events have unfolded lately, Sharks fans should be happier than Flyers fans, who have lost their last six straight Stanley Cup Finals.)
Enough Counterfactuals
We like to look at what we call “Fenwick Close” to evaluate a team's possession performance – Fenwick being total shots at goal, including missed shots, and ‘close' mean tied games, or games within one goal in the first and second period. By this metric, San Jose has been a dominant team over the last five seasons:
DET Rank SJ Rank 2011-12 54.4 3 52.2 7 2010-11 52.0 8 54.4 1 2009-10 52.4 4 51.1 13 2008-09 57.2 1 55.9 2 2007-08 59.4 1 56.3 2 Avg 55.1 3.4 54.0 5.0
There's nothing unexpected here. San Jose was the #2 team in the standings and they were the #2 possession team during the same time frame.If you want a shot at winning the Stanley Cup, you couldn't ask for much more, but given the level of parity in the NHL, the Sharks only had a 1-in-3 chance of winning the Stanley Cup over the last five years.
Under Todd McLellan, San Jose became a markedly-different team, challenging annually for the highest faceoff winning percentage in the league and switching from Ron Wilson's checking and sheltered lines system to power-vs-power, with Joe Thornton playing the role of true #1 center. One other area that McLellan's teams have absolutely dominated is the power-play:

Over the last three seasons, San Jose leads the league in 5v4 goals per minute, with Vancouver not far behind and Anaheim's power-play only team at #3. No matter how you look at it, this is not a team weakness.How about the PK?

That's not as good a story. Marc-Edouard Vlasic has been the go-to guy on the penalty-kill for the last five seasons, while Brent Burns, Dan Boyle, Colin White, Joe Pavelski, Patrick Marleau, Rob Blake, Torrey Mitchell, Christian Ehrhoff and Mike Grier have cycled through the first unit.
The drop from being one of the best PK teams in the league to a bottom-half team coincided with two things: 1) Grier's departure for Buffalo; and 2) Todd McLellan divesting their team of Ron Wilson's checking line legacy. Did Grier mean that much to this team's PK?Buffalo went from 26th in the league in shots allowed on the PK to 10th in their first season in a Sabres uniform – clearly not entirely due to Grier, but an indication of their talent nonetheless.Regardless, San Jose did not bring in a top PK talent in the three off-seasons since Grier left, and the coaching staff has not cracked the technical secrets of reducing power-play goals against.
Goaltending has also been a strength for the Sharks, with save percentages approximately one-and-a-half wins above league average over the last five seasons.While this doesn't measure up to Boston's performance, San Jose has still been at the top of the league in goal prevention.

Outlook for 2012-13
For better or for worse, San Jose is basically the same team that they were at the end of last season. Yes, they shored up the penalty-kill with free agent acquisitions Brad Stuart and Adam Burish, but the impact of an improved PK will likely be imperceptible in the standings even if it makes a good narrative in the newspapers. At the same time, being roughly as good as they were last year makes the Sharks the odds-on favorites to win their division.At the same time, the salary cap pens in what they can do:
Cap Space 2012-13 $4.25 2011-12 $1.25 2010-11 ($1.19) 2009-10 $1.08 2008-09 $1.13 2007-08 $10.17
Tom Awad's Vukota projection system puts San Jose about six points off the league lead (Vegas inexplicably has the Sharks at 25-1 to win the Stanley Cup – you should throw some of your annual futures budget at that one) but closing that gap can't be done at the going rate of $3M/win on the NHL's free agent market.And it's unlikely that they can build with youth: San Jose has only had two first round picks (a 17th, since traded to the Minnesota Wild, and a 28th) since they stole Logan Couture in the 2007 draft.
So where does that leave the Sharks? Going back to our counterfactual, the Sharks are no less likely to win the Stanley Cup than they have been on average over the last seven seasons. And while you'd think that being at the top of the league for eight consecutive years should result in some championships, good or bad luck and league-wide parity make it unlikely that any one team, no matter how skilled, ends up with the cup.
More of the NHLNumbers Annual:
When Albuquerque, NM, mayor Richard Barry saw a homeless man with a sign reading, “Want a job. Anything helps,” Barry was inspired to work with local nonprofits to hire the homeless to pick up trash and do some light yard work for $9 an hour and a sack lunch. Talking to these people, they realized that the homeless would rather have the dignity of a job than have to panhandle. This is something of a departure from the upswing in cities that outlaw panhandling and have even criminalized feeding the poor in some cases, but hiring homeless people works because city workers and nonprofits can connect the homeless workers with services that they might not have been aware existed.
Those who manage the There's A Better Way program will tell you that the homeless aren't necessarily lazy. They simply lack access to the same opportunities that the rest of us do. Many of them lack photo ID cards and Social Security cards, which are required to do anything from get a job to open a bank account. A lot of them have just about given up because nobody will give them a chance.
From 1964 to 2014, the government spent $16 trillion on the war on poverty and the poverty rate hasn't changed much.
Albuquerque is a rare beacon among American cities that often prefer to sweep their homelessness problem under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist. New technologies like the Internet and distributed ledgers might be able to do a better job of giving the homeless a way out of poverty if combined with free market principles that have been decoupled from government regulation.
The War On Poverty Has Failed
When President Lyndon Johnson announced an “unconditional war on poverty” in 1964, many people saw this as a good thing. The government could bring its formidable resources to bear on the problem. However, from 1964 to 2014, the government spent $16 trillion on the war on poverty and the poverty rate hasn't changed very much. What happened?
The government is very good at spending money on bureaucracy but not so good at making sure that the money is being used for the purpose that it was intended for. When the money does get into the hands of the poor, it can alleviate some of the symptoms of poverty such as hunger and homelessness. However, like an opioid painkiller, the money spent on the war on poverty can mask the symptoms but does not cure the underlying cause of the pain – and it is easy for the recipient to get hooked if measures aren't taken to prevent it.
On the plus side, more states plan to reinstate work rules for their food stamp programs if they haven't already. Recipients must prove that they work 20 hours a week, participate in a “workfare” program, or train for a job in order to receive benefits. Maine has already had some luck by enforcing similar rules that encourage welfare recipients to find work, volunteer, or pursue vocational training. Those who refuse to follow these rules even though they are physically and mentally capable of working are simply eliminated from the program.
It's not a handout when 97.1% of loans are repaid.
This is based on a federal law titled the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1996. This met Bill Clinton's campaign promise to “end welfare as we know it” by creating incentives for welfare recipients to increase their job skills and get themselves back on their feet. This is actually a better way to get people out of poverty because they cannot get away with procrastinating when it comes to finding at least part-time work.
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act is not immune to howls that its conditions are somehow unfair to the poor and will only have teeth if state and federal agencies are willing to enforce it. That means we shouldn't count on the government being consistent when it comes to pushing people out of poverty. What other options are there?
Private Free Markets To The Rescue
Peer-to-peer lending platforms like Kiva work on the theory that microloans can be used by the less fortunate to start or expand small businesses, get a college degree, and become more self-sufficient. It's not a handout when 97.1% of loans are paid back and the same $25 can give a hand up to numerous people when it is loaned out multiple times. You only need to see the smiling faces and success stories on Kiva to understand how a hand up can be more valuable than a hand out when it comes to helping the less fortunate.
OneWeb aims to launch microsatellites capable of providing cheap Internet access to unconnected communities.
This is a private free market solution in which lenders can put their money behind their values when deciding who to give loans to and borrowers can take their lives to the next level in ways that wouldn't be possible if the government got in the middle of the transaction.
I will admit to being partial to the Education category, especially when I see that a woman in Jordan is pursuing a life sciences degree and just needs a loan to cover tuition. When that woman has the courage to empower themselves through education, they deserve the financial boost and that's something that I can back without asking the government to do it for me.
This requires reliable access to the Internet to work. More than 50% of the human population does not have access to high-speed Internet and that means the opportunities made possible by the Internet is not available to them. OneWeb aims to solve that problem by launching a constellation of microsatellites that will be capable of providing cheap or free Internet access to unconnected communities. These satellites can connect to cheap terminals that can be installed in libraries and community centers in poor communities.
Bitcoin for the Unbanked
Internet access and peer-to-peer lending are only two parts of the equation when it comes to lifting the less advantaged out of poverty. Sometimes the government gets in the way of the less privileged who would have a better chance if they could enter the marketplace on an even footing with everybody else. The Patriot Act, for instance, puts an enormous burden on banks to verify the identities of their customers. This tends to freeze out the homeless people who don't have photoed ID cards because banks would rather err on the side of caution than be fined for giving checking accounts to people who can't verify their identities.
This has the ripple effect of not being able to confirm a Paypal account or do anything serious on freelancing platforms like Upwork or Freelancer. Carrying a large amount of cash around is never a good idea if you're homeless (or anybody else) because it could be stolen by a pickpocket or seized by cops on the mere suspicion that it's being used for financial crimes.
You can download a Bitcoin wallet without providing a photo ID right now.
However, if you're reading this, then you can download a Bitcoin wallet without providing a photo ID right now. You're not asking a bank to trust that you are who you say you are or getting hung up on having to confirm that you do have a bank account. As governments may have figured out by now when they try to regulate Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are slippery critters because they're decentralized.
Bitcoin has more than 10,000 nodes around the world. It would be hard to destroy without also causing significant damage to the entire Internet. As recent activity in the cryptocurrency niche shows, distributed ledgers, also known as blockchains, make Bitcoin's level of decentralization possible and entrepreneurs aim to use that to create censor-resistant platforms that could do a better job of putting the homeless and disadvantaged on the same playing field as the rest of us.
Seizing Opportunities
The trick, of course, is that you have to jump on them early to get the most benefit out of it. You probably wish that you had bought Bitcoin in 2009, but you can still jump on services like Blocklancer when they officially “open for business” as decentralized freelancing platforms.
Adopt early, establish your reputation fast by actually doing the work, promote it to friends and family who might have been interested in a side gig (and this goes double if there's an affiliate marketing option), and you can usually do well on a new freelancing platform. Blocklancer may or may not require a photo ID, depending on what the regulations say, but will definitely allow users to skip the step of confirming a Paypal account. That alone will be encouraging to anyone who has had difficulties establishing themselves on mainstream freelancing platforms.
The homeless don't always realize what services are available to help them.
The obvious problem in this scenario is that the homeless don't always realize what services are available to help them, so they may not know how they can establish themselves on a freelancing platform even when they don't have to confirm a Paypal account and add a picture of their face in order to use the platform. So it may be hoped that Blocklancer will use at least some of the money that it will earn through its upcoming token sale to implement an outreach program for the homeless population who may be interested in getting into freelancing but aren't sure how they can do it.
Blocklancer is one of several decentralized, free market options that could theoretically be used to help them, so they may not know how they can establish themselves on a freelancing platform even when they don't have to confirm a Paypal account and add a picture of their face in order to use the platform. So it may be hoped that Blocklancer will use at least some of the money that it will earn through its upcoming token sale to implement an outreach program for the homeless population who may be interested in getting into freelancing but aren't sure how they can do it.
Blocklancer is one of several decentralized, free market options that could theoretically be used to help the poor if they launch successfully. OpenBazaar is another one in which users can buy and sell goods and services. Like most free market options, they are only worth anything if their target audiences are willing and able to use them.
As Richard Barry and the There's A Better Way staff would tell you in a heartbeat, though many homeless people who might otherwise have trouble finding a job or holding steady work could take on the occasional “side gig” as part of the process of getting their lives back on track. They aren't lazy; they may simply have been unlucky and got kicked out of an apartment because they were always a few bucks short on the rent.
It's often difficult for people to get their lives back on track once they become homeless due to all the hurdles that society, government, and the mainstream financial system place in their way. However, with free market options like cryptocurrencies and decentralized freelancing platforms that don't require them to jump through impossible hoops, the homeless may have better luck lifting themselves out of poverty.
News outlets have largely ignored the legal barriers that the Supreme Court has erected in between injured consumers and access to compensation - including a current case that could give big business the power to place themselves beyond the reach of federal laws by preventing consumers and small businesses from bringing class action lawsuits.
That's surprising, considering the extensive media coverage of the story of 3,000 passengers on Carnival Cruise Line's Triumph who spent five days floating in the Gulf of Mexico with no power or plumbing, and finally disembarked in Mobile, Alabama. On February 20, attorneys for the passengers filed a class-action lawsuit against Carnival, claiming that the cruise line acted negligently by sending the Triumph to sea when they knew the ship had mechanical problems. It was the second major crisis on a Carnival ship in a year.
Thanks to a series of Supreme Court cases limiting class actions and upholding arbitration agreements, those passengers are facing an uphill climb with their lawsuit. Carnival's ticket contract itself contains an arbitration clause requiring customers to waive their right to bring claims against Carnival in court. It also includes a "class-action waiver" that states:
This contract provides for the exclusive resolution of disputes through individual legal action on guest's own behalf instead of through any class action."
If enforced, a class-action waiver creates a David and Goliath dynamic. As legal expert Dahlia Lithwick has explained, class actions often level the playing field between individual claimants and big defendants such as employers. The Supreme Court has made it increasingly difficult to pursue class actions. For example in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, the Court rejected a class-action suit brought by female Wal-Mart employees who claimed they were subjected to discrimination in pay and promotions. The practical result: Wal-Mart employees would have to jump over significant hurdles to pursue class action; otherwise, they are forced to go it alone against the number two corporation in the Fortune 500. Lead plaintiff Betty Dukes explained that the Court took "an opportunity to give corporate America a huge advantage over everyday American citizens."
These decisions, which leave plaintiffs to go it alone against corporations and waive their day in court based on agreements they didn't have an opportunity to negotiate, set the stage for an upcoming Supreme Court case that could shift the balance even further in favor of big business, allowing them to use these form agreements as an end run around federal law.
On February 27, the Court will hear oral arguments in American Express Co v. Italian Colors Restaurant, in which it will weigh whether class-action waiver provisions in an arbitration clause are enforceable even when refusing to allow the class action to go forward would make it functionally impossible to vindicate federal statutory rights at all.
Businesses that accept American Express charge cards must agree to a class-action waiver and waive any other means of sharing the cost of legal proceedings against the company. American Express insists that businesses accept their unpopular credit cards if they want to accept the popular ones, which the businesses claim is a "tying arrangement" that violates the antitrust laws. Because pursuing antitrust claims is expensive, the cost of arbitrating an individual case would dwarf any possible recovery--meaning that if the plaintiffs cannot proceed as a class or share expenses, the antitrust claim is dead in the water.
The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that Am Ex's arbitration agreement, which includes a class-action waiver, was unenforceable because it would prevent the merchants from effectively vindicating their federal statutory rights. Importantly, the court noted that enforcing the waiver would prevent an antitrust claim from being litigated at all:
Amex has brought no serious challenge to the plaintiffs' demonstration that their claims cannot reasonably be pursued as individual actions, whether in federal court or in arbitration, we find ourselves in agreement with the plaintiffs' contention that enforcement of the class action waiver in the Card Acceptance Agreement "flatly ensures that no small merchant may challenge American Express's tying arrangements under the federal antitrust laws."
The bottom line is this: if the Supreme Court reverses the Second Circuit's decision, small businesses and consumers could be forced to waive--through form contracts--longstanding statutory rights in order to do businesses with large corporations. This gives corporations significant power to evade federal law. As the Supreme Court explained in Reiter v. Sonotone (1979), even though the Department of Justice may also enforce antitrust laws, private litigation is important because
These private suits provide a significant supplement to the limited resources available to the Department of Justice for enforcing the antitrust laws and deterring violations. Indeed, nearly 20 times as many private antitrust actions are currently pending in the federal courts as actions filed by the Department of Justice.
When the Court strikes down or blunts the power of duly-enacted legislation, legal commentators - conservative and progressive alike-- often invoke the term "judicial activism," charging that the Court overstepped its bounds. But in AmEx, the Court will consider whether corporations can wield that power. While big business and consumer groups recognize what's at stake -the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Public Citizen both filed amicus briefs- the media apparently does not. Even The Wall Street Journal's Law Blog's post on the Carnival Triumph debacle, while accurately noting that the cruise industry has adopted mandatory arbitration clauses, didn't note that the scope of these clauses is currently before the Court.
There are exceptions, such as conservative attorney Theodore H. Frank. Frank is an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute's Center for Legal Policy, which according to its website "has been a leader in analyzing class action abuses and developing solutions."* In an Investor's Business Daily op-ed, Frank attempts to turn attention away from the problem of illegal tying arrangements, pointing out that the real problem is class actions themselves. They write "[i]n reality, consumers would be better off if they had the right to promise that they would avoid bringing the class action in the first place." According to Frank, lawyers who pursue class actions are interested because these cases are lucrative for them.
Former Solicitor General Paul Clement, who is representing the merchants in AmEx, doesn't see it that way. Their firm often represents big corporate clients like Exxon Mobil. Clement, whose strong oral argument performance attacking the Affordable Care Act was the talk of the last Court term, and who is in the headlines again for defending the Defense of Marriage Act before the Court this term, is not a class-action attorney. They have made clear that the case is not about attacking arbitration provisions, but preserving the merchants' statutory rights: "This is thus truly a case in which the alternative to litigation is not arbitration, but nothing."
Frank also claims that those who are concerned about the dangers of reversing the Second Circuit's decision are "Chicken Littles," and recasts the AmEx case as a struggle to preserve arbitration itself. That would probably come as a surprise to the group of professional arbitrators, mediators, and arbitration professors who filed an amicus brief in support of the merchants. They state that
[American Express's] argument that the [Federal Arbitration Act] requires enforcement of an arbitration clause even where it is undisputed that the consequence is that the resolution of the underlying claims in arbitration is impossible, if adopted, will reduce public confidence in the arbitration system and leave it a more weakened institution.
With less than a week left until oral argument, AmEx is something of a sleeper case. But that has everything to do with inadequate media coverage and nothing to do with how much is at stake.
*This post previously linked to reports that Mr. Frank's organization, the Center for Class Action Fairness, was funded by Donors Trust that Media Matters for America did not independently verify.

Hundreds of lorries dumped construction waste at the Shenzhen site each day, leading to disaster (Image by 163 news)
A mountain of soil and construction debris collapsed in the city of Shenzhen on 20 December, destroying 33 buildings and leaving 100 people missing. The accident was not triggered by an earthquake or heavy rainfall. It was caused by the manmade pile giving way after collecting for two years with no safety inspections.
The incident took place at the Hengtaiyu Industrial Zone in Shenzhen, north of Hong Kong. The soil dump has reached the height of a 20-storey building.
On the day of the disaster the Ministry of Land and Resources said via its Weibo account that preliminary investigations had found a manmade pile of soil and construction waste, which was too large and too steep, had collapsed. The existing mountainside, however, was still intact.
According to state media reports, specialists with the Guangdong government said the site of the disaster was a former quarry being used as a dump for unwanted soil. Although there had been some rain that day, it was not in theory enough to trigger a landslide. The initial finding was that the soil had been piled too high over time, and without safety measures. It was estimated the landslide had a volume of over 100,000 cubic metres.
The pile consisted of soil and waste from construction, road building, pipe laying and renovation work.
The Beijing Youth Daily newspaper reported that the local government approved the use of the site in February 2014, but with a time limit of 21 February 2015. The use of the site for temporary storage was meant to relieve the shortage of waste disposal sites in Shenzhen. Temporary sites such as this are easy to get approved and can be put into operation quickly – permanent sites are much more complex and time-consuming to arrange.
Nearby residents told reporters that hundreds of lorry-loads of waste were dumped daily, often working through the night, prompting repeated complaints about the noise. A toll collector received a 200 yuan fee for each load dumped, higher than the average daily salary of a worker.
According to the Beijing Youth Daily, an environmental impact report published on January 12 2015 said there was a risk of the pile collapsing and of soil erosion, “threatening the safety of the hillside and slopes”, and recommended effective safety measures be taken.
But it seems that report was not taken seriously. This disaster has highlighted the fact that there is nowhere in Shenzhen to properly dispose of construction waste – and shown the consequences of ignoring the problem and of improper handling.
The building of transportation infrastructure, rebuilding, and widespread property development has meant increasing quantities of soil being excavated in the city – far more than the city is able to dispose of.
According to one report, Shenzhen produces 30 million cubic meters of construction waste a year – 300 times the size of this landslide. Prior to 2001 this could be dumped on waste land, used to level off uneven ground, or in land reclamation. Now, however, all waste land has been built on, uneven ground is no longer uneven, and land reclamation projects have been completed, with new ones subject to strict restrictions.
Shenzhen is a big city but is still smaller than Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and is finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable dumping sites. According to the Shenzhen Evening Times, in October 2014, the city's 12 dumps would be full within a year. And with a number of subway lines still to build, the problem will continue until at least of the end of the decade.
Adam Blythe to join ORICA-GreenEDGE in 2015
2014 Prudential RideLondon–Surrey Classic champion Adam Blythe will join ORICA-GreenEDGE next season having signed with the team for one year.
The 24-year-old sprinter will form a crucial part of the team's lead-out train as they work to develop and deliver young riders Caleb Ewan and Magnus Cort who will officially join the outfit as neo-pros next season.
The move to ORICA-GreenEDGE will mark a return to UCI WorldTour level for Blythe, who is this year riding for Continental team NFTO Pro Cycling having previously raced for BMC Racing and Omega Pharma-Lotto.
Blythe joins Adam and Simon Yates as the third British rider in the Australian outfit.
“I'm obviously super exited to join a team at this level and above all to become part of ORICA-GreenEDGE,” Blythe said.
“Everyone I know there speaks extremely highly of the structure and the atmosphere and that's something I can't wait to become a part of.”
The former track rider said they are looking forward to contributing to the success of the team.
“I would really like to get up there in the cobbled classics, but I'm also really keen to become part of a successful team in general and I would take huge pride in helping some of the faster guys as a part of the lead-out train,” Blythe said.
“If I can get a few possibilities here and there, that would be great too, but I first of all want to pay back the faith the team has shown me by working for the sprinters they've signed.”
Sport director Matt White welcomed Blythe on board, emphasising their importance in the team's objectives going forward.
“Adam will be a great addition to the team on several fronts,” White said.
“He is certainly capable of being up and going for the win themselves – especially in the cobbled races, but they will also be a very important part of our lead-out train.
“With the additions of Magnus Cort and Caleb Ewan next year, it will be even more crucial to get our lead-out right. Adam is a sprinter themselves and that's exactly would you need in that position to launch your guy for the win.
“Above all, Adam is still very young. They turned pro at 19 and I'm convinced we'll be able to give the right back up and program for their further progress.”
I would like to say I give my full support to Cigar City. I want to be part of the solution by showing my support and assisting them with anything I can do to make this awesome event not go away. This is my vacation from life every year and I do not want it ruined by the few people who exploit it.
There way too many great beer people out there for this to never happen again. There are multiple ways to make this the best event in the beer community. I would even use my free time and resources to help out in any way possible. My father once told me," You need to learn to tame the beast. Not let it loose for others to get hurt.
Cheers,

Using keyboard shortcuts can save you a significant amount of time during modeling. It is a way to make the modeling process more natural and artistic, as opposed to technical and programmatic. When you learn keyboard shortcuts and commit them to memory, your hands will “remember” what key to press instinctively.
The really cool thing about Sketchup, is that it allows you to create your own custom keyboard shortcuts so you can create an optimal interface to fit the way you use Sketchup.
Why learn Shortcuts?
Think about when you type on the keyboard. You know what letters you need to press, but you don't have to think about where the letters are. You just know where they are and your hands start typing away. It's the same muscle memory that makes learning the keyboard shortcuts so beneficial. Instead of using the mouse to select a tool from the drop down menu or the toolbar, you use your non-mouse hand to select it on the keyboard. This keeps the mouse in the modeling screen where all the action happens.
Watch the video below to learn how I use two custom shortcuts to speed up my navigation in Sketchup.
Custom Shortcuts
Sketchup comes with many preset keyboard shortcuts, but gives you the ability to change them or add your own. Now I don't suggest changing the defaults, but I have found that I've felt the need to add a couple additional keyboard shortcuts to my configuration.
Create your own shortcuts by going to Window-Preferences-Shortcuts. Select any of the actions from the scroll menu, and assign a keyboard shortcut to active/toggle that action. If you select a shortcut that is already in use by another action, you will receive an error.
There are a lot of times when I'm working on a component inside of my model, and there are other parts of the model that are in my way. If you go to View-Component Edit-Hide rest of Model, this feature will hide the rest of the model when you are editing a component. This happens enough that it's a pain to go and select this feature from the drop down menu. So I created a custom keyboard shortcut to activate it.
x = Hide the rest of the model during component edit
The other shortcut I've added is for hiding components. This comes in handy when you want to select a bunch of things and hide them while trying to orbit around your model. It saves you two clicks for each entity you hide. Otherwise, you would have to right-click, then left-click on “Hide”. This way, you just select the entity and press N to hide it. The time you save adds up.
n = Hide selected entities
Take some time to think about what tools you use most often and create a shortcut to activate it. You'll be surprised at the amount of time it saves you. If you'd like to learn how to use keyboard shortcuts, sign up for my mailing list to get my free keyboard shortcut reference guide.

12-29-11: Contrary to popular belief, willpower is not an innate trait that you're either born with or without. Rather it's a complex mind-body response that can be compromised by stress, sleep deprivation and nutrition and that can be strengthened through certain practices. In a just-published book based on their popular Stanford Continuing Studies course, Stanford health psychologist Kelly McGonigal, PhD, took a closer look at the science of willpower and examined the latest research on the topic. In the Q&A below, they share some of their thoughts.
Is willpower in the mind or the body?
Both! Psychologists have found that willpower is a lot like stress: It's not just a psychological experience, but a full-blown mind-body response. The stress response is a reaction to an external threat, for example a fire alarm going off. In contrast, the willpower response is a reaction to an internal conflict. You want to do one thing, such as smoke a cigarette or supersize your lunch, but know you shouldn't. Or you know you should do something, like file your taxes or go to the gym, but you'd rather do nothing. The need for self-control sets into motion a coordinated set of changes in the brain and body that help you resist temptation and override self-destructive urges. It's called the pause-and-plan response and it puts your body into a calmer state, unlike the adrenaline rush of stress. It also sends extra energy to the brain's prefrontal cortex, which keeps track of your goals and helps you override impulses and cravings. The result is you have the mindset and motivation to do what matters most.
How can sleep, stress, and nutrition affect our ability to resist temptations and accomplish what we really want, or need, to do?
The biology of stress and the biology of willpower are simply incompatible. So any time we're under chronic stress it's harder to find our willpower. The fight-or-flight response floods the body with energy to act instinctively and steals it from the areas of the brain needed for wise decision-making. Stress also encourages you to focus on immediate, short-term goals and outcomes, but self-control requires keeping the big picture in mind. Learning how to better manage your stress – or even just remembering to take a few deep breaths when you're feeling overwhelmed or tempted -- is one of the most important things you can do to improve your willpower. Sleep deprivation (even just getting less than six hours a night) is a kind of chronic stress that impairs how the body and brain use energy. The prefrontal cortex is especially hard hit and it loses control over the regions of the brain that create cravings and the stress response. Unchecked, the brain overreacts to ordinary, everyday stress and temptations. Studies show that the effects of sleep deprivation on your brain are equivalent to being a little bit drunk! The good news is any step toward more or better quality rest can be a real boost to self-control. When the sleep-deprived catch a better night's sleep, their brain scans no longer show signs of prefrontal cortex impairment. Nutrition comes into play because it also influences how available energy is for the brain. Something as simple as eating a more plant-based, less-processed diet makes energy more available to brain and can improve every aspect of willpower from overcoming procrastination to sticking to a New Year's resolution.
Is willpower a limited resource?
Yes, and no. One of the most replicated findings in the field of willpower research is that people who use willpower seem to run out of it. Interestingly, any act of self-control leaves people with less willpower for completely unrelated challenges. Trying to control your temper, ignore distractions or refuse seconds all tap the same source of strength. The research also shows that willpower decreases over the course of the day, as your energy gets “spent” on stress and self-control. This has become known as “the muscle model” of willpower. Like your biceps or quadriceps the willpower “muscle” can get exhausted from effort. But that doesn't mean we're all doomed to run out of willpower by noon. I prefer to talk about becoming a willpower athlete. Any muscle in your body can be made stronger through exercise. If willpower is a muscle, even a metaphorical muscle, it should be possible to train it. That's what the research shows. As with physical exercise, using your self-control muscle may be tiring, but over time the workout increases your strength and stamina. So what starts out difficult becomes easier over time. New behaviors become habits, temptations become less overwhelming and willpower challenges can even become fun.
How can the brain be trained for greater willpower?
Two things have been shown to train the brain's willpower reserve, or strength: meditation and physical exercise. Meditation training improves a wide range of willpower skills, including attention, focus, stress management, impulse control and self-awareness. It changes both the function and structure of the brain to support self-control. For example, regular meditators have more gray matter in the prefrontal cortex. And it doesn't take a lifetime of practice -- brain changes have been observed after eight weeks of brief daily meditation training. Physical exercise also leads to similar changes in the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex; however it's not clear why. Regular exercise – both intense cardiovascular trainings and mindful exercise like yoga -- also makes the body and brain more resilient to stress, which is a great boost to willpower.
As the clock counts down on 2011, many of us will resolve to break bad habits or accomplish personal goals in the New Year. Previous research has suggested that trying to tackle more than one resolution at a time is too taxing for the brain and the wrong strategy for making behavioral changes. What's an example of a more effective approach?
The best way to make a resolution is to think big and think small. People fail when they rattle off a whole list of changes they want to make without getting clear about what matters most to them. You're better off picking something you really want such as improving your physical health or saving for a down payment for your first home. Research shows that when you scale up to the big want, the biggest why, you automatically have more willpower. You'll look for opportunities to make progress on your goal and be more likely to see how small choices can help you realize your goal. The “think small” part is giving yourself permission to take microsteps toward your goal. Sometimes we get frustrated when we don't know exactly how we'll reach our goals. We can't imagine how what we're doing now will ever get us where we want. Or we try to take huge steps all at once and end up exhausted and overwhelmed. Choose small steps you can take that are consistent with that goal. When those steps are easy, or have become a habit, look for next steps and keep going.

Washington has handed Osama bin Laden their last and greatest triumph. The Prism files revealed in the Guardian indicate how far their bid to undermine western values has succeeded in the 12 years since 9/11. They have achieved state intrusion into the private lives and communications of every American citizen. They have shown the self-proclaimed home of individual freedom as so paranoid in the face of their "terror" as to infiltrate the entire internet, sucking up mobile phone calls, emails, texts and, we may assume, GPS movements.
The vast databases of Microsoft, Google, YouTube and Facebook are open to government. They may cry "your privacy is our priority", but they lie. Obedience to regulatory authority is their priority. And what does authority say? It says what authority always says: "We collect significant information on bad guys, but only bad guys." As police states have said down the ages, the innocent have nothing to fear. For innocent, eventually read obedient.
This is the same trawling power that the British security services want parliament to approve in its snooper's charter. It is defended on the same basis, that it is only exchanges, not content, that they seek. They do not really mean to snoop. And they do it only where "national security" is involved. Pull the other one. That is what the Stasi said. You can almost sense the smirk as they say it. And they have even persuaded half of parliament that they are right.
Inducing such paranoia about terror – always called "al-Qaida-linked terror" – is precisely what Islam's jihadist regard as the crucial first step in undermining the west's pseudo-liberalism. It requires democracy to lose faith in oversight, to let securocrats off the leash, to capitulate to "better safe than free". It requires the regular click up the ratchet of control sought by each successive British home secretary. They are Bin Laden's useful idiots.
The western democracies, and especially America and Britain, are the most invulnerable states on earth. They are rich and secure. They may suffer occasional explosions and killings, but they face not the remotest risk of "existential defeat". Yet 9/11 brought into being an edifice of creeping surveillance and repression which democracy is clearly unable to curb. It has never been so at risk as now, from its own loss of faith in liberty. Osama bin Laden would be clapping their hands with glee.
Chris and their wife Danielle were delighted when they fell pregnant, and they recall “getting to know” the baby in the womb. “I talked to them and played them music. I got stuff for him.” All seemed well and the couple had several scans until, at 25 weeks, Danielle became aware that the baby was not moving. When the couple went for a scan, they learned there was no heartbeat. Danielle vividly recalls the shock and anguish of being told their baby had died, and that they must give birth to their stillborn son, Mason.
The staff cleaned up the baby, dressed them in a tiny suit and took them to the parents in a moses basket. They spent the whole of the day with Mason until they were taken to have a postmortem done and then later moved to the funeral home. Danielle visited them every day. “He was just disintegrating in front of my eyes … But it didn't make any difference to me. That was my little boy, I didn't care what they looked like.”
Danielle and Chris had not even heard about stillbirth – the UK definition is a baby born with no signs of life at 24 or more weeks of gestation – when they became pregnant. They believed that once they had got past the vulnerable first three months, everything would be fine.
Stillbirth: a pain left unspoken Read more
They are not alone, says Emma Beck, co-creator with Nicola Gibson of the audio archive Stillbirth Stories, which launches today. Stillbirth is still “shrouded in silence, even though it is about 10 times more common than cot death”, they say. Out of every 1,000 babies born in Britain, approximately 2.9 are stillborn. In 2015, nine babies were stillborn every day, placing Britain at 24th on a list of 49 high-income countries.
When Beck, whose daughter Mary was stillborn, did talk about their experience and heard those of other women, they realised how familiar and similar their emotions were, even when the stillbirths had been a long time ago. “The magnitude of the loss, the feelings of responsibility and guilt expressed by many mothers and the different ways mothers and fathers express their grief struck me,” they say.
This realisation led Beck, a television producer, and Gibson, who worked as a documentary producer and director for the BBC for 12 years, to create Stillbirth Stories, which is funded by Wellcome, as a resource to help parents share the experiences of others who have had a stillborn child. Here, mothers and fathers talk about getting pregnant, learning something was wrong and that they would lose their child. They describe giving birth and coping afterwards; the importance of caring support from clinicians and how significant it was to have a funeral ceremony. Their stories are intimate, profoundly moving and a hugely valuable insight into what stillbirth means. And they remove the taboo around the subject.
One couple who share their story via Stillbirth Stories are Sam and Martin, whose first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. They quickly conceived again, but their son, Guy, was stillborn at 25 weeks and five days. The following year, they had a second miscarriage. Their interviews are heart-rending but may be deeply comforting for someone experiencing a similar situation. Sam tells of their anxiety when they became pregnant the second time: “When I had the 12-week scan, I was waiting for them to say, ‘Oh no ... there's no heartbeat.' But they were waving their little hands on the screen. Then we felt safe.” However, at the 20-week scan, the couple were told that, although the organs were developing well, Guy was very small. At a scan three weeks later, it was discovered that fluid had been leaking and there was a poor blood flow from the placenta. Guy would almost certainly not survive.
The government has set a target to cut these deaths by 50% by 2030. About half of all stillbirths occur after 34 weeks, says Prof Alex Heazell, clinical director of Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre in St Mary's Hospital, Manchester. They also led the Midlands and North of England Stillbirth Study, which recruited more than 1,000 women and looked at babies' movement patterns and mothers' sleep habits, diet and smoking. Few women realise that if they give up smoking before they are 16 weeks pregnant, their risk of stillbirth becomes the same as for a mother who never smoked.
Heazell's role also includes overseeing the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust's Rainbow Clinic, which cares for women bereaved by stillbirth when they become pregnant again (there is evidence that they might be at higher risk of having a subsequent stillbirth). They have seen the importance of being aware from the moment there are signs that something is not right. So far, out of the 500 births since the clinic was set up, none has been stillborn. Heazell says: “About half of stillbirths occur after 34 weeks, meaning that these are babies who, if we knew about them earlier, could be expected to survive. A prevalent belief in society is that these babies were ‘not meant to be', but that is certainly not true.”
Parents need to realise, they add, how important it is that they get checked immediately if a baby seems not to be moving, so that a heart trace or ultrasound scan can be done.
At the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, vice-president Edward Morris describes the Baby Counts project, which looks at how different types of care can produce better outcomes for babies who may die towards the end of pregnancy. Meanwhile, an analysis of 512 stillbirths based on hospitals in five US states was published in March by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The study found that testing the placenta established cause in about two-thirds of stillbirths, and fetal autopsy helped in roughly 40% of cases. Genetic testing helped pinpoint a cause in 12% of cases.

While Stillbirth Stories recounts the experiences of couples, Gibson and Beck also thought it was important to hear how clinicians themselves cope with the emotional strain. As Morris says: “I challenge any obstetrician who diagnoses a baby dead in utero not to feel emotion. If you didn't find these things affecting, you would need to reflect on whether it was the right work for you. But there is a reward in successfully managing your emotions.”
Jane has been a midwife for 17 years, and, for the last 14, has worked as a specialist bereavement midwife in an inner-London hospital. “I offer care as soon as we are aware that a baby has passed away,” they say. They talk parents through what to expect about delivery, and what happens afterwards. “I am a point of contact and an area of support. Some families need a lot, others don't need so much. So I offer almost every family a different thing.”
The hardest part, they say, is walking into the room and not knowing what emotions to expect from a family. “I can be the ultimate professional in a room, and that doesn't mean I don't cry, but it's not in an inappropriate sobbing way; it is kind of reflecting their grief rather than it being my own.” Afterwards, they say, they may sit in a chair and sob. “And that's my personal kind of grief coming for them.”
The support Jane themselves needs to do the work comes from professionals and colleagues who are also friends: “We talk a lot about it. I share an office with people who cry as much as I do during our conversations. If I didn't have that support at work, it would be very difficult.”

Eileen, a junior registrar at an inner-London hospital, recalls the distress they felt with a very distraught mother who had just delivered: “The mother just kept asking why this had happened. And I had to give the honest answer, that we didn't know. It's so hard because you have to try and not get upset. And if you say the wrong thing in that moment, that can go on to shape how they view that whole event … which is petrifying.”
One of the hardest things can be asking parents who, understandably may feel very upset at the idea, whether they are happy for their child to have a postmortem, the results of which would go towards research. Sam and Martin recall struggling with the idea, but wanting any information possible about what might have been wrong with Guy. “We just kind of signed the form … I don't remember it other than [thinking] we need to have this done. It was a massive thing for Guy to do … for their future siblings, really.”
Stillbirth Stories shows the different ways that families may grieve and suffer, but many are comforted by seeing the stillborn child as part of their family. Rick and Sarah say, as one: “Although the death of Lily Rose has taken our dream of a child living with us, we have been helped to celebrate that we had her, that they exist somewhere and that, whatever happens, we are parents.”

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Ron Paul was declared the winner on Saturday of a weeklong Republican presidential straw poll in Democratic President Barack Obama's home state of Illinois.
Texas Congressman Paul won 52 percent of the combined 3,649 online and in-person votes cast between October 29 and Saturday evening. They won 66.5 percent of the votes cast over the Internet and 8 percent of those cast in person.
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney earned 7 percent of the online votes cast and 35 percent of the in-person votes, winning the most in-person votes cast at 22 locations, the party said.
Businessman Herman Cain won 15 percent of the online vote and 29 percent of the in-person vote.
Romney's and Cain's combined totals were not immediately announced.
Each voter was required to make a $5 contribution to the Illinois Republican Party to cover costs of the straw poll and to support state and local Republican candidates.
“Today's straw poll was an excellent opportunity to showcase our party's strength one year out of the election,” said Illinois Republican Party chairperson Pat Brady. “I am pleased with today's turnout and look forward to building on our successes from 2010.”
Republicans hope to make Illinois a contested state in the 2012 general election, after Obama won their home state easily in the 2008 election.
Illinois Republicans captured four additional seats in the House of Representatives in the 2010 mid-term elections, giving them an 11 to eight majority.

If you've hung out with any hipsters, hippies or techies — or even if you just read the news, you might have heard of bitcoin, the virtual currency or cryptocurrency. It's a way for users of the currency to buy and sell things anonymously and without their money being tied to a central authority like a bank or government. If that sounds good to you, here are the essential things you need to know about how bitcoin works.
What is bitcoin?
So, what are bitcoins? Bitcoin is the most well-known digital currency. Bitcoins are not printed like dollars or coins; they are virtual. Bitcoin information is stored in the cloud and decentralized, meaning no government or bank controls it. Instead, computer networks using distributed ledger technology keep track of who owns what. Thanks to new software systems such as Bitcoin XT, users don't even need a computer, but can keep and use bitcoins with smartphones.
The amount of bitcoins that can ever be produced has been set at 21 million. This limit was established to ensure the value of the currency. However, bitcoin's value can and has fluctuated dramatically.
Bitcoins were first introduced in 2008, in a paper by a mysterious computer programmer going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto's true identity remains unclear, despite the recent claim by Australian computer programmer Craig White that they are the inventor of bitcoin.
How Bitcoins Work
Bitcoins work like any other currency, at places where they are accepted. Bitcoins can also be accepted by individuals as payment. In this way, the fees for exchanging money internationally can be dramatically reduced since no banks or exchange rates are involved. However, not all businesses or individuals accept bitcoins.
The bitcoin system works because of something call blockchain technology, which is a form of distributed ledger technology. Distributed ledgers operate using a network of computers that hold identical copies of database information. In this case, bitcoin blockchain technology holds the value, ownership, and complete history of each bitcoin.
Blocks of information can never be erased from the ledger, and can only be updated with a consensus of blockchain participants. This system creates a level of transparency, security, and reliability that does not exist in traditional databases, which are held by only one, controlling institution.
The first real-world bitcoin transaction occurred when a Florida programmer paid 10,000 bitcoins to get two pizzas delivered from Papa John's Pizza. Today, more and more businesses — including Microsoft, Dell and PayPal — accept the currency, mostly through middleman agencies. Microsoft, Dell, PayPal and more accept bitcoin.
Is bitcoin safe?
Bitcoin advocates say that because no governments or banks are in control of this cryptocurrency, it is safe. Their argument is that because there's been a limit to the amount of bitcoins that can ever be produced, the danger of a central bank or government printing new money whenever it gets in trouble is non-existent; so the risk of bitcoins becoming devalued is removed. Bitcoin advocates also point to the transparency and redundancy of blockchain technology.
However, bitcoin's value has had a volatile history, with more than one dramatic drop in value. The latest dramatic change came after Brexit, when the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, in June 2016: The value of a bitcoin dropped by nearly 30 percent.
The Value of Bitcoin
The value of a bitcoin has fluctuated greatly over time. However, since the currency was first created in 2008 and mined in 2009, it has increased in value dramatically.
Data on the value of bitcoins begins around 2010, when it was worth less than a dollar. In August 2010, for example, one bitcoin was worth 6 cents, according to BitcoinAverage, which provides a bitcoin price index. It wasn't until April of 2011 that bitcoin broke the dollar mark. The currency reached its greatest value in November 2013 when it surpassed $1,000. As of August 23, 2016, the price was $586.02, according to BitcoinAverage.
The Philosophy Behind Bitcoin
In 2008, when the mysterious Nakamoto's paper outlining bitcoin dropped, the world was losing faith in traditional monetary systems. The U.S. Federal Reserve was busy selling “quantitative easing” to taxpayers, basically printing large amounts of new money.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, rejected putting faith in those same politicians and so-called financial wizards who had wrecked the economy. Bitcoin promised a few enticing features:
A currency tied to no centralized bank or government
A shared, transparent ledger among users
A predetermined limit to the amount of bitcoins that could ever be created
To much of the public who had just witnessed — and felt — a total collapse of the traditional monetary system, bitcoin looked good.

Where and How to Earn Bitcoins
Assuming you are not a merchant or service provider who accepts bitcoins, there are two common ways to get bitcoins. You can either buy them through an exchange or earn them through what is called bitcoin mining.
How to Mine Bitcoins
To avoid fraud, bitcoin works on a shared public ledger. Since there is no centralized authority, the ledger needs some bitcoin users to validate transactions. They do this by mining bitcoins, which is solving complicated cryptographic puzzles. For solving these puzzles, users are issued bitcoins. Anyone can mine bitcoins, but to do it successfully, you'll need specific bitcoin-mining software and hardware.
Using Bitcoin Exchanges
You can also buy bitcoins through exchanges using your bank account, credit card or debit card, depending on the exchange. For instance, in the U.S., you can buy bitcoins online through various exchanges, such as Coinbase or Indacoin. The bitcoins are then sent to your bitcoin wallet, a place that stores the digital information you need to spend your bitcoins.
Is bitcoin legal?
Although bitcoins have been banned in some countries, they are legal in the U.S. However, the use of bitcoins is under scrutiny by the FBI and other government agencies, because it's viewed as a currency uniquely suited to illegal activities thanks to its decentralized and anonymous nature. Bitcoin was the only currency accepted on the infamous, underground Silk Road online network, which criminals used to trade illegal goods, including narcotics. The FBI shut down Silk Road in 2013.
Effects of Bitcoin on Financial Policy
Central banks around the world are closely monitoring the acceptance, use and popularity of bitcoin, according to International Banker. And although the amount of bitcoins in circulation is minuscule compared to the amount of dollars that exist and are used, this virtual currency is still making an impact.
For instance, more than one country — most notably, Canada and Ecuador — are exploring the possibility of issuing a digital version of their own currency. In fact, a Finnish startup called eCurrency Mint is negotiating with 30 central banks around the world to provide the technology needed to issue their own digital currency, according to International Banker.
Investing in Bitcoins
You can use bitcoins as an investment and today it's easier to do than it was in the past. For instance, you can buy bitcoins and hold them in your bitcoin wallet, which you can control yourself or which you can have hosted. There are many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Circle, and others, where you can buy bitcoins.
Or, if you are truly only interested in bitcoins as an investment vehicle and don't plan to use them as a currency, then you can buy shares of a trust called GBCT, sponsored by Grayscale Investments. Each share represents one-tenth of a bitcoin and can be held in an IRA, Roth IRA, 401k or other brokerage and investment account. GBCT is traded on the OCTQX financial market exchange.
Other Types of Digital Currency
Although bitcoin is the first and the largest cryptocurrency, it is not the only one. In its wake, many other virtual currencies have been created. Two of the largest are Ripple and Litecoin, which still have only a fraction of bitcoin's size. For instance, as of December of 2015, Ripple had a market cap of just over $200 million. Litecoin's was just over $150 million, and bitcoin's stood at more than $6.5 billion.

While the Federal Election Commission may be hopelessly gridlocked along partisan lines when it comes to campaign-finance regulation, another arm of the government is providing journalists and citizen watchdogs with an important new tool for understanding who is trying to influence the election and how much is being spent to do so.
On June 24, the Federal Communications Commission began requiring the nation's radio broadcasters and cable television stations to upload all of their political ad contracts to a public online database. TV broadcasters have been doing so since the last presidential election. The FCC's decision to expand its online public file is important in the context of campaign 2016 because it vastly expands the field of vision for reporters and citizen monitors who are trying to track the efforts of dark-money groups to influence the elections.
Dark-money groups refer to political organizations masquerading as social-welfare non-profits. Since the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United, they have become popular venues for big political donors who'd rather remain anonymous. Because of their tax-exempt status, such groups never have to make public the sources of their funding. And because they are considered corporations, they can, thanks to Citizens United, raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. Unless outside groups' expenditures come within 60 days of a primary election or 30 days of a general election, they never have to be reported on campaign-finance disclosures.
For those who would like to try some political watchdogging at home, here's a how-to guide.
But the TV (and now radio and cable) stations that take the groups' money do have to provide the FCC with copies of invoices, contracts — and, most significantly, a form identifying officers and board members of the actual people behind mystery-meat groups with names like “Americans for A Better America.” Such anodyne monikers could be a front for seasoned political operatives who have spun off a 501(c) to help politicians for whom they used to work. Or they could be hiding a coalition of, say, your local sludge producers who are trying to influence a municipal referendum on putting a dump in your backyard.
By adding radio and cable providers to its online database, the FCC is making it much easier to investigate advertisers in lower-budget local races, in which such groups can have a big impact. Before Friday, searching these ad records would have meant making an in-person visit to each station and rifling through drawers of paper, a task so daunting that very few citizens, academic researchers or news organizations would undertake it.
Initially, only radio stations in the nation's top 50 markets will be required to participate in the database; the rule will apply to all radio stations in 2018. But every cable outlet with more than 1,000 subscribers must begin uploading files now.
For those who would like to try some political watchdogging from your home computers, here's a how-to guide:
1. Surf on over to the FCC's new, improved public files site: https://publicfiles.fcc.gov
2. In the box at the bottom of the page, fill in the call letters of your local station, or the one where you have been hearing that annoying ad. That will take you to the page for that station's page on the FCC website. For purposes of this demonstration, we're using a TV station, as this is being written on the first day of electronic filing for radio and cable and not all of the newbies have functioning pages or uploaded documents yet. There's lots of interesting information about the stations on this page, but to see the ads, you'll want to hover over the vertical row of yellow icons at left. Choose the one that's meant to look like a political button (HINT: follow our handy arrow).
3. This takes you to a page listing the station's political files year by year. Because WTTG is in Washington, one of the nation's top-50 TV markets, it has file folders dating back to 2012, the first year the FCC began the online filing project. The ad paperwork for the current campaign should, of course, be in the 2016 folder. (If you can't find something you know should be there, check other folders. Misfilings have been known to happen.)
4. Click on the number of the year you want (the file folder icon doesn't seem to be clickable). This will take you to a new page of folders that's pretty self-explanatory. Ads for presidential and congressional candidates will be in the federal file, state officeholders in the state file and municipal officeholders in the local file. But the file that's usually going to be the most interesting is the one for “non-candidate issue ads.” This is where the mystery-meat groups end up, whether they are buying ads on behalf of federal, state or local candidates.
5. Click on the words “non-candidate issue ads” and you can see for yourself.
Let's check out what's inside the Coalition for Medicare Choices folder.
There are two documents: a contract, which we've uploaded here, for a $16,000 ad that ran on Fox News Sunday on March 13, and, what can be more interesting for watchdogs, the so-called NAB form (named after the National Association of Broadcasters that developed it). You can see that document here; if you scroll down, you will notice two items of information: an address and the name of the executive director. The address matches that of America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). And, searching on the Web, we found a Beth Leonard, who is AHIP's former executive vice president for public affairs, and is now chief communications and marketing officer for New York health insurer EmblemHealth.
The Coalition for Medicare Choices, meanwhile, has a website that identifies AHIP, the trade association of US health-insurance companies, as its founder. And while the FCC ad files don't tell always us the titles of the ads being aired, this contract does tell us that the “product” involved is Medicare Advantage. So it's probably a safe bet that the ad below, featured on the coalition's YouTube channel, is the one that aired in Washington, just a few weeks before the government unveiled the rates it will pay insurers that sell Medicare Advantage.
Take A Look
Medicare Advantage is popular with seniors but some politicians and policymakers say it helps insurance companies more than customers. Former health-insurance executive Wendell Potter has denounced it as a cash cow for insurers that undermines the larger Medicare program. By airing the ad on a popular Washington, DC news program, the health insurers were reaching the lawmakers and policymakers most likely to influence the government's decision. Knowing who is behind the ad, which features a series of attractive seniors but no mention of health-insurance companies, might alter the way viewers process the message.
So that's how it works. Five steps to becoming a better-informed citizen, made infinitely easier by the FCC's online database. In an era when newsrooms have been hollowed out, it's more important than ever for citizens to develop some investigative chops. So give it a try. Find something fishy? Email us here. Happy hunting.
For their Mikenesses series, Adventure Time and Bravest Warriors cartoonist Mike Holmes drew themselves (often accompanied by their cat Ella) in the styles of more than 100 different cartoonists and animators. It's a neat study that shows a real understanding of the styles—and it's also incredibly charming.
It looks like Mikenesses have been on pause for a while, but Holmes has tons of them up on their Tumblr. Here are just a few of them:

I realized that this is what I actually want. Having one signon via OpenID is really nice. It allows me to plug in â€œhttp://almaer.comâ€ as my identifier. However, I always have to go around finding the OpenID option (if it exists) and put that in.
What I really want is for the browser to do that work for me. If a site groks OpenID the browser should be able to pass that over without having me intervene at all. It could hide the entire login process if we came up with a microformat to let all sides know what is going on.
It would be a breath of fresh air to be able to jump through sites leaving comments on blogs, and checking out my to-do list, all without me once having to actually log in.
I wonder if a Gear could be made with a complementary microformat / server side handshake that could then give us single sign-on in all of the browsers.

Korean pop sensation BIGBANG is returning to the U.S. this fall. Following the September 1 release of the quintet's upcoming third studio album, Made, the band will embark on its second world tour and is slated to hit North America in October. Six arena dates are currently scheduled over the two-week leg.
The “Made” world tour officially kicks off on October 2 at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. It then heads to California for a pair of dates at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim's Honda Center on October 3 and 4. The band then heads across the country to New Jersey's Prudential Center for back-to-back dates on October 10 and 11. It wraps on October 13 at Air Canada Centre in Toronto.
Tickets for all six shows went on sale to the general public on June 12, and are already garnering demand on the secondary market. More than 6,000 tickets are available on TicketIQ between all six shows, and the average secondary price for BIGBANG tickets is $265.13. The band's top-priced gig will be at Mandalay Bay Events Center, where tickets currently average at $394.17 and get-in price starts at $85.
BIGBANG has been dormant since 2013, after the massive release of its sophomore record Alive in 2012 and a successful first world tour. Label mates Epik High recently wrapped an 11-show North American tour leg last month, setting the precedent that there is a strong desire to see the world's biggest K-pop groups live in the U.S. and Canada.

Mark Hunt has been forced to pull out of their UFC 146 fight against Stefan Struve due to a knee injury, MMA Fighting has learned from sources close to the fight. As a result, Struve will now face Lavar Johnson on less than two week's notice.
Johnson last fought just 12 days ago at UFC on FOX 3. They knocked out Pat Barry in the first round of their main card fight.
Hunt, a winner in their last three fights, has enjoyed a career renaissance in the UFC, so much so that there was a strong online movement to get them to replace Alistair Overeem against Junior dos Santos in the UFC 146 main event. As fate would have it, neither Overeem nor Hunt will end up fighting on the card after all.
Both Struve and Johnson enter the fighting riding two-fight winnings streaks.
UFC 146, headlined by dos Santos vs. Frank Mir, airs live on pay-per-view on May 26.
UPDATE: UFC has confirmed the news.
Norway kills more whales every year than some of the most notorious whaling countries combined, according to a new report.
Co-written by three environmental and animal rights NGOs—Animal Welfare Institute, OceanCare and ProWildlife—the report concludes that Norwegian whalers are responsible for killing some 12,000 whales since 1993. Norway killed more whales than infamous whale hunters Iceland and Japan combined, later exporting nearly 400,000 pounds of products made from whale oil to those countries and the Faroe Islands.

“This is not the 1800s. It is incomprehensible that such a modern nation produces skin creams sourced from an inherently cruel industry, Susan Millward, executive director of AWI said in a statement.
The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but Norway resumed hunting in 1994, according to the report. Since 2014, when Japan briefly put a stop to whaling, Norway has become the global leader in whale hunting.

The daily commute for thousands of motorists and TTC users is being interrupted by a major road closure in downtown Toronto.
The intersection of King Street West and Spadina Avenue closed Tuesday at 10 a.m. so TTC and city workers can replace the streetcar tracks.
The intersection is scheduled to reopen Aug. 20 at 6 a.m.
Until then, commuters who are travelling near the intersection should expect delays, police say.
All eastbound traffic on King approaching Spadina is being detoured to Bathurst Street, Portland Street or Brant Street.
All westbound traffic on King is being diverted to John Street, Peter Street or Charlotte Street.
Northbound traffic on Spadina is being detoured to Bremner Boulevard, Blue Jays Way or Front Street, while southbound traffic is being forced to take Queen Street, Richmond Street or Adelaide Street.
The 510 Spadina streetcars have been replaced with buses between Spadina Station and Queens Quay West, and the buses are diverting around the road closure. Streetcar service is scheduled to resume Sept. 1.
The 504 King and 508 Lake Shore streetcars are not operating on King between Shaw and Church streets. Streetcars are being diverted via Queen.
Despite the road closure, the sidewalks are still open to pedestrians.
Between Aug. 20 and Aug. 31, the intersection will be reduced to one lane in each direction, except southbound Spadina, where two lanes will be open, the TTC says.
Similar work was done at Queen and Spadina last summer.
Part of Bayview Avenue closed
Meanwhile, motorists are contending with another road closure.
Bayview Avenue is closed between River Street and Lower River Street for about six weeks for an Enbridge Gas Distribution project.
The utility says work is being done on the Don Valley natural gas pipeline now to avoid a service disruption during the fall heating season.

Life for the monks at New Camaldoli Hermitage in Big Sur is by definition an exercise in isolation, but recent months forced that isolation to new levels. In February the monastery was effectively cut off from its normal stream of visitors and guests after winter rain storms dubbed "atmospheric rivers" pounded the California coastline, damaging Highway 1 and nearby access roads. Several monks and staff decided to ride out the isolation, enduring multiple health crises and two deaths as they persisted in their devoted, austere lifestyles in this remote mountain community. After six months, the Hermitage began accepting guests again this month.
Brother Timothy Jolley looks toward the New Camaldoli monastery from the "ranch" house where guests and workers normally stay on the Hermitage, which has been isolated by storm-damaged roads on Highway 1 since February. They say: "Life around here has been rather unsettled since this weather drama set in. We've lost phones for the longest time, Internet was spotty and propane got more scarce. We are feeling the loss of the income and I have recognized just how important faith is and how sustaining. I have found that the absence of guests and being cut off from regular flow through the bookstore [provide] opportunity to spend more time alone in my cell with God. I've worked in my little garden, learning patience from the plants I've put in, watching the birds and squirrels and looking at our remarkable sky, both day and night. Because no one is around, the stillness has its own voice, and I listen."
Father Isaiah Teichert, who has lived at the Hermitage since 1978: "[The isolation] is a chance to go deeper into our contemplation and prayer. I see it as an opportunity. The immediate worry is propane and fuel, and in the longer haul how soon will we be able to connect with our guests and get back to our ordinary life given the roads. But we've been through hard times before and the Lord always seems to get us back on our feet one way or another. If I were God I'd want to keep this place going."
Dust kicks up on a stretch of damaged road on Highway 1 in Big Sur near Paul's Slide.
The Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge north of Big Sur is seen with a buckling section. The bridge was condemned in February and demolished in March, bifurcating many communities along Highway 1. Work crews have been working tirelessly to replace it in the coming months.
The monks chant in the rotunda of their monastery in Big Sur. On March 5, one of the eldest monks, Brother Emmanuel Wasinger, passed away from heart attack complications after being airlifted by helicopter. They were a fixture at the Hermitage and had lived there since 1965.
Rich Veum tends a beehive named "Eve" on the monastery grounds. The bookstore and business manager says "the monks help remind me to stay in the present and not worry so much about the future. Right now, I could get caught up in the fact that we're down $200 or $300,000 this month, but I try to stay positive. You know there's that saying, in the end everything will be alright, and if things aren't alright then it's not the end."
Prior Cyprian Consiglio looks out the window of the dining hall near a painting of St. Romuald while composing a homily for evening service. Cyprian oversees all aspects of life at the monastery. "The real problems have been lack of propane for cooking, heat and hot water, and lack of diesel for our generator. Income loss has also been a worry." They added that he's been surprised "how the brothers have adapted, and how this situation has allowed us to get back to basics: more silence, more solitude, greater simplicity."
Local firefighters and volunteers receive a food drop from a helicopter at the Post Ranch Inn, about 25 miles up Highway 1 from New Camaldoli Hermitage. Two of the monks traveled on the damaged roads to Big Sur's post office to receive food supplies delivered by helicopter.
Brother Benedict Dell'osa walks the Hermitage grounds back to their monastic cell after evening prayers.
Father Isaiah Teichert, who has lived at New Camaldoli since 1978, sits next to a statue of the Virgin Mary inside the hollow stump of the "Womb Tree," a hollow oak tree that nearly burned down in a fire several years ago. Regarding their current plight, they said, "I miss that rhythm, and their input. They sort of keep to their side of the wall and we keep to our side but very often they want to talk and they're curious, we have them in for lunch on Sunday. On the other hand it's a chance to go deeper into our contemplation and prayer. I see it as an opportunity."
Brother Benedict Dell'osa, who cooks once a week for the other monks, looks for boxes of food marked for the Hermitage after helicopters delivered supplies.
The monks pray at a Vespers evening service.
Vickie Conte helps with the dishes after lunch. After 2 1/2 years as the beekeeper for the Hermitage, they recently moved into the canyon a short hike from the cloister and is a neighbor and friend of the Hermitage. "It has been a very challenging time ... the roads were falling apart. No phones. There was talk we might have to evacuate. We have been conserving fuel, and on top of all that our dear Brother Emmanuel broke their hip and had to be air-lifted out. They died a week later. This was a very tough time. I know the monks have also said they miss having visitors since part of their vocation is to show hospitality, so this is missing from their lives. Yet they seem to be coming together, reevaluating and reflecting ... when you are surrounded by incredible beauty and silence there is a connection back to the land." They add, "Everyone has pulled together and taken on different responsibilities for the good of the entire community."
Father Thomas Matus reads a magazine in the Hermitage library. Born in Hollywood in 1940, Thomas is a former student of Kriya yoga and has been at the Hermitage since 1962. "It is true that in these weeks of relative isolation we have had the opportunity to appreciate deeply both the bonds of brotherhood in community and the greater simplicity of our prayer and work; this simplification has favored the contemplative experience in our moments of solitude."
Brother Michael Harrington poses for a portrait in their robes after evening prayers. They moved to New Calmodoli in 1989 following a divorce. Before becoming a monk, they were an engineer at defense contractor Pratt & Whitney. "Growing up I was told if I'm not a manager then I'm a failure. I'm an introvert so all the hobnobbing of business didn't fit for me, in the sense of who God made you, you know. An introvert draws energy from within so being a monk is a perfect match," they said.

But the tactic has backfired after a mugging victim complained that officers were using their forces' official accounts to keep track of their favourite celebrities, sports teams and fashion brands.
Among the accounts being followed by police throughout the country are those of
Miranda Hart, the comedian, and Rihanna, the pop singer, below. Officers also follow television shows such as Downton Abbey, and shopping brands including Victoria's Secret, the lingerie company, and Christian Louboutin, the shoe designer.
The country's biggest force has ordered a clean-up of its official social media accounts after receiving a formal complaint from a victim who was concerned about its apparent interest in celebrities.
By “following” other accounts on Twitter, users are notified when that person sends a message. This means that when the officers who control the police accounts log on, they will be presented with a stream of information about the people they are following.
Some forces have defended their use of social media, saying that it helps them to keep in touch with the public, particularly young people. Police are encouraged to use such sites to “engage” with residents, post updates about crimes and appeal for information and witnesses.
The majority of police forces have a main Twitter account, with many employing dedicated social media staff. Other Twitter accounts are maintained by local safer neighbourhood teams and specialist police departments, such as roads policing.
Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) says that “the use of social media for private purposes during working time and from force systems should be in accordance with local force policies. The use of social media for such purposes during working time, and from personal mobile devices, is not recommended”.
Police Scotland, which last month said it was reviewing its Twitter use after an insulting message was posted from its official account, “follows” Andy Murray, the tennis player, and President Barack Obama. The force has apologised for the message, which was aimed at Toby Young, the Telegraph blogger, after they appeared on Newsnight discussing whether police should act to stop Twitter “trolls”.
Police in Solihull in the West Midlands follow Cricket Australia, which offers “all the latest breaking Aussie cricket news” as well as Danny Baker, the BBC broadcaster.
Leicestershire Police follows Coleen Rooney, the wife of the England footballer, and Miranda Hart.
Police in Lambeth, south London, followed Rihanna, Simon Cowell, Downton Abbey, Victoria's Secret, Christian Louboutin and Justin Bieber, the pop star, until the account was the subject of a complaint.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: “Guidance is issued to police and staff authorised to use the MPS social media accounts and this includes following appropriate users on Twitter.”
It added that the officers who control the Lambeth account had been asked to review their usage and “make appropriate changes”.
Other forces said they were happy to have their officers follow celebrities.
Staffordshire Police, which follows Rebecca Adlington, the swimmer, and a satire of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, claims that it had gained the help of a celebrity in a police appeal, which it said was “very successful”.
Gordon Scobbie, formerly the Acpo officer responsible for social media, said: “I can understand following some politicians, celebrities with a cause, or perhaps local celebrities, but not Rihanna and Justin Bieber.
“I think there needs to be a better understanding of senior managers as to where does this fit into the overall strategy of what we are trying to do.
“Where forces are getting themselves into a bit of trouble is where they just go into it without thinking and letting a few people loose on it.”
A crowd on the south side of Houston took part in a nationwide protest in response to the recent events in Baltimore.About 50 people gathered Wednesday afternoon near Dowling and Southmore by Highway 288. Some held signs read "Honk for justice," "America's worst nightmare;" others wrote messages against the police.Houston police were there to ensure everything stays peaceful, following the rioting in Baltimore. No reports of violence were made.The demonstration was one of many across the nation related to the unrest in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray. Gray, 25, died while in police custody earlier this month.In Ferguson, several dozen people marched down West Florissant Avenue in the St. Louis suburb. That same area was the site of numerous protests after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, by a white Ferguson police officer in August.Several hundred people also gathered in New York and rallied in Manhattan's Union Square. They chanted "no justice, no peace" and "hands up, don't shoot," a reference to the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. Police officers stood and watched.A police helicopter hovered overhead, and a police loudspeaker warned the protesters that they would be arrested if they marched in the street.A group of protesters spilled into the street and disrupted traffic. Dozens of police officers moved in with plastic handcuffs and began making arrests while officers with batons pushed the crowd back onto the sidewalk.
For the first time, scientists have discovered evidence of a human DNA fragment in the genome of bacteria, shedding light on why this particular bug is so adept at surviving in human hosts. The bacteria in question is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea.
Gonorrhea is one of very few diseases exclusive to our species, and is one of the oldest recorded diseases in human history. An ancient disease that resembles gonorrhea's symptoms is even described in the Bible, according to Hank Seifert, senior author of a paper on the gene transfer.
The bacterium apparently picks up a genetic sequence from the host it is infecting, a novel ability that could help the bacteria adapt to its host, according to Seifert, a microbiology and immunology professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. This ability may enable it to develop different strains of itself, they said. The paper is published today in the online journal mBio.
The human genome has plenty of ghost DNA fragments, relics of viruses that entered after some past infection. Lateral gene transfer is pretty common between bacteria and multicellular organisms, according to several studies. But this is the first time that scientists have seen a bacteria pick up the genes, rather than depositing them.
"Whether this particular event has provided an advantage for the gonorrhea bacterium, we don't know yet," Seifert said in a NU press release.
Scientists discovered the gene transfer while they were examining the genomic sequences of several gonorrhea strains. Three of them had a piece of DNA wherein the sequence was identical to a sequence found in humans, according to NU. Further examination suggests this evolved relatively recently.
About 700,000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide are infected with gonorrhea every year. It's curable with an antibiotic, but it developed resistance to several drugs over the past 40 years. Studying the bacteria's human DNA fragment could conceivably help scientists find better treatments.
"The next step is to figure out what this piece of DNA is doing," Seifert said.

LAST MONTH, upon the release of Justin Lin's “Star Trek Beyond,” there was a ripple of controversy over the feature-film franchise's decision to portray the character Sulu as gay, with even George Takei — the popular actor and gay activist who originated the role — questioning the choice to alter late creator Gene Roddenberry's vision.
Star Trek historian Mark A. Altman, however, lauded the film's glimpse of this alternative-timeline Sulu with their same-sex partner in a brief shot of a family reunion. “I think that would be commended,” Altman said, “and I don't think that in any way diminishes Roddenberry's worldview [of diversity]. It feels very true to the values we have today, and the way we look at multiculturalism.”
[How Star Trek embraced diversity 50 years ago — and continues to do so today]
Then Altman, author of a new Star Trek 50th-anniversary oral history (Volume 2 of “The Fifty-Year Mission” is due out later this month), pivoted to how future Star Trek creative enterprises will reflect social change and acceptance.
“I'm sure in the new series” on the CBS All Access platform, Altman told The Post's Comic Riffs last month, “we'll see it dealt with in a much more honest and real and contemporary way, because Bryan Fuller, who is the showrunner, is gay, and so I think he's going to be very comfortable dealing with these issues.”
Now comes news that Fuller will indeed emphasize such inclusion in their new CBS-platform series, “Star Trek: Discovery.”
“Absolutely we're having a gay character,” Fuller told the media Wednesday at the show's Television Critics Association panel in the Los Angeles area.
Back when Fuller was a co-producer and writer on “Star Trek: Voyager,” that '90s series received a wave of hate mail over the mere rumor that one character might be written as gay. Now, Fuller told the TCA audience, acceptance of LGBT characters has improved greatly, perhaps even making greater strides in recent years than some other areas of inclusion.
Fuller also noted that “Discovery” will have a woman as the lead character, and that they might be played by an actor of color.
“We live in a world where television is ready to deal with these kinds of things,” Altman told Comic Riffs, “and why shouldn't it be?”

"Voters are learning that lesser evil voting hurts us by empowering the two major parties to march to the right and take voters for granted," Dr Margaret Flowers told Muslim Press.
Read the full text of the interview:
Muslim Press: Dr. Flowers, what would you do for American working families if you were elected to the senate?
Margaret Flowers: One of my primary concerns is the growing wealth divide, which has been getting increasingly worse over the past decade. Currently the bottom 50% of people in the U.S. are sharing 1% of the wealth and the bottom 25% are in debt with negative wealth. This is not sustainable. To change this, I would push for progressive taxes on wealth and to close tax loopholes because wealth is growing in the U.S. but it's going to the top. I would push to reinvest that money in communities to build up their local economies through small and medium sized businesses, especially worker-owned enterprises. And I would promote public banks which can partner with community banks and credit unions to provide small loans for home purchases and capital for businesses. I also support a Green New Deal which would set a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030 and have a clear plan to transition to electric transportation including affordable mass transit, to transition our agriculture to regenerative organic practices, to build up our wetlands and to make our buildings energy efficient. This would create tens of millions of living wage jobs. And we need to treat public investments as something that provides a public return so that we create a guaranteed basic income to eliminate poverty. I will also push for a national improved Medicare for all and for free public higher education. This will take the stress of health care and education off of working families.
MP: What do you see as the biggest challenge that American workers face in this era?
Margaret Flowers: I believe the biggest challenge that workers face is a global economic system that makes workers insecure and exploits them. Businesses are under pressure to pay as low as tolerated and to reduce benefits in order to stay competitive in a market that encourages large corporations to move wherever labor and environmental laws are the most relaxed. I have been fighting to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other bad deals for the past five years. We need trade models that raise labor and environmental protections. We need to end extractive models of development in which large businesses come into communities because of taxpayer funded incentives and leave as soon as they get a better deal somewhere else. Workers need to be empowered and to be able to work with dignity.
MP: What could be done (what would you do) to fight racial injustice?
Margaret Flowers: At the federal level, there are a number of things I could do to fight racial injustice. Certainly economics are a part of that. Systemic racism for centuries has created a racial wealth divide. The Green Party supports reparations. I also support making taxing and regulating Marijuana and releasing nonviolent drug offenders because drug laws are used to disproportionately incarcerate people of color. I would treat drug addiction as a public health issue, not a crime. I would end the militarization of police through provisions such as section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). And I would push for independent investigations of all deaths in police custody and holding police officers accountable. I would also conduct investigations through my office to expose racial disparities and to promote solutions at the local level such as community control of policing. And I oppose private prisons.
MP: What would you do to fight financial fraud and Wall Street's power?
Margaret Flowers: I was the first candidate to sign on to the Bank Whistleblower United's 19-step plan to hold Wall Street accountable using existing law. I would support that in Congress by working to allocate more funds for federal agents to investigate white collar crime. We can also use existing law to put caps on banks so they are not too big to fail.
MP: What would you say is the most important issue in today's America and how do you plan to fight it?
Margaret Flowers: An underlying cause of the many crises that we face is the domination of our political process by wealth and the resultant lack of democracy. We now have academic studies that prove the U.S. is a plutocracy, ruled by and for the wealthy. We can fight that by withdrawing support for candidates of the two plutocratic parties, the Democrats and Republicans, and electing candidates who do not accept contributions from corporations and PACs. We need elected officials who represent and answer to the people. In Congress I can fight this by pushing for greater transparency for campaign contributions, for public financing of elections and for equal airtime for candidates. I will push for universal voter registration and removing other barriers to voter participation. And I will work to remove obstacles to independent parties.
MP: How do you see the future of the Green Party?
Margaret Flowers: The Green Party is a young party in the U.S. that is growing. Nationwide, thousands of Green Party candidates have been elected to office at the local level. I believe the Green Party has the potential to become a major party in the U.S. Green candidates do not take donations from corporations or PACs. The Green Party values and platform are strongly in alignment with the values of the growing social movement in the U.S. and with what the majority of people in the U.S. want. It has been exciting for me to see the growth of the Green Party this year and I hope that we break through and see some of our candidates elected to federal office.
MP: How do you see the impact of Jill Stein in the presidential election?
Margaret Flowers: Dr. Jill Stein has been working hard for many years to build the Green Party presence at the national level.  They are dedicated and tireless. And they are having an impact because this year the major media outlets have launched attacks at them Dr. Stein and their vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka are elevating the level of political discourse in this country by talking about critical issues and solutions while the major party candidates argue over who is the most corrupt. The Stein-Baraka ticket is giving voters a choice they can feel good about in this election. Voters are learning that lesser evil voting hurts us by empowering the two major parties to march to the right and take voters for granted. More people are realizing that there is no democracy when voters vote out of fear and that a vote for a candidate is just that, a vote for a candidate and not 'stealing' a vote from another candidate. And the Stein-Baraka ticket has a chance of receiving 5% or more of the popular vote in this election. If they achieve that, it will give dozens of states automatic ballot access and will give the campaign access to millions of dollars in federal funding. This will give the party a huge boost and allow greater investment in building party infrastructure and supporting more candidates to run for office.
MP: The Green Party supported Bernie Sanders and their political revolution throughout their campaign. Now that Hillary Clinton got the nomination, what do you think about the future of their revolution?
Margaret Flowers: There was a lot of hope during Sanders' campaign that they would take the momentum that developed and continue to challenge the establishment. It is disappointing that they chose to support the establishment instead because many people hoped they would be different. It is normal for insurgent Democratic candidates to fall in line with the party after they bring a lot of new energy into it. I'm glad to see that people are not following them and are turning to the Green Party and other left independent parties instead. That gives me hope. I expect that Our Revolution will be like the other Democratic groups that arose out of presidential races such as the Rainbow Push Coalition, Democracy for America and Progressive Democrats of America. It may try to push the party to the left but in the end it will be a tool for the Democratic Party agenda.
MP: What role does Wall Street play in U.S. elections? Is Wall Street too powerful to fight against?
Margaret Flowers: Wall Street finances and plays a significant role not only in our elections but also in our government. Corporate media shape the public narrative and distract from discussion of the real issues of the day. They go after Dr. Stein with false accusations of being an anti-vaxxer when they have question the pharmaceutical industry's influence over the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is documented to exist, but they don't go after Clinton for their policies that have impoverished and killed thousands. They go after Dr. Stein for their investments in mutual funds, but they do not go after Clinton for the fraud committed by the Clinton Foundation or their offshore accounts. We see their influence in the fact that Citigroup executive Michael Froman recommended much of President Obama's cabinet positions, including making themselves the U.S. Trade Representative, and the president followed their advice. Despite this, Wall Street is not too powerful. History teaches us that people have more power than any government when they have the courage to use it. We can expose Wall Street fraud and demand accountability. We can protest those who commit fraud. And we can build alternative economic institutions that are independent of Wall Street and withdraw our support from Wall Street. There are more of us than there are wealthy elites. Remember, we are the 99%.
MP: How have Obama's policies affected American workers?
Margaret Flowers: I would say that overall, Obama's policies have hurt workers. We could have enacted an improved Medicare for all in 2010. It is what the majority of people wanted, including 80% of Democrats and only Democrats voted for the health bill. That would have taken the strain of paying for health insurance off of workers. Instead, the health law is forcing workers to buy insurance that doesn't protect them. Under Obama, the 'recovery' from the 2008 financial crisis has been for those at the top. The banks were bailed out, but not the people. People are struggling in low wage insecure jobs. Half of workers in the U.S. are making $31,000/year or less. Students are burdened with debt that prevents them from participating in the economy. We are strangling the economy from the bottom because people do not have the money to meet their basic needs. And the military budget has grown under Obama as they continue the policy of endless wars. Weapons sales have skyrocketed. We need to dramatically realign our federal spending to invest in education, jobs and other human needs instead of more wars and aggression, which are also creating greater instability and insecurity around the world.
MP: How will the TPP affect working families? Who does it benefit?
Margaret Flowers: The TPP was literally written by and for transnational corporate interests. Industry lawyers wrote the language while Congress was cut out. And now Congress will be pushed to ratify it without the power to amend it even though the TPP will change U.S. law. For workers, the TPP will lower wages because manufacturers and other businesses will be able to move to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia where wages are extremely low. The TPP will benefit large multinational corporations and will hurt small and medium-sized businesses and farms. Even the U.S. International Trade Commission admitted this year that the TPP will hurt 16 out of 25 industrial sectors in the U.S, and will increase the trade deficit. In addition, the TPP will prevent us from passing laws that are in the public interest, such as raising the minimum wage or banning polluting industries, if these interfere with corporate profits.
MP: Hillary Clinton has opposed the TPP. Do you think they will still oppose it if they become president? What would change after the election?
Margaret Flowers: Clinton supported the TPP for a long time before they were forced to oppose it due to public pressure. I suspect that they hope President Obama will ratify it before they are in the White House so they don't have to take responsibility for it. If we stop the TPP from being ratified this fall, they will have to find a way to maneuver their support for it. It will be tricky for them to find a way to justify pushing for its ratification, but they can count on the corporate media to be complicit. The current language we are hearing is that the TPP is a national security issue, so they can always use fear to manipulate the public.
MP: Hillary Clinton has a good chance of becoming the next president of the United States. If you were to describe one of their policies as the worst one, what would it be?
Margaret Flowers: The Clinton policy that frightens me the most is their foreign policy. They have no respect for international law or human rights and will continue to pursue policies of hegemony and imperialism. They will continue to antagonize Russia and China and will increase the risk of another major war. Them presidency must be a presidency of protest. That is already happening as they face protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. We must recognize that Clinton is a neo-liberal and a neocon who has successfully united the two plutocratic parties. They must not be given a honeymoon or a pass because they are a woman. It is critical that the people rise up to demand that we set the political agenda to meet our needs, not the elites.

Dear Rep. Jason Chaffetz,
As a nonpartisan organization of nearly 5,000 women, many of whom are your constituents, we are profoundly disturbed by apparent Russian involvement in our recent election. The unexpected firing of FBI Director James Comey is one more disruptive action weakening confidence in the current administration.
Rather than instilling “renewed confidence in the FBI,” this action, together with so many other unpredictable and unprecedented behaviors by our 45th president, threatens our democracy and capacity to trust that the current administration has our nation's best interests in mind. We plead with you in your role as chairperson of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to be aggressive and zealous in choosing country over party. The behavior of many partisan legislators has challenged our confidence.
As your sisters in the faith who share with you a commitment to ethics, honor and justice, we urge you to do your job as chairperson. Ties to Russia and potential conflicts of interest in the current administration need your assertive attention.
We understand that you are recuperating and we hope you will heal well and thoroughly. We have the same hopes for our shaken country. Presumably, if you are well enough to defy doctor's orders to return to Washington to vote for the grievously flawed AHCA, you are well enough to fiercely investigate these issues of grave concern to our nation.
Back in September 2016, fueled by frustration with what you felt was an uncooperative Congress, you voiced your commitment to the authority of the Oversight Committee.
You said:
"I believe passionately in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee . . . . Every expenditure, everything we do in this nation is supposed to be overseen by us. We can investigate anything at any time. That's what's different about the United States of America. We're different because we ARE self-critical. We DO go look under the hood. We DO hold people accountable."
We support those words and urge you to be as determined and ferocious in your commitment to them now as you were last fall. If you are not able to serve in this capacity on the Oversight Committee, please insist immediately on the appointment of a special prosecutor and/or a special congressional committee to focus specifically on Russian ties to the current administration and any related obstruction of justice.
Earnest bipartisan scrutiny of the issues of Russian ties and this administration's panoply of conflicting interests is as vital to the health of our country as surgery was for your foot, Rep. Chaffetz. Earlier this year when asked about the Russian investigations and Michael Flynn's involvement, you replied, “It's taking care of itself.” That would have been an inadequate answer about the care of your damaged foot. It is just as inadequate an answer about investigations into the grave concerns facing our country today.
We call upon you to do your job to investigate these issues thoroughly as chairperson of the bipartisan Oversight Committee in the time you have remaining in your legislative service. If, for whatever reason, you cannot, we ask that you call for the appointment of a special prosecutor to oversee this investigation.
Sincerely,
The founders of Mormon Women for Ethical Government

'til Death Do Us Part A Rude Awakening Anita Spearman Thought They Had Their Whole Lives Ahead Of Them. Them Husband Had Other Plans.....
''We've been broken into out here,'' the caller said calmly. ''I can't wake my wife up. My name is Robert Spearman and we live at 2367 Bay Circle in Palm Beach Gardens. . . . You better send the emergency rescue and you'd better send the police out here, too.''
At 7:50 a.m. on a Saturday in November 1985, an operator at the 911 number in West Palm Beach took a call.
When the emergency rescue technicians from the Palm Beach County Fire Department arrived, Robert Spearman led them to a bedroom in the northwest corner of their house. Anita Spearman, dressed in a nightgown, was lying on a bed with their head resting on its right side, partially covered with a pillow. Them arms were at their sides, their left foot dangling from the bed.
To rescue workers, it was apparent no one would ever awaken Anita Spearman again. As they moved the pillow and turned their face up, they saw that their right temple had been bashed in. Them blood had soaked through the sheet beneath their head.
Later that day, county medical examiner Dr. Frederick Hobin would perform an autopsy on 49-year-old Anita Spearman. They would determine that they had been struck in the head with a heavy, elongated object along a line that ran from just above and behind their right eye socket to just above and behind their right ear. There had been four blows, with the first three breaking through the skull and cutting into brain tissue. The fourth had caught the top of their ear and cut the flesh of both ear and scalp.
And there was more. Although there were no signs of a major struggle in the room, there was a significant bruise on the woman's right hand. They hadn't been bludgeoned to death as they slept. They had raised their hand to shield themselves from the blows. Anita Spearman, Dr. Hobin concluded, had fought for their life.
In the early hours of this grisly discovery, Robert Spearman sobbed uncontrollably in their living room, wondering aloud what kind of person could have done such a thing to the soft-spoken and genteel woman who had been their wife.
Were it not for their broad, muscular shoulders, Sean Doutre would look like the archetypical undertaker.  They are tall and angular, with sunken eyes that make them look much older than their 22 years. If they have a characteristic expression, it is a lack of expression, a blank, emotionless stare.
Some might say that Doutre's countenance is not of their own making, however. For from the time they took their first step as a toddler, Sean Doutre did not find the world an easy place. Born Sean Lee Perry and deserted twice by their mother, they were turned over by their stepfather to a state orphanage at age 5.
At 7, they were adopted by a couple who changed their name to Sean Treavor Doutre. Two years later, they returned them to the orphanage.
For the next few years, they were shuffled from one foster home to another. Finally, after sufficiently aberrant behavior, they got their first taste of stability: They were sent to a center for emotionally disturbed boys in Seattle. There, Sean Doutre would receive most of their formal education.

Megan Kelly - LAFAYETTE, La. (KLFY)—Workers at the Moncus Park at the Horse Farm were surprised to find thousands of dead fish in the parks coulee.
Director of Lafayette Central Park, Elizabeth Brooks said thousands of fish died, but there are "thousands and thousands more still alive."
Wildlife and fisheries said the death of all these fish is a byproduct of receding floodwaters, however, they are still investigating the phenomenon.
"What's happening is the water temperature is high, about the mid-80s," Said Jody David with Wildlife and Fisheries, "The ones [fish] that did leave, they left, but they still have some [fish] that's in there and they're basically trapped and the oxygen level is failing and therefore the fish are going to perish."
David said the majority of the dead fish are buffalo fish, freshwater drum and a few catfish.
The fish that are still alive appear to be swimming upstream of the Coulee Mine which drains into the Vermillion River, officials said.
"Last night's rain I think helped a little bit because I think it created a little bit more oxygen in the water," Said Brooks, "But it's not enough. They're definitely gasping for air."
The fish gasping for air and the smell wafting through the air has some residents concerned, "I really hope these fish corpses don't just sit here indefinitely because that doesn't seem safe." Said Rozanne Macmanus.
Officials said not much can be done for now adding it's simply a matter of waiting for nature to take its course.
According to Brooks, the park is still safe to visit, they just doesn't recommend fishing in the coulee anytime soon.
A filament of dark matter has been directly detected between the galaxy clusters Abell 222 and Abell 223. The blue shading and yellow contour lines represent the density of matter. Image credit: Jörg Dietrich, U-M Department of PhysicsANN ARBOR—Scientists have, for the first time, directly detected part of the invisible dark matter skeleton of the universe, where more than half of all matter is believed to reside.
The discovery, led by a University of Michigan physics researcher, confirms a key prediction in the prevailing theory of how the universe's current web-like structure evolved.
The map of the known universe shows that most galaxies are organized into clusters, but some galaxies are situated along filaments that connect the clusters. Cosmologists have theorized that dark matter undergirds those filaments, which serve as highways of sorts, guiding galaxies toward the gravitational pull of the massive clusters. Dark matter's contribution had been predicted with computer simulations, and its shape had been roughed out based on the distribution of the galaxies. But no one had directly detected it until now.
“We found the dark matter filaments. For the first time, we can see them,” said Jörg Dietrich, a physics research fellow in the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science and the Arts. Dietrich is first author of a paper on the findings published online in Nature and to appear in the July 12 print edition.
Dark matter, whose composition is still a mystery, doesn't emit or absorb light, so astronomers can't see it directly with telescopes. They deduce that it exists based on how its gravity affects visible matter. Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up more than 80 percent of the universe. To “see” the dark matter component of the filament that connects the clusters Abell 222 and 223, Dietrich and their colleagues took advantage of a phenomenon called gravitational lensing.
The gravity of massive objects such as galaxy clusters acts as a lens to bend and distort the light from more distant objects as it passes. Dietrich's team observed tens of thousands of galaxies beyond the supercluster. They were able to determine the extent to which the supercluster distorted galaxies, and with that information, they could plot the gravitational field and the mass of the Abell 222 and 223 clusters. Seeing this for the first time was “exhilarating,” Dietrich said.
“It looks like there's a bridge that shows that there is additional mass beyond what the clusters contain,” they said. “The clusters alone cannot explain this additional mass,” they said.
Scientists before Dietrich assumed that the gravitational lensing signal would not be strong enough to give away dark matter's configuration. But Dietrich and their colleagues focused on a peculiar cluster system whose axis is oriented toward Earth, so that the lensing effects could be magnified.
“This result is a verification that for many years was thought to be impossible,” Dietrich said.
The team also found a spike in X-ray emissions along the filament, due to an excess of hot, ionized ordinary matter being pulled by gravity toward the massive filament, but they estimate that 90 percent or more of the filament's mass is dark matter.
The researchers used data obtained with the Subaru telescope, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. They also used the XMM-Newton satellite for X-ray observations. This work is funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA. Other contributors are from the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University; Ohio University; Max Planck Institut für extraterrestrische Physik in Germany; The University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford.

Valley of the pitchers is located in Laos, in the province of Xieng Khouang. A group of sites with historical and archaeological monuments, is a very mysterious place, across the valley scattered huge number of giant stone jars, which tied a lot of secrets, how they are having who could create them, and what they were used for. Stone jars are scattered at the foot of Annamskogo ridge separating Laos and Vietnam. On the territory of the valley is more than 60 sites with pitchers, more of them located in Xieng Khouang province. More of them located in Xieng Khouang province, but they are also found in Thailand and in northern India. The largest group of pitchers finds near the town of Phonsavan is called “the first landing,” there are about 250 pots. Dimensions pitchers range from one to three meters and a weight of about 6 tons, their shape is also diverse – rectangular or round, are found in the valley of drives that are likely to serve as covers for these pots. The material for the manufacture of pitchers as the analysis of researchers, used rocks, granite, sandstone or calcified coral.
But it is not so rosy things for scientists to answer the question, which were used and who created these amazing pitchers. The age of some pots from about 1500 to 2000 years, and have been used by the people who lived in Southeast Asia, whose culture remains completely unknown. According to archaeologists who found the tools in the valley, bronze objects suggests that most likely served as vessels for burial urns. According to other versions of jars were used for food storage, water or other substances. There is also a version that they were left in the valley to collect rainwater for trade caravans. flickr/Damien @ Flickr
But in addition to the assumptions of archaeologists, there are legends of the indigenous peoples of Laos, in their stories, earlier in these places lived ancient people of the giants, they were masters of the valley, but one day, for some reason left the place, leaving jugs scattered along the valley thus formed pitchers valley. According to another legend, the king Trung Khung when scored with their army victory over their enemies, ordered to make for a large number of rice wine “lao-lao”, and under this wine created a gigantic jug, a celebration and festivities for all its people.
During the civil war in the 1970s, Xieng Khouang province has undergone a massive bombing by the US Air Force, the capital of the province was completely bombed, was also destroyed by shells large number of archaeological and historical sites in Laos. Now scientists studying the valley pitchers are constantly in danger, as a large number of unexploded ordnance left after the war that prevents scientists to study how to historic sites. For this reason, a significant part of the territory of the valley remains inaccessible to tourists and are only a few areas completely cleared of shells, they are open to visitors. Since pitchers Valley is an important historical and tourist area, the authorities of Laos are trying to get to the Valley of the pitchers UNESCO World Heritage, which should speed up the cleaning of the valley from the shells and assist in the preservation of historical heritage of the province and the development of tourism in the area.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slipped for a second straight session against a basket of currencies on Thursday after U.S. retail sales and weekly jobless claims data showed weakness in the economy and curbed speculation of a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve.

The Commerce Department said retail sales gained 0.3 percent last month, missing expectations for a 0.6 percent rise. April's retail sales, however, were revised to show a 0.5 percent increase.
“The retail sales data was a bit concerning for people anticipating stronger growth, and if you're not going to get stronger growth, that brings down the expectations for higher Fed rates,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey.
The Fed's upcoming monetary policy meeting is next week.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 317,000 for the week ended June 7, exceeding expectations.
The dollar fell against the euro for the first time in five trading sessions, although the euro was not far from a four-month low of $1.3503 hit last week after the European Central Bank cut rates to record lows.
A drop in U.S. Treasuries yields narrowed the gap between yields on U.S. Treasuries and German bunds, leading traders to take profits on the dollar's rally against the euro, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
The dollar also fell on worries that violence in Iraq would disrupt oil supplies. Traders said violence in the second-largest OPEC producer raised concerns of larger geopolitical conflict and a sustained period of higher oil prices.
“This could potentially signal a broader destabilization in the region,” said Esiner, who added that the impact of higher oil prices could hurt U.S. consumer spending.
The dollar fell against the yen, which has advanced in recent sessions after strong economic data reduced expectations for further Bank of Japan monetary easing. The central bank's latest two-day policy meeting starts Thursday.
The New Zealand dollar, meanwhile, rallied after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked base rates by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent, drawing demand for the higher-yielding currency.
The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.28 percent at 80.565. The euro was last up 0.18 percent against the dollar at $1.3554.
The dollar was last down 0.43 percent against the Japanese yen at 101.63 yen, and was last down 0.22 percent against the Swiss franc to trade at 0.8982 franc. The New Zealand dollar last traded up 1.48 percent at $0.8692.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last up 14/32 in price to yield 2.588 percent. Debt prices rallied on the weak U.S. data and a robust auction of 30-year bonds.
Amid the constant media outrage over everything Trump, Trump, Trump, some might have forgotten that in the political rollercoaster over the past 12 months, there were numerous other high-profile individuals involved, including not only former DOJ head Loretta Lynch, whose every interaction with the Clinton campaign is about to be probed under a Congressional microscope, but the man who some say started it all: former FBI Director James Comey.
First loved by the Democrats when they personally absolved Hillary Clinton of any sins regarding their (ab)use of their personal email server, then furiously loathed when they reopened the FBI probe into Hillary Clinton one week before the election, then finally getting into a feud with President Trump which cost their them job, Comey ultimately admitted to leaking at least one memo which contained personal recollections of their conversations with the president, in hopes of launching a special probe into the president's alleged Russian collusion.
There was just one problem: according to a blockbuster report from The Hill, in addition to the leaked memos, Comey also leaked classified information in gross and direct violation of FBI rules and regulations. And just like that Comey finds themselves in trouble. Only not just any trouble, but the virtually same trouble that Hillary Clinton was in in the summer of 2016... and which James Comey was tasked to investigate.
We'll repeat the above because it bears repeating: in the purest definition of irony, James Comey is about to be investigated for the exact same thing which they absolved Hillary Clinton of doing last summer. Almost as if neither Comey nor Clinton were aware of - or willing to abide by - the security protocol of the agency they were in charge of.
Aside from once again confirming that Trump may have been right all along in their accusation of the ex-FBI chief's motives, this shocking revelation raises the possibility that Comey broke their own agency's rules - by putting their own interests above those of their country - but far more grotesquely, ignored the same security protocol that they publicly criticized Hillary Clinton for in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election, in order to settle their vendetta with President Trump.
Amusingly, Comey's alleged flagrant disregard for FBI regulations would explain why they also found Clinton's email server transgressions to not be a material concern, contrary to what most Republicans claimed at the time. After all, if it was good - or rather not bad enough for Clinton, maybe it was the same with Comey's own abuse of confidential data? The only problem is that while Comey was generous enough to let Hillary go, now that the ex-FBI chief is facing the president of the US as their adversary, they may not be quite so lucky.
Upon hearing of Comey's alleged transgressions, the now former Chair of the House Oversight Committee said simply that "IF true, this is bombshell news."
Comey's private memos on Trump conversations contained classified material https://t.co/XCncK9Ijl1 IF true, this is bombshell news — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) July 10, 2017
Incidentally, the first to warn of Comey's imminent headaches, was Breitbart News, which on Friday reported that a new Senate report said recent leaks by former FBI Director James Comey's leaking of memos could “potentially harm national security.” The report, released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday, found that there were 125 separate leaks in President Trump's first 126 days that were potentially damaging to national security. The report said it included Comey's leaking of their memos after they were fired by Trump in May.
* * *
Comey's troubles started when they testified under oath last month that they considered the memos they prepared to be personal documents and that they shared at least one of them with a Columbia University lawyer friend. As Comey later disclosed, they asked that lawyer to leak information from one memo to the news media in hopes of increasing pressure to get a special prosecutor named in the Russia case after Comey was fired as FBI director.
The Hill recounts that particular exchange with Senator Roy Blunt:
“So you didn't consider your memo or your sense of that conversation to be a government document?,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) asked Comey on June 8. “You considered it to be, somehow, your own personal document that you could share to the media as you wanted through a friend?” “Correct,” Comey answered. “I understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president. As a private citizen, I thought it important to get it out.”
Comey insisted in their testimony they believed their personal memos were unclassified, though they hinted one or two documents they created might have been contained classified information. “I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership,” they testified about the one memo they later leaked about former national security adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. Additionally, they added, “My view was that the content of those unclassified, memorialization of those conversations was my recollection recorded.”
That's when the problems escalated, because according to The Hill - which for the first time disclosed that the total number of memos linked to Comey's nine conversations with Trump - when the seven memos Comey wrote regarding their nine conversations with Trump about Russia earlier this year were shown to Congress in recent days, the FBI claimed all were, in fact, deemed to be government documents.
Oops. As The Hill reveals, four, or more than half, of the seven memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the “secret” or “confidential” level, according to officials directly familiar with the matter.
This is a major problem for Comey because FBI policy forbids any agent from releasing classified information or any information from ongoing investigations or sensitive operations without prior written permission, and mandates that all records created during official duties are considered to be government property.
“Unauthorized disclosure, misuse, or negligent handling of information contained in the files, electronic or paper, of the FBI or which I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could impair national security, place human life in jeopardy, result in the denial of due process, prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its responsibilities, or violate federal law,” states the agreement all FBI agents sign.
FBI policy further adds that “all information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of America” and that an agent “will not reveal, by any means, any information or material from or related to FBI files or any other information acquired by virtue of my official employment to any unauthorized recipient without prior official written authorization by the FBI.”
Comey indicated in their testimony the memos were in their possession when they left the bureau, leaving them in a position to leak one of them through their lawyer friend to the media. But they testified that they have since turned them over to Robert Mueller, a former FBI chief and now spearheading the investigation about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. It is not clear whether Comey as director signed the same agreement as their agents, but the contract is considered the official policy of the bureau. It was also unclear when the documents were shown to Congress whether the information deemed "secret" or "confidential" was classified at the time Comey wrote the memos or determined so afterwards, the sources said.
Meanwhile, Congressional investigators have already begun examining whether Comey's creation, storage and sharing of the memos violated FBI rules, but the revelation that four of the seven memos included some sort of classified information opens a new door of inquiry into whether classified information was mishandled, improperly stored or improperly shared.
Where things get especially ironic, is that this was the same issue the FBI - under Comey - investigated in 2015-16 about Clinton's private email server, at the time the most sensitive and controversial issue of the Clinton campaign, where as secretary of State they and top aides moved classified information through insecure channels.
Ultimately, Comey concluded in July 2016 that Clinton's email practices were reckless, but that they could not recommend prosecution because FBI agents had failed to find enough evidence that they intended to violate felony statutes prohibiting the transmission of classified information through insecure practices. While the news initially was loved by Democrats as it let Hillary get off scott-free from any potential criminal probe, Comey's subsequent decision to restart the FBI probe into Clinton's email server one week before the election is what eventually prompted both Hillary and John Podesta to claim that James Comey was one of the two factors that cost Clinton the presidency... along with the "Russian hacking" of course.
The only problem is that while there is yet no evidence of Russian hacking, suddenly with the factual emergence of Comey's transgression, questions may emerge not only into the ex-FBI chief's actions and motives, but whether the FBI's clearance of Clinton's use of an email server under Comey was proper after all...
* * *
So what happens next? According to The Hill, congressional investigators are likely to turn their attention to the same issues to determine if Comey mishandled any classified information in their personal memos.
In order to make an assessment, congressional investigators will have to tackle key questions, such as:
Where and how were the memos were created, such as whether they were written on an insecure computer or notepad.
Where and how the memos were stored, such as inside their home, their briefcase or an insecure laptop.
Were any memos shown to private individuals without a security clearance and did those memos contain any classified information
When was it determined by the government that the memos contained classified information, before Comey took them and shared one or after.
One avenue for answering those questions is for a panel like Senate Intelligence, House Intelligence or Senate Judiciary to refer the matter to the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the inspector general, or to the Director of National Intelligence and its inspector general. One thing is certain: the near-future will see many more of Comey's sworn Congressional testimonies, and the vendetta between Trump and Comey is about to not only be rekindled but escalate to previously unseen levels. For an appetizer of what's to come, look closely at Trump's Twitter feed once the president learns the news of Comey's alleged transgressions.
El Shaddai is a striking game, with its constantly shifting art style and biblically inspired story. Its action-oriented gameplay blends 2D and 3D perspectives, and the combat feels surprisingly solid. It's a rare new IP that actually takes some creative risks, and it's one that has some solid pedigree behind it—Sawaki Takeyasu, who worked on games such as Okami, is the game's lead designer.
Already available in Japan, El Shaddai is descending upon North America today, so Ars spoke with Takeyasu to learn a little more about what we can expect from the adventures of Enoch.
When you play the game or start watching a trailer, it's the visuals that hit you first. The world surrounding Enoch—the main character in the game—is constantly moving and the art style seems as though it's always shifting. There are visual references ranging from Japanese woodblock prints to anime and manga, but there's also quite a bit of surrealism.
"My approach to creating El Shaddai's visual style was, in some ways, a journey of personal discovery," Takeyasu told Ars. "Because I was tasked with illustrating a world unlike anything that anyone living on Earth has seen, I knew that I had to forge a visual identity that was not completely based on an existing style. First, some of the ideas come from deep within my own head. I've been dreaming of directing a game for a very long time, and some of the more abstract or surreal ideas that might not have fit in a more traditional game were finally able to express themselves in El Shaddai."
The fact that world is constantly changing is a key part of the design of the game, and according to Takeyasu it actually "defines the world of El Shaddai."
The focus on the game's visual style is unsurprising given that Takeyasu themselves is an artist. So when it comes to the narrative, which is loosely based on the Book of Enoch, the idea actually came from outside the core team. According to Takeyasu, developer UTV Ignition's UK office actually suggested the idea a few years back. El Shaddai tells the story of Enoch as they set out to find seven fallen angels in order to stop a devastating flood. It's not exactly a word-for-word retelling of the story, but that's not the point.
"I was careful to maintain the overall narrative and themes from the apocryphal biblical texts, but I did take some creative liberties in order to make the story a little more relatable for modern players," Takeyasu told Ars. "Since these allegories are part of the oral tradition and were constantly being changed over time, I felt that I had some freedom to add tiny elements to the story by modernizing it a bit."
Though the focus may be on art and story, El Shaddai is, after all, a game, so how it plays is important, too. And from the time we spent with the game's demo it appears to be a pretty solid combination of 2D platforming and 3D action. Takeyasu calls the gameplay "El Shaddai's secret strength," but does worry that the eccentric visual style could be a turn-off for some players who would otherwise enjoy the gameplay.
"If you are someone who has a negative reaction to the game's austere art style, I fear that you might never try the gameplay—and that would be unfortunate," they explained.
You can try it yourself with a demo available on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, while the full game is available in stores today. And while Takeyasu has their expectations tempered and isn't expecting El Shaddai to reach the same level of commercial success of past games, they do believe that there's potential for the game to strike a chord with players in the West.
"You never know," they said, "perhaps a taste of something completely new and different is what gaming needs right now."
Cristiano Ronaldo warned by Portuguese surgeon that they are risking their Real Madrid future by playing at the World Cup
Cristiano Ronaldo limped out of Portugal training with knee injury
Real Madrid superstar has been suffering from thigh and knee problems
Portugal lost 4-0 to Germany in their opening World Cup game
Pepe is facing a three-game ban, Fabio Coentrao has been ruled out for the rest of tournament and there are injury concerns over Almeida and Patricio
Cristiano Ronaldo was warned by their doctor that they risk threatening their career by playing on for Portugal at the World Cup.
The Real Madrid superstar is struggling with a knee injury but is under pressure to lead their team into Sunday's crucial clash with the USA after the 4-0 opening defeat to Germany.
According to Spanish online newspaper El Confidencial, Portuguese surgeon Jose Carlos Noronha told the 29-year-old: ‘Let your knee rest, or your future is in danger', to which Ronaldo reportedly replied: 'I'm the one that says whether I'm playing or not.'
Ronaldo was pictured limping out of training with their knee heavily strapped.
There had been serious doubts over the Real Madrid superstar's fitness ahead of the tournament, after a thigh problem and tendonitis in their knee forced them to miss training and two warm-up matches.

Ronaldo declared themselves '100 per cent' fit on the eve of Portugal's opening 4-0 demolition at the hands of Germany but, although they managed to play the entire game, they were largely peripheral and failed to change the course of the result.
It now appears that the Ballon d'Or winner has suffered a recurrence of their knee problems after receiving treatment during a training session in Campinas.
Ronaldo was taken through a series of stretches before having their left knee bandaged with an ice pack and helped off the field 30minutes before training finished. Ronaldo watched the rest of the session from the sidelines.
Portugal are already without defender Pepe after a rush of blood to the head saw them face a possible three-match ban for aggressively confronting Thomas Muller in the opening game.
Fellow Real Madrid defender Fabio Coentrao has been ruled out for the rest of the World Cup with a thigh injury while there are also injury doubts over Hugo Almeida and Rui Patricio.
Portugal faces the USA o 22 June in a must win game in Group G. Until then, Portugal fans are likely to be waiing with baited breath to find if their talisman is fit to lead them.

The Rolling Stones have announced they are to give a free concert in Cuba later this month.
A band spokesperson said the show in the capital Havana on 25 March was "the first open air concert in Cuba by a British rock band".
The Stones are currently on a Latin American tour due to end on 17 March in Mexico City.
The Havana gig will come three days after an historic visit to Cuba by US President Barack Obama.
In a statement, The Rolling Stones said: "We have performed in many special places during our long career, but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too."

Rock music was marginalised in Cuba for political reasons after the Cuban revolution in the 1950s which saw Fidel Castro come to power.
In 2001, Manic Street Preachers became the biggest British rock band to play in the country, putting on a show at Havana's Karl Marx Theatre which was attended by the Cuban president.
The Stones' America Latina Ole tour also includes shows in Brazil, Peru and Colombia.
The Havana gig will be filmed by director Paul Dugdale, who has previously worked with One Direction, Adele and Coldplay.
RICHMOND, Va. — Emmy Sumpter, a 5th grade student at St. Catherine's School in Richmond, has been sitting on a secret for 10-months.
In January, the 10-year-old girl, won their episode of Chopped Junior. That episode finally aired this week.
Sumpter's filet mignon and chorizo meatball dish earned them a $10,000 prize. Not bad for girl who does not eat meat.
“She's been a vegetarian their whole life,” Emmy's mother Erica said.
When the judges asked how Emmy knew their meal was tasty without ever tasting it, they said they cooked for their brothers at home and they always asked for seconds. Them brothers, by the way, are 250-pound college football players.
Now that she's back home and able to talk about their big win, Emmy has big plans for them winnings.
Emmy plans to take some of the money and use it to help feed the homeless in Richmond.
JNS.org – Why do half of French Jews want to leave France? Because the recent rise of violent antisemitism has made French Jews justifiably concerned about their personal safety.
A University of Oslo study published in June is one of the most methodologically sophisticated and comprehensive reports exploring the growth of Europe's antisemitism problem.
Authored by Dr. Johannes Due Enstad of the Center for Research on Extremism, the study documents violent antisemitism from 2005-2015, analyzing seven countries: France, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Russia.
According to the study, many European Jews feel unsafe as a direct consequence of violent antisemitism, and — as a result — one in five Jews in Sweden and the UK, one in four in Germany, and half of the Jews in France have considered emigrating. In 2015, 10,000 Western European Jews departed for a new life in Israel — the largest number leaving Europe since 1948.
The study found that there has been a consistently elevated level of antisemitism in Europe during the last two decades as compared to the 1990s.
French Jews are more likely than German, Swedish and British Jews to have personally experienced a violent attack in the final five years covered by the study. Although the incidence of antisemitism in France is the highest, reports about personal attacks during the study's final five years in Swedish and German Jews is not far behind. The largest gap in antisemitism is between British Jews and Jews living in Norway, Denmark and Russia.
According to the report, Jews in France and Sweden are more likely to not attend Jewish events or visit Jewish sites because they do not feel safe. More than half of the Jews in France and Sweden avoid wearing, carrying or displaying things that would cause others to recognize them as Jews, according to the study. This behavior does not rise to the same levels in Germany and the UK, but substantial numbers of Jews in those countries also avoid doing things in public that would label them as Jews out of fear for their safety.
Among French Jews, the elevated level of fear probably comes from France having experienced more violent, dramatic and fatal antisemitic incidents than other European countries. The barbarous attack on a Jewish school in 2012 in Toulouse — where three Jewish children and a rabbi were killed — undoubtedly contributed greatly to the insecurity of France's Jews. Mohammed Merah, the 23-year-old terrorist who carried out the Toulouse attack, said they wanted to kill Jews because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
More recently, the head of the Jewish community of Marseille — France's second-largest city — told their fellow community members not to appear in public in any way that would identify them as Jews.
And who is responsible for the attacks on Jews in Europe? In every country studied, except for Russia, the perpetrators are disproportionately of Muslim background. A British study cited in the University of Oslo report notes that the proportion of Muslim perpetrators often increases in the wake of “trigger events” in the Middle East.
In what might be considered a clumsy attempt to downplay antisemitism there, German authorities do not classify anti-Israeli incidents as antisemitism. This results in absurdity. If any country should know better, it should be Germany.
The only country in the study where antisemitic incidents are not disproportionately perpetrated by Muslims is Russia, and — according to the study — Jews do not fear to express their Jewish identity when appearing in public there. This appears to perplex the study's author, as Russia contains both large Jewish and Muslim populations.
Yet, in my view, the issue is easily resolved. In Russia, the large Muslim and Jewish populations live in the same country, but are generally separated by a vast expanse of land. Most Muslims live in the Eurasian Caucasus region, while most Jews live in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. This isn't the case in the other European countries profiled in the Oslo report.
Summary
Define library APIs to make it convenient to create instances of collections and maps with small numbers of elements, so as to ease the pain of not having collection literals in the Java programming language.
Goals
Provide static factory methods on the collection interfaces that will create compact, unmodifiable collection instances. The API is deliberately kept minimal.
Non-Goals
It is not a goal to provide a fully-general "collection builder" facility that, for example, lets the user control the collection implementation or various characteristics such as mutability, expected size, loading factor, concurrency level, and so forth.
It is not a goal to support high-performance, scalable collections with arbitrary numbers of elements. The focus is on small collections.
It is not a goal to provide unmodifiable collection types. That is, this proposal does not expose the characteristic of unmodifiability in the type system, even though the proposed implementations are actually unmodifiable.
It is not a goal to provide "immutable persistent" or "functional" collections.
Motivation
Java is often criticized for its verbosity. Creating a small, unmodifiable collection (say, a set) involves constructing it, storing it in a local variable, and invoking add() on it several times, and then wrapping it. For example,
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(); set.add("a"); set.add("b"); set.add("c"); set = Collections.unmodifiableSet(set);
This is quite verbose, and because it cannot be expressed in a single expression, static collections must be populated in static initializer blocks rather than via a more convenient field initializer. Alternatively, one can populate a collection using a copy constructor from another collection:
Set<String> set = Collections.unmodifiableSet(new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c")));
This is still somewhat verbose and also less obvious, since one has to create a List before creating the Set . Another alternative is to use the so-called "double brace" technique:
Set<String> set = Collections.unmodifiableSet(new HashSet<String>() {{ add("a"); add("b"); add("c"); }});
This uses the instance-initializer construct in an anonymous inner class, which is a bit prettier. However, it is quite obscure, and it costs an extra class at each usage. It also holds hidden references to the enclosing instance and to any captured objects. This may cause memory leaks or problems with serialization. For these reasons, this technique is best avoided.
The Java 8 Stream API can be used to construct small collections, by combining stream factory methods and collectors. For example,
Set<String> set = Collections.unmodifiableSet(Stream.of("a", "b", "c").collect(toSet()));
(The streams collectors make no guarantees about the mutability of collections they return. In Java 8, the returned collections are ordinary, mutable collections such as ArrayList , HashSet , and HashMap , but this might change in future JDK releases.)
This is somewhat roundabout, and while not obscure, it's also not very obvious. It also involves a certain amount of unnecessary object creation and computation. As is typical, Map is the outlier. Streams cannot be used this way to construct a Map , unless the value can be computed from the key, or if the stream elements contain both the key and the value.
In the past, there have been a few proposals floated to change the Java programming language to support collection literals. However, as is often the case with language features, no feature is as simple or as clean as one might first imagine, and so collection literals will not be appearing in the next version of Java.
Much of the benefit of collection literals can be gained by providing library APIs for creating small collection instances, at significantly reduced cost and risk compared to changing the language. For example, the code to create a small Set instance might look like this:
Set<String> set = Set.of("a", "b", "c");
There are existing factories in the Collections class to support the creation of empty List s, Set s, and Map s. There are also factories to produce singleton List s, Set s, and Map s that have exactly one element or key-value pair. EnumSet contains several overloaded of(...) methods that take fixed or variable numbers of arguments, for conveniently creating an EnumSet with the specified elements. However, there is no good general-purpose way of creating List s, Set s, and Map s containing objects of arbitrary types.
There are combinator methods in the Collections class for the creation of unmodifiable List s, Set s, and Map s. These don't create inherently unmodifiable collections. Instead, they take another collection and wrap it in a class that rejects modification requests, creating an unmodifiable view of the original collection. Possession of a reference to the underlying collection still allows modification. Each wrapper is an additional object, requiring another level of indirection and consuming more memory than the original collection. Finally, the wrapped collection still bears the expense of supporting mutation even if it is never intended to be modified.
Description
Provide static factory methods on the List , Set , and Map interfaces for creating unmodifiable instances of those collections. (Note that unlike static methods on classes, static methods on interfaces are not inherited, so it will not be possible to invoke them via an implementing class, nor via an instance of the interface type.)
For List and Set , these factory methods would work as follows:
List.of(a, b, c); Set.of(d, e, f, g);
These will include varargs overloads, so that there is no fixed limit on the collection size. However, the collection instances so created may be tuned for smaller sizes. Special-case APIs (fixed-argument overloads) for up to ten of elements will be provided. While this introduces some clutter in the API, it avoids array allocation, initialization, and garbage collection overhead that is incurred by varargs calls. Significantly, the source code of the call site is the same regardless of whether a fixed-arg or varargs overload is called.
For Map s, a set of fixed-argument methods will be provided:
Map.of() Map.of(k1, v1) Map.of(k1, v1, k2, v2) Map.of(k1, v1, k2, v2, k3, v3) ...
We expect that supporting small maps of up to ten key-value pairs will be sufficient to cover the majority of use cases. For larger numbers of entries, an API will be provided that will create a Map instance given an arbitrary number of key-value pairs:
Map.ofEntries(Map.Entry<K,V>...)
While this approach is analogous to the equivalent varargs APIs for List and Set , it unfortunately requires that each key-value pair be boxed. A method for boxing keys and values, suitable for static import, will make this more convenient:
Map.Entry<K,V> entry(K k, V v)
Using these methods, it will be possible to create a map with an arbitrary number of entries:
Map.ofEntries( entry(k1, v1), entry(k2, v2), entry(k3, v3), // ... entry(kn, vn));
(It might be possible to mitigate the expense of boxing by using value types in a future version of the JDK. The entry() convenience method will actually return a newly introduced concrete type that implements Map.Entry , in order to facilitate potential future migration to a value type.)
Providing APIs for creating small, unmodifiable collections satisfies a large set of use cases, and it helps keep the specification and implementations simple. Unmodifiable collections avoid the need to make defensive copies, and they are more amenable to parallel processing.
The runtime space occupied by small collections is also a strong consideration. A straightforward creation of an unmodifiable HashSet with two elements, using the wrapper APIs, would be comprised of six objects: the wrapper, the HashSet , which contains a HashMap , its table of buckets (an array), and one Node instance per element. This imposes a tremendous amount of overhead compared to the amount of data stored, and access to the data unavoidably requires multiple method calls and pointer dereferences. Implementations designed for small, fixed-sized collections can avoid most of this overhead, using a compact field-based or array-based layout. Not needing to support mutation (and knowing the collection size at creation time) also contributes to space savings.
The concrete classes returned by these factories will not be exposed as public APIs. No guarantees will be made about the runtime type or identity of the returned collection. This will allow the implementations to change over time without breaking compatibility. The only thing the caller should rely on is that the reference returned is an implementation of its interface type.
The resulting objects will be serializable. A serialization proxy object will be used as the common serialized form for the implementation classes. This will prevent information about the concrete implementations from leaking into the serialized form, thus preserving flexibility for future maintenance, and allowing the concrete implementations to change from release to release without affecting serialization compatibility.
Null elements, keys, and values will be disallowed. (No recently introduced collections have supported nulls.) In addition, prohibiting nulls offers opportunities for a more compact internal representation, faster access, and fewer special cases.
The List implementations are expected to provide fast element access by index, so they will implement the RandomAccess marker interface.
Elements stored in these collections must support typical collections contracts, including proper support for hashCode() and equals() . If an element of a Set or a key of a Map is mutated in a way that affects its hashCode() or equals() methods, the behavior of the collection could become unspecified.
Once constructed and safely published, these collection instances will be safe for concurrent access by multiple threads.
The JDK will be searched for potential sites where these new APIs can be used. These sites will be updated to use the new APIs as time and schedule permit.
Alternatives
Language changes have been considered several times, and rejected:
The language proposals were set aside in preference to a library-based proposal as summarized in this message.
The Google Guava libraries have a rich set of utilities for creating immutable collections, including a builder pattern, and for creating a wide variety of mutable collections. The Guava libraries are very useful and general but are perhaps overkill for inclusion into the Java SE Platform. This proposal is similar to a proposal from Stephen Colebourne lambda-dev, 19 Feb 2014 and includes some ideas from the Guava immutable collection factory methods.
The Map.fromEntries() approach for initializing a Map with an arbitrary number of entries is not ideal, but it seems to be the least bad of the alternatives. Its advantages are that it is type-safe, it has keys and values adjacent in the syntax, the number of entries is known at compile time, and it is suitable for use as a field initializer. However, it involves boxing, and it is rather verbose. Several alternatives were considered, and they all introduced tradeoffs that seemed to make them worse than the current proposal.
Static factory methods on concrete collection classes (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet) have been removed from this proposal. They seem like they are useful, but in practice they tend distract developers from using the factory methods for the immutable collections. There is a small set of use cases for initializing a mutable collection instance with a predefined set of values. It's usually preferable to have those predefined values be in an immutable collection, and then to initialize the mutable collection via a copy constructor.
There is another wrinkle, which is that static methods on classes are inherited by subclasses. Suppose a static factory method HashMap.of() were to be added. Since LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap, it would be possible for application code to call LinkedHashMap.of(). This would end up calling HashMap.of(), not at all what one would expect! One way to mitigate this is to ensure that all concrete collection implementations have the same set of factory methods, so that inheritance doesn't occur. Inheritance would still be an issue for user-defined subclasses of the concrete collections.
Testing
There will be the usual set of unit tests in the JDK regression test suite, and JCK tests for the public APIs. The serialized forms may also be covered by the JCK.
A set of size and performance tests will be developed. In contrast to typical goals of comparing to baseline measurements, these tests will compare the new collection implementations to existing ones. The expectation is that the new collections will consume less heap space, both in terms of fixed overhead and on a per-element basis. In some cases the new collections may be slower, however, because of the different internal representation as compared to the existing collections. Any such slowdown should be reasonable. Although there are no specific performance goals, being 10x slower is unacceptable. In addition, the new collections should maintain consistent performance as the number of elements is increased. Finally, the measurements will establish baseline performance figures against which future changes should be compared.
Cruz and Kasich now cling to dirty, backroom tricks to steal the nomination from Trump during the National Convention.
(The Real Agenda) Trump is a political outsider, a showman who knows very well how internal politics works, so they run their own race.
The New York real estate mogul is unstoppable in the race for the Republican nomination.
Last night, they won emphatically in primaries celebrated in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
The billionaire candidate for the White House has exceeded all expectations and is now clearer than ever that they will be the winner at the Republican convention in July in Cleveland.
Only a political conspiracy of unpredictable consequences could prevent their presidential candidacy for the Grand Old Party. Trump's plan is to reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates to avoid a second or third round. Last night, they took a great leap in that direction.
It is important to underline that Trump, the anti-establishment Republican man, has defeated 16 Establishment-run candidates who counted on multi-million dollar budgets.
They did not achieve their objective of deterring the party base, seduced by Trump's direct and aggressive speech. Their opponents, including Goldman Sachs-backed, Ted Cruz, and governor John Kasich's desperately attempted to unify efforts to defeat Trump but their alliance did not last 24 hours.
On the contrary, Trump has won in the five states with better results than the polls predicted. The first projections Trump granted them more than 60% of the vote in Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island and more than 50% in Pennsylvania and Maryland.
Even before last night's wins, Trump had more votes than their two rivals combined. Last night the big loser was Ted Cruz, who was overtaken by John Kasich in four of the five states that celebrated primaries.
“We will defeat Hillary easily,” Trump said in New York. “I consider myself the presumptive nominee,” they said later. The presumptive nominee in US electoral jargon, is a candidate whose nomination is inevitable due to their delegate and public support advantage, but which lacks the official blessing of the party. Mathematically, Trump is miles away from their opponents, who, for all intents and purposes have been eliminated from the contest. Yet, Trump still needs to close it up by getting to the magic number of 1,237 before the July convention.
Now, there are 14 primaries left before 14 June. The next key date is May 3, when the state of Indiana, an rural and industrial heart of the USA will decide who should be its nominee. Finally, on June 7 in California, the most populous state in the country, and the one that distributes more delegates in the primaries, will get to have its say.
Although it is not time for Trump's coronation yet, that day seems to be getting closer. It has been a long and tense process, in which both parties have faced grassroots discontent with the elites: in the Republican Party, the rebellion has triumphed; in the Democratic Party, it has not.
The time comes for the defeated to grieve, to assume they have no options to beat the favorites. Trump has 950 of the 1,237 delegates needed to be nominated. Their nearest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, has 560 delegates. At this time in the game, that is a gigantic difference that will most likely make it impossible for Cruz to get back into the race.
In the Democratic camp, the favorite Hillary Clinton has won four of the states that held primaries, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware, but Sanders has returned to embitter their night by defeating them in Rhode Island.

Nearly half of Android devices are vulnerable to an attack that could replace a legitimate app with malicious software that can collect sensitive data from a phone.
Google, Samsung, and Amazon have released patches for their devices, but 49.5 percent of Android users are still vulnerable, according to Palo Alto Networks, which discovered the problem. Google said it has not detected attempts to exploit the flaw.
A malicious application installed using the vulnerability, called “Android Installer Hijacking,” would have full access to a device, including data such as usernames and passwords, wrote Zhi Xu, a senior staff engineer with Palo Alto.
The company wrote two exploits that take advantage of the flaw, which involves how APKs (Android application packages) are installed.
The vulnerability only affects applications that are installed from a third-party app store. Security experts generally recommend using caution when downloading apps from those sources.
Apps downloaded from third parties place their APK installation files in a device's unprotected local storage, such as an SD card, Xu wrote. From there, a system application called PackageInstaller finishes the installation. The flaw allows an APK file to be modified or replaced during installation without anyone knowing.
An attack would work like this: A user downloads what appears to be a legitimate application. The application asks for certain permissions on the device. During that process, Palo Alto found it was possible to swap or modify the APK file in the background because the PackageInstaller fails to verify it, Xu wrote.
After clicking the installation button, “the PackageInstaller can actually install a different app with an entirely different set of permissions,” they wrote.
Android devices do not need to be rooted for the attack to work, although rooting does make devices more vulnerable.
When the flaw was discovered, in January 2014, close to 90 percent of all Android devices were affected. That has since dropped to 49.5 percent, but many devices have not been patched.
Palo Alto's exploits were successful against Android versions 2.3, 4.0.3 to 4.0.4, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x. The 4.4 version of Android fixes the issue. Some Android 4.3 devices may still be affected, however, since some manufacturers have not patched yet, Xu wrote.
Google has published a patch here, and Amazon recommends downloading the latest version of the Amazon AppStore, which will update its Fire devices, Xu wrote.
Palo Alto has also developed an Android app that will detect if a device is still vulnerable.
The controversy over the pending Marketplace Fairness Act (S.336/H.R.684), is dizzying. First, the big news. The Senate passed it. See Symbolic Senate Vote Demonstrates Support For Marketplace Fairness Act. But it really wasn't the Act itself but rather a budget amendment, and only in the Senate. So will it pass?
Not necessarily, but regardless, the days of tax-free clicks are numbered. The Marketplace Fairness Act doesn't impose a federal tax or even a new state tax. Online sellers are already required to collect sales tax from customers in their own states. But under the Supreme Court's 1992 holding in Quill v. North Dakota, retailers don't always have to collect.
They must collect sales tax from out-of-state customers only if they have a physical presence (store, warehouse or office) in the customer's state. Since then, a growing number of states are extending sales taxes to online retailers with in-state sales affiliates. Amazon recently started collecting tax in Pennsylvania, Texas, California and Connecticut and according to the Marketplace Fairness Act website, is now allied with supporters of the bill. eBay opposes it.
Some of the claims about the law are hyperbolic. Opponents say it would obliterate the physical presence standard, something they assert is a baseline protection shielding taxpayers from harassment by out-of-state collectors. It's hard to support that claim, although there's no question the law would help harmonize brick-and-mortar and online sales.
Another claim is that the law would force remote retailers to interrogate their customers about where they live, look up regulations in thousands of taxing jurisdictions across the country, and then collect and remit taxes for distant authorities. See Letter to Congress: Oppose the Marketplace Fairness Act! Of course, customers already must state a delivery address, and credit card companies verify them too.
Opponents also invoke ultra-complexity, claim interstate commerce will be harmed, and say online sellers will be burdened with 9,600 separate taxing jurisdictions, each with its own unique definitions, holidays, and rates. They claim the law triggers a massive expansion in state tax collection authority, dismantling a vital taxpayer protection upon which virtually all tax systems are based. Most of this is at least overstated.
The Marketplace Fairness Act seems workable, encouraging uniformity and allowing states to collect taxes that in many cases are already owed. See Online Sales Taxes Done Right. Yet the debate is so heated that passage into law still seems unlikely. Why, then, do I suggest that paying tax will soon be inevitable?
States already have the power to tax and 45 states exercise it. Many states have amended their law to define physical presence differently than in the past. Some of those laws are being tested in court. Eventually, the Supreme Court could even get in on the act. The physical presence of today might not be interpreted the same as it was in 1992 in Quill.
Besides, even where sellers aren't forced to collect sales tax at point of sale, all of us (in 45 states and DC) should be paying use tax after we click. States are getting better at enforcing it, too, including use tax reporting on income tax returns. So however the emotion-riddled debate over Marketplace Fairness ends up, the days of tax-free clicks are probably not long for this world.

Billy Graham's Son: Obama Could Learn from Putin's Homophobia
The heir to Billy Graham's evangelical throne, son Franklin Graham, is telling their flock that Vladimir Putin's state-sanctioned homophobia should serve as a lesson to President Obama.
Writing in their own Decision magazine, Graham called Obama's embrace of LGBT rights "shameful," and said they should follow in Putin's footsteps. The Russian leader signed a bill that criminalizes gay "propaganda" and their government does little to prevent antigay violence.
“Isn't it sad, though, that America's own morality has fallen so far that on this issue — protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda — Russia's standard is higher than our own?," wrote Graham, who included some caveats, saying their support for Putin wasn't unequivocal.
“In my opinion, Putin is right on [LGBT] issues,” Graham writes. “Obviously, they may be wrong about many things, but they have taken a stand to protect their nation's children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda.”
Graham leads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and often strikes a more polemic tone than their father did during the Reagan and Bush years. Read more here.
A man in Maine was arrested Monday after they dressed as a tree and blocked traffic, authorities said.
Portland police said Asher Woodworth, 30, covered themselves in evergreen branches and plopped themselves in the middle of a busy intersection about 1 p.m. as a “performance.”
Officers warned the Portland native several times to get out of the road. Woodworth cooperated at first and can be seen on video walking slowly to the sidewalk. “Keep going, buddy, you're almost there,” an officer tells him.
But then they later made their way back onto the street, prompting their arrest for obstructing a public way, Portland Police Department spokesperson Lt.

Woodworth, who has no criminal history with the Portland Police Department, was later released from jail on a $60 bail, authorities said. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Woodworth's antics amused many on social media. Police acknowledged that their performance was “odd” but also stressed that it affected safety. “It's very dangerous, especially the way their view was obstructed,” Martin said. “People might not have known there was a person inside there.”

Whilst Raúl was the big star of the Bernabéu Trophy, Kaká was most definitely the pariah. The Brazilian started in a game that holds good memories for them (he netted a hat-trick against Millionarios last year). However, it quickly turned into a nightmare.
The Bernabéu gave them their first jeers before even ten minutes had passed. Nothing was going right for Kaká, and the fans expressed the disdain they feel towards a player who is starting their fifth season at the club.
Every time the attacking midfielder touched the ball, the Bernabéu was ready and waiting to whistle at him. Nothing that they tried worked out, which increased the volume and acrimony coming from the stands.
With Ancelotti in the dugout, it was no surprise that Kaká got the chance to prove that they are still capable of the footballing prowess that Real Madrid shelled out €65 million for. However, the spectators no longer believe in resurrections or miracles. They want nothing more to do with him.
It's all going down on February 21st – Samsung will be unveiling what could be its most anticipated flagship yet a day before Mobile World Congress kicks off. Okay, so maybe every Galaxy S flagship takes the title of the most anticipated flagship before launch, but that is pretty normal considering it's the best-selling high-end smartphone series out there other than the iPhone. But where the hype for the Galaxy S7 (and Galaxy S7 edge) differs is in the huge amount of conflicting leaks that have made it hard to come to a conclusion on what the Korean giant will actually show the world at the next Unpacked event.
Now that Samsung has officially announced its plans to unveil the Galaxy S7 on February 21, we thought it would be a good idea to go over what one can expect from the device. There have been many rumors about the Galaxy S7, but at this point we have a pretty clear picture of the features the phone will offer, so let's get to it.
One of the biggest features the Galaxy S7 has been rumored to include is a pressure-sensing touchscreen, similar to Apple's 3D Touch technology. A few trustworthy sources (such as the Wall Street Journal) pointed out that such a display could be part of the S7, but oddly, we haven't heard much about it in the leaks that have made their way online recently.
Even a retina scanner is said to be a part of the package, in addition to a fingerprint sensor. It's possible the sources of these leaks don't have enough information to be talking about these aspects, and also that Samsung is keeping things tightly under wraps, but we aren't very hopeful to see the company's version of Force Touch or a retina scanner on the Galaxy S7.
What we are hopeful of seeing, and what seems to be pretty much confirmed at this point, is the return of the microSD slot, something we were the first to report a few months back. The entire 2015 went by without a single Samsung flagship offering expandable storage, and it's highly likely sales were affected considerably. Samsung even managed to make the 128GB a non-option with the Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+, so it's not surprising everyone is extremely excited that the microSD slot will be making a comeback.
The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are also expected to come with large batteries – 3,000 mAh on the regular S7 and 3,600 mAh on the 5.5-inch S7 edge, with the S7 quoted to be able to last more than 17 hours of video playback on maximum brightness. The battery won't be removable, but with such endurance most consumers shouldn't rue the fact that the battery will be fixed and inaccessible. The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge were great phones, and it would be great to see their successors fix the almost abysmal battery life that was offered by the original S6 duo.
Imaging is also set to see major changes this year, with Samsung set to make the move to a 12-megapixel camera sensor. A downgrade from the 16-megapixel sensors the company currently uses, but the new sensor is said to have impressive low-light shooting capabilities, partly because of its low f/1.7 aperture and partly because of a larger pixel size. The camera itself will not protrude as much as it does on existing flagships; all in all the camera performance should be amazing, something we have now taken for granted when it comes to a Galaxy flagship.
Under the hood, the Exynos 7420 processor is set to be replaced by the Exynos 8890 in most markets, and the Snapdragon 820 in others. The 7420 was an excellent SoC and we should see performance improve with the newer chips, in addition to improved multitasking because of 4GB of RAM (hopefully with none of the aggressive task killing of Samsung's current software). On the storage front, Samsung should offer 32GB and 64GB options, and the S7 should also come with a USB Type-C port with charging speeds of 100 minutes for the regular model.
When it comes to design, not many things are changing this time around. Both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 will look like their predecessors, but with the S7 edge to come with a 5.5-inch display (a Quad HD Super AMOLED panel). Rumor has it that both devices will also be water-resistant. It's a feature that Samsung experimented with on the Galaxy S5 and is present on the Active variants of these flagships, and it could be something that puts the S7 siblings ahead of all other flagships launched this year.
On the regular S7, the back will curve similar to how it does on the Galaxy Note 5 – not just on the left and right, but on the top and bottom as well, which should help improve grip during usage. The Edge panels on the S7 edge will offer the same feature set as that found on Marshmallow on the Galaxy S6 edge. Speaking of Marshmallow, Android 6.0.1 is sure to be running on both devices out of the box. Samsung has made a few changes to its TouchWiz UX for Marshmallow.
Samsung is even reportedly working with a few Google engineers to optimize its software and make it run even more fluidly than iOS. The status bar is now all white with new quick setting toggles, and we should see all the regular features of Android 6.0 present on these devices. Doze should be particularly useful, especially with the bigger batteries under the hood. A feature that is inspired by Apple's Live Photos could also be included.
What about that rumored Galaxy S7 edge+ though? Well, it doesn't seem like such a device will be getting announced with the S7 and S7 edge. What will be announced is Samsung's new Gear 360 virtual reality camera. It will be compatible with the S7 duo and let people create 360 degree imagery. It's the next step after the Gear VR virtual reality headset – let users create their own VR content rather than depending on regular VR content. Retail availability is tipped to begin on March 11, and as our own exclusive report revealed, the pricing isn't expected to change over the S6 and S6 edge.
We'll say it again – the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are probably the most anticipated devices in the Galaxy S lineup. If all the rumors pan out, we could be looking at smartphones that are pretty much perfect, more so than even the Galaxy Note 5. It won't exactly be surprising to see all these features make it to the two phones; after all, Samsung now has a year's worth of experience making metal and glass devices and can now focus on bringing back important functionality that it had to do away with, in its quest for that premiumness everyone had been clamoring for.
We're less than three weeks away from the official announcement, and we will be there at the Unpacked event to bring you live coverage of whatever Samsung has in store for the day. What do you think? Are you looking forward to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, and do you think these are the devices that will bring Samsung to the glory that it couldn't achieve last year?

House to push for answers on why GM failed to recall cars despite knowledge of flaws ultimately linked to 13 deaths
Regulators and GM executives will come under fire Tuesday as Congress pushes for answers on why the auto company failed to recall over a million cars despite evidence it knew of fatal flaws in their design.
Over the weekend the House committee on energy and commerce released new details of its investigation into the events leading up to GM's recall of 2.6m vehicles for ignition-switch defects now linked to 13 deaths.
The latest revelations come as GM's newly installed chief executive officer Mary Barra prepares for a two-day grilling over the scandal in Washington. On Tuesday Barra and acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) administrator David Friedman will appear before the House committee. On Wednesday, they will talk to a Senate panel.
The House committee said regulators declined to open formal investigations into complaints about the cars on two occasions and that GM dropped plans for a fix in 2005 because it would have taken too long and cost too much money.
Government officials have been examining more than 200,000 pages of documents from GM and approximately 6,000 pages from the NHTSA. The committee found that in 2007 the federal regulator decided not to open an inquiry even after its own investigators had identified four fatal crashes, 29 complaints and 14 other reports related to ignition issues and problems with disabled airbags in Chevrolet Cobalts and other cars.
The agency again declined to open a full investigation after more issues with airbags surfaced in 2010.
According to the committee's timeline, GM knew of issues with the ignition switches in pre-production models of the Saturn Ion in 2001. In November 2004, GM engineers reported that ignition defects meant Chevrolet Cobalts could be "keyed off with knee while driving".
But in March 2005 a GM project engineering manager closed an investigation into the issue, saying the "lead time for all solutions is too long", "the tooling cost and piece price are too high" and none of the proposed fixes "represents an acceptable business case".
“The documents produced to the committee to date do not explain the criteria for an ‘acceptable business case' and how the decision was made in this case,” the committee said in its memo.
Instead of issuing a recall, GM issued a bulletin to dealers with the subject line: “Information on Inadvertent Turning Off of Key Cylinder, Loss of Electrical System and No DTCs [diagnostic trouble code].”
The bulletin informed dealers about the ignition issue and recommended potential remedies including removing heavy items from key rings.
Earlier this month the families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 car crash involving a 2005 Cobalt sued GM for negligence and fraud for not disclosing facts about the defects. Natasha Weigel, 18, and Amy Rademaker, 15, died in the crash. Megan Phillips, the car's driver, suffered permanent brain damage.
The lawsuit is one of hundreds that GM could potentially face over fatalities linked to ignition and airbag issues. Barra said earlier this month that “terrible things” had happened at the company and said the recalls would cost GM $300m in the first quarter.
GM is not commenting ahead of the congressional hearings. Over the weekend the NHTSA said it had “reviewed data from a number of sources in 2007, but the data we had available at the time did not warrant a formal investigation.” The agency said it is "aggressively investigating" the recall and new information provided by GM.
David Johnson, chairperson of crisis management consultancy Strategic Vision, said this week's hearings were high stakes for GM and Barra. “This is very damaging in the short term for GM, they have been trying to demonstrate that they are a new company after the bailout. For Barra it is going to be about what they knew and when. When did they find out about these issues and what did they do?”

The Cyberpunk 2077 release date has been revealed!
In an interview with Gamespot, Company CEO Marcin Iwinski stated that the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are being developed independently of each other with separate development teams so the Cyberpunk 2077 release date was not affected by the Witcher 3 release date delay.
"Cyberpunk 2077 is developed by a separate team within CD Projekt Red, so the development of Cyberpunk 2077 is not really affected," they said.
Marcin Iwinski did go on to admit the two projects do share a few developers. "In order to ship a huge RPG we do use help of certain team members between teams. It works this way between Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3," they said, before promising big things from the still largely under-wraps Cyberpunk RPG.
"We are working hard to deliver an outstanding RPG and rest assured, that all the learnings on The Witcher 3 are being applied to the Cyberpunk 2077 development," commented Iwinski.
Cyberpunk 2077 will be based on the Cyberpunk series of tabletop role-playing games. It is due for release in 2015 currently only announced for PC, but is said to 'most probably' arrive on 'next-gen' consoles.
Due to the similar 2015 release dates of Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3, it has been rumored that the two games will have almost simultaneous release dates.
CD Projekt Red denied the rumors though, stating that the Witcher 3 release is the priority and that Cyberpunk 2077 will come later.
CD Projekt Red describes the game as a "multi-thread, non-linear story designed for mature players" set in the sprawling metropolis of Night City and its surroundings.
The Witcher 3 release date was delayed to February 24, 2015 while the Cyberpunk 2077 release date is on Fall 2015 with some rumors saying the exact Cyberpunk 2077 release date is on October 2015.

PHOENIX -- Authorities say a man has been arrested for allegedly fatally running over their girlfriend in the parking lot of a Phoenix club in front of their two children.
Police say 26-year-old Ricardo Garcia is being held on suspicion of one count of first-degree murder and four counts of aggravated assault.
They say 28-year-old Anjelica Moraga died of their injuries at a hospital early Sunday.
According to police, Moraga and Garcia argued late Saturday night outside the club and they rammed into their girlfriend's vehicle, causing minor damage.
Inside the car were two other adults and Moraga's two children.
Police say Moraga was outside of their vehicle in the parking lot when Garcia allegedly ran them over with their car. Garcia then allegedly fled the scene.
A short while later, police were called to an alley where Moraga's family had located Garcia and were fighting with them in the car, reports CBS affiliate KPHO. Police arrested Garcia without further incident.
It was unclear Monday if they have a lawyer yet.
The Global Retail Theft Barometer 2011
GLOBAL RETAIL THEFT BAROMETER 2011
Shrinkage rises to $119 billion in 2011, up 6.6% since 2010.
Shrinkage an average of 1.45% in 43 countries compared to 1.36% in 2010.
35.9% of retailers reported that actual and attempted shoplifting rose last year and 24% suffered higher employee theft.
The costs of retail crime-plus-loss prevention were $128 billion in 2011 equivalent to $199.89 per family. ($66.27 per individual).
Key Results
After a dip in shrinkage last year (2009-10), shrinkage has risen in the 12-months ending June 2011 as a result of increased shoplifting, higher employee fraud, and organized retail crime (ORC). Total global shrink in 2011 cost retailers $119.092 billion, an average of 1.45% of global retail sales. The shrinkage rate was an average of 6.6% higher than 2010. Last year shrinkage was $108.092 billion (1.36% of sales), adjusted for the inclusion of South Korea and exchange rate changes. 'Shrinkage' or 'shrink' is inventory loss caused by crime or administrative error. In this report it is measured as a percentage of retail sales value.
The Survey
The GRTB 2011 survey of major retailers in all business sectors in 43 countries provided 1,187 useable responses, 25%., with combined sales of $984 billion.
The results are grossed up to be equivalent the size of every national retail market surveyed
Causes of Shrinkage
The causes of shrinkage reflect retailer perceptions of the causes of shrinkage in their own businesses. Internal error including mispricing, invoicing errors and administrative failure cost $19.4 billion, representing 16.2% of total shrinkage.
Dishonest employees were thought to cause $41.7 billion (35.0% of shrinkage) of losses and customer theft, including shoplifting and organized retail crime, cost retailers $51.5 billion in 2011 (43.2% of total shrinkage) compared to $45.4 billion in 2010. This was a year-on-year increase of 13.4% in customer theft.

Protesters gathered in front of LG Uplus' customer care center in Seoul, Wednesday, demanding an investigation into the suicide of one of its employees last month.
Members of the Youth Community Union, an independent workers group, claimed the telecommunications company's excessive workload and unfair treatment led the man to kill themselves on Oct. 21.
The man, who is only known by their surname Lee, worked as a counselor at its customer center in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, the union said.
"LG Uplus did not allow them to leave the office until they met certain sales quotas, which was not supposed to be their job," the union said. "As a result, they suffered an enormous amount of stress."
According to a suicide note found by police, the company forced Lee to sell Internet phones and IPTVs up to 10 p.m. most nights, while not paying them for their extra work. The union said they were contracted to work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day.
The union also accused LG Uplus of hiding its poor labor conditions.
"Before the labor ministry came to the office on an inspection, the company educated its employees about what to say and what not to say," the union said.
Lee had also written in their final note that their situation was not at all different in most of the company's offices across the country.
"We want a thorough investigation into this case," the union said. "Until then, we will continue to hold campaigns and press conferences to let people know what happened to Lee."
"The government should do something about it and LG Uplus should be held accountable."
LG Uplus said in a statement that it will try to improve labor conditions for its employees.
Two weeks after its first known execution of a Chinese hostage, extremist group Islamic State has published a war chant in Mandarin that calls on the country's Muslims – or at least its Muslim men -- to take up arms.
The four-minute song was released Al-Hayat Media Center, Islamic State's media arm, and distributed through Twitter and messaging app Telegram on Sunday, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors and tracks radical groups online. Like many of the group's chants, known as nasheeds, the track is slickly produced and hypnotically infectious, with lyrics that extol death in service of Islam.
“We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us,” a male voice, enhanced with a digital echo, sings in the chorus. “Our dream is to die fighting on this battlefield.”
Recruitment efforts by the Middle East jihadist groups are an increasing cause for concern in the world's most populous country, though it's rare for such materials to appear in Mandarin. Most instead target members of China's Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim Uighur minority. A sporadically violent separatist movement made up of Uighurs seeks to establish an independent state in the group's homeland in the northwestern Chinese territory of Xinjiang.
In June, Islamic State released a video of an elderly man describing in a Turkic language their decision to join the group after decades of oppression in China and the death of their son in Syria. The video later shows what appear to be Uighur children in military clothing being interviewed about traveling to join Islamic State.
The recording of a nasheed in Mandarin “is yet another example of the IS seeking to broaden its reach and support base,” SITE said.
China foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing on Monday that they were not aware of the song. "We hope we can safeguard the citizens of every country through international cooperation," they added.
It's not clear whom the group might be trying to reach. China's Hui ethnic group – which is predominately Muslim and numbers more than 10 million – is Mandarin-speaking but has traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam. Mandarin is also the dominant language for some younger Uighurs.
China has been on guard against terrorism since knife-wielding extremists killed more than 30 at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming in 2014. On Monday, the website of the Communist Party-controlled China Youth Daily newspaper said police in central China's Shanxi province had apprehended four members of a Uighur extremist group who were planning attacks in the area. Photos of warning notices about the four suspects had earlier circulated online, the newspaper said.
In November, Islamic State announced that it had murdered Fan Jinghui, a Chinese national it had been holding for ransom. The news was met with anxiety inside China as many Internet users questioned the government's ability to protect its citizens abroad.
Below is a rough China Real Time translation of the lyrics:
We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us
To die fighting on this battlefield is our dream.
We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us
To die fighting on this battlefield is our dream.
A century of slavery, leaving that shameful memory.
Deep in ignorant slumber, the nightmare continues on.
A century of slavery, leaving that shameful memory.
Deep in ignorant slumber, the nightmare continues on.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us
To die fighting on this battlefield is our dream.
To this day we guard the Koran and the Sunnah.
No power can stop our progress.
To this day we guard the Koran and the Sunnah.
No power can stop our progress.
To fight against those who fight you is Great Allah's command.
To take up weapons in rebellion is Muhammad's order.
To fight against those who fight you is Great Allah's command.
To take up weapons in rebellion is Prophet Muhammad's order
We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us
To die fighting on this battlefield is our dream.
The brilliance of Islam is etched in history. The purpose of our struggle is to let it shine again.
The brilliance of Islam is etched in history. The purpose of our struggle is to let it shine again.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken
Take up your faith and courage, fulfill the lost doctrine.
We are Mujahid, our shameless enemy panics before us
To die fighting on this battlefield is our dream.

Nurses are preparing for a big baby boom on Fort Hood this summer.
Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center typically sees 180-200 births per month. But, those figures are about to spike.
Major Anne Daniele, the officer in charge at the Army hospital, estimates an increase of 50 to 80 extra births per month this summer -- bringing the total to somewhere between 230 and 280 births per month.
"This [summer] is definitely higher than we've seen before," Major Daniele said.
Nobody seemed to know what caused the increase in births. But, Metroplex Hospital also anticipates an increase after seeing more births this year than last year.
"I wish I knew that answer," Metroplex Maternal Child Health Director Tabitha Poole said. "That is a hot topic and I don't know the answer. But, we are glad to have them and hope they continue to increase."
In the meantime, Fort Hood medical officials said they were evaluating their maternity processes to see if anything needed to be streamlined to best handle the higher patient load.
Official football tailgates on gamedays, along with any other social events, will have to be put on hold for the brothers of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for the foreseeable future.
The Ohio State Theta chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, commonly referred to as SAE, was given a cease-and-desist order from the Office of Student Life this week while the university investigates possible violations of the student code of conduct policy.
“The action permits Sigma Alpha Epsilon to continue only essential activities, but requires prior approval,” David Isaacs, spokesperson for the Office of Student Life said in a statement. “An investigation of possible violations of the Code of Student Conduct is currently underway.”
Details about the nature of the violation are not immediately clear.
Miles Turner, chapter president of SAE, declined to comment on the investigation and instead direct questions to its national headquarters, based in Evanston, Illinois.
“Our headquarters takes every allegation seriously, and we are performing our own separate and immediate investigation as part of our organization's protocol,” SAE Director of Communications Brandon Weghorst said in a statement.
SAE's statement did, however, cast doubt on the allegations put forth by the university.
“At this time, we cannot substantiate any of the allegations made to the University but will continue our review,” Weghorst said.
This is not the first time the Theta chapter of SAE has caught heat from the university. In 2001, the chapter had its charter revoked and was forced to leave campus for two years following repeated violations of the student code of conduct.
“The SAE chapter was found to have committed multiple violations of university rules governing conduct of Greek organizations. These violations included three separate violations of the Interfraternity Council/Womens Panhellenic Association Alcohol Policy,” the announcement of SAE's revocation from 2001 read.
“In addition, over the past 15 months, numerous allegations have been made about chapter members participating in incidents that created substantial threat to other persons and property, including launching beer bottles and frozen water balloons at pedestrians, cars and nearby facilities.”
Ohio State's decision came after the university worked with the chapter for over a year to align it with university and Interfraternity Council values.
“Despite repeated counseling with university staff, the young men of SAE continued to disregard not only the rules, but more important, the underlying values of both the university and their own organization,” the 2001 announcement read. “Under the circumstances, I believe it is best to withdraw university recognition of SAE for a period of time.”
In 2014, months after being named the “deadliest fraternity” in the country by Bloomberg News, SAE eliminated its pledging process for all chapters across the country.
Pledging is the time in between receiving a bid to join and being officially initiated as a member of the fraternity and is commonly associated with hazing incidents.
In lieu of the now eliminated pledging tradition, SAE introduced “The True Gentleman Experience” instead.

WHEAT RIDGE, Colorado-- Donald Trump has a new campaign manager. But it's the youngest "manager" on their staff that's getting attention.
Weston Imer is just 12-year-old, and he's already involved in one of the most important elections of our lifetime in one of the most important counties in the battleground state of Colorado.
Weston is working to get out the vote to people of all ages in their community. But it hasn't been easy. Weston says they were bullied at school last year, and admits sitting behind a desk in a campaign office isn't the "coolest" thing to do. They say they love it, though, and hopes to inspire others.
They said, "Get involved! That's what I'm going to say. Get involved, kids need to be educated."
On paper, Weston's mom is the official campaign coordinator, but they hope giving their son so much responsibility will teach other parents to do the same with their kids, both Democrats and Republicans.
Weston is hoping to continue their role in the campaign until school starts in September. But overall, this campaign is just a preview of what's to come for Weston.
When asked if they want to be president one day, they exclaimed, "Definitely! 2040, watch for me! 2040 Imer and Barron Trump, if you are watching, in 2040 I'll take you as my running mate!"
Barron Trump is Donald Trump's 10-year-old son. So far, he's stayed out of the political limelight.
Replace WordPress Cron with Real Cron for Site Speed
How to replace your WordPress cron job with a server cron job to increase site speed.
We can all relate to a slow WordPress website with a very long request times. Most of us have also seen the WordPress “Missed Schedule” error message for content such as future scheduled posts that were supposed to be published but weren't. The list goes on and the WordPress cron job is the cause.
Inexplicably slow WordPress sites with high CPU usage is frustrating. You need a break so let's fix this!
How Does the WordPress Cron Work?
In reality, the WordPress cron is a system that has a set list of tasks, each with a time when it needs to be executed and it's once or recurring status.
When the time comes – or has lapsed – the WordPress cron executes the task and continues with the list.
Visitor traffic is required for WordPress to keep track of time and scheduled tasks to execute with the cron.
Why Would the WordPress Cron Fail?
There are many reasons why a cron job could either fail or be delayed:
Server overloaded and as a result the cron cannot execute.
Not enough or not frequent enough visitors on the website.
A bug or conflict caused by a plugin or combination of plugins.
and so on…
Benefits of Using a Server Cron Job Instead
Replacing your WordPress cron job with a real, server cron job is beneficial in many ways:
Reliable, accurate cron jobs that fire on time as expected
Make your WordPress website faster to your users/visitors
Eliminate high CPU usage caused by WordPress
Both benefits are important but the 2nd one is especially important.
Unfortunately, when someone visits your website and the WordPress cron has a task to run at that moment, it will run that task on the visitor's time, increasing the time of the request or even ending up giving that visitor a blank page if the task cannot complete.
So you take the cron jobs off your visitors and relaying it to the server side of things.
How to Replace the WordPress Cron?
This is quick and easy, let me show you how! 2 Steps
1. Disable the WordPress Cron Job
First, disable the WordPress cron job by opening your wp-config.php file and placing the following line of code into it at any place inside the opening PHP tag.
The code simply defines DISABLE_WP_CRON to true which WordPress knows of and will then not run cron jobs itself but wait for them to be called instead.
2. Create a Server Cron Job
With no WordPress cron job running anymore, you need to setup a server cron job to replace it. The server cron job will not actually run the scheduled tasks directly, it is just doing the job that your visitors have done up until now, telling WordPress what the date and time is so that it can check if tasks should be fired.
The instructions on setting up a cron job on your hosting will depend on your hosting control panel interface. I would say the most common control panel for hosting is cPanel which is used by most large hosting companies these days and it is great.
So login to your cPanel and go to Advanced > Cron Jobs.
Then under “Add New Cron Job” you can create the cron job. I recommend that you use an interval of 5 to 15 minutes depending on your website and what it does. Use the “Common Settings” drop down menu to select your interval for the cron job.
The best command to use is WGET but you can use other, similar commands if you prefer to change it. Here is the command that you'll use:
Be sure to change out the www.yourwebsite.com part with your own domain or URL to your WordPress home page.
WordPress Multi-Site Server Cron Job
Unfortunately the WordPress cron has to be run individually for each site/blog on the WordPress multi-site network.
Because of that, you'll need to repeat the above process for each site/blog on the network. Or alternatively, you can create a new file named wp-cron-multi-site.php in the WordPress root (same location as the current wp-cron.php file) and put the following code into it:
Then simply change the cron tab command in cPanel to this:
WordPress Server Cron Job Not Working?
Unfortunately some hosting providers have restrictions on the interval and some hosting providers do not even allow the WGET command to be executed. Sad but true and it is a common issue. You have 3 possible solutions here:
Contact your hosting provider and ask them to enable WGET or provide an alternative Get proper WordPress hosting that won't restrict you in silly ways. Use a 3rd party, online cron job service such as EasyCron for your cron jobs.
And that's it, you're done! You've replaced the WordPress cron job with a real, server cron job. I hope that you found this useful and that it will increase the speed of your WordPress website drastically.

First nate silver has numerous times said that all historical data suggests a switch from rv to lv should not be worth more than 1.5 to 2 percent change. In fact, the polls that whiffed the most in 2008 and 2010 were ones in which their likely voter margin was greater than that. Both Ras and Gallup had better numbers in their RV models than LV because of this.
Second, A president does not lose an election when their approval rating is 53 percent and their disapproval is 42! It does not happen. That is historical fact, and can be seen in not just presidential races but state races.
Third, the 3 day approval rating keeps getting higher than Romney high point numbers fade. That means that most likely Obama will make up a lot of ground as those thur, friday numbers go away.
fourth, the house of ras has it tied. Why is this significant? the problem with the house of ras is that by weighing for party id they dont capture a true snapshot of the electorate. but at the same time bc of this their poll is less inclined to fast movements in one direction or another with the news cycle. what their poll tells you isnt the state of the race, but the fact that obama hasnt lost democratic or independent voters. Romney has just gained repubs back in the fold.
keep calm and carry on. As dem enthusiasm comes back and romney high fades, this race will adjust to where it always should have been, a 2-3 point obama advantage. It's going to be close but we are still the favorite.
Update: someone asked about the approval rating argument here is a link to nate explaining the hisorical data
http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/...
basically no incumbent has ever lost with an approval rating of 49 or higher.
two things to remember as to why there is a difference between approval rating and voting preferences. one the approval rating is 3 day rolling average and has lost the thur sample. as we lose the thur and fri samples from the 7 day tracker we will see the two numbers come closer together.
second, and more encouraging for dems, is that it implicitly implies that some of those undecided voters are probably approving of obamas job. that means that we are more likely to pick them up as voters as the election gets closer. you saw this in 2004 as within the final week the approval numbers and election numbers moved toward each other. bush net approval was basically their margin of victory.
thanks everyone for recs! one final note to be positive above. Notice once again the CNN poll is Obama plus 4 lv but plus 10 rv. Like ive said and nate has said, come election day any lv screen that changes dynamics by more than 2 percent is usually flawed.
One final note to be positive above. I will write a diary later to fully explain but one thing that all polls are ignoring is that because of the great recession some states have undergone more dramatic demographic shifts than other states. The net result is that both Neveda and Colorado have increased their share of minorities in the electorate by 9 and 5 points respectively since 08. Oh and what two states had dem senators behind all the polls but yet somehow survive election day? Colorado and Neveda of course. You can put two and two together yourselves and make a logical conclusion what happened. Thanks once again. Lets gotv!
Ajmal Kasab, hanged in India for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, had never demanded mutton biryani and the story was manufactured to stop an emotional wave in favour of the Pakistani militant in the media, the public prosecutor in the case said on Friday.
Ujjwal Nikam, the high-profile public prosecutor, said during a counter-terrorism conference that they had merely said “Kasab has demanded mutton biryani”, a sentence which became the fodder for many sensational stories in the media to the effect that the government was serving the delicacy to a terrorist.
It became such an issue, they recalled, that the then Maharashtra chief minister and opposition leaders visited the Arthur Road jail to check if Kasab was actually being served mutton biryani.
Pakistani national Kasab was the lone member of the terrorist group who was captured alive during the November 2008 attack on the metropolis which left 166 people dead and many more injured.
Kasab was hanged in November 2012, nearly four years after the attack.
Going into the genesis of their statement, Nikam said during one of the court hearings, Kasab had wiped their eyes.
The media immediately flashed a breaking news, “Kasab ki aankhon mein paani (Kasab's eyes are moist).
“There were panel discussions on news channels: they are remembering their sister, Kasab is an innocent boy, he's a young boy, so they are repenting their crime.”
“This kind of emotional wave and atmosphere was needed to the stopped. So, after that, I gave a statement to the media saying Kasab has demanded mutton biryani in the jail,” they said.
What Nikam left unsaid was that after that remark there were many reports in media on Kasab's “tantrums” in jail.
As they took the audience through the nitty-gritty of the trial, Nikam recalled that Kasab called them ‘Badshah'.

The gunplay in City Councilor Tito Jackson's Roxbury neighborhood has kept them up nights searching for an answer to stop the violence. They found one, they say, in Richmond, Calif.
The small San Francisco Bay Area city pays violent young adults a stipend of between $300 and $1,000 per month for up to nine months to abandon a life of crime. It's working, they say. Crime is down in Richmond.
Jackson says they want to see if a similar pay-to-behave program can take root on the Hub's 300 most violent troublemakers. He's pitching their “disruptive” plan to the City Council. Something needs to be done, they told the Herald's Joe Dwinell, to protect city kids:
“This issue has tugged at my heart since I've been in office because my district is disproportionately hurt by violence. What are the real solutions? I've been searching for innovative ways to stop violence.
We cannot continue on the same course. We need to do something disruptive. We have to look at different models.
The Richmond model is a better economic model than locking everybody up and then locking them up again.
In light of the many things that have gone on, I wanted to do something to get ahead of what we could possibly do to head it off by this summer.
To those who want to be critical, just look at the numbers. If the state Department of Correction can spend an average of $53,000 a year on every inmate, $9,000 invested on someone who just got out of prison is money well spent. The recidivism rate — which is 50 percent — would be cut down.
You get no taxes from someone while they are locked up in prison. We need to break that cycle. We need to cut down not just on murders, but shootings, too.
Another reason why it's compelling is it could also reduce the $60 million being spent this year on overtime for police.
We have to give individuals an alternative. It's not sustainable to go in and out of jail. Most of the time they get out of prison and are homeless and unemployed. We need to support people through difficult times.
As someone who lived in this city when we had 150 murders one year in the '90s, I know how bad it can be. We need to continue to engage folks. We have to guide them to sustainability. This is a very real way to do it.
I want to live in a city of Boston where any young person on any street on a bicycle has as their greatest fear skinning their knee — not getting shot.
They were referring to the 7-year-old boy shot while riding their bike late last month in Dorchester.
“There are about 3,000 people in Boston involved in gangs, with 300 driving the violence. We need to look at the individuals who are the biggest drivers of that violence. We need to target them with street workers. We need radical change.
The objective now is how do we support this. The money could be used to land jobs, get GEDs or keep people from becoming homeless. We need to build a bridge so these individuals can turn their lives around. As for the money, maybe we can turn to the philanthropic community for help.
What Richmond is doing is something we should aggressively explore.
This could change behavior — permanently!”
The Middle East and North Africa are already some of the hottest places on Earth. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia daily high temperatures can exceed 40°C (104°F) for the entire summer. Unfortunately, it's about to get a whole lot hotter. A paper from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia today warns that by the end of the century parts of the region could be too hot for humans to survive.
The authors examined the possible impact of climate change using two different projections of greenhouse gas concentration. The first assumes that carbon emissions will be curbed by mid-century while the latter assumes that they will continue to increase. Both projections predict that by 2050 the global temperature will be close to or have already exceeded the 2°C (3.6°F) target set last year in Paris.
In the milder of the two scenarios, the number of days per year that would qualify as part of a heat wave would increase from the 15 per year on average for the region during the years 1986 to 2005, to 83 per year by mid-century. In the more drastic scenario there would be 118 heat wave days per year. By the end of the century those would increase to 104 days and 204 days, respectively.
That's a more than fivefold increase in the number of heat wave days—at a minimum. Such an occurrence would have a devastating effect on the half a billion people living in the region. A heat wave day occurs after temperatures have exceeded the 90th percentile temperature set between baseline years of 1961-1990 for six or more days.
This is not the first study to warn about the effects of climate change on the Middle East and North Africa. Organizations from the World Bank to the US National Intelligence Council (pdf) have cited the particular vulnerability of the region. One paper published last year predicted that by the end of the century the temperature in the oil-producing countries around the Persian Gulf could exceed the limits of human adaptability, even for healthy adults (pdf).
The Middle East and North Africa are already incredibly hot. Fresh water is limited. Local food crops are vulnerable to reduced rainfall. The drier it gets, the more sandstorms will force people indoors. These changes are in addition to the global effects of climate change: more severe weather, more war, and rising sea levels.
In the Middle East, climate change already has been blamed for pushing rural populations into cities, making them more dependent on imported food and vulnerable to running out of safe drinking water. Larger temperature changes could push people out of the region entirely.
The last couple years have shown that the world is pretty bad at managing large-scale migration, but that may turn out to be a mere trial-run for things to come.

The Environment Agency has issued flood alerts for every river in Somerset after heavy rainfall.
The rain on Sunday caused Taunton Deane Cricket Club to flood and most Vivary Park in Taunton has also been left underwater.
On Sunday, 230 homes in the Midsomer Norton area and 96 homes in the Taunton area were left without power but most have now been reconnected.
Homes have also been flooded in Lydeard St Lawrence, West Hatch and Bickenhall.
John Rowlands from the Environment Agency said: "We've had some high rainfall totals particularly in West Somerset over the last 24 hours.
"We've over two inches of rain, or 65 mm, it's the same on the river Tone, so those are out areas of slight concern.
Image caption The heavy rain has affected farmers with livestock on the Somerset Levels
"Because of the catchment themselves, the river Tone is a big river, we are expecting that to continue to rise, whereas in West Somerset, we will hopefully start to see the levels drop off.
The river Frome between Frome and Freshford was put on flood warning since Sunday evening until about 09:30 BST on Monday.
Flooding in the Curry Moor area on the Somerset Levels has also affected farmers with livestock.
Mary Kate Mahony from North Curry said: "We've got cattle, and my other half had them out at Curry Moor and they rang me last night on their way back from milking.
"He told me they had to get them in, and they ended up getting them at 7 o'clock last night before the area was flooded out. They needed to move them in two loads.
"They are quite big and they had a bit of a run round as they didn't want to go in."
The high winds have also forced the National Trust to close its properties at Montacute, Barrington Court, Lytes Cary and Tintinhull Manor.
'Absolute nightmare'
On Sunday, the grounds of Taunton Deane Cricket Club was left 30 cm deep in floodwater together with the neighbouring Vivary Park in the town centre.
Image caption Taunton Deane Cricket Club was about 30cm underwater after heavy rain on Sunday
Club chairperson, Jason Squire, said: "It's up to the top of my welly boots. It flooded around 11 years ago, but this is worse, so we're not expecting to play cricket here for some time, it's an absolute nightmare."
The River Tone has also burst its banks.
BBC reporter, Andrew Plant in Bradford on Tone, near Taunton, said: "It's impossible to see where the river should end and where the fields should begin.
"There are trees here underwater, halfway up their trunks, and in one direction the road is completely blocked."
Flooding has also been reported along the A38 between Taunton and Wellington, the A39 between Bridgwater and Minehead and the A359 between Mudford and Marston Magna.
Crews from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue were called out at about 06:00 BST to a report of animals trapped in pens due to flooded river banks in Glastonbury.
Firefighters have lowered the electric fences to try and encourage the animals away from the flood water.
The incident involved nine horses, two goats in water and a further five horses who were left stranded.
On Sunday there were also reports of caravans worth thousands of pounds being damaged in Burnham-On-Sea.
Le Pen visits the meat pavilion at the Rungis international food market near Paris on April 25, 2017.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate in the French presidential elections, said on Tuesday that they would ban halal slaughter of animals if they are elected on May 7, along with any other method of ritual slaughter without stunning.
Le Pen, who finished second with 21.5 percent of the vote in the first round of the elections Sunday, made the statement on halal slaughter during a campaign visit at a meat market near Paris. They did not mention shechitah, the kosher slaughter of animals, but did say they wanted to outlaw any slaughter of animals without stunning.
“Slaughter without stunning, I'm sorry, it should have special labels,” Le Pen said. “Furthermore, I think that slaughter without stunning should be prohibited.”
Le Pen stepped aside as leader of the National Front on Tuesday and will advance to the second and final round of the French presidential race as an independent candidate on May 7.
Both halal and shechitah require animals be conscious when their throats are slit — a practice that critics say is cruel but which advocates insist is more humane than mechanized methods used in non-kosher abattoirs. Muslims slaughter animals in a similar method to shechitah, albeit with fewer restrictions, to produce halal meat.
In their statement Le Pen, who has called for a shutdown of immigration from Muslim countries, a ban on public prayer and the wearing of Muslim religious symbols, referenced halal slaughter specifically.
“I would say that I think that 90 percent of abattoirs are halal” in the Paris region, Le Pen said.

In Europe, the Jewish and Muslim customs have united opponents both from liberal circles who cite animal welfare as their main concern and right-wing nationalists who view the custom as foreign to their countries' cultures.
Le Pen in the past has said they would impose limitations on expressions of Judaism in France not because they regard them as a threat, but to preserve the principle of equality in order to implement similar steps against the spread of Islam in France, which they and their party often describe as a "threat.”
They have said during the current campaign that they would ban the wearing of kippahs in public in France in order to facilitate a ban on Muslim clothes. They have also said that they would make it illegal for French citizens to have an Israeli passport.
Le Pen has called on French Jews to make these “sacrifices” to curb radical Islam and has promised to be French Jewry's “shield” against Islam.
French Jewish leaders have called Le Pen a “candidate of hate” and urged voters to support the leading candidate, centrist Emmanuel Macron, to keep Le Pen from winning. They won the first round with 23.7 percent of the vote. Polls from Tuesday predict they would win the second round by more than 20 points.
French Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia accused Le Pen of “fomenting hatred and war between the government and religions, as well as interreligious animosity” with their statement.
“It undermines the foundations on which France was built,” they said in a statement.
CLOSE Sheriff Will Lewis addresses sexual assault allegations, lawsuit at news conference. Anna Lee

It's a story as old as time. Powerful men — and sometimes not so powerful ones — accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Think Bill Clinton. Woody Allen, Bill Cosby and most recently, Harvey Weinstein, a man whose alleged actions helped refuel a social media campaign in recent days known as #MeToo.
Against this backdrop, Greenville County Sheriff Will Lewis stepped in front of the microphones Thursday to defend themselves against charges in a lawsuit brought by a former employee of the Sheriff's Office, Savannah Nabors.
According to Nabors, Lewis drugged them and sexually assaulted them A series of audio tapes were filed with the lawsuit. In one, a man identified as Lewis can be heard on tape discussing a trip the two can take to Reno, Nevada, on the county's dime. There's only one catch, they tell Nabors: The county will only pay for one room.
Nabors' main concern in the discussion seems to be that someone will find out since county trips produce paper trails.
"I don't see how that's going to work. That's too risky. I feel like if somebody were to find that out...," they are heard saying on the tape.
"Ain't nobody going to find that out because ain't nobody gonna be there from South Carolina; I mean nobody's going to find out; That's the whole point," Lewis can be heard saying. "But again, I mean I wouldn't do it if it was risky. I mean, I'll think through it ahead of time but that's kind of the thing. If you're not comfortable with going with one room..."

More lawsuit audio: Friendship discussed
At a Thursday news conference, Lewis, who is married, maintained they are innocent of all allegations in Nabors' lawsuit. Their only sin, they say, was having an affair with Nabors.
When the dust from this situation settles, Lewis's statements may prove to be true. After all, anyone can file a lawsuit. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is conducting its own investigation into the accusations, and Lewis has not been criminally charged.
But the sheriff — who is an elected official — now faces a huge credibility problem. And as the county's chief law enforcement official they need to step down until SLED concludes its probe into their conduct.

In their remarks Thursday, Lewis said they didn't want the allegations against them to cast a shadow on the good work their deputies are doing. Having a sitting sheriff who is under investigation not only undermines their authority with deputies and other sheriff department employees, it also undermines their ability to execute their duties due to the distraction of such serious allegations.
And long term, such allegations could hurt the county's victim's advocacy work. Victims of crimes, particularly sexual assault crimes, may not feel their allegations will be taken seriously because the sheriff was accused of inappropriate behavior. On the flip side, if Lewis is innocent of the charges in the lawsuit, their attorney is right to advise them to stay on the job. Resigning, said one legal expert The Greenville News talked to, could imply guilt.
Lewis's guilt or innocence remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Workplace affairs are seldom a good idea. Lewis has admitted to having one with a subordinate. Their affair and the circumstances surrounding it could end up costing taxpayers in legal fees and a settlement. That shows extremely poor judgement on their part.
Since the Greenville County Council has no authority over the sheriff, Lewis needs to do what's in the best interest of county residents: step aside until the SLED investigation concludes.
If they are seriously concerned about the damage their indiscretion is having on the county, the department they supervise and their family, perhaps they could use this time to repair those relationships.

Ragna From BlazBlue Wrote A Light Novel, And It's Being Turned Into A Vita Game
By Eugene . September 27, 2013 . 5:03pm
Arc System Work's Groundhog-day horror/mystery visual novel game Getsuei Academy Kou has released a trailer of its varied characters. Most of them will be part of the school's student council, who look set to be part of the fight against the mysterious Hazards that walk the lands, if the trailer is any indicator.
Getsuei Academy Kou is based off the light novel of the same name by Tomokazu Sugita (BlazBlue's Ragna the Bloodedge/Gintama's Sakata Gintoki's voice actor). Players are Hiroshi Toyama, a transfer student to Getsuei Academy who transfers to protect their grandparents from their parents. Unfortunately, their first day… doesn't go so well. Warned that “ghosts stalk the school” they disregard it and is subsequently caught face-to-face with the hellish Hazard demons.
Toyama is saved by Eiri Mizuki, another first-year student, who then kills him. Or does she? They awaken the next day only to realize it's the same day as yesterday.
Getsuei Academy Kou is headed to the PlayStation Vita October 10th.
THE LAST Republican debate crystalized a divide among the candidates on foreign policy that, at its starkest, centers on whether the United States should seek to undermine the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) (who has since ended their campaign) argued forcefully that the removal of the Assad clique is essential to fighting the Islamic State. Donald Trump and Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) say the opposite: that opposing the Syrian dictator is a distraction at best — and might even empower the jihadists.
Of the latter, Mr. Cruz has offered the most detailed explication of this right-wing “realism.” In a lengthy speech to the Heritage Foundation this month, Mr. Cruz claimed that the removal of Mr. Assad would lead to “radical jihadis controlling Syria.” They also defended Egyptian strongman Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and inveighed against democracy promotion by the United States.
As intellectual underpinning, Mr. Cruz cited a famous 1979 essay by Ronald Reagan's U.N. ambassador, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick , who castigated the Carter administration for “double standards” in its handling of right-wing dictators and left-wing revolutionary movements. Yet the citation did not strengthen Mr. Cruz's argument. Instead, it exposed the shallow and counterfactual thinking behind their position.
Kirkpatrick's essay centered on their objections to the Carter administration's withdrawal of support from the pro-American shah of Iran and Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza to the benefit of anti-Western totalitarian movements. But these were conventional strongmen who, Kirkpatrick contended, could have been coaxed into creating the conditions for an eventual democratic change. Mr. Cruz is arguing for a stridently anti-American and nakedly genocidal dictator who sponsored terrorism against U.S. troops in Iraq and serves as a willing puppet of Iran. The notion that Mr. Assad could be nudged into reforms or compromise with their opposition was tested in 2011 by actors ranging from then-Sen. John F. Kerry to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and was found to be delusional.
Mr. Cruz claims that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shares their view that there is no advantage to intervening in a fight between the Assad regime and the Islamic State. In fact, senior Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon , have advocated for the defeat of Mr. Assad and the jihadists by a U.S.-led coalition. Moreover, the very notion of an Assad-Islamic State war is a misconception. The Damascus regime and its Iranian and Russian allies have mostly avoided attacking the self-declared caliphate, instead focusing their fire on the forces that Mr. Cruz claims don't exist: non- jihadist and secularist Syrian Sunnis.
Mr. Cruz faults the Obama administration for attempting to train those rebels but fails to acknowledge that it tried their proposed policy of fostering local resistance to the Islamic State rather than Mr. Assad. The tactic was a failure because Syrian Sunnis as well as Sunnis from other states proved reluctant to fight the Islamic State while the Assad regime remained in power. President Obama has acknowledged that the Islamic State cannot be defeated as long as the Assad regime stays.
Therein lies the greatest flaw of Mr. Cruz's position. In proposing that the dictator be left in place, they and like-minded GOP contenders not only would empower a butcher, war criminal and close ally of Iran but also would preserve the Islamic State.
they whereabouts of the Gandhis will no longer be a secret while they are abroad, even though they enjoy Special Protection Group (SPG) cover. In fact, every time Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Vadra and other members of the family go on a foreign tour, the Narendra Modi government will have precise information regarding their movements. Rahul, who turned 44 years on Thursday, was until some days ago in Europe. Sonia Gandhi was likely to go out of the country on Saturday and shall be back in a week's time.
Well informed sources said that during the UPA regime, the Gandhis travelled freely and the SPG normally did not share the information of their whereabouts with anyone except the Cabinet Secretariat and the Intelligence Bureau. The political establishment was unaware of their travel plans and no one dared ask anything unless the Gandhis themselves shared their itinerary with people close to them. But in the changed political scenario, it will be difficult for the SPG to conceal information and it will also be equally difficult for the Gandhis to give the security and intelligence agencies a slip. In other words, the security cover provided to them will serve as an obstruction to their privacy and act as an instrument of surveillance.
In the past when Sonia Gandhi went for treatment to the United States, the then SPG director Bharat Wanchoo (now Governor of Goa) accompanied them along with some of their team members. They ensured that their movements were kept confidential. The nature of their ailment and the procedures adopted to treat them were never put in the public domain. All this while, the political class speculated on where they are. Some said that they had recuperated partially at a Park Avenue apartment in New York, belonging to the family of Indira Gandhi's friend, Katharine Meyer Graham while others said that they were at the Syosset Oyster Bay in Long Island.
Similarly, Rahul Gandhi and Robert Vadra would travel very often to foreign countries and were also frequent visitors to Dubai. Now each time the Gandhis travel, they will have to disclose their destination to enable the SPG to make the required arrangements to ensure their safety and security. Unless, they give the slip to the SPG and leave without informing anyone. Even then they will be required to go through the Immigration counters which function under the overall control of the Intelligence Bureau and the government will immediately know the first destination they are headed to. For instance if one of them was to catch a flight to Dubai, it would be known and if they board another flight for some other destination from Dubai, the Indian authorities will have to seek the information from their Dubai counterparts. Rahul Gandhi had visited Havana in 2012. Their visit to Cuba was not public knowledge though the embassy circuit knew precisely where they are. The SPG, however, kept it a closely guarded secret.
Sources in the Delhi Police confirmed that there have been occasions when VVIP protectees manage to shake off their security. It has happened on several occasions with Rahul Gandhi and even the former Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who sometimes preferred total privacy and would go away unnoticed if they considered security to be an obstacle. But the practice so far has been that no regime likes to disturb the security arrangements of the previous government and allows the security cover to continue if the threat perception is of a very critical nature. In case of the Gandhis who have lost two members of their family, it is colossal. Even in the case of L.K. Advani, who was guarded by 260 personnel, even if four or five were moved out, their staff would want them to be immediately replaced. The government of the day complied. Advani enjoyed a much bigger security cover than the three Home Ministers of the UPA government.
A senior official said that the Congress regime was very liberal in granting security as was evident from a request received from a close aide of Sonia Gandhi to give additional security to a BJP leader, now a Union minister.
Sources said that Sonia Gandhi's position will be quite similar to what it was during the period of the P.V. Narasimha Rao government when some of the SPG officers assigned to them were from the Intelligence Bureau and kept a watch on those who came to meet them What they were doing at that time was known by those in power even if it was a Congress government. A senior IB officer (now retired) connected with their security confirmed that many of the people in their SPG team were from the STF (Special Task Force) originally constituted to protect the Prime Minister and were later absorbed into the SPG. However, over a period of time, they moved on as the demands of the job require younger and fitter personnel to do VVIP duties.
As per the SPG Act, the government of the day has to protect and provide adequate security to former Prime Ministers and their families as also to the Gandhis. The drill is that whenever a member of the Gandhi family travels, the SPG is required to conduct an ASL (Advanced Security Liaison). The drill is not as elaborate as it is for a serving Prime Minister who has a lot of protocol issues but much depends also on the countries to be visited. While some countries do not allow any security personnel to carry any weapons, others do so. The protection of a protectee is also the responsibility of the country they visit and the SPG gets the assistance it needs on a case to case basis. When former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh was being treated in London, the SPG had got permission to be with him. A strong contingent was staying at the St James Hotel during this period.
The standard operational procedure of the SPG is that if a Protectee gives it a slip, the matter is immediately brought to the notice of the director who in turn informs the Cabinet Secretariat. The Protectee is then cautioned on their action and told to be careful in the future. But the SPG is duty bound to provide the cover and it remains its responsibility to keep a close watch on the protectees. In addition, the security requirements make it mandatory to abide by the Blue Book which is amended after a review as and when the need arises.
Rev. Franklin Graham is leading a "disinformation campaign" against President Obama by attacking Obama's Christian faith and distorting Islam's theology, says a leading religion professor.
After CNN's John King gave Graham a full news cycle to raise a lifted eyebrow at President Obama's Christian profession of faith, Stephen Prothero, religion professor at Boston University, came on King's show Friday night to undercut Graham and question why CNN would ask an evangelist known to slur Islam, to speculate on its theology.
According to a transcript released by CNN, Prothero, author of
God is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World, told King, the finding in a recent survey that 18% of Americans believe Obama is Muslim ...
... is because we have people who are supposed to be responsible public leaders, like Franklin Graham, who are spreading what seems to me like a sort of disinformation campaign... What Franklin Graham should say: 'Barack Obama says he's a Christian, he's a Christian, end of story.'
Prothero also pointed out that Obama prayed with Franklin and their father, America's most famous living evangelist, Rev. Billy Graham, in May but Franklin still repeatedly used the "if" word to answer King's questions Thursday on whether Obama has accepted Christ.
Prothero said:
Franklin Graham doesn't seem to be interested in focusing on preaching the gospel of -- of Jesus. They want to be spreading misinformation about the religion of Islam. ... Why are we listening to Franklin Graham?
Prothero, who also wrote a book on Americans' ignorance about their own faith traditions as well as those of others (Religious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know -- And Doesn't) told King,
.. it doesn't help the conversation we need to have as a public about Islam to be having people who are just basically spreading falsehoods about the tradition.
We should be listening to Muslims about their tradition. We should be listening to scholars about their tradition. But we shouldn't be listening to Evangelical preachers who are out to trash the Muslim religion in order to gain some political and perhaps religious advantage.
Prothero also pounced on Graham for cherry-picking quotes from the Quran that highlight violence. (In U.S. Protestant culture, picking quotes out of context from the Bible to prove a point is called "proof-texting."). Prothero highlighted
... shared beliefs and practices across Christianity and Islam. And we shouldn't be talking about the worst of the tradition of Islam and comparing it with the best of the tradition of Christianity.
When Jesus says, "I come not to bring peace, but a sword," is it fair to say, oh, Jesus is out to kill people?
No, because you read that in the context of the whole Bible. You read that in the context of the Christian tradition. That's how you need to understand passages in the Quran, is in the context of the whole Quran and in the context of the whole Islamic tradition.
Who are you listening to on Islam and Christianity?

DAVE O'BRIEN / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS The hotel where German forces in the Netherlands surrendered to Canadian troops
The end of the Second World War for Canada occurred here in this Dutch town on May 5 when German Gen. Johannes Blaskowitz sat down in the Hotel De Wereld with Canada's Gen. Charles Foulkes to negotiate terms for surrendering all German forces in Holland.
A grainy, black-and-white, 1945 film shows Hitler's general and their small contingent walking into the hotel to meet Foulkes, who in 1951 became chief of the general staff, the first person to hold that post.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES CANADA Lt.-Gen. Charles Foulkes (left), commander of the First Canadian Corps, accepts the surrender of the German army from General Johannes Blaskowitz (right) at Wageningen, the Netherlands, on May 5, 1945.
For the lack of a typewriter — not one could be found in the town about 15 kilometres west of Arnhem — the signing of the surrender document was delayed a day when the parties returned. The actual document was signed in a building next to the hotel.
May 5 has since been celebrated as Liberation Day in the Netherlands, while May 4 is marked as Remembrance Day for all the people who fought and died in the war.
Today, the room where the terms of the surrender were negotiated looks very much like the scenes in the contemporary newsreel footage, with the original wall panelling and furniture.
On the same day, Canadian forces just inside Germany near the Dutch border sought the surrender of German formations confronting them, but it was a difficult task because of the general confusion and poor communications on the German side.
Finally, Brig.-Gen. Jim Roberts of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade was assigned to escort Gen. Eric Von Straube to the surrender ceremony.
Sitting in the back of the Jeep, Von Straube asked what Roberts did before the war.
"I replied," Roberts said, "that I was never a professional soldier but that, like most Canadian soldiers, I was a civilian volunteer and that, in my former pre-war life, I had been an ice-cream maker."
The German seemed offended they had been forced to surrender to "a common civilian," Roberts said in their memoir, The Canadian Summer, a title they borrowed from the Dutch characterization of the summer of 1945.
In fact, 98 per cent of the soldiers in the Canadian army were civilians before the war. The pre-war army was made up of about 5,000 regulars, with roughly 50,000 militias. By war's end, the armed forces had swelled to 1.1 million soldiers, sailors and airmen.
Like Roberts, they were carpenters, postal workers, farmers and school teachers. Some had been unemployed. These were the men who won the war and rose to senior command levels, where they quickly learned the skills of seasoned professionals, although, as historian Jack Granatstein has said, it took four years of hard training, missteps and mistakes before the army was ready to confront the Germans in northwest Europe.
According to historian Terry Copp, about two-thirds of the men were between 18 and 25, and the rest weren't much older. One-third had not finished primary school, one-third had only reached Grade 7 and only one out of eight had a high school diploma.
Despite the popular view that most men were unemployed, the Depression had actually eased by the end of the 1930s. As result, many recruits had jobs when war broke out. According to Copp, in the first three years of the war, 87 per cent of the force was made up of people who left jobs to become soldiers.
The average soldier was 5-7 and about 160 pounds. Surveys at the time showed they understood the war "in simple but clear terms."
The highest ranks were another matter. Research by Copp, Granatstein and others shows they weren't very good as strategists or administrators, and they were prone to petty squabbling. Many officers were fired or dismissed both before and after D-Day, some for good reasons, others because of bad luck or the equivalent of old-fashioned office politics.
It wasn't just the Canadians who suffered from weakness in high command.
"The senior levels of the Allied armies were plagued by rivalry and lack of imagination," Copp wrote in Cinderella Army.

Kiev and Nato have urged Moscow to do more to help establish a genuine ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, where fighting is still raging around Donetsk airport and shelling and shooting continue to kill and injure civilians.
Ukraine's pro-western government says scores of its soldiers have been killed since the signing of a September 5th truce deal raised hopes of an end to the conflict, which the United Nations says has claimed more than 3,500 lives, injured more than 8,000 people and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Pro-Kremlin rebels, allegedly backed by Russian soldiers and armour, are still trying to seize Donetsk airport, in the face of dogged resistance from isolated government forces.
Broad self-rule
“Today we can say that the Russian side does not have the political, or any other, will to fulfil the peace deal,” Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said yesterday.
They told diplomats from member states of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) that Russia had not withdrawn all its forces from Ukraine, or stopped giving help to the rebels, or acted to close the countries' shared border, across which fighters and weapons have flowed freely to the militants.
“The preliminary agreements reached in Minsk could lead us towards peace. But today I am very sceptical about how they are being fulfilled,” they said.
Kiev has offered broad self-rule to the partly rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions that border Russia, but the militants have rejected the offer as insufficient.
The regions have also pledged to hold their own elections on November 2nd in defiance of the rest of Ukraine, which is preparing for a parliamentary ballot on October 26th.
Moscow insists it is not helping the insurgents, who reject Kiev's authority and want independence or unification with Russia.
The Kremlin blames Kiev's pro-western leaders for the conflict, accusing them of drawing support from Russian-hating “fascist” elements.
Political solution
The EU and United States have threatened to tighten economic sanctions on Russia if it fails to help implement the ceasefire deal, and Nato has regularly accused Moscow of sending troops and shellfire into Ukraine and massing forces on its border.
“It is important that Russia use all its influence to make sure that the ceasefire is also respected by the separatists,” Nato's new secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said yesterday in Warsaw.
“The ceasefire is important. It is a reason for concern that we see so many violations,” they added, while praising Ukraine's leaders for “doing a lot, to both [respect] the ceasefire and also to contribute to a political solution.”
The former Norwegian premier insisted, however, that “there is no contradiction between a strong Nato and building constructive relations with Russia”.
Some Nato members have suggested they may sell arms to Ukraine, but western powers have made clear they will not intervene militarily in the conflict.
France and Germany reportedly plan to send drone aircraft to monitor the ceasefire, and two drones to be operated by OSCE monitors in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces have already arrived in Ukraine.

Good help is hard to find these days, especially if you're looking for a reliable contract killer. Do you ask the guy for references? Awkward. So you take their suitability for the task on faith. If you're religious, you might pray on the whole thing a little (the Lord's heard worse).
Anyway:
“All five of us are Christians,”
said Tim Lambesis of the U.S. metal band As I Lay Dying.
“I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very ‘preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.”
Of course,
“If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life.”
Like your marriage and your family, obviously.
Funny story.
Tim Lambesis, lead singer for the heavy metal band As I Lay Dying, was arrested in California on Tuesday on charges that they sought the help of an undercover detective to have their estranged wife killed, police said. … Lambesis' wife, Meggan, filed papers in San Diego Superior Court in September 2012 seeking a dissolution of marriage, according to an online court database.
The couple has three adopted children.

Ten Reasons Why Borussia Dortmund Will Win The Bundesliga
After defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 to lift the DFL Supercup for a second consecutive year, Borussia Dortmund looks destined to lift more silverware in the upcoming season. Early in the summer, Die Schwarzgelben's head coach Jurgen Klopp brought in key players and has built a team strong enough to compete and succeed in multiple competitions.
Here are 10 reasons why BVB will lift the Bundesliga trophy at the end of the season.
1. Marco Rues is on the cusp of greatness
If Reus stays, the 25-year-old could join the likes of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic as one of football's elites.
After missing the chance to establish themselves as a superstar during this summer's World Cup due to an injury they picked up in a friendly, Reus is hungry and motivated for success with the club he's called home since 2012.
The talented attacking midfielder is familiar with Klopp's system and knows that they are the vocal point of the team.
2. It is Henrikh Mkhitaryan time to shine
The Armenian didn't have a great first year in the Bundesliga, but they were still one of the best players in the league. Despite their injury problem, Mkhitaryan managed to score nine goals.
Now that he's settled down and he's healthier than ever before, the Armenian international is ready to take the league by storm. Their trickiness, awareness on the ball and ability to slalom their way out of tight spaces will captivate Dortmund's incredible fans and will strike fear into opposing players.
3. Mats Hummels
Hummels' remarkable showing in Brazil is proof that they are one of the best, if not the best, center backs in the world. The 25-year-old towering defender managed to dislodge Per Mertesacker – a player with over 100 international caps — in Germany's starting lineup and could have easily won the award for the tournament's best player.
Going into the new season in great form, Hummels should dominate the Bundesliga.
4. Defensive depth
Neven Subotić, Oliver Kirch, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Łukasz Piszczek, Matthias Ginter, Marcel Schmelzer and Erik Durm, what more can I say?
Klopp is blessed with fantastic defenders that are experienced, energetic and willing to do whatever it takes to win.
5. Ciro Immobile and Adrián Ramos will shock the world
My bold prediction for this Bundesliga season is that the two strikers brought in to replace Robert Lewandowski will score at least 30 goals.
Immobile is coming off a 22-goal season in the physical Serie A, and the underdog is hungry to prove the cynics wrong.
Ramos has humbly usurped the spotlight in Germany, and after scoring 16 goals last season, the Colombian should score more with the world-class services that'll be directed towards him.
6. Roman Weidenfeller is nearing the end
The German goalkeeper is 34 years old and even though they are still in top form, one can conclude that it won't be long before they hang up their boots. Just like most footballers, the club's long-time loyal servant will want to go out on top by unseating Bayern as Bundesliga champions.
7. The return of the fallen
Once upon a time, Jakub Błaszczykowski and İlkay Gündoğan were among the best in the world. Both players had to watch from the stands last season as their team couldn't keep up with Bayern in the race for the coveted trophy. The eminent figures should make their long-awaited return this season.
8. Nuri Şahin's season to reclaim the spotlight
Back in 2011, the Turkey international was one of the most sought-after midfielders in the world. They had excelled during their three seasons with Dortmund and Real Madrid came in a pried them away.
At that moment, the move to Spain seemed like the right decision, but Şahin failed miserably. Due to their lack of playing time, they went on loan to Liverpool and also failed. After their forgettable spells away from Dortmund, Şahin returned to the Signal Iduna Park.
Since then, he's returned to form and could very well become a game-changer in the upcoming season.
9. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang
The Gabon international is not the best of the coterie of quality attackers on Dortmund's roster, but they possess qualities that most will die for: speed and athleticism.
Aubameyang could very well be the fastest player in the world. Their fleet feet helped them score 13 goals last season and since this is their second season with Dortmund, they should be more lethal in front of goal.
10. The man of the hour; Jurgen Klopp
It is almost impossible to hate this man. The charismatic coach never disappoints both on and off the pitch.
Will the quality players at their disposal, the great tactician will find a way to lead their team to the land of milk and honey.

Virginia Woolf (1882-1941), English author, feminist, essayist, publisher, and critic wrote A Room of Ones Own (1929);
All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor pointa woman must have money and a room of their own if they are to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unsolved.-Ch. 1
Now regarded as a classic feminist work, Woolf based their extended essay A Room on lectures they had given at womens colleges at Cambridge University. Using such female authors as Jane Austen and Emily and Charlotte Bronte, they examine women and their struggles as artists, their position in literary history and need for independence. They also invent a female counterpart of William Shakespeare, a sister named Judith to at times sarcastically get their point across. Woolf proved to be an innovative and influential 20th Century author. In some of their novels they move away from the use of plot and structure to employ stream-of-consciousness to emphasise the psychological aspects of their characters. Themes in their works include gender relations, class hierarchy and the consequences of war. Woolf was among the founders of the Modernist movement which also includes T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein.
The effects of bi-polar disorder at times caused Woolf protracted periods of convalescence, withdrawing from their busy social life, distressed that they could not focus long enough to read or write. They spent times in nursing homes for rest cures; frankly referred to themselves as mad; said they heard voices and had visions. My own brain is to me the most unaccountable of machineryalways buzzing, humming, soaring roaring diving, and then buried in mud. And why? Whats this passion for? (from a letter dated 28 Dec. 1932). The subject of suicide enters their stories and essays at times and they disagreed with the perception that it is an act of cowardice and sin. When Virginia was not depressed they worked intensely for long hours at a time. They were vivacious, witty and ebullient company and a member of the Bloomsbury Group or Bloomsbury which had been started by their brother Thoby and their friends from Cambridge. It quickly grew to encompass many of Londons literary circle, who gathered to discuss art, literature, and politics. During their life and since their death they have been the subject of much debate and discussion surrounding the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of their half-brother, their mental health issues and sexual orientation. Also, their pacifist political views in line with Bloomsbury caused controversy. From Three Guineas (1931);
Therefore if you insist upon fighting to protect me, or our country, let it be understood, soberly and rationally between us, that you are fighting to gratify a sex instinct which I cannot share; to procure benefits which I have not shared and probably will not share; but not to gratify my instincts, or to protect either myself or my country. For, the outsider will say, in fact, as a woman, I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.-Ch. 3
Regardless of the polemic, or because of it, even into the 21st Century Woolfs prodigious output of diaries, letters, critical reviews, essays, short stories, and novels continue to be the source of much scholarly study. Adeline Virginia Stephen was born in London, England on 25 January 1882, daughter of Sir Leslie Stephen (1832-1904), literary critic and first editor of the Dictionary of National Biography. Their first wife, daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, Harriet Marion (b.1840) died in 1875. Virginias mother was their second wife, Julia Prinsep Jackson Duckworth (1846-1895) who inspired the character Mrs. Ramsay in To The Lighthouse (1927).
Virginia had two brothers, Thoby (1880-1906) and Adrian (1883-1948) who became a psychoanalyst. They were very close to their older sister Vanessa Nessa (1876-1961) who would become a painter and marry art critic Clive Bell. They also had four half-siblings; Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870-1945), and George (1868-1934), Gerald (1870-1937) [who would found Duckworth and Co. Publishing] and Stella (1869-1897) Duckworth.
A number of the Stephen relatives were friends of Scottish historian and author Thomas Carlyle. Many other successful Victorian authors of the time were regular visitors to their bustling home in Hyde Park including Henry James and George Eliot; Virginia would write an article about them for the Times Literary Supplement in 1919. Middlemarch, the magnificent book which with all its imperfections is one of the few English novels for grown-up people. (George Eliot). Their works and many others including Charles Dickenss and Thackerays were part of their home education. Them father had a massive library so they and their sister were not without material although Virginia would soon reject the values and morals of their generation.
The Stephens summered at Talland House in St. Ives, County Cornwall in the southwest of England along the rocky shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Virginia had vivid and fond memories of these times which often had an influence on their writing including visits to a nearby lighthouse. However they ended when their mother died; they were just thirteen years old and suffered the first major breakdown of many that would plague them off and on the rest of their life. The death of Stella, who had become like a mother to Virginia and the death of their father caused another period of profound depression. The beauty of the world ... has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder. (A Room of Ones Own). Vanessa then moved their sister and brothers to another neighborhood in London, Bloomsbury. Virginia was feeling better and by 1905 was writing in earnest articles and essays, and became a book reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement. They also taught English and History at Morley College in London.
In 1906 Virginia, Vanessa and their brothers traveled to Europe, where Thoby contracted typhoid fever and died from in 1906. Back in England the Bloomsbury Group was flourishing, their home a meeting place for writers, scholars and artists including Clive Bell, artist and art critic, who Vanessa married 1907. They would not stay together for long. After their third proposal, Virginia finally married left-wing political journalist, author and editor Leonard Woolf (1880-1969) on 10 August 1912. They would have no children. In 1914 when World War I broke out they were living in Richmond and Woolf was working on their first novel The Voyage Out (1915) a satirical coming-of-age story;
As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are very narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm. If you persist, lawyers clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady typists will have to fidget behind you. In the streets of London where beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is better not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the air with your left hand.-Ch. 1
Leonard and Virginia would themselves get into the publishing business, together founding the Hogarth Press in 1917. Works by T. S. Eliot and Katherine Mansfield would be among their many publications including Virginias. Night and Day (1919) was followed by their short story collection Monday or Tuesday (1921) and essays in The Common Reader (1925). Jacobs Room (1922) was followed by Mrs. Dalloway (1925) which inspired a film The Hours in 2002. To The Lighthouse (1927) was followed by Orlando: A Biography (1928);
Different though the sexes are, they inter-mix. In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is very opposite of what it is above ..Every secret of a writers soul, every experience of their life, every quality of their mind is written large in their works.-Ch. 4
One of their more popular novels, it was adapted to the screen in 1993. A roman à clef, Orlandos character is modeled after Vita Sackville West (1892-1962), friend and possible lover of Woolf; Princess Sasha based on their friend Violet Trefusis. Vitas husband Harold Nicolson also plays a part as Marmaduke. Their son Nigel referred to it as the longest and most charming love letter in literature. I was in a queer mood, thinking myself very old: but now I am a woman againas I always am when I write. (The Diary of Virginia Woolf, 31 May 1929.) The Waves (1931) is said to be Woolfs most experimental work. Flush: A Biography (1933) is told through the eyes of Elizabeth Barrett Brownings spaniel. The Second Common Reader (1933) their next collection of critical essays, was followed by The Years (1937) and Roger Fry: A Biography (1940).
With the outbreak of WWII the Woolfs were living at their country retreat, Monks House near the village of Rodmell in Lewes, Sussex, which is now preserved by the National Trust. In 1940 they received word that their London home had been destroyed. Fear of a German invasion loomed and Leonards Jewish heritage provoked the couple to make a suicide pact if the possibility of falling into German hands arose. Leonard as usual was ever vigilant to the onset of the next major depressive episode in their wife; they would get migraine headaches and lay sleepless at night. However, they and their doctor, who had seen them the day before, would never intuit that their next one was to be their last. I letters to friends had been written in shaky handwriting and though they were actively working on their manuscript for what was to be the last publication before their death, Between the Acts (1941) they did express much disdain for its worth and wanted to scrap it.
The scullery maid....was cooling their cheeks by the lily pond. There had always been lilies there, self-sown from wind-dropped seed, floating red and white on the green plates of their leaves. Water, for hundreds of years, had silted down into the hollow, and lay there four or five feet deep over a black cushion of mud....fish swamgold, splashed with white....poised in the blue patch made by the sky....It was in that deep centre, in that black heart, that the lady had drowned herself.
Virginia Woolf died on 28 March 1941 when they drowned themselves in the River Ouse near their home in Sussex, by putting rocks in their coat pockets. Them body was found later in April and they were then cremated, their ashes spread under two elms at Monks House. They had left two similar suicide notes, one possibly written a few days earlier before an unsuccessful attempt. The one addressed to Leonard read in part;
Dearest, I feel certain I am going mad again....And I shant recover this time.....I am doing what seems the best thing to do....I cant fight any longer....Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I cant go on spoiling your life any longer....I dont think two people could have been happier than we have been. V.
After their death, Leonard set to the task of editing their vast collection of correspondence, journals, and unpublished works and also wrote an autobiography. They died in 1960. Posthumous publications include; The Death of the Moth and Other Essays (1942), A Haunted House and Other Short Stories (1944), and The Moment and Other Essays (1948). Virginias nephew, the late Professor Quentin Bell (1910-1996) wrote the award winning Virginia Woolf: A biography (2 vols, London: Hogarth Press, 1972).
Every season is likeable, and wet days and fine, red wine and white, company and solitude. Even sleep, that deplorable curtailment of the joy of life, can be full of dreams; and the most common actionsa walk, a talk, solitude in ones own orchardcan be enhanced and lit up by the association of the mind. Beauty is everywhere, and beauty is only two fingers-breadth from goodness. So, in the name of health and sanity, let us not dwell on the end of the journey. The Common Reader Montaigne-Ch. 6

The little one is a little over 1½. So it's busy at the house and it's going to be even busier, but I really enjoy it. They go nuts when papa comes home. It's the greatest feeling in the world. But obviously it's busy."
Fatherhood wears well on Nowitzki.  They are glad the way it turned out, with their firstborn being a girl, Malaika. Then came Max.
"It's every guy's dream to have a boy and Mad Max is doing well," they said. "He's chasing around the balls already. It's a lot of work, but it's a blast."
Soon enough, the house will be a little more crowded.
More and more families with children are struggling to meet basic living standards despite having at least one person working full-time, according to a new report by an influential think tank.
The proportion of households in which one or both parents are in work but have fallen below the minimum income standard (MIS) has increased since the financial crisis, despite a spell of low inflation, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said.
Some 41 per cent of lone parents working full-time had incomes below the minimum standard, up from 26 per cent in 2008/09, the report said. For families in which both parents work full-time the risk rose from 5 to 12 per cent and for couples with a single breadwinner, the risk rose from 38 to 51 per cent.
The results will come as a blow for the Government, whose ministers rubbished Ed Miliband's long-running campaign on the cost of living.
Today Owen Smith, shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “It's getting harder and harder for working families to make ends meet, as under this Tory government we are seeing the lowest rate of pay growth for a century.
“Instead of doing anything to help Iain Duncan Smith is about to make things much worse. The Tory cuts to Universal Credit will leave more than two million low and middle paid working families £1,600 a year worse off.”
The Tories have repeatedly claimed low inflation and an increase in employment has protected families from a fall in living standards. When inflation fell to zero in February this year – in figures announced just weeks before the General Election – George Osborne said: “Prices are frozen and as the recovery from Labour's Great Recession strengthens, their economic argument has literally come to nought.”
Today's report also showed the share of people in households with incomes below the minimum standard – based on what the public think is necessary for a minimum acceptable living standard – has increased by a third between 2009 and 2014, from 21 to nearly 28 per cent, although the rate of increase has slowed.
The foundation picked out three phases in the changes to living standards since the financial crisis: a rise in unemployment and the outpacing of earnings by inflation up to 2010/11; wage stagnation and changes to benefit and tax credits to 2012/13; and a further deterioration in 2013/14, although the risk of falling below the minimum standard reduced slightly for working-age households without children.
The report was produced with the Centre for Research and Social Policy at Loughborough University.
Public relations, marketing and branding strategies, what we can take from Donald Trump.
Donald Trump has taken the 2016 Republican presidential primary campaign hostage, and regardless of whether or not you personally like the guy, we could all learn a thing or two from him, — or their PR team at least.
With their racy comments, mind-boggling ideologies, and head turning visions for the future of America, they have certainly kept the attention of not only Americans throughout their campaign, but the world. Whether for good or bad reasons, Donald Trump has certainly mastered the art of commanding media attention and generating out of this world headlines, and punchlines for that matter.
Yet, regardless of the countless ignorant, prejudice, racist, classist, sexist, bigoted, (I could go on) comments, gestures or suggestions they have made as of recently, they still appear to be generating a reasonably strong following while rising in the polls.
So what gives?
How did Trump achieve this golden ticket to brand survival in the midst of so much controversy? What is their secret to having the ability to say and/or do generally whatever they please, and still have people on their team? How have they built their brand reputation to be so solidified that they have the freedom, or luxury to offend without apology?
Put simply, Donald Trump is a master brander. Donald Trump once said “If you don't manage your brand, somebody else will do it for you, and that somebody will likely be a competitor.” These are words Trump appears to live by, as for them sales and marketing are a 24/7 gig.
Know your market:
Identify your target persona through finding your target market. This is a basic marketing strategy. Not everyone is going to like you, so to focus your energy on trying to make that happen, isn't wise. Trump knows this, and uses this to their advantage, by ensuring that they focus on those who share their perspectives. Trump knows who their loyalists are, and every show they put on, is for them.
Know yourself:
In order to sell yourself, you've gotta know yourself. Ask yourself with confidence; who am I, what do I want to do, where will it take me, whydo I think I am the best fit, and when can I start?! By identifying who you really are, what you stand for, and why you want to do something, you will have established a working set of goals. Trump definitely knows himself. The Donald's image has been meticulously constructed, and in order to do this, they had to take a long look in the mirror.
Know Your Competition:
The best way to know your competition is to study them. Learn their strategies and methods. Figure out what they have left out, and then exploit it. Make your competition look weak, incompetent, incomplete, or incapable of offering what you can. Always attack wisely. For Trump, this isn't considered a task, they do this while they eat their breakfast.
Make Your Audience Feel Special:
Many brands attempt to be too inclusive, and non-offensive, in efforts to gain mainstream popularity, and the marketshare of everyone. Unfortunately, this seldom works. Targeting a select group of voters, allows Trump to focus on appealing to them the most by giving voice to their concerns. Making them feel special, and noticed. Trump treats their target market like an audience. They read them, and then gives them the best show they can.
Keep it Simple, Stupid:
Trump plays into the short attention spans of many Americans. They keep their speeches short and simple, minimizing intellectuality, and any call to action requiring their audience to actually utilize their critical thinking skills. Then, when they say something that generates a reaction, they repeat the message redundantly. They disregard political correctness, diplomatic speaking and generally everything else a seasoned politician would adhere to.
Take Risks, Get Noticed:
Playing it safe isn't a part of the philosophy. Be controversial enough to be spoken about at dinner, but not so controversial that any mess you make can't be cleaned up via damage control. Trump thinks outside of the box, and goes where no one else wants to go. Whether Trump's thinking outside of the box insights positive or negative responses, this still renders them noticeable. People remember things they notice.
No Regrets, No Apologies:
Trump has capitalized on their ‘this is what you get' sort of attitude, and it certainly works for him.  They are an example of a bold — almost ruthless — no regrets, no apologies business model. They have appealed to Republican voters with theirs ‘I could care less what the critics say' sort of attitude. They have taken this attitude so far, as to even shrug off experts who debunk many of their outrageous claims. They never backtracks, and certainly doesn't admit fault, wrongdoing, or defeat.
Brand Management and Damage Control:
If there is one thing the Donald knows, it's damage control. An expert at managing their brand, Donald Trump has dubbed this part of brand management as critical. Cultivating an image which transcends into the minds of people, is only the initial step. Maintaining what you have cultivated is crucial. Especially considering their habitual pattern of offending without apology, damage control to Trump, is considered a survival tactic. If you are not managing your brand, ensuring the image you want exhibited, then more often than not, a competitor will take it upon themselves to brand for you.
Strategize like you already have the trophy:
The law of attraction works in mysterious ways. Trumps confidence, almost made people believe they actually had a shot at taking the trophy. They were so sure of himself, that this resonated and made their audience absorb this confidence, and begin to actually believe that someone who calls themselves “the Donald”, could be the next leader of the most powerful country in the modern world.
Play into your audience's emotions:
The Donald identifies their audiences soft spots and touch points, and then exaggerates and blows them out of proportion. They have come to use the politics of fear to their absolute advantage. By exaggerating the problems that exist in America's immigration process, they have effectively marginalized the hardworking immigrants who add value to the economy, while also casting out those immigrants who seek refuge, and a chance at the American dream.
A brand requires dimension. It requires an identity that is differentiated from everything else on the market, aimed at establishing a presence in the audience's mind that is unique and memorable. Although they have transitioned from business to politics, their brand has not altered, they have just made it applicable across another platform.
Although Donald Trump has very little chance of realistically winning the 2016 Presidential election, let alone the Republican primaries, they have done an awfully good job at making it look like they have a shot. They have done this successfully through the strategic use of branding, marketing, and PR tools and tactics. If there is one thing Trump knows how to do, it is leverage their brand equity.
Breken Elwood & Carter Etherington said their “I do's” on Sunday in front of close to a million people during Toronto's very fabulous Pride Parade. Yes that's right: a million! We have shot weddings in some pretty amazing places – but shooting on a parade float surrounded by so much love was mind blowing. No doubt the biggest gay wedding ever! Work it!
BEST. WEDDING. GUESTS. EVER. Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life and from all over the country and the globe witnessed their big day. And not one invitation or save the date was sent out! The cheers for the length of the parade never let up for a second. From when Breken & Carter walked down the aisle hand in hand to when they exchanged rings and I do's. When the grooms kissed as husband & husband – the crowd went wild. It was the most emotional wedding we have ever shot and beyond incredible to be a part of it all. Jason was on the float and I shot from the street level capturing all the excitement. Humanist wedding officiant Mary Beaty conducted the ceremony.
Breken & Carter won a contest put on by Tourism Toronto to get the word out about Toronto Pride. The prize: airfare, hotel accommodations at the Windsor Arms Hotel and an official marriage ceremony during Toronto pride. This amazing idea was from Tourism Toronto's ad agency CP&B. And it certainly was the crowd and media favourite! The journalists and cameras flocked to the float like Carrie Bradshaw to a new pair of Manolo's.
“It's overwhelming. It's like the biggest hug you've ever received. It's unbelievable” said Breken when interviewed by the press.
The guys are from NYC and flew down on Thursday. We shot their super intimate and wonderful wedding at the Windsor Arms hotel on Saturday. Their bestest friends were on hand for the big moment and celebration. Guest count: 8. It was perfect. We will be doing a blog post to share photos from this very elegant and magical day.
Nothing could have prepared them for the overflow of love, congratulations and amazingness that came their way during the parade. Tears of joy streaming from their faces and from those in the crowd – and behind our cameras!
It was an incredibly amazing day. Difficult to really put into words how it felt to be a part of it all. Same-sex marriages have been legal in Ontario since June 2003. But this was certainly the biggest and best gay wedding ever.
Long. Live. Love.
The folks at 280slides.com announced their Objective-J framework Cappuccino which “aims to fundamentally change the way applications are written on the web,” and I've no doubt it'll do just that – but does that mean you should use it?
There are as many tools to build web applications as there are developers in this world – Ruby, PHP, Java, JavaScript, jQuery, Prototype, Python, Lisp, SproutCore, Flash, Silverlight, Flex – and now Cappuccino's Objective-J. So what makes it different, where does it fit in, is all the hype true, and is Cappuccino right for you? These are all questions I hope this post will help you answer, and to start out, let me explain the title of this post…
Taking the “Web” out of Web Development
A quote from Cappuccino's site:
With Cappuccino, you don't need to know HTML. You'll never write a line of CSS. You don't ever have interacted with DOM. We only ask developers to learn one technology, Objective-J, and one set of APIs.
If you're anything like me – a million red flags just shot high into the air. If you're building a web application, I sincerely hope that you do know HTML and CSS and JavaScript and how to interact with the DOM. But Dion Almaer of Ajaxian gives us a bright side:
they are abstracting developers high up, so you don't have to deal with [cross browser issues].
Now that doesn't sound half bad at all! It'll take more than a promise to convince me that Objective-J isn't the FrontPage of web languages, but if they can keep that promise, then this could be a game changer indeed.
What Makes It Different?
So how does this work?
Cappuccino was implemented using a new programming language called Objective-J, which is modelled after Objective-C and built entirely on top of JavaScript. Programs written in Objective-J are interpreted in the client, so no compilation or plugins are required.
To clarify, there are two new things here: Objective-J and Cappuccino. Objective-J is a new language with it's lexer, parser, and interpreter written entirely in traditional JavaScript. Cappuccino is a essential Cocoa ported to Objective-J. Both of these together let you write new applications entirely in Objective-J on the Cappuccino framework.
There are a few things that come out of this, the first of which is that JavaScript does a lot of extra work. All of your Objective-J code will be tokenized, parsed, and interpreted entirely in JavaScript. Hopefully, with new JavaScript engines (and browsers like Chrome that actually compile JavaScript), speed will become less of an issue – but in the short term this is very much a concern.
Second, developers only need to learn 1 programming language, and Cocoa developers already have a head start with this new framework! This almost almost makes me wish I'd been building Mac apps for the past few years instead of web apps – but not quite In fact, Dion's interview with 280 North a few months ago had some interesting tidbits about just that:
The guys talk a little about the toolchain an why they did this, and even how it enables future cool things such as generating a native Mac application from the same code.
That's a future I want to live in.
Is the Hype True?
And now the fun part: 280 North make some bold statements with Cappuccino. Let's take a look at the highlights:
Cappuccino is not designed for building web sites, or making existing sites more “dynamic”… Projects like Prototype and jQuery are excellent at those tasks, but they are forced by their nature to make compromises which render them ineffective at application development…
and
jQuery, Prototype, and others do a great job of making static web pages a little more interactive, but they weren't designed for building full fledged applications.
Lies. Filthy lies.
Ben Sargent provides a fantastic counter-example to this exaggeration in the form of a re-implementation of Cappuccino's sample Flickr app in only 45 lines of jQuery. Cappuccino's code was hundreds of lines of Objective-J for the same (if not poorer) result. (Notice zooming photos in the jQuery version runs much smoother than in Cappuccino).
To be fair, the Flickr sample app is a very small application. So does jQuery fall apart with larger applications? Of course not! Especially since you're already using a Model-View-Controller, right?
Comparing Cappuccino to jQuery is beginning to look like comparing Java to C. Each can be used with great effectiveness – and each for its own reasons: Java for abstraction and portability, and C for speed. This may be the beginning of similar arguments for and against Cappuccino and jQuery: Cappuccino for new language features, and jQuery for speed.
Which brings us to the next statement:
the real beauty of Objective-J is that it already works in every major browser and it is completely extendable at our descretion
This is mostly true, but not entirely. In their announcement post, they provide their motivation for building Objective-J vs waiting on the next-gen JavaScript:
Most JavaScript programmers today could list a number of features and bug fixes they'd like in JavaScript, such as classical inheritance, better media support, and access to the webcam.
And while Objective-J does solve some problems (classical inheritance) it does not and cannot solve others (better media support and access to the webcam). A new language that's built in and runs in JavaScript cannot and will never provide more than what JavaScript provides.
Features like media and webcam support, offline access, persistent data storage, etc, will always be dependent on JavaScript's foundation. Cappuccino can change how you accomplish things in JavaScript with new syntax and semantics, but can not change what you accomplish in JavaScript.
Performance
As I mentioned above, Ben's Flickr app suggests that Cappuccino's performance leaves a bit to be desired. To compare, load each app (link to jQuery and Cappuccino versions) and note how quickly the photos scale when using the slider – the jQuery version wins hands down.
In Cappuccino's defense, the incredible speed improvements made by browsers will hopefully make this a non issue relatively soon.
This shouldn't be too surprising. After all, a lot of work has to be done to transform all of the Objective-J code into JavaScript, and that clearly adds extra weight to your application.
Alternatives
Lightweight alternatives include jQuery, Prototype, and YUI, among others. Each of these can be used to build incredibly rich applications – especially if you follow the correct methodology
Sproutcore is another option, although it's certainly my least favorite of all of them, and for the same reasons as Cappuccino provides:
While SproutCore set out with similar goals to Cappuccino, it takes a distincly different approach. It still relies on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Prototype, and an entirely new and unique set of APIs. It also requires special development software and a cumbersome compilation step. We think this is the wrong approach.
And last (and least preferred), you can roll your own foundation for your web app, as Buck and I did with Jotlet before there even were frameworks. (Well, we did use X, but Mike themselves won't call it a framework ).
Is It the Best Option?
If you're a Cocoa developer who wants to make apps on the web, this is a no brainer – Objective-J is a fantastic choice. There is a dark side though: at the cost of a graceful learning curve you'll likely have to sacrifice some performance and optimization.
If you're well established in jQuery (or similar library) and building with good methodolgy, then Objective-J may mean slower development cycles, more lines of code, and poorer performance. No one (certainly not me) will chastise you for staying with the proven ridiculously fast jQuery.
One thing is for certain, Cappuccino will change web development. This opens a huge door for Cocoa developers in particular to begin writing solid web apps in a comfortable developer environment. And another thing is certain, Cappuccino is not the only framework for building web applications – so don't believe their lies.
New Delhi: Congress today accused Narendra Modi of being "anti-national" by projecting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in "poor light" over the 'village woman' row and demanded that they apologise to the nation.
Strongly condemning Modi for the remarks, Congress said it does not behove of a Prime Ministerial candidate of an opposition party to use such language against the Prime Minister.
"It is anti-national and needs to be strongly condemned. They need to apologise to the nation for what they said today that puts Prime Minister in poor light," Ajay Maken, head of the Congress media department, told reporters here.
Maken said Modi while addressing a rally went by the views of a Pakistani journalist who claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has termed Singh as a "village woman" for complaining against them before US President Barack Obama.
They said, "It does not behove of a Prime Ministerial candidate of the opposition party to speak against the Prime Minister" in this manner. "Modi, who claims to be a nationalist, does not believe in the Indian journalists and spreads a false story of a Pakistani journalist before the whole nation," they said, adding "Modi has put forth Pakistan's views before the nation".
Maken said it is "very sad that Modi chose a time to show the Prime Minister in poor light when they are abroad and has insulted them by doing so." Another Congress leader Rashid Alvi dismissed Modi's charge that Rahul Gandhi had undermined the Prime Minister's authority by attacking the ordinance on lawmakers and alleged that the Gujarat CM was "misguiding" the country while "ignoring" their state which is facing a flood threat.
"Rahul Gandhi had not even mentioned the name of the Prime Minister. They had only expressed their views regarding the ordinance. They did not even ask the government to withdraw it," Alvi said, alleging that it was Modi who was "denigrating" the Prime Minister.
"Look at the content and tone in which they spoke. I think it is utterly despicable," said another party leader Sandeep Dikshit.
Insisting that no country has the right to insult India's Prime Minister, Modi said Sharif perhaps mustered the courage to do so as Singh's own party leader Rahul Gandhi has called the Ordinance on convicted MPs as "complete nonsense" "If I were to put it in simple terms, then the Congress vice president has insulted him. If you do not respect our Prime Minister then why will Nawaz Sharif," Modi said.
They maintained that there are doubts whether Singh will be able to forcefully raise the issue of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, beheading of Indian soldiers by Pakistani forces and other contentious issues in their meeting with Sharif.
Raising their concern over domestic issues, Modi said, "The nation is going through a period of crisis due to corruption. It has not only affected the exchequer but has also created a crisis when it came to the nation's future."
"Countries which got independence around the same time and had less resources compared to India are doing better. We are regressing instead of progressing. Youth of this country need employment but this government is not able to provide it," Modi said.
They claimed that while the NDA government had provided employment to six crore people in six years, the UPA could only create 27 lakh jobs between 2004-2009. Modi asked the youth to throw out the UPA government as it has failed to make their future secure.
Citing recent judgements in which the Supreme Court has used "harsh words" against the government, Modi said the leaders of Congress and its allies were unmoved by such observations and made their comparision to an alchoholic who remains immune to any talk on the ill effects of liquor.
Modi said the UPA government has failed in all departments where the Centre is directly involved be it Railways, highways or aviation sector. Modi thanked the people for helping them reach the position they hold today and said they started out by selling tea in railway coaches. "I was never a ruler, nor am I today. I am only your servant. Earlier also I was your servent. I will remain your servant in the future also," they said.
They promised that BJP will never let down the people who have put their faith in it.

To close out a busy week of Hollywood Prospectus podcasting from actual Hollywood, Chris Ryan and I took the time to break down the Season 5 premiere of Mad Men. What is it that makes the stylish show better than anything else on TV? And how much of it involves Jessica Paré singing in French? Then the celebrity quotient was raised considerably (although the number of microphones remained stuck at two) when Community star Joel McHale dropped by for a wide-ranging, occasionally strange, and mostly very funny discussion of their culty comedy's survival chances, their Seattle sports fandom, and what, exactly, is wrong with my hair. (The McHale segment begins at 22:25, for those who still want to avoid Mad Men spoilers.)

IIT Kharagpur was entrusted to initiate a National Digital Library project in April 2015.
The Ministry of Human Resources Development has sanctioned the second phase of National Digital Library or NDL project which is aimed at building a virtual repository of learning resources with a single-window search facility.IIT Kharagpur was entrusted by the ministry to initiate a pilot project in April 2015 after which funds of Rs 48.75 crore for the second phase was sanctioned recently, officials said.The second phase will start from January next year under which they plan to build a user base of 10 lakh, content base of 200 lakh materials and 1000 participating institutions."A full-blown NDL will pave the way to providing easy access of quality educational e-contents to various learners with different backgrounds, expectations and languages for all citizens of the country," IIT-Kharagpur director P P Chakrabarti said.NDL officials said they will also build a mobile app, audio books, vernacular content and a user interface for differently-abled users.Students of class X and XII will be able to find content related to various subjects.Currently, the NDL hosts 14.6 lakh contents and 2.3 lakh users from participating 230 institutions.Another about 50 lakh contents from publishers are in different stages of processing and going to be included by March 2017. The first phase will be completed by March 2018 and will overlap with the beginning of the second phase.
With two-thirds of the original stones and modern earthquake-resistant reinforcements, Óvila's chapter house now sits, perhaps incongruously, in an open field near the abbey's modest church and vineyards, a couple of hours north of Sacramento.
It was in 1167 that King Alfonso VIII of Castile founded Santa Maria de Óvila in the province of Guadalajara, an area that they had reconquered from the Moors and that they hoped to populate with Christian settlers. For centuries, the monastery thrived as a home to Cistercian monks, a Roman Catholic order that hewed to the sixth-century Rule of St. Benedict and its emphasis on self-sufficiency, manual labor and prayer.
The monastery declined, however, and by the time it was shuttered by the Spanish government in 1835, there were only four monks left. The monastery fell into disrepair — the chapter house was being used as a manure pit — and was forgotten until it caught the eye of Hearst's art dealer, Arthur Byne, in 1930.
Hearst, the larger-than-life newspaper publisher who inspired “Citizen Kane,” had already built Hearst Castle on California's Central Coast, complete with the facade of an ancient Roman temple they had bought in Italy for their estate's Neptune Pool. But Hearst was looking to build something even bigger near Mount Shasta, in the forest about 120 miles north of Vina, where their mother's summer home, called Wyntoon, had recently burned down.
Hearst wanted to build an eight-story medieval castle facing the McCloud River, and parts of the Spanish monastery would fit right in. According to American Heritage magazine, Spanish farmers and laborers from surrounding villages were hired to dismantle and haul the monastery's most important buildings. A rail track was laid, and roads and a bridge were built to transport the massive stones. Eventually, 11 ships containing much of the monastery arrived in San Francisco.
Those who powered through all eight hours of Netflix's Stranger Things know the supernatural drama wears many influences on its sleeve, often out-and-out referencing famous Spielberg movies, or even legendary author Stephen King . King heartily seems to approve of the comparison, however, sharing their praise for Stranger Things online.
The prolific author with never a shortage of their prior work being adapted shared their thoughts on the series over Twitter, noting that yes, at least some of it felt eerily familiar:
In a prior interview with The Wall Street Journal , co-creator Matt Duffer spoke to their affinity for and reference to King:
The books of Stephen King were a big inspiration. It was those films and books that were such a big part of our childhoods. What made all these stories so great, and connected all of them, was that they explored that point where the ordinary meets the extraordinary. That's what we wanted the show to do, because, when we were growing up, we were just regular kids living in the suburbs of North Carolina playing Dungeons & Dragons with our friends, so when we watched these films or read these books, we felt [like those characters]. You watch “The Goonies” and you felt like you were one of those kids going on one of those grand adventures. So, the goal was, could we capture that feeling? Could we make basically a long-form movie that evoked that feeling of our favorite things in the world, which were these books and these movies, mostly from the '80s.
Not for nothing, but fellow horror master Guillermo del Toro also offered their praise of the series:
Presumably, Stranger Things would continue to channel Stephen King in a second season , though Netflix has yet to issue a formal declaration, even as critical raves continue (and those kids aren't getting any younger). What King influences and other ‘80s touchstones should inform the next run?
All episodes of Netflix's Stranger Things are available to stream right now.
Being one of the biggest stars on the planet, Canadian rapper Aubrey “Drake” Graham has gone from success to success. With quadruple platinum albums in ‘Take Care' and ‘Views', the music superstar was estimated to have earned a net worth of $60 million in 2016.
Being an advocate of style, we thought we'd take a look inside Drake's garage to weigh up the rapper's luxury car collection.
Loading...
Drakes Car Collection
Bugatti Veyron
Would any serious luxury car collection be complete without a Bugatti Veyron? Possessing the super rare 2010 Sang Noir Edition, Drake splashed $2 million-plus on the hypercar.
Built with a 8.0-litre quad turbocharged W16 cylinder engine, the car produces 987bhp with a top speed of 253mph. While the outside is all-black, the tangy orange interior makes for a more vibrant drive.
"You wildin', you super childish. You go to CVS for Kotex in my Bugatti"
- Child's Play
However, after experiencing some mechanical faults, it seems Drake wishes to offload the Bugatti, with Lamborghini Vancouver listing the car for sale. Will Drake opt for a newer, and even more expensive Bugatti? Only time will tell.
Bentley Continental GTC V8
You might remember seeing this car in the music video for Started from the Bottom. Posing in the back of a droptop white Bentley Continental GTC, Drizzy (Drake's nickname) cruises through a snow drift in what we presume to be Toronto.
“And my uncle callin' me like, 'Where ya at?/I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
- Started From the Bottom
Although strictly not their car, Drake has been pictured driving around in a similar looking Bentley – the Continental SuperSports Convertible. Similarly designed to the GTC featured in the music video, the white Bentley packs a W12 engine with a 0-60mph sprint time of just 3.9 seconds.
Brabus 850 6.0 Biturbo Coupe
In 2015, Drake purchased the first S-Class coupe-based Brabus in North America – and what a powerful car it is.
Built with an awesome body-kit, this Brabus comes with all-wheel drive and a 6.0-litre twin-turbo V8 capable of producing 838bhp and pushing the coupe to a top speed of 217mph.
Lamborghini Aventador Roadster
Last year, Drake added a custom Lamborghini Aventador Roadster to their garage, after purchasing the vehicle from Driving Emotions, Toronto.
Equipped with HRE wheels and a 6.5-litre V12 engine built for unleashing 691bhp and reaching 0–60mph in three seconds, the beast is well equipped for screeching down Canada's open roads.
"I am spending much more than I'm making/on these cars and these vacations, is that too much information? I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing/with a windshield full of tickets, because I live right by the station"
- I Am Not A Human Being
But what was Drakes motivation for buying the car? In an Instagram post, Drake stated: “Like I'm Christian Bale.” Perhaps the Canadian rapper has plans to become Toronto's very own Caped Crusader.
Rolls-Royce Phantom
Mostly used as a chauffeur car, Drake's custom Rolls-Royce Phantom is definitely a stylish vehicle. Painted white with a metallic grill, the car conveys opulence and class, perfect for arriving at the club.
The interior features this car's biggest party piece - a fibreoptic, star studded roof. While the Rolls-Royce Phantom Celestial is known to have had this interior feature fitted, that car was a one-off concept, so Drizzy likely got Rolls-Royce or a third-party company to build this feature into their own Phantom's cabin. With a $60 million net worth, we're sure the superstar could sway the manufacturer to build them this bespoke ride.
McLaren 675LT
What's the best way to celebrate selling 600,000 copies of your new album in just 24 hours? Drake's answer was to purchase a super-rare McLaren.
Last year, the celebrity decided to buy themselves a 675LT. The supercar was purchased from Drakes favourite luxury car dealership - Driving Emotions Motorcar.
An enhanced version of the 650S model, the new aerodynamic design of the car provides a 40 per-cent increase in downforce. Engine modifications enable the 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 to produce 666hp with a 0–60mph sprint time of 2.8 seconds. Not a bad way to spend $350,000 if you ask us.
Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren
Drake's latest car purchase has seen them invest in a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren Convertible. Not the most expensive car within their collection – but another incredibly fast supercar regardless.
Although there have been several variants of the car produced, the original model packed a supercharged 5.4-litre V8 engine that produced 617bhp.
Posting several pictures of the SLR on their Instagram account, it's clear that Drake likes this two-seater roadster.

Federico D'Alessandro has one of the coolest jobs in the world. He's the Head Storyboard Artist/Animatics Supervisor at Marvel Studios, meaning they get to conceptualize all your favorite Marvel Movies from the earliest point in the process. (You might also remember them from this Halloween pitch reel.)
With Iron Man 3 now in theaters, D'Alessandro has shared with /Film a very early animatic from the film. It's of the mansion attack, where the Mandarin's goons totally destroy Tony Stark's Malibu home. The scene is filled not only with action, but non-verbal character development and tons of cool uses of the Iron Man armor.
D'Alessandro completed the animatic for the scene long before filming began and, below, you can check it out and read their account of creating it alongside director Shane Black.
Here's the Mansion Attack animatic:
And here's D'Alessandro's account of creating it.
I met with Shane Black very early during pre-production to discuss this scene. Even in the early stages, the sequence seemed gargantuan. So much needed to happen in a relatively short amount of time, and I knew that this would be my most challenging animatic yet. The beauty of the way Shane works is that he's not only a brilliant storyteller but he's very open to other ideas, and during my time on the show they trusted me as a creative collaborator. I wanted to reward the freedom they gave me and that led to some of my best work I've done for Marvel yet. After a few story meetings with Shane where we hashed out a lot of beats together, they gave me control of the scene and I went to work figuring out how to turn this sequence into a visual spectacle. Creating this animatic was a technically challenging process as I was trying a lot of new techniques not normally found in animatics. The storytelling had to be tight, the energy frenetic, and the action clear. One of the things I focused on was a “good news, bad news” stacking of the beats…Tony gets out of a bind, only to be faced with another challenge which they overcome but then they are immediately dealt a fresh problem. As much as anything else, Tony needed to outthink their attackers. Thankfully Shane and Marvel were ecstatic with the end result. By the time the animatic was approved by all the powers-that-be, were still many months away from shooting, but I think having this kind of scene locked down so early allowed Marvel to carefully strategize all the necessary elements to make this very complex scene come to life. In the end, they ended up following my animatic almost shot-to-shot, so seeing that on screen was an amazingly gratifying experience.
They promise to continue to load more Marvel animatics onto their YouTube account as well as their website, thefilmartist.com. Right now, he's already got a few more from Iron Man 3 as well as The Avengers. What differences do you notice?
The only reason Sarah Palin is a big deal in the first place––leading to the huge news of their Donald Trump endorsement today––is because of John McCain, and McCain reacted early tonight to Palin's endorsement of Trump.
Just as a refresher: despite their post-2008 differences, McCain and Palin have still been friendly. Palin supported McCain for reelection in 2010. When Trump made that nasty remark about liking POWs who don't get captured, unlike McCain, instead of maybe showing more support for their friend, Palin instead tried to split the difference by calling both Trump and McCain heroes.
And none of that even factors in how much McCain really, REALLY dislikes Donald Trump. On the other hand, McCain also dislikes Ted Cruz, whom Palin passed over.
So here's how McCain responded to Palin's Trump endorsement tonight:

Well, there you have it.

From John Tate, President of Campaign for Liberty:
September 24, 2009
Dear Friend of Liberty,
This Friday, the House Financial Services Committee will meet at 9 am eastern to hold a hearing on Congressman Paul's Audit the Fed bill, HR 1207.
We have come a long way in this historic effort, but your action is needed now more than ever.
Click here to find the names of the representatives on the Financial Services Committee and to get their contact information. Even if they do not represent your district, be sure to call as many of them as you can anyway, as their work on the Committee greatly impacts every one of us.
Urge them to pass the Audit the Fed bill to the floor on its own merits and not as part of an overall package that would strengthen the Federal Reserve and further damage our economy. Transparency in our monetary system is too important to be smothered in yet another Washington regulatory bill.
If your representative is not on the Committee, please contact them as well and tell them you want to know what the Fed has done with your money. Demand a standalone vote on Audit the Fed and that they cosponsor HR 1207 if they have not yet done so.
The hearing will be streamed live on the Committee's website.
This hearing would not have taken place if not for all of your hard work in calling, writing, faxing, and petitioning Congress to support HR 1207 and S 604, its Senate companion.
It's incredible to see all the support we have amassed in this historic effort, but if we want to achieve a complete victory, we must now push harder than ever and turn the heat up!
Your call could have a critical impact on your representative's decision. Contact them immediately!
In Liberty,
John Tate
President

In the 16th year of Emperor Wen's reign, 7th of the line of Han, 618 AUC, a caravan formed in and departed for the land of Sina. Lord Liu, riding upon their great 3 legged toads, General Tao, of the Black pearl, Lord Caishen of good fortune, Bi Gan, Li Fan, Kuan Yu, the 5 siblings of the world, and Tsai Sheng Li, 12 in all, representing the many lands of Sina, filled with wealth and trade, set out along with their followers to explore the lands to the west of their nation, having heard of the noble exploits of Zhang Qian and of new nations to the West. Our lord Tricephalus , also known as Hermes the guider of the dead, Mercury god of messengers, met them at the crossroads of the two rivers, and proposed that they sit and trade stories and goods. And they introduced themselves, and exchanged tales of their lands for 2 years. Tricephalus, wise and cunning, proposed to spread prosperity together across the land. They envisioned a great road, stretching to both east and west, where the gold would never end and merchants would not fear the bandits. Seeing that this was good, the Gods of swore to the pact, and shared their gold and spices. And considering this meeting fortuitous, and that greater gains might be made, they left to find other pantheons. Aje Shaluga, the 7 lucky lords of the Eastern Archipelago, and the many Jambhalas, masters of gold gathered together with the first 13 here, to discuss a great Prosperity, to benefit all nations. For 101 days and nights they sat and consulted, and finally they came upon a decision to sponsor a great and mighty road, sustained by their combined powers, to ease travel between their lands and bring wealth to all, whereupon these pillars were created to commemorate their alliance. Thus they numbered 42. And eventually others came, Lakshimi and their attendants, decked in the Spice of the southern lands from whence they came, (The cautious?), of the fish and maggots, forger of gold, and [Unreadable ] swearing to the pact, and partaking of its profits.

In the 215th year of the Qin dynasty, 200th year of the Western Han, 694th AUC, the Golden Confederation met again to discuss their continued compliance. There have been 37 raids on traveling caravans by Northern Barbarians, and many fear a direct assault on one of the way points. The Confederation has requested that those of the Central Kingdom lead an attack to prevent further interruptions of trade. To further assuage fears, the gods of the Indi, numbering 34, have agreed to fund 2 new resting points together, to be constructed in 5 years, for a total of 8 way points. The confederation then discussed raising tariffs, which can be found in tablet 4 of the year 694 AUC, and the supply of spices and metals, found in tablet 6 of the year 694 AUC. And thus the 76 member lords agreed to disperse and discuss with their respective kingdoms a unified measurement system. Thus ended the Confederation meeting of the year 694 AUC, 215th year of the Qin dynasty, blessed by the gods.

I fear for my life, for last night one of the great lords came and visited me. We welcomed two travelers from the east before we closed the gates. They had no caravan, and barely any baggage.
As I let them in, a worm flashed in one's clothes. I went up to him, and said "Brother, watch your clothes, for there are worms. Get them washed, that you may not get sick." They smiled, and said to me, "Your accent is that of Athens, is it not?" I said "Yes, Lord, my family maintained a temple to Mercury there. I left to seek my fortune with their blessing." They nodded and said no more. Later that night, I awoke to find the stranger in my room silencing me. They held up a staff, golden and intertwined with snakes, and I knew them to be my lord Hermes. They said "For your family's loyalty, I will let you know of a calamity that is coming, for I have done the greatest theft of all time. For years, I pretended to be content to rule with the others in the Confederation, but now it will all come down. The worm of silk, the great pride of the central kingdom, has been stolen by me." And they showed the inside of their cloak, filled with the valuable worms, and other treasures of the east. "Of course, the gods will be shaken and rage against the theft. But I have made a new alliance with the Northern tribes, and as the gods blame each other the Golden Hordes will sweep down as a storm and conquer, with me as their sole sponsor. None, god or merchant will be spared, of the South or the East, but Bynzantine will be my chosen city, and I will rule the world's trade networks from there. Flee while you can." And Hermes left. I write this now, as a record, should I not make it home to write it again. Any god which remains would surely call for my head, but this is one time I think my lord Hermes does not lie.

It is finally sinking in that for the first time in several years, I will not be at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Skipping the sappy comments about missing my racing friends and seeing the start of a new season, I'm going to miss the guy directing traffic after you go over the Turn 17 bridge into the paddock, La Bombe Racing, and of course the beer drinking "monks" who wander the paddock and bless the cars before returning to what I assume is the monastery they've built from empty kegs over in the Party Zone.
The one thing I won't miss is the cell service overload and the rip-off that is/was the track's Wi-Fi system. Have fun this year guys and gals, I'll be watching on TV.
CAIRO, Egypt – As Egyptians head to the polls today to elect a new lower house of parliament for the first time since 2005, many are already questioning its legitimacy after incidents of intimidation and other abuses by the government of President Hosni Mubarak.
A total of 508 seats are up for grabs in today's election, with more than 5,000 hopefuls competing from a variety of political parties.
But it is Mubarak's National Democratic Party, a well-oiled political machine that has held power for three decades, that is expected to come out on top.
The election comes after weeks of government clampdowns on both independent media outlets and opposition politicians. Experts and human rights groups say that the severity and efficiency of the recent suppression is a bleak bellwether for a country facing increasing political uncertainty in the run-up to the 2011 presidential election.
“The crackdown this year is much worse than it has ever been in the past,” said Emad Gad, a researcher at the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a state-funded think tank. “Egypt's democratic process, which is completely run by the ruling regime, is a controlled one. It is not open.”
Critics argue that the president's strength is maintained through tightly controlled electoral guidelines and a draconian emergency law that gives security forces unbridled power.
With increasing public speculation over the health of the 82-year-old Mubarak, who has never named a vice president, many see control of parliament as one of the biggest keys to presidential succession.
Mubarak and their party have dominated Egypt's political arena since they first took office in 1981. In 2007, a controversial amendment to Egypt's constitution required that all applicants to the post of president first gain 250 endorsements from Egypt's local and national legislative bodies – with the largest minimum requirement coming from the Peoples' Assembly.
Gad said that, more than ever, Egypt's government is “scared” that certain groups could make legislative gains, namely the banned but semi-tolerated Muslim Brotherhood.
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest opposition movement, is barred from participation in politics by a constitutional ban preventing the formation of parties with religious platforms.
Still, the Islamic group won a surprising 20 percent of the seats during the last election in 2005, circumventing the restriction by running as independent candidates.
At the time, they ran under the popular “Islam is the solution” banner.
Two years later, a parliament controlled by the National Democratic Party answered by amending the constitution to make the use of religious slogans and other campaign activities illegal.
More recently, however, the government has relied on brute force to keep dissenting voices at bay.
Recent campaign events held by the Islamic group in cities throughout the country have been cut short by state security using tear-gas, beatings and detentions to disperse the crowds.
“[The ruling NDP has] to use police force to stop our candidates from winning elections,” said Ramadan Omar, a Muslim Brotherhood parliamentary candidate in the Helwan district just south of Cairo.
Intimidation of candidates and voters, however, is nothing new for Egypt.
This June, in the days following the upper house election for parliament, widespread reports of official fraud and vote-rigging surfaced.
In the months leading up to this election, human rights groups and media professionals also criticized the heightened restrictions that have been placed on Egypt's independent media, including new limits on mobile phone text messaging and satellite uplinks used by television broadcasters.
Although Egypt is one of the biggest recipients of American foreign aid – at just under $2 billion annually – the United States has remained largely silent on the opposition's accusations of intimidation.
The Mubarak administration recently rebuffed a State Department request to allow foreign observers to polling stations, denouncing the United States for interfering in its internal affairs.
Instead, Egypt announced that certain civil society organizations would be allowed to monitor elections.
In a recent editorial published in the popular independent newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm, columnist Adel Iskandar noted that at least one of these groups had already been denied the necessary permits to cover the elections.
“The monitoring procedures in this election are embarrassing, if not catastrophic,” wrote Iskandar last week. “Every good election performance needs an audience. Once again, the regime has decided that only few would watch the final cut and the rest should be content with just the trailer.”
Stroll won last year's Formula 3 European Championship, and took the Italian Formula 4 title in 2014 while a Ferrari junior, but the role their family's wealth has played in their rise to F1 has been questioned in some quarters.
The 18-year-old, who made their debut last weekend in Melbourne, believes much of that comes from drivers who have not reached grand prix racing.
“Obviously people who are not in Formula 1 are trying to find excuses why they are not in Formula 1,” they told Motorsport.com.
“I think that the drivers in the [F1] paddock have respect of each other.
“They all know that winning Formula 4, Formula Renault, Formula 3 takes a lot of effort and work to do that.
“So for sure the drivers in Formula 1 have respect for each other, we know what it takes to arrive here and then obviously the drivers who are not here, most of the time, will find a way to find a reason not to be here.
“So it's normal. I don't think I need to spell it for you, but that's the way it is.
“Because you're always going to find jealous people and people that don't like you for the wrong reasons and that's the way it is.”
Stroll started their maiden grand prix in Australia in 20th place, having incurred a grid penalty for a gearbox change necessitated by a crash in practice.
Having climbed to 14th on the opening lap, Stroll was running in 13th place when they retired with a brake problem with 18 laps to go.
The Canadian believes respect within the F1 paddock is based on drivers having won championships such as Formula 3 on their way through the ranks.
“I think everyone here on the grid as drivers, and even the people who work in the teams, they really know racing, they know what it takes to arrive in Formula 1,” they said.
“They know the championships you need to win are challenging and to score the points for the superlicence, you need to be able to win them.
“And for drivers like [Sebastian] Vettel and [Lewis] Hamilton and [Esteban] Ocon – all of them had to win those championships.
“That's very challenging and they know that and that's why we share respect for each other even if we are racing all together, we have respect for each other.”
The executive shuffle is continuing at Microsoft, with two more high-profile execs getting new posts.
On November 13, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced via an e-mail message to all Microsoft employes that Eric Rudder is moving from their current post as Executive Vice President of Technology & Research, to a newly created role as Executive Vice President of Advanced Strategy. Taking Rudder's Technology & Research job is Harry Shum, who currently leads Bing Engineering at the company.
In their new position, Rudder will be overseeing undisclosed "key, cross company technology initiatives," according to Ballmer's e-mail. Rudder is set to move ino the new job in mid-December 2013.
In December 2012, Rudder took over completely the management of Microsoft Research, Trustworthy Computing, and the Technology Policy Group. Before that, they had been keeping a low profile since leaving their job as head of Server & Tools at the company, way back in 2006.
In the early 2000s, Rudder was often mentioned as one of the likely possible CEO successors to Bill Gates. But then they went underground to work mysterious projects, like Microsoft's Midori operating system .
For their part, Shum headed up the Microsoft Research China ateam before taking on the job of running Bing engineering. Qi Lu, the head of Microsoft's new applications and services engineering unit, is going to manage Shum's Bing engineering direct reports until a new head of engineering for Bing is appointed, according to the Ballmer e-mail.
What to make of these latest two changes of the guard? I genuinely don't think the moves signal any kind of intention by Microsoft's senior leadership to sell Bing. Bing is increasingly integrated into more and more Microsoft products and technologies -- including still-unannounced ones like Microsoft's "Cortana" rival to Apple's Siri -- making a Bing sell-off not only questionable, execution-wise, but also strategy-wise.
I also don't think Rudder's appointment means anything about how soon (if ever) any of the technology incubations, such as Midori, in which he's been involved, will debut.
Anybody has any guesses (educated or not) about what -- if anything -- these executive moves may mean, as CEO Steve Ballmer's replacement is expected to be named any time now?
The third media day of the Carolina Panthers OTA practices have come and gone. Here are a few photos and observations from the field.
Center Ryan Kalil received a congratulation on their two year contract extension. Ron Rivera remarked after practice on how important Kalil's extension it to the continuity of the offense. More should probably be written about Kalil and their positive impact on the team.
As Ted Ginn made their way to the field, they felt like entertaining the runningbacks. I can't really describe what they were doing (much to the pleasure of Jonathan Stewart), so here, just see for yourself.
Cam Newton is usually one of the last players to the field, but they are always running.
Newton gets limber away from the other players with their dedicated trainer. If you ever hear in the media that Cam is not stretching with their team, this is why. They take care of it before they even pick up a ball.
Thomas Davis and Mario Addison took the cart to practice. A veteran luxury not afforded to any rookies. It is probably best that they not even ask.
Running Back Brandon Wegher saw an increased number of reps today. Some with the second string and the rest with the third string. Wegher caught the ball nicely out of the backfield and had a few really nice gains. Panthers fans should be excited to see them again this preseason.
With KK Short still absent , Vernon Butler again started at the under tackle position. And once again, they were a monster. On one particular play they were so quickly in the offensive backfield that the play was halted. The entire defense began to whoop and holler as they patted Butler on their helmet. I am looking forward to seeing them with pads on.
The offensive line worked on run blocking quite a bit today. “Defenders” stand with a cushion as the offensive line move them out of position. Trai Turner looked especially good at this drill, always moving their man back a few yards. How men this large practice this intensely in the heat I will never know.

'The Tonight Show' gets a bigger audience because most people aren't looking for the self-righteous mirth of slamming those stupid Republicans right before bed.
I have a confession to make. I don't find Samantha Bee very funny. I also don't think John Oliver, Trevor Noah, or Seth Meyers are all that amusing. I bring this up because in The New York Times Ross Douthat wrote a column suggesting that liberal political comedians like Bee cause certain problems for Hillary Clinton. They say these late-night comedians and their views occupy a much greater space in culture than they do in the opinions of the electorate, which puts Clinton in an awkward position.
If Clinton gets too close to Bee's scolding progressivism, they risk losing more middle-of-the-road voters. But if they don't, they could alienate Bernie Sanders voters, 25 percent of whom already might not vote for them For their trouble, Douthat met some rather aggressive pushback from liberals, who view all the branches of the Jon Stewart comedy tree as gold.
The liberal New Republic ripped off two pieces attacking Douthat's conclusions. The first alleged that, wait for it, Douthat had not taken race into account thoroughly enough in arguing that part of Trump's appeal is rooted in their rejection of progressive political correctness. The second argued that they were off-base because most millennials are socially liberal, as if older Americans don't vote and younger people don't become older people.
Bee themselves weighed in, saying in a conference call “it's so good to know that we're the problem, and not racism,” according to New York Times writer Dave Iztkoff's Twitter feed. When Iztkoff got some blowback from conservatives they had this to say:
Isn't it interesting that people get so upset that comedians have any place in our discourse, or that viewers watch of their own volition? https://t.co/dAjiayVAkn — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) September 21, 2016
The weird thing about all of this is that the only people upset were liberals attacking Douthat's theory. Part of the reason so many reacted is no doubt affection for Bee, who regularly “destroys” all the horrible conservative badness in the country. But what really got under their skin was something deeper.
People Are Voting for Fallon With Their Remotes
The background for the current discussions about late-night comedy is the ferocious anger thrust at “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon for being too nice to Trump. Earlier this week I wrote about how wrongheaded the reaction was. But I failed to mention something that speaks to Douthat's theory that hyperpoliticizing entertainment is turning off more people than it is enlightening. Fallon and “The Tonight Show” blow their competition away in the ratings. The shows' viewership dwarfs all of the political-minded comedy shows.
“The Tonight Show” gets a bigger audience because most people aren't looking for the self-righteous mirth of slamming those stupid Republicans right before bed. Most would rather just have a chuckle. But as the backlash against Fallon shows, that apolitical style of comedy is not only becoming rare, it is being openly attacked as insufficiently politically militant.
This is the phenomenon to which Douthat is rightly attributing much of Trump's appeal. Their signature issue, more than immigration, more than crime, more than trade, is political correctness. Are some of their supporters downright racists? Sure, but many, many more connect with them when they say the speech police are keeping us from having frank conversations about real issues and problems. It is an effective argument for Trump because it is largely true. Yet saying so drives the progressives of the cultural elite absolutely bonkers with outrage.
There are comedians who eschew political correctness; Jerry Seinfeld has taken flack for criticizing the snowflake mentality of the permanently outraged. Some comedians unable to secure late-night TV spots use the more open arena of podcasts. One such celebrity is Norm MacDonald, and a recent podcast exchange with Stephan Merchant might give a hint about why television isn't giving them a broader platform.
About 12 minutes into a recent podcast, MacDonald and Merchant discuss transgenderism, pointing out ways in which the trans movement contradicts itself. At one point Macdonald asks if Merchant knows what cisgender means. Merchant didn't, so MacDonald explained it is a man born a man who identifies a man, going on to say, “It's a way of marginalizing normal people.”
Now, that's a funny joke to my way of thinking, but not one safe for TV. Tellingly, by the end of the segment on the trans issue, Merchant suggests they know they must have offended people, but he's not exactly sure how or why.
Stop Ordering Us How to Think
This is exactly the predicament many voters leaning towards Trump feel. Their ideas, concerns, and feelings are consistently dismissed as not only wrong, but so wrong that they must never be spoken or heard. They know people are offended by them, but they aren't even sure why, because it can't be discussed. Trump and those who share positions with them are so deplorable they should only appear on TV to be destroyed.
Meanwhile, Hollywood celebrities are lining up, not just to tell us not to vote for Trump, but that not voting for Trump is the most important thing anyone can do in their or their entire life. In response to the latest video of anti-Trump hysteria, Ben Domenech hit the nail on the head.
This is the most convincing ad for Trump I've ever seen. https://t.co/8rzZdxQOGc — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) September 21, 2016
I understand that many right-thinking Samantha Bee fans are disappointed that not every American has jumped on their “muticulti, choose your own pronoun, get out of my safe space before I'm triggered” bandwagon. It's hard knowing many people out there don't share one's fundamental beliefs. When we are told our religious beliefs, politics, and worldviews aren't acceptable in decent discourse, it pisses us off.
Trump's unique genius in this election cycle was in identifying political correctness as a major issue for many Americans. Resistance to the progressive inquisition explains better than anything else the surprising breadth of Trump's appeal. Liberals don't want to hear this; after all, they consider themselves to be the apex of tolerance. More and more Americans don't see it that way. They see a progressive hegemony that makes their ideas cogitatio non grata.
Should Trump become the next president, a possibility some on the Left are awaking to with cold shudders, the rebellion against political correctness will be why. As much pause as Trump gives me, that rebellion alone has made their candidacy worthwhile.
For the past five seasons, Heat guard Wayne Ellington felt like the new kid on the first day of training camp.
The start of camp was spent learning about their teammates, coaches or even the best route to the practice facility. Now, they no longer has to endure the uncomfortable experience.
When they re-signed with Miami, it meant Ellington would play on the same team again for the first time since the 2011-12 season.
"Well, it means a lot to me,” Ellington said Tuesday during an appearance at the Heat's youth camp at Nova High School. “It's my first time returning to a team since my second or third year in the NBA. It means a lot. It means a heckuva lot to me that a team wanted me back.”
The stability comes at the opportune time for a couple reasons. Ellington didn't have to uproot their family after the birth of their first son, Wayne III, in March. They also didn't have to leave behind a group of teammates they refer to as friends instead of co-workers.
“For somebody that's been on different teams for the past several years, being able to come back here and be with my brothers, we built a bond that we're friends,” Ellington said. “We're not just teammates. We're actually really friends. We really enjoy each other. So to be able to come back here … I've got a family now, stability is huge. It's something that you don't get a lot of in this business.”
Ellington was so they eager to remain here they didn't have a backup plan if the Heat chose to go in another direction. Instead, they patiently waited for the decision. The nerves eased once the Heat were able to trade forward Josh McRoberts to the Dallas Mavericks, freeing up cap space.
“Obviously, I've been in the league for a little while and I know how everything works,” Ellington said. “Seeing that the money kind of matches, it made me feel like that move is being done for a certain reason. Still, at the end of the day, you still never know.”
Ellington realized they wouldn't have to change scenery once the text messages began to come in. First, it was agent Jim Tanner. Then it was assistant coach Octavio De La Grana, who works out with Ellington before every game.
And, finally, coach Erik Spoelstra.
"It never got that far where I needed to have anything backup,” Ellington said. “Like I said, speaking to my agent throughout the whole process and speaking to everybody that's here, staff and teammates, I felt very confident throughout the whole process. They all made sure of that."
The following are the Miami Heat salaries of all 17 players under contract for the 2017-18 season: (Keven Lerner) (Keven Lerner)
Another year in Miami provides opportunity for Ellington to improve on last year's breakout season. They averaged career-highs in points (10.5) and 3-pointers made (149) on 37 percent shooting. The Heat fell just one game shy of making the playoffs despite going 11-30 the first half of the season.
Ellington used a toy from their childhood to describe how this year could unfold if they avoid the early season struggles.
“I kind of compare it to one of those cars -- you know those cars when you're a kid that go back in order to go forward,” Ellington said. “ … We had to kind of go backward and learn each other and figure it out. Towards the end of the year the car was all the way back and ready to go forward. I think we're ready to just go forward. We're all anxious man.”

The Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter at Loyola University was temporarily suspended by the university administration for verbally assaulting a student group tabling for Birthright Israel according to the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law.
The Brandeis Center, which seeks “to advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and to promote justice for all,” noted in a press release that the university presented SJP “with a letter indicating that SJP is temporarily prevented from hosting any on-campus activities or events until their leadership meets with Loyola University Chicago representatives and the group complies with stated policies and procedures that apply to all student organizations.”
"By all reports, this appears to have been a serious incident, and we are glad that Loyola University Chicago is taking it seriously. More work must still be done, and we hope that Loyola University Chicago will follow up and take appropriate further action,” Brandeis Center President Kenneth L. Marcus stated in a letter to university President Michael J. Garazini. “Sadly, we have seen a pattern of incidents in which SJP has violated the rights of other students and the rules of other universities. We are glad that Loyola University Chicago is upholding its standards and values."
As first reported by The College Fix, SJP “verbally assaulted their Jewish peers recently, hurling a variety of insults at them before creating a human wall to block their attempt to advertise trips to Israel.”
One student told The College Fix that members of SJP approached the table and asked students, “How does it feel to be an occupier?” and “How does it feel to be guilty of ethnic cleansing?”
In August, a friend of the SJP chapter at Temple University who was standing near an SJP table punched a Jewish student in the face. The attacker was later arrested and charged.
We estimated recently that entire countries may choose to jump into a decentralized financial system flooded by CryptoCurrencies, in order to escape from the monopoly of the Western hard currencies.
Less than two months later, it was the turn of Venezuela to announce that is considering to issue its own CryptoCurrency. As MintPressNews reports:
Months after Russia became the first country to announce the creation of a state-backed Cryptorouble, Venezuela has followed suit, announcing the creation of El Petro, a state-sanctioned cryptocurrency to be backed by Venezuela's extensive reserves of crude oil.
Venezuela has already broken free of Dollar dependence months ago when Caracas announced it would be trading its oil using China's Petroyuan. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro also stated that they would like to begin trade with Russia in the Rouble. With Venezuela heavily sanctioned by the United States, El Petro looks to be another tool which Venezuela can use to continue and conduct international commerce without relying on Dollar based financial institution.
Crucially, while existing Cryptocurrencies tend to create their initial value through an arithmetic process called “mining”, leaving them heavily subject to market fluctuation, El Petro will be backed by a known commodity, oil, thus giving it a clear advantage for risk-averse investors. While the world's most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has seen its value skyrocket against the Dollar, some remain unconvinced of its long-term prospects for stability. A currency, backed by oil would, by contrast, ostensibly fluctuate in accordance with the well established global price of Brent Crude.
[...]
An official oil-backed cryptocurrency could work in tandem with Russia's soon to be launched Cryptorouble, a digital currency which will ostensibly be backed by the vast resources of the Russian state. With western governments ambivalent about how to treat existing cryptocurrencies, Russia and Venezuela have taken the lead to both normalize cryptos while backing them by well-known assets.
More countries are expected to follow the example of Russia and Venezuela, or BRICS as a whole. An interesting case is Greece. Many in Greece are considering Bitcoin and other alternative currencies as a solution against the monetary dictatorship of the ECB.
Recall that, w hile Greece was the major victim of an economic war, Germany used its economic power and control of the European Central Bank to impose unprecedented austerity, sado-monetarism and neoliberal destruction through silent financial coups in Ireland , Italy and Cyprus . The Greek political establishment collapsed with the rise of SYRIZA in power, and the ECB was forced to proceed in an open financial coup against Greece when the current PM, Alexis Tsipras, decided to conduct a referendum on the catastrophic measures imposed by the ECB, IMF and the European Commission, through which the Greek people clearly rejected these measures, despite the propaganda of terror inside and outside Greece. Due to the direct threat from Mario Draghi and the ECB, who actually threatened to cut liquidity sinking Greece into a financial chaos, Tsipras finally forced to retreat, signing another catastrophic memorandum.
Under a really open-minded government that will seek to liberate Greece from the ECB dictatorship, Greece may become the next country that will choose to abandon euro currency sado-monetarism through its own CryptoCurrency. This will also permit Greece to find an alternative on the rapidly growing market led by BRICS. Under similar circumstances, the entire European periphery may follow. Countries who also suffer from the euro sado-monetary prison, like Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland could issue their own CryptoCurrencies in order to escape from the euro-tyranny.
But the CryptoCurrency alternative could be used by the eurozone countries also as a backup plan against a potential collapse of the rotten eurozone structure in the close future.
Again, the CryptoMarket anarchists have nothing to fear. A CryptoCurrency issued by BRICS, or some member-states, or even other countries separately, will not be a threat for the decentralized nature of the rest of CryptoCurrencies. On the contrary, it will give them a significantly wider field and greater opportunities for all kinds of transactions inside a dynamically growing economic bloc which, if nothing else, does not rely on wars and destruction to maintain its dominance.
However, authorities should not exhibit excessive control on certain issues. There should be a viable balance between free activity and regulation. Russia already works to regulate virtual currencies:
As the Russian government is working on laws to regulate virtual currencies, the country's finance ministry has proposed making their mining illegal. However, buying them will not be punishable.
"The penalties will be different, mostly administrative, but if someone created the cryptocurrency for the purpose of settlements, then there will be a criminal punishment," said Deputy Finance Minister Aleksey Moiseev.
Criminal penalties can also be applied to the creation of a financial pyramid or the issuance of a cryptocurrency to avoid tax, they said. The minister stressed buying bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies would be legal.
Moiseev added that work on the bill could drag on, as it includes many new words and concepts now absent in Russian legislation.
At the moment, bitcoin mining and selling are not regulated by Russian law. President Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to create legislation governing the status of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, mining, initial coin offerings, as well as defining everything that relates to digital money by July 2018.
The Ministry of Finance earlier suggested introducing mandatory registration of cryptocurrency miners and only to allow legal entities and individual entrepreneurs to participate.
A Sikh student having a coffee at an Auckland cafe has been mistaken for a terrorist, with police called out to investigate whether their headphones were a bomb.
Jaspreet Singh was sitting at Columbus cafe yesterday morning, outside Auckland Hospital, and a few metres away from the University of Auckland Medical School where they are studying to become a doctor.
Mr Singh is 21 and wears a turban as part of their Sikh faith.
They were meeting their mentor and research supervisor, Professor Luke Larkin, to talk about a research project they were keen to get involved with.
Two police officers entered the cafe 20 minutes later and asked Mr Singh to step outside. Prof Larkin initially refused on their behalf, arguing the officers were picking on them because of their race.
Mr Singh said they were shocked, but obliged and followed the police out.
"They took me outside and they explained that someone had called them and said I was doing something with wires in my laptop bag."
They said their first reaction was to laugh, and the police quickly realised they posed no danger.
"They were quite apologetic because that was quite ridiculous. They were just doing their job."
Police spokesperson Scott Leonard confirmed the callout was made yesterday morning.
"Someone saw a male with headphones out... and then put wires into what looked like a transistor radio in a backpack."
They said police went to the cafe and spoke to the parties involved, but decided there was nothing of concern.
Columbus Coffee general operations manager Peter Webster said the first they heard about the incident was when their marketing manager told them about RNZ's online report.
They said they were embarrassed about the racial tone of the incident, which was something that had never happened in their shop before.
"We don't like anything that would imply that any one of our customers is racist; we don't particularly like that."
If customers had any concerns about anything happening in the cafe, they should first bring it to the attention of cafe staff, they said.
"I would encourage them with any concern going on in our cafes... of anything suspicious to raise it with the store manager of the cafe, so that they can deal with the problem there and then."
They said they would be in touch with Mr Singh to apologise.
"Obviously it has nothing to do with any our staff or franchisees, but we don't like the idea of any of our customers being made embarrassed."
Behaviour 'going to breed more fear'
A barista working at the time of the incident, Tove Carland, said they were in the bathroom about 10 minutes before the police arrived and heard a woman making a phone call, sounding very nervous, and describing a man in a turban sitting across from them
When the officers turned up, Ms Carland realised the woman had been calling the police.
They said they believed, from what they heard, it was no more than racism.
"They had no reason to call. They just said 'oh, they have a turban'... So soon after the [Paris] terrorist attacks and everything, people are being crazy."
Prof Larken, who was having coffee with Mr Singh during the incident, said people might be on edge because of what had happened in Paris and other parts of the world, but it was not good enough.
"It's that kind of behaviour that's going to breed more fear and hurt and anger."
They had called for the person who phoned the police to step forward but no-one did, they said.
Mr Singh said they could guess who had made the call because of the woman's reaction to how they looked and how they were dressed.
"I think, [based on] when I entered the cafe initially, I think I know who made the call but I'd rather not say who it is."
They said the incident was influenced by some racial bias, but had more to do with ignorance and fear.
"This isn't about holding someone accountable, but more so using this to raise awareness about these sorts of issues. The biases we hold in our society and how we can fight them."
Supreme Sikh Council spokesperson Daljit Singh said New Zealand was a very tolerant country, and the other customer's judgement might have been clouded by what happened in Paris.
"There's only a very small number of people that are thinking like that, otherwise we've never had any issues."

One person is dead and three people were injured following a multi-vehicle accident in College Station Monday evening.
The crash happened around 6 p.m. at the intersection of Holleman Drive and Harvey Mitchell Parkway.
Officials say a Silver Honda Pilot was heading north on Harvey Mitchell parkway when it hit a maroon Honda Accord attempting to turn left.
The crash then sent the Accord into a Mercedes that was stopped at the light.
According to police, 21-year-old Caroline Killian was a passenger in the Accord. They were taken to the hospital where they were later pronounced dead. Sources say Killian was an A&M student.
All three drivers were taken to the hospital with injures but they are all expected to be okay.
The driver of the Accord was given a citation for failure to yield the right-of-way.
Police say alcohol was not a factor in the crash.
Music Music Big Fish Theory A- Music Big Fish Theory A- A- Big Fish Theory Artist Vince Staples Label Def Jam
You don't want to write about Vince Staples. Few modern musicians have made playing with the press such an essential part of their appeal. There is, on the one hand, their endless trolling: sardonic tweets about American Apparel and 3 Ninjas; their sarcastic sponsorship of Sprite, which is almost long-form performance art at this point; their participation in what has to be one of the least illuminating Reddit AMAs ever conducted. When a journalist does get some face time with him, they refuse to play along, defying their attempts to narrativize their role in hip-hop or analyze their music. And even if they give you a good quote, you still have to stay on guard. They told L.A. Weekly that their new album, Big Fish Theory, was “Afro-futurism”; a few days later, they told The Daily Show's Trevor Noah they were just fucking around with all that. “I like saying stuff about black people to white people,” they said. “Got a lot of headlines, happened every day this week.” Even in that interview, they were five steps ahead of Noah, setting up most of the jokes so the host could get easy dunks.

The primary lesson learned from all of these interactions is this: Vince Staples is smarter than you. It's tempting to carry this disaffection over to the music itself, which occasionally describes acts of violence with a bracing, Mobb Deep-like remorselessness, refusing to moralize or pander to people looking for more solutions-based rap music. It can scan as nihilism when he's dreaming of a clip that's long enough to shoot until he's dead, or engaging in territorial chest-thumping in “Norf Norf,” but there's something about their terse phrasings that suggests an embedded morality. From their earliest works, he's sketched out an almost Cormac McCarthy-esque power structure: a racially hierarchical world in which men clamber over each other like crabs in a bucket, the ones on the bottom dulling themselves with drugs, and everyone else fighting upward toward money and sex, the ultimate arbiters of power. A few might dupe themselves into thinking that turning to God will suffice. On last year's Prima Donna EP, Staples found themselves far from the bucket, drinking wine with women in Dubai. But the larger power structure remained the same, and that rarest thing—love, glimpsed only in flashes—stayed elusive. They compared themselves to Da Vinci and Joyce, called themselves “Gatsby gone gangsta,” then dreamed of painting their new kitchen with their own blood. God went largely unmentioned.
On the new Big Fish Theory, he's richer but no happier, and so they go looking for both God and love where people always have since time immemorial: on the dance floor. Don't call the result Afro-futurist, lest you attract the Sauron-like gaze of Staples' derision—but then again, maybe do, because the term's apt. They corral producers like Australian EDM star Flume, PC Music mainstay Sophie, Miami house duo GTA, and Southern California beat scene newcomer Zack Sekoff to create cavernous sonic spaces, full of pneumatic drums and phasing synthesizers, in which formal emceeing is treated as an almost stylistic punctuation. He's name-checked Grace Jones as an influence on the record, and in their image they act as more of a dance-floor maven than solipsistic rap star.
This isn't the densely lyrical autobiography of Summertime '06—even if Staples remains one of our preeminent rap stylists, with an ability to skip their voice high over the beat like some bastard fusion of Eazy-E and André 3000. Big Fish Theory veers off the course set by its predecessor, bucking the sophomore slump by ditching the vast majority of their old collaborators and peers in favor of the sort of whole-cloth artistic reinvention generally associated with canonical greats like Kanye or Bowie. What's even crazier is that they stick the landing. It's their second classic LP in a row.

The album starts with windswept synthesizers and the familiar sound of gulls circling the horizon, but soon heavily modified vocals and skittering drums come in, sounding more like Burial than the boom-bap of yore. Turns out Clams Casino's “Norf Norf” fit them too well: While a lot of the drums here would sound at home during the fever pitch of a big-tent EDM set or blaring out of a South Beach sports car, the tracks here trade far more in the horror-flick synths (“745,” “SAMO”) and esoteric compositions of the experimental beat scene. They surge to life, evolve, and fade out, like a Nosaj Thing instrumental. It's an enveloping new setting for Staples, whose Prima Donna now looks like the jettisoning of their final DJ Dahi and No I.D. work in favor of a cohesive new aesthetic.
Lyrically, however, that EP's tableau of panic attacks in expensive hotel rooms remains. Staples is still obsessing over the ladder of power: He's finally got the waves at their front door and women waiting for them in Paris, breathing easy and enjoying life as much as their constitution allows on the careening title track. But he's much more focused on a loveless drive to an expensive restaurant, still smarting as their date heads wordlessly to the oyster bar, and worrying about paparazzi snapshots accidentally revealing how much pain he's in. On the queazy, rattling “SAMO,” nestled between a bunch of paranoid musings on backstage grifters and their own envisioned last supper, they ask, “If I wrote your ass a love song could I make it bang?“
The answer, 12 times over, is yes. You never get a picture of whom that love song's for, and maybe it's no one. This isn't so much a breakup album as it is a richly robed portrait of loneliness. One of Staples' long-running concerns is the failure of language to truly connect people, and it's the thing they still can't shake, no matter what they can buy or who they can fuck. It's partly why they refuse to analyze their lyrics, explain their references, or play nice with the press, and it's partly why they don't cast judgment on the womanizing, violence, feckless commercialism, and existential despair that fill their verses. But there's a glimmer of hope in the fact that they keep trying. They keep stacking their words in flamboyant arrays and using them to venomously describe the systems that created that bucket, as well as to remember the fury they felt within it.

On Big Fish Theory, an album about the guilt that comes with transcending one's home, Staples finds a better language still. They conclude with the imagistic “Rain Come Down,” a jet-setting fever dream of regret and yearning, concluding, “Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound”—a straight-edge paean to the transportive power of music. They may not have found God or love on the dance floor, but they found music, and that's good enough for now.

While Bond 25 is still without a director, confirmed title or leading lady, 007's next ride might have just been unveiled and it looks...
Very fast.
Introducing the new, improved and very luminous 2019 Vantage, Aston Martin's latest addition to one of its most popular and powerful models, the next generation features a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine that will take it from 0 to 60mph in 3.5 seconds and on to a maximum speed of 195mph. Which should give it just enough speed to drag race through the markets of Istanbul, or whatever else Bond has lined up for their next outing.
Along with its ridiculously powerful engine, the new Vantage features 50:50 weight distribution (good for handling), bonded aluminium panels, a "three-stage adaptive-damper system," an overall larger build and rear LED lights connected with a single "central light bar."
Nice.
Available to order now for a starting price of just £120,900, the 2019 Vantage will begin shipping during the second half of 2018.
But is it good for shunting Fiat 500's?

An image of a male police believe might be able to assist with inquiries into the malicious damage of a number of public monuments in Hyde Park. Credit:NSW Police On Saturday, NSW Police released images of a man they want to speak to.  They are described as being of Caucasian appearance with a full face beard, wearing black sunglasses, khaki coloured jacket with a red shirt or scarf underneath, black track pants and brown boots. "We as police support the right to protest, but defacing public property is unacceptable and is criminal. If anybody has information that can lead us to the people involved, we are certainly keen to hear from them," acting Inspector Peter Northey said. The statue of Queen Victoria was also targeted in the attack, with the words "F---ing bow down" spray-painted onto the pedestal. A bag was also placed on the head of Macquarie and graffiti was sprayed on the Archibald Memorial Fountain, ANZAC Memorial, several park benches in Hyde Park and in Martin Place, police said.
"if we can't have this conversation in a country, democratically and respectfully, then it is just disgraceful": Stan Grant. Credit:Dallas Kilponen Grant lamented the actions of a small minority, stating that they reflect poorly on those who want to have a civil, rational debate. "People who do that, they actually reflect badly, not just on themselves, but if they actually care about Indigenous people and our cause, they are the ones who damage us. It's ridiculous. You know, we should all be able to come to this properly and conduct ourselves legally and respectfully." The male captured on CCTV appeared to carry a white can in their right hand. Credit:NSW Police "If you look at the history of the Aboriginal struggle in Australia, the history of it, has been peaceful. Indigenous people have conducted themselves with dignity, and peace and honour and have sought a way to be part of this country.
"And everything I have ever written has been about allowing us to feel as if we are part of this country too because we love it too and that's been the hallmark of the Indigenous struggle. So anything that goes to vilify people or mocking people or threatening people or defacing things is not what we do in Australia." A bag was also placed on the head of Governor Macquarie. Credit:Lily Mayers/ABC News Former prime minister Tony Abbott also condemned the acts of vandalism, calling for the vandals to be charged and prosecuted. "It's what happens when politically correct activists decide to jump on a US bandwagon. What I want to hear is an unequivocal statement from [Opposition Leader] Bill Shorten that our history must be respected and strong action by NSW Police and Sydney City council to prosecute politically motivated vandals," they said. James Cook is a most unlikely candidate to be dragged back and forth like a rag doll by today's cultural warriors. Credit:Cole Bennetts
Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison also criticized the vandalism, in a statement on their Facebook page. "Enough is enough. This is a bloody disgrace. This is an insult to all fair minded Australians who don't look back on our history with ignorance or rose coloured glasses, but also rightly acknowledge our extraordinary achievements as a nation since Lt James Cook turned up almost 250 years ago." They said. The statue of Captain James Cook in Sydney's Hyde Park that was defaced, which is understood to have prompted Mr Bolt's column.

"This divisive BS political grandstanding and vandalism does nothing but indulge the egos of the perpetrators. It is an exercise in pure vanity. Grow up, you're not helping anyone or anything."
The statue of Queen Victoria was also targeted in the attack, with expletive-laden words painted onto the pedestal. Credit:Cole Bennetts Grant believes no positives will come from these acts, arguing that respectful debate is the most effective way to advance the cause of Indigenous Australians. "No good comes from illegality. And no good comes from whipping people up into a state of frenzy. What good comes from is people coming out into society and being able to speak and have rational debate without mocking people or vilifying people or threatening people or going out and defacing things. "It's just not what we do. You know, it's not what we do. And it's not how people should conduct themselves. No good comes from that sort of nonsense." The acts have largely been condemned, with many taking to Twitter to denounce the vandalism. However, many were also quick to condemn Grant for their comments throughout the week, blaming them for the vandalism.
Grant, however, argues that they have never encouraged this sort of behaviour. "I just look at it and whatever I write, whatever I try to do, is based around rational, civil, polite argument. Not mocking, hysterical, not vilifying, but saying how do we actually find a way to live together in this country. "If people want to go to anything that I've ever said, that's what they'll find. This sort of thing, and people turning it into ridiculous hysterical debate doesn't help, it's just ridiculous." NSW Police are investigating the incident, while City of Sydney council workers have finished cleaning the statues. Loading
The statues were at the centre of controversy earlier in the week after it was revealed lord mayor Clover Moore had referred concerns about the statues to the council's Indigenous Advisory Panel. The news prompted claims by Mr Abbott that the statue of Cook would be torn down by Mr Shorten if they won the next federal election.
Calgary-Centre MP Kent Hehr was lauded as an inspiration and "strong voice for Alberta" after being sworn in as Canada's minister of veterans affairs and associate minister of national defence — one of two Albertans in Justin Trudeau's new cabinet.
​Hehr was one of two Liberal MPs elected from Calgary in the Oct. 19 federal election, the first ones from the city since 1968. A lawyer and popular former Alberta MLA, they defeated incumbent Conservative MP Joan Crockatt by just 906 votes in Calgary-Centre.
Hehr bubbled over with enthusiasm as they and other soon-to-be ministers arrived with Trudeau at Rideau Hall in Ottawa this morning.
"It is awesome, man. It is very cool to be here," Hehr said. "It's an honour to be here in Ottawa to be part of a national government and get to play a role that is meaningful to both me and the citizens of Calgary."
Later, they took a more official tone.
"I, Kent Hehr, do solemnly and sincerely swear that I shall be a true and faithful servant to Them Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as a member of Them Majesty's Privy Council for Canada," Hehr said as they took the official oath inside Rideau Hall in Ottawa this morning.
'It is awesome, man. It is very cool to be here!' Calgary Liberal MP Kent Hehr said minutes before being sworn in at Rideau Hall as minister of veterans affairs and associate minister of national defence in Justin Trudeau's new cabinet. (CBC)
'A strong voice for Alberta'
Their appointment was welcomed in their home town.
Hehr 'has inspired so many for so long and will continue to bring their compassion and humanity to their new role.' - Mayor Naheed Nenshi
"[Hehr] has inspired so many for so long and will continue to bring their compassion and humanity to their new role," Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said in a release.
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley sent out a statement congratulating Trudeau and their newly appointed cabinet ministers — especially Hehr and Edmonton Liberal MP Amarjeet Sohi, who was tapped to be minister of infrastructure and communities minister.
"I'm confident you will be a strong voice for Alberta in the federal government," Notley said.
Even some prominent Conservatives joined the chorus of congrats.
Jason Kenney, former defence minister and Conservative MP for Calgary Midnapore, tweeted: "Congratulations ... to fellow Calgarian @KentHehr on their appointment as Minister of Veterans Affairs."
Alberta Conservative MP John Barlow also tweeted that they look forward to working with Hehr.
A shooting in October 1991 left Hehr a C5 quadriplegic. They were a 22-year-old student planning to become a physical education teacher when they were shot while riding in a friend's car.
'Veterans Affairs has always been a land mine'
Rev. Bette Madaro says they are glad to see a Calgary MP will be representing Canada's veterans at the federal government level. (CBC)
Rev. Bette Madaro, a chaplain with the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 285 in Calgary, says Hehr will have their work cut out for them on the veterans file.
"Well, I'm glad we got a Calgary MP representing this area, 'cause there are plenty of young veterans here as well as the older veterans that need help," Madaro said.
"I think that they need to do a lot more for post-traumatic stress disorder," they said.
Hehr faces big challenges in their new job, according to Mount Royal University policy studies professor Duane Bratt.
"Veterans Affairs has always been a land mine, as it were," they said. "Julian Fantino handled it horribly."
Two other Liberals were elected in Alberta as part of the party's historic breakthrough in the province.
Darshan Kang took Calgary-Skyview in a decisive victory over Conservative incumbent Devinder Shory and Randy Boissonnault won in Edmonton-Centre.
Bratt added that Trudeau's decision to put two of their four Alberta caucus members in cabinet should be viewed as a signal that they see the province as important.

Damien Comolli has defended Tottenham's lack of signings this summer, telling talkSPORT it's ‘an almost impossible task' to improve their young and talented first XI.
Last season's Premier League runners-up are yet to spend a penny in the summer transfer window, despite banking over £70million by selling the likes of Kyle Walker, Nabil Bentaleb and Federico Fazio.
Many have questioned why Spurs have been so slow in building on their impressive squad this summer, with many fans also voicing their frustrations while all their closest rivals have strengthened and spent millions in the market.
But former director of football Comolli believes manager Mauricio Pochettino and chairperson Daniel Levy deserve a lot of credit for building such a special squad, saying that it was always going to an extremely difficult task to make them better.
“I think Tottenham deserve so much respect for what they've achieved,” the Frenchman told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast.
“Daniel Levy and Mauricio Pochettino are working with less money than everybody else and working on a lot smaller wage bill than any of the Premier League's top five – we need to give them some credit.
“I'm sure they know exactly where they're going [in the transfer market].
“The thing with Spurs which is extremely difficult for them to deal with and is probably very frustrating, is that if you take that first XI, it's so difficult to make it better because every player is fantastic, every player is young…
“There's was the second youngest team in Europe among the top five teams last season and yet they finished second in the Premier League which is the most competitive league.
“So to reinforce that team with players who are as good or better than those players, and as young too, it's almost an impossible task.
“They're probably looking for young and up-and-coming players to come an compliment that team, probably two or three and I'm sure they'll achieve that in the end.
“It must be so difficult to find reinforcements for that team.
“Pound-for-pound, every player could play for almost every club in the world, that's how good that starting XI is.”
A report by a panel of experts has called for minor drugs offences to be decriminalised in west Africa, saying trafficking, consumption and production is undermining development and causing a public health crisis.
The West Africa Commission on Drugs (WACD) said on Thursday that current policies were fuelling corruption in a region where the cocaine trade alone, estimated at $1.25bn a year, dwarfs the combined budgets of several countries.
"We call on west African governments to reform drug laws and policies and decriminalise low-level and non-violent drug offences," Olusegun Obasanjo, the commission chairperson and former president of Nigeria, told reporters in Dakar on Thursday.
"West Africa is no longer just a transit zone for drugs arriving from South America and ending up in Europe but has become a significant zone of consumption and production.
"The glaring absence of treatment facilities for drug users fuels the spread of disease and exposes an entire generation, users and non-users alike, to growing public health risks."
The commission highlighted the drug-fuelled instability in Guinea-Bissau, a country of just 1.5 million people which has been wracked by conflict between the army and state since independence from Portugal in 1974.
Drug traffickers have turned the country, sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, into a transit point for the international cocaine trade.
'Militarisation of drug policy'
The WACD report also argued that the widespread criminalisation of drug use was bloating the prison population.
Most governments' reaction to simply criminalise drug use without thinking about prevention or access to treatment has not just led to overcrowded jails, but also worsened health and social problem Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the UN
Inmates are rarely reformed and in many cases end up more criminalised or sick as a result of their time inside, said the report, entitled "Not Just in Transit - Drugs, the State and Society in West Africa."
The study is the culmination of 18 months of research and consultations with the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, and several regional and national organisations.
The report was commissioned by Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the UN.
Contributors included Senegalese psychiatrist Idrissa Ba, retired Sierra Leonean judge Justice Bankole-Thompson, Pedro Pires, a former president of Cape Verde.
It describes the political, social and economic challenges that the region must confront to prevent drug trafficking, production and consumption from undermining states and societies, and destroying lives.
"Most governments' reaction to simply criminalise drug use without thinking about prevention or access to treatment has not just led to overcrowded jails, but also worsened health and social problems," Annan said.
The authors make a draft of recommendations for states to adopt a joined-up policy for battling drug abuse which includes treating it as a public health issue rather than as a criminal justice matter, the AFP news agency reported.
Their report urges west African states to tackle corruption within governments, the security services and the judiciary that drugs cartels have been able to exploit.
It also calls for governments to avoid "militarisation of drug policy" which it says has been ineffective in Latin America.
"We caution that west Africa must not become a new front line in the failed 'war on drugs', which has neither reduced drug consumption nor put traffickers out of business," the report said.
It's high time heads start rolling over the unacceptable, inhumane state of Ontario's jails. And we don't mean the heads of lower-level functionaries, such as the warden who parted ways with the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre months ago. We mean people – politicians, high-level provincial officials – who knew better, or should have known better.
We also need real, not just symbolic, change.
Most Ontarians, we'll wager, aren't sympathetic to the kinds of people who end up in our provincial jails. But still, we are all ethically and legally bound to treat them with humanity, and too many cases have come to light in which this is not the case.
In the latest example, the Citizen reported Friday about two men who complained of being held in segregation for 24 hours, naked, at the Innes Road jail. The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services wouldn't confirm or deny the allegations, merely saying this wouldn't be normal practice.
That dodge comes in the context of previous lack of candour from officials. Earlier this year, when the Citizen inquired about reports of prisoners held in mouldy shower cells, ministry officials denied it had happened – until suddenly they admitted it was happening and scrambled to ban the practice.
Here's more context: Adam Capay, 24, was held alone in a cell in Thunder Bay for four years, with the lights on constantly, awaiting trial for allegedly killing another inmate. People in the system knew about this. Premier Kathleen Wynne, while “troubled” about it, hasn't indicated she'll hold anyone accountable.
And here's more: Mutiur Rehman, 23, will spend 5 1/2 years in jail for stabbing André Boisclair to death in 2013. Rehman had been held at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre and it was believed he'd been in segregation there for 18 months, and had lost their mind. Wrong. They did lose their mind – though they recovered after intensive treatment – but they were actually held for 24 months. We know this because of records produced in court.
Their lawyer said they had had their mattress taken away, and been denied food. (The ministry this week told the Citizen that taking away mattresses and canteen privileges will no longer be available as punishments to inmates.)
And here's even more context: Responses provided by inmates of the Innes Road jail to a task force that Yasir Naqvi (corrections minister at the time) convened in April to offer up reform recommendations were, apparently, destroyed, so no one can review the originals. Why? Who was responsible for torching these important records?
Taxpayers are funding what is starting to look like a morally bankrupt jail system in Ontario.
In 2011, a United Nations special rapporteur said solitary confinement is torture. The Ontario Human Rights Commission and Ontario ombudsman have called for an end to segregation.
It's true the Liberal government isn't totally ignoring the problem. Federal corrections investigator Howard Sapers has been called in for a review of segregation in Ontario, starting in January. He's already said that, in the federal system, there should be no solitary for mentally ill inmates.
Meanwhile, the province dithers, and the abuse, the sometimes-irreparable harm to our fellow Canadians, continues within the walls of Ontario jails. Neither Naqvi, who's now the attorney general, or David Orazietti, the current corrections minister, were available to comment Friday, though Orazietti's office released a statement, in response to the Citizen's inquiry, with no new information.
Nobody consequential is being held accountable. It's time they were.

Update : HERE A physical photo the helmet has shown up and can be seen
Indie Revolver has photos of the actual Stormtrooper designs for Star Wars: Episode VII. And there are two! Sounds to me like something we have mentioned before. We have heard about these details over and over again for the new trooper designs.
Indie Revolver says:
The sequel Stormtrooper helmet feels like a natural continuation from the original, but there are distinct differences. The helmet is not symmetrical – there's only one breather/vent on the bottom near the mouth, on their left side. The black “mouth” area under the white nose plate appears to be a cloth/mesh (which you can better see in the detail shot below). The eye lenses are still separate, but set into a black frame to connect them and give the illusion of one single piece.. A couple people have referred to this as a “Jungle Trooper,” but I have a few good reasons to believe that this is actually an update to the Empire Strikes Back's Snowtrooper. This new helmet has a flared dome and a single thin horizontal eyepiece to it (as we first saw described at Making Star Wars) and appears to have a removable face mask.
newtrooper newtrooper2 newtrooper3
Jason EDIT: The “Jungle Trooper” as mentioned has been spotted on a few different sets at Pinewood. I believe they're calling it that because it appears in the sequence which take place at the “tree house” set and Puzzlewood exteriors.
I have to be honest about the John Boyega Stormtrooper stuff. We're slightly confused right now on our front. It appears they are a Stormtrooper of some kind. But we can't ascertain if that's backstory and he's already defected by the time the film begins or if they defect from the Empire on screen itself. The background in the first pic makes me speculate that might be the type of costume John Boyega's character would wear if he's still in a Stormtrooper.
You might have caught the film “12 Years a Slave.” We hear less, though, about the lives of indentured workers who replaced slaves.
But a new book by Gaiutra Bahadur is changing that, and rescuing their great-grandmother's story along the way. Bahadur's new book is called “Coolie Woman.” But, what's behind the title?
“The word ‘coolie,'” Bahadur says, “comes from the Tamil and it means wages. But then the term was given this stigma of this new form of slavery when British bureaucrats used it to describe indentured laborers.”
Those workers include the hundreds of thousands of South Asians who crossed the Atlantic to work under contract in the colonial Caribbean in conditions similar to slavery.
“Coolie” eventually became known as an ethnic slur for Asian workers.
But Bahadur's connection to the word goes back to their great-grandmother. They were a so-called “coolie woman,” who left India for Guyana in 1903.
But Bahadur didn't know any of this growing up in New Jersey. They were six when their family left Guyana for the United States.
“Amazingly, I didn't hear about their story until I was in my early 20s," they say. "I was on a trip back to Guyana with my father. I remember their words exactly: ‘She was a pregnant woman traveling alone.'”
So, Bahadur, a journalist, went to London (among other places) and scoured the archives of voyages from India to the Caribbean for their great-grandmother's records.
Bahadur found Sujaria's emigrant pass — their name was Sujaria, they didn't have a last name — from 1903. It was yellowed and delicate, and noted that Sujaria was 27, petite, with a burn mark on their left foot. They were also pregnant, but no husband was listed.
“I pictured them at the docks, about to get on this ship,” Bahadur says. “And I know she's pregnant, but aside from that I don't know anything about them I don't know what they look like. But I thought if I could work around her, then I could tell this story, you know, with them sort of as a ghost at the center.”
Bahadur recreates their great-grandmother's world: a rough sea voyage from Calcutta to Guyana.
“There were high suicide rates on the ships,” Bahadur says. “If there were people on the ships who didn't want to be there, or if they'd been tricked into it, how do you resist being taken? You end your life.”
What Bahadur can't tell from the records was why their great-grandmother made this journey, which included them giving birth to their son at sea. But Bahadur has a possible clue from a relative.
“One of them remembers my great-grandmother was smoking a clay pipe at home and told a story about being on a pilgrimage, going from one holy city to another,” Bahadur says. Sujaria, according to the story, talked about “white men in boats” offering to take them to the next stop on their holy tour.
“And then suddenly,” Bahadur says, “she found themselves in the depot in Calcutta and on their way to sugar plantations in British Guiana. So that story, if it's true, suggests that they didn't want to go, that they might have been kidnapped even.”
However the story went, Sujaria left for Guyana — and so did Bahadur. Them research took them to the fields of Guyana, places that their great-grandmother likely knew well. They say they wanted to “feel what, literally, what is a cane leaf, how does that feel — it's sharp as hell! You know, what does a burning cane field smell like?”
Bahadur also researched how indentured workers lived. They “lived in part of a plantation that was called the n-word yard. So, there were sorts of military-style barracks, no privacy. They worked very long hours for little pay,” they add.
And like slaves, indentured workers sang to help the days go by. Recently, Bahadur discovered that one of their friends, the Guyanese-American poet Rajiv Mohabir, had recorded their grandmother, the daughter of indentured immigrants, singing a song in Hindi kept alive by indentured women.
The recording is scratchy, but the woman's soft voice is heard singing a song about a new bride leaving their family.
“This was a song that made the journey from India to the West Indies and was kept alive primarily by women,” Bahadur says.
Eventually, indentured immigration to Guyana stopped in the early 1900s.
So what became of Bahadur's great-grandmother? They worked off their contract and was freed in 1908, five years after arriving to Guyana.
“She recreated family in Guyana,” Bahadur says. “Whatever they had lost in India, they managed to rebuild and they never returned.”
But Bahadur's return to their Guyanese roots helped them tell a chapter of their own family's story that might have easily disappeared.

Hey Guys, if you have been lingering around with Windows Phone site wpcentral, you might just have found something quite interesting:
Co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak chooses the Lumia 900 over Android, calls the Windows Phone "intuitive and beautiful"
"Just for looks and beauty I definitely favor the Windows Phone over Android" "....I'm just shocked, I haven't seen anything yet that isn't more beautiful than the other platforms" "Intuitive and beautiful" "it's making me feel 'Oh my gosh, I'm with a friend not a tool'" (In regards to the animations and graphics) "I just really like the experience and will be carrying the Windows Phone everywhere"
Read original article here at aNewDomain
Here's their comment on the article:
I did give my opinion that the Windows 7P phone had superior visual appearance and operation cues that were also more attractive. In my opinion, it sets the mark for user interface. I would recommend it over my Android phones given that it doesn't yet have the breadth of apps. I surmise that Microsoft hired someone from Apple and put money into having a role in the UI and appearance of some key apps. I also surmised that Steve Jobs might have been reincarnated at MS due to a lot of what I see and feel with this phone making me think of a lot of great Apple things.
Read, Mr.Topolsky, " would recommend it over my Android phones given that it doesn't yet have the breadth of apps."
Anyway, thoughts, guys?
And, Mr.Warren, fire this article up first thing in the morning!
LAKEWOOD, Ohio – Mayor Michael Summers is warning motorists traveling through Lakewood to drive carefully because roads are slippery as the city is running precariously low on salt.
The city's road salt supplier, Morton Salt Inc., has failed to deliver 1,000 tons back-ordered by the city, according to the mayor's office.
A Morton spokesperson said a higher demand for salt this year because of heavy snow and colder than normal temperatures has delayed shipments.
"The surge in demand for salt can delay deliveries as we try to balance the needs of all our customers," said company spokesperson Denise Lauer. "We are working closely with the city and taking a number of steps to deliver on their salt orders as quickly as possible."
Lakewood has placed orders with other vendors. City officials said those deliveries could take some time since the other vendors will give priority to their regular customers already under contract.
Lakewood also is contacting other local governments to see if it can purchase salt from them. However, Lakewood is not alone in running low on salt supplies. Canton also is running low salt, Summers said.
"They are parceling it out a little bit here and there," Summers said of Morton. "My sense is there are a lot of communities that face this situation."
Pepper Pike reported a shortage earlier this month. A Pepper Pike Service Department employee said Monday that the city is down to about 350 tons of salt and has 1,700 more tons on order from Morton that has not been delivered. Some of those orders date back to Dec. 16. In the meantime, Pepper Pike is ordering salt from competitor Cargill Inc. to fill the void. Cargill delivered 50 tons to Pepper Pike Monday, the employee said.
Pepper Pike received a request from Lakewood to sell or loan them road salt, but the Pepper Pike employee said the city had none to spare.
Meanwhile, Lakewood is looking at all options, according to the mayor's office.
"We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of our residents, and getting salt to clear our streets is a big part of that," Summers said. "Unfortunately, we have had promises repeatedly broken by Morton."
While the city waits for delivery, plow trucks have been clearing the streets of snow. But the removal of the final slick layer of ice requires the use of salt. The heavy and frequent snowfalls this season, coupled with extreme cold temperatures that make salt less effective, have compounded the salt shortage.
Lakewood's typical salt storage is 1,500 tons, but the supply has dwindled to about 250 tons. During the shortage, the city is concentrating its remaining salt on hills and intersections. Lakewood has 2,200 tons on order, but Morton has only delivered 900 tons so far this season, Summers said.
Morton officials have promised the city additional salt should arrive this week.
Meanwhile, the city is looking into contractual remedies against Morton, Summers said.
Unusually cold temperatures later this week could compound problems with road conditions. Traditional salt loses much of its effectiveness when temperatures drop below 15 degrees Fahrenheit. However, some salts sprayed with liquid chemicals are effective at subzero temperatures.
The first thing that stuck me as odd about Reddit's r/ferguson community was how empty it is.
Every social media platform, from Facebook to Twitter, has percolated with information about the endless waves of protest and violent police crackdowns that have battered the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., for over a week. Reddit was no exception. It seemed like every third link on the site's front page was about racism, police brutality, or the struggle on the part of millions of Americans to make sense of events that left an unarmed African-American teenager lying in a pool of their own blood in the middle of the street.
On the subreddit supposedly dedicated to the events unfolding in Ferguson, however, there was barely a trickle of new posts. A handful of stories popped up each day, mostly with a pro-police, anti-protester bent—nothing even remotely resembling the torrent that a regular user of the site might expect. As of Wednesday morning, the subreddit has just under 170 subscribers.
The reason for the surprisingly small amount of traffic going to r/ferguson is relatively simple: The subreddit is operated by racists.
Like r/TrayvonMartin before it, r/ferguson is part of a white supremacist network of 42 subreddits wholly dedicated to bashing African-Americans, who have been labeled by the moderators as the “Chimpire.”
While Reddit collectively prides itself on its tolerance—at least when it comes to things that aren't Comcast customer service—the existence of r/ferguson, and the flourishing of the entire ?Chimpire” network as a whole, is evidence that the site that bills itself as the ?front page of the Internet” has extremely vocal apostates to its progressive hive mind, viewpoints the site's administrators have allowed to flourish.
One of the aspects of Reddit that has led the site becoming such a massive traffic-driver across the Internet is its flexibility. Anyone can create their own little community, known as a subreddit, without the pre-approval of Reddit administrators. The r/ferguson subreddit was created by a user who goes by the handle u/Jewish_NeoCon2 on Aug. 11, two days after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown touched off protests in Ferguson.
Jewish_NeoCon2 told the Daily Dot that they jumped on the virtual estate quickly, essentially to ?squat” it, before it could be created by people with more tolerant views toward African Americans.
Jewish_NeoCon2 is the moderator of 91 other subreddits. While some of those subreddit are fairly mainstream, like r/media, most of them are inside ?The Chimpire.” Jewish_NeoCon2 announced the creation of the network in a post last month, saying it came out of rapid growth of the anti-black, white supremacist subreddit r/GreatApes:
This [r/GreatApes] subreddit has been experiencing exponential growth lately. We feel it's time to expand our sphere of influence and lebensraum on reddit. Thus we have decided to create The Chimpire, a network of n****r related subreddits. In addition to just r/GreatApes, this mean we now have a large plethora of subreddits to link and discuss n****r content targeted aimed more specific topics. r/GreatApes will function like it always has while we're now expanding for more activity, content and quality. Want to read people's experiences with n****rs? There now is an affiliated subreddit for it. Want to watch chimp nature documentaries? We got it. N****r hate facts? IT'S THERE. World Star Hip Hop? Oh yes you bet we got videos of ghetto n****r fighting each other. N****r drama on Reddit? There's a sub. Sheboons? Gibsmedat.
The subreddits within the network are a hive of racism. There are communities dedicated to mocking black music, promoting racist cartoons, and one called r/WatchN****rsDie, where users revel in video footage of black people being gruesomely killed.
A link appearing near the top of Jewish_NeoCon2's post announcing the creation of the network directed users to a page asking them to recount the incident that was the ?last straw” before they admitted to themselves that they truly hated black people.
This is the top comment in that thread:
?As to why people are interested in /r/GreatApes, Westerners (and Americans especially) are given an unrealistic view of blacks where they are presented as a race who are just like Europeans but stricken by poverty and racism with the result their gigantic crime problem, single black welfare mom, the missing black father syndrome, school dropout rate and poor academic performance and their violence,” Jewish_NeoCon2 told the Daily Dot, adding that the network has somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 subscribers.
While most posts on r/ferguson don't generate very many comments, the ones that are left there do tend to adhere to the overall anti-black sentiment of the entire racist network. This screenshot shows some of the top comments on a video showing a group of activists in Chicago protesting the police's use of force in Ferguson.
Reddit's administrators have long and conflicted history with unsavory content on the site.
Last year, Reddit staffers shuttered the popular r/n****rs subreddit; however, they insisted the closure was because the subreddit's moderators broke too many of the site's main rules— spam, child pornography, vote manipulation, and sharing other users' personal information—rather than anything having to do with the promulgation of hate speech.
“This particular subreddit and its moderators repeatedly broke key site rules, and as a result were banned from the site,” Reddit Community Manager Alex Angel told the Daily Dot at the time. ?We would do this for any subreddit found to be breaking our site rules; the banning of r/n****rs was not a special case.”
Reddit views itself as a bastion of free speech and, as a result, has been loath to censor anything that neither violates its central tenets nor runs afoul of the law. Staying true Reddit's ideals of not favoring one type of content over the other, Jewish_NeoCon2 insists they have never been contacted by a site administrator about anything he's ever posted to the site.
This stance of radical openness has drawn criticism not just from many of the site's average users, but from celebrities like William Shatner. In a private thread with the site's admins last year, the Star Trek actor slammed Reddit for providing fertile grounds for hate speech to flourish:
Reddit has been the first ‘mainstream' site that I have been to that actually appears to allow racists and other hate mongers to group, congregate, incite and spread their hatred. There's entire subreddits that allow it. What mainstream sites do you think are more racist? … I don't pretend to know where the managers of Reddit wish to go with this site, but embracing that kind of culture I feel is counterproductive to where this world is heading and I think that is probably hurting this site.
Representatives from Reddit did not respond to requests for comment about r/ferguson and other openly racist subreddits.
In the early 1990s, digital activist John Gilmore told Time that “the Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”
A similar argument can be made about how Reddit handles this type of blatant, unabashed racism. The site automatically steers most users away from it, because it lacks the popularity of more mainstream subreddits, and the vast majority of users who do somehow stumble across it quickly back away, confused and disgusted. Nevertheless, it's there, bubbling just below the surface, waiting for someone curious about the news coming out of Ferguson to suddenly tumble down Reddit's rabbit hole of hate.

Perhaps a session of waterboarding is the correct sentence for a California man convicted of selling more than $1 million worth of counterfeited "access cards" that allowed customers unlawful access to DirectTV's digital satellite feed.
Jay Bybee, a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who as an assistant U.S. attorney general signed the infamous "torture memo," (.pdf) isn't saying what would be an appropriate sentence. But on Monday, they blasted two of their colleagues who sat with them on the DirectTV case: They signed off on a lower court judge's rendering of five-years' probation, a $50,000 fine and community service.
"This sentence is substantively unreasonable for someone who was convicted of stealing over $1 million in profits from DirectTV and who bragged to have personally made over $400,000 from the theft," Bybee wrote (.pdf) Monday.
Bybee, in 2002, signed off on the torture memo after the CIA requested legal advice on how aggressively it could interrogate suspected terrorists detained outside the United States while comporting with the Convention Against Torture.
Among other things, the memo said, "physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death." (Translation: As long as the detainee isn't killed while being interrogated, there's no torture.)
For mental anguish to equal torture, the memo said, it "must result in significant psychological harm of significant duration."
That said, Bybee was concerned Monday that the majority decision was undermining the power of the appellate courts in the wake of a string of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions giving sentencing judges the right to set aside sentencing guidelines.
The two other circuit judges on the DirectTV case wrote defendant Thomas Whitehead's sentence was appropriate. The lower court judge deemed it as such when it was issued in 2005, the majority wrote.
The defendant faced up to 51 months behind bars. The government appealed.
Whitehead was convicted of breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which forbids the sale of devices that are designed to circumvent a "technological measure" designed to protect copyrighted works.
Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, and Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, wrote there was no "abuse of discretion in the district court's conclusion." The majority pointed out that it was a white-collar crime; the defendant has repented, is devoting themselves to their house-painting business and to their young daughter, and is "building an honorable life."
Bybee wrote that the non-prison sentence "was not an exercise of discretion as much as an abdication of responsibility."
But the majority concluded that the sentencing judge was "intimately familiar with the nature of the crime and defendant's role in it, as we are not."
Bybee countered. Deferring to a sentencing judge's discretion, they wrote, "does not mean rubber-stamping the court's actions."
The "challenge," Bybee wrote, "is to determine the boundaries of a reasonable sentence for a given conviction and set of individualized circumstances and then decide whether the sentence imposed by the district court sits within these boundaries."
At least we know what torture is.

Climate change is the greatest threat to public health worldwide and doctors must step up to help mitigate it, according to a leading advocate speaking at the annual Canadian Medical Association (CMA) meeting in Vancouver on Monday.
Dr. James Orbinski, a former top official with the medical charity Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), who is now an an associate professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto, urged physicians to "step up and step out" in the fight against climate change as part of their duties to create "health-in-all" policies.
"We're not separate from our biosphere, or our planet," Orbinski told the audience of 600. "We can't possibly live, survive, and thrive without our biosphere. It affects us and we affect it."
"Climate change is very much of our own making...but as doctors, we have a vital responsibility to urge the development of a health-in-all-policies approach," they said.

The summit is taking place following extreme weather events and other environmental catastrophes throughout Canada, from wildfires in Fort McMurray to a massive oil spill in Saskatchewan.
The Vancouver Sun reports on Orbinski's comments:
Droughts, fires like the one in Fort McMurray in May, floods, food security and infectious diseases are all linked to climate change. Mental health problems and respiratory ailments from air pollution as well as rising rates of infectious diseases like West Nile virus and Lyme disease are also some of the consequences of climate change.
They also noted that Canada's yearly rate of warming is twice the global pace, which means the effects of climate change will increase as time goes on, absent a concerted effort to reduce greenhouse gases.
"The implications are utterly profound," Orbinski said.
"People go to war over water, food and territory, and when you cannot feed your children, you will do anything, even if it means going to war. This is the reality of climate change."
CMA president Dr. Cindy Forbes said the organization would attempt to create an action plan. "I appreciated greatly Dr. Orbinski's call to action, and I agree as a nation and as a planet we cannot ignore climate change," they said.
Chicago police are questioning persons of interest after a Facebook Live video surfaced showing a group of people beating and cutting a teen who appeared bound and gagged as they shouted “F--- Donald Trump.” NBC5's Trina Orlando reports. (Published Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017)
Chicago police said Wednesday night that four teens are being held and questioned in connection with a Facebook Live video showing a group of people beating and cutting a teen who appeared bound and gagged as they shouted “F--- Donald Trump.”
Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson called the video a "brutal act" that was "broadcast for the entire world to see." They said the victim has "mental health challenges."
NBC News reported that officials said they expect to file charges against the four 18-year-olds, two men and two women, within the next 24 hours.
Police said officers on patrol found a disoriented man walking Tuesday afternoon in the 3400 block of West Lexington in the city's Homan Square neighborhood. The man was transported to an area hospital for treatment.
Then, just before 5:30 p.m., officers responded to a battery at a residence in the 3300 block of West Lexington, where they discovered signs of a struggle and damage to the property -- a scene they linked to the disoriented man.
Officers later became aware of social media video depicting “a battery of an adult male which is believed to be the same individual,” police said in a statement Wednesday.
Authorities said the video, which shows a group of black men and women kicking, cutting and slapping a white man, who at one point appears to be bound and gagged, is credible. The video was posted around 2 p.m. Tuesday and had been seen more than 62,000 times before it was removed from Facebook.
In the footage, some in the group can be heard saying "F--- Donald Trump" and "F--- white people."
The victim is an 18-year-old man from northwest suburban Crystal Lake who had been reported missing and "has mental health challenges," police said. Their parents reported them missing late Monday, telling police they had not heard from them since Dec. 31, when they dropped them off at a McDonald's at Schaumburg and Barrington Roads, according to a release from Streamwood police.
Their parents began receiving text messages from persons claiming to be holding them captive, authorities said, and officials discovered the Facebook video while investigating the source of the messages.
Police said the teen was "extremely traumatized" but has been released from the hospital.
Authorities believe they knew one of the suspects and had gone with that person willingly before they were eventually brought to the city in a stolen van and held against theirs will.
They had been with the suspects for at least 24 hours, authorities said.
"It's sickening," Johnson said. "It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat someone like that."
Police are investigating whether the attack was a hate crime, though they have not yet said that it is one. Commander Kevin Duffin told reporters that it may have been people "ranting about something they think might make a headline."
When asked if the attack was politically motivated, Johnson said "at this point we don't have anything concrete to point in that direction."
In their Monday “Hey Small Spender” column, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman bizarrely denied that federal spending has significantly expanded over the past two years. They asserted that “[t]here never was a big expansion of government spending” and “the big government expansion everyone talks about never happened.”
Yet for their talk about a “fact-free” disinformation campaign, Krugman curiously provides no data on total federal spending. This may be because all official budget data reveals a different story. According to President Obama's own Office of Management and Budget—the keepers of the official data on government spending—federal spending has just finished its largest two-year surge in nearly 60 years, leaping from 20.7 percent of the economy to 25.4 percent (see Table 1.2 here), the highest spending level in American history outside of World War II.
Overall, Washington is spending 23 percent more today than it did two years ago. Quite a stunning increase given the concern about deficits and fiscal austerity other nations are embarking on. The Congressional Budget Office and Treasury Department show similar figures. So where are the facts, one wonders, to support Krugman's claim that the federal government has not significantly expanded?
Krugman's argument starts by stating that most spending increases have been concentrated in social spending and financial bailouts, rather than government employment, direct government purchases, or the creation of many new government programs. This is a non-sequitur. The composition of a federal spending increase—whether it goes towards Medicaid, direct purchases of fighter jets, state bailouts, new federal employees, or new government programs—isn't the same as how much federal spending has increased.
The broader purpose of Krugman's column is to rehabilitate the outdated myth that government can spend its way to job growth and prosperity. Washington's massive spending spree has, by any objective standard, failed to create jobs. So Krugman simply denies that this spending ever happened, despite reams of official evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, the type of spending that Krugman concedes jumped—unemployment and social spending—is among the most stimulative according to their Keynesian economic theories, yet the unemployment has not even responded minimally. This spending's complete failure to create jobs should provide one more nail in the Keynesian coffin.
Krugman can argue that the historic surge of spending and deficits since 2008 is too small for their taste. But their claim that “[t]here never was a big expansion of government spending” just doesn't add up.
UPDATE: Here are a few points to address some of the more prevalent responses we've seen in the comments section:
1) Some have stated declining GDP explains the entire rise in federal spending as a percent of GDP. Table 1.1 of the OMB Historical Tables says otherwise:
2008 spending – $2,983 billion
2010 spending – $3,720 billion.
2) Others assert that federal spending hikes merely offset state & local spending cuts. However, *total* spending has leaped. OMB is the official scorekeeper, and Table 15.2 of the Historical Tables shows a 10% increase in 2009 alone. And indications are that it increased again in 2010. Perhaps a 10% increase isn't enough for Paul Krugman, but its a healthy increase to most people.
3) Some of Krugman's defenders are using a bait and switch. They wrote “[there never was a big expansion of government spending” and “the big government expansion everyone talks about never happened.”
Now their defenders say that Krugman merely said *stimulus* spending didn't increase enough. While the body of their op-ed made some of those distinctions, their summary argument — again, quoted above — asserted that *total* government spending didn't grow significantly. That is demonstrably false.
A new startup, SeatID, wants to change the way you fly. Their service lets you use your social network to help pick your next flight and seat assignment. SeatID is available starting today on the Ukrainian airline AeroSvit and the company plans to sign up major international airlines and online travel services soon.
Whether passengers will want to share their flight and seat info is a big and controversial question. Eran Savir, CEO and co-founder of Israeli-based SeatID, says everyone has a bad flying story thanks to an awful seatmate. That experience is what inspired the founders to start the company.
When you are deciding what flight to take and where to sit, SeatID shows your Facebook friends or LinkedIn contacts on each flight, if they have opted in to the service.
Savir argues it's better to sit next to a friend, a friend of a friend, or someone with common interests or business connections, rather than a total stranger, which is the case now. Savir says while the service could be used for social and dating purposes, the more popular scenario is the business use case.
I asked a few folks around the TechCrunch office if anyone wanted so share their seat and flight info. None did. One said ‘flying is not a social thing' and someone called it ‘creepy'.
The SeatID team knows not everyone will opt in. They have built in strict privacy controls that allows users to decide who they share their information with. SeatID's privacy rules inherit your existing Facebook or LinkedIn privacy setting and then add additional limits.
SeatID says they don't need many passengers to get started. Their initial target is a 5 to 10% conversion rate, or 10 to 20 people on every flight. Given the nearly 3 billion passengers each year, that would be a huge number of users.
There are two parts needed to make SeatID work. The first is people who agree to share information that they will be on a specific flight. Without some passengers who are willing to share this info, the second group won't know who is available for them to sit next to. If someone decides to sit next to you, you don't have the ability to reject them. But, you don't have that ability without SeatID either. Of course, you could try to move your seat.
SeatID also knows they need enough users in the beginning to have a network effect and make the service useful. Savir claims once their customers use the service, they won't want to fly the old-fashioned way, without this social knowledge the next time.
I wrote about other companies that have tried to do this nearly a year ago, when KLM announced a “meet & seat” program. But SeatID's concept is different. They want to work with every airline, something that KLM can't offer. SeatID says while the airlines are looking to increase their uses of social media, building the technology to do social seating is not their core business.
In addition to KLM, I also reported Malaysia Airlines has been experimenting with social seating. But, the airline requires you to book your flight on the airline's Facebook page, which is not the typical place people book flights. That's not at all how SeatID works.
SeatID wants you to book your flight on the same site that you currently book it on, whether that's an airline website or a travel ticketing site. But all the passengers who opt in to SeatID when purchasing their ticket on partner sites will see other passengers no matter which ticketing system they used, as long as their privacy settings allow.
With their first partnership, travelers can go to AeroSvit's site and decide if they want to login with their Facebook or LinkedIn accounts.
SeatID doesn't integrate with the backend ticketing or reservations systems of each airline. It only integrates on the frontend so a widget can display who is on each flight. David Rachamim, co-founder and CTO of SeatID says “we've built it as a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution, which makes the implementation onto the customer's website very simple.” SeatID says they can integrate with a new partner in a few days or less.
At launch, AeroSvit is only showing ticket buyers in your social networks who are on each flight. The seatmap feature, which shows their seat assignment, has not been implemented yet, but will be soon.
When I questioned how valuable this service would be without the seatmap feature, Savir notes that some airlines don't have assigned seating. So friends could, would be able to grab seats together after they board. Savir says SeatID has gotten interest from some of these “no seat assignment” carriers, but wouldn't name them until a deal is reached.
SeatID has raised seed funding, but they won't disclose the amount. For the first customers, the service is free and SeatID would like it to stay that way. They hope to make money by licensing the software to the airlines. If airlines discover this creates great value for users, airlines might charge passengers to use it.
For now, SeatID is only available on AeroSvit, based-in Ukraine, with its 80 international routes to 34 countries.
At best, SeatID could make your flight much more enjoyable. SeatID might also help you avoid sitting next to a screaming baby. However, if you pick a flying companion that turns into a nightmare, you can't just leave. Of course, you can always put on your headset or go to sleep.

Technology has brought unprecedented precision to our daily lives. I can draw a perfect circle with my eyes closed, calculate Pi to the nth degree, split a 15 percent tip seven ways, and accurately measure how many calories are going in and out of my body. Or can I?
A frenzy for quantifying everything about the human body is sweeping the electronics industry — with Apple's HealthKit and Samsung's SAMI being the latest and most prominent efforts — and catalyzing an explosion of sensor-laden wearable devices. But in its hurry toward a more self-aware future, this wave of innovation is also perpetuating one of the big mistakes of the past: counting calories.
As food historian Martin Bruegel explains, the obsession with calories got its start at the turn of the 20th century as part of a broad "scientific eating" movement focused on figuring out ways to help the poor eat well. Over time, that concern moved from the political to the personal, culminating in the 1997 introduction of the Weight Watchers Points program. That globally popular dieting regimen elevated the calculation and tracking of calories into a weird blend of pseudoscience and ersatz religion, asking adherents to follow the numbers with unquestioning faith.
Even Weight Watchers now accepts that calorie counting's a bad idea
That's where the pre-digital world went wrong. "As the co-author of a book called Why Calories Count, I might be expected to favor calorie counting but I most definitely do not. It cannot be done accurately or even close to accurately," noted NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle tells The Verge. In November 2010, then-president and CEO of Weight Watchers David Kirchhoff conceded that point and admitted that "calorie-counting has become unhelpful" for people trying to lose weight. Citing the myriad variables that go into working out how much energy is in your food and how much of it you can actually digest, their company completely reworked its program.
In spite of a widespread professional unease about getting too specific with calories, that's exactly what new technology is doing. The problem is that standards for accuracy and reliability of consumer health gadgets are not as strict as those for professional use because, well, they don't exist. The US Federal Trade Commission investigates and takes action against allegations of false advertising or misleading claims, but that's about as far as it goes. Pretty much anyone can introduce "the next great health invention," and with the help of crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo, many are trying.
Opportunity meets opportunism
A million dollars. That's how much faith the internet has put in the promise of Healbe GoBe, an Indiegogo project that has raised as many red flags as funding pledges. This wrist-worn device claims to combine pressure and hydration sensors with an accelerometer to accurately quantify both the calories you've taken in and the calories you've burned. The key metric being measured by the GoBe wearable is said to be glucose concentration in the blood, though Healbe's own literature on the subject admits it "doesn't meet medical accuracy requirements." If it did, it'd be a revolution for diabetics, but the fact it doesn't stopping the company from promoting it to people desperate for a new method to lose weight. Beyond calories, Healbe's claims grow increasingly outlandish: it'll also tell you the macronutrient (fats, carbohydrates, and protein) composition of the last meal you ate and monitor your stress levels.
You can train for years to become a nutritionist or pay $2.99 for an app that will guess the calories for you
The $2.99 Meal Snap app follows a similar path by offering to calculate the caloric content of your food through "pure magic." You take a photo of your plate, upload it, and the app returns an estimate of how many calories sit in front of you. The entire mysterious process appears to actually be a case of manual photo analysis that matches the results to the food database of Daily Burn, the app's maker. Meal Snap is not without merit, as it helps users keep a visual food diary over time, but its results have been shown to fluctuate wildly.
The calorie content of anything you eat will vary, sometimes dramatically, according to how it's cooked, plus a proportion of a meal's energy is always lost to bacteria inside the gut and the digestive process itself. All this complexity is lost when you have a person being paid a few cents per photo identifying it as "chicken with small bits."
This creates a dissonance between perceived and real accuracy. When you're told that "that piece of bread has 113.95 calories," as in the demo video for The Situ Smart Food Nutrition Scale, the extra decimal places suggest precision. But all you're doing is weighing each ingredient in your meal and then assigning it a generic caloric value for that typical food. You think you're adding 100 calories of ham and 32 — no, let's do two slices — 69 calories in the form of cheese, but those are estimates, a guide rather than a hard rule. Like the GoBe, the Situ has met with crowdfunding success, this time through Kickstarter, but like Meal Snap, it seems to be focusing on the wrong thing.
The lack of precision in self-reported food consumption is "legendary"
The common thread that runs through calorie-counting apps and gadgets is that we, as humans, are not very good at it. Professor Nestle describes the lack of precision in self-reported food consumption as "legendary," citing an average underestimation of 30 percent. But the same pitfalls that sabotage pen-and-paper calorie tracking also affect the digital kind: you're still just as likely to neglect documenting late-night snacks as you ever were. In the absence of an automated solution like the GoBe that actually works, technology's just fancying up an inherently faulty process of self-quantification.
Hard numbers don't matter as much as comparable ones
Measuring the expenditure of energy — the other side of the caloric equation — has produced a wider range of automatic devices, but not much more accuracy. Most pedometers struggle to keep an accurate step count, never mind calculating the exact energy consumption of a given day's exertions. Dr. Alice Ammerman from the University of North Carolina's nutrition department says that "probably the most useful health-promoting information from these devices is to show that it takes a lot of physical activity to ‘burn off' a candy bar or soda, or other high-calorie food."
It'd be okay for every device to be wrong if they were all wrong by the same amount
Another significant advantage of fitness trackers like the Nike FuelBand is that they allow for comparison: you can track your personal development over time, compare times with others online, or just measure yourself against a general standard. That doesn't strictly need to be accurate, it just has to be consistent. And it is, provided you only ever use Nike products, but the legion of other fitness monitors on the market don't count Fuel points and don't adhere to any other universal standard for measurement. Apple's newly introduced HealthKit proposes to rectify one of these issues by centralizing data from all wearable devices into one hub, but it doesn't yet offer a solution for the problem of inconsistency. A recent test by Quartz found an average disparity of over 500 calories per day between some activity trackers.
In the absence of standards, people resort to calories as the common denominator for cross-comparisons, using that seemingly scientific measurement in a way that's far from scientifically rigorous. You can't balance your diet properly with a Situ scale and a Samsung Gear Fit — even though both purport to track calories — because they use different methods and produce different errors in their final numbers.
Dr. Barry Popkin, a colleague of Professor Ammerman's at UNC and the author of The World is Fat, agrees with them and Marion Nestle in warning against the dangers of even small errors of estimation when relying on calories to guide lifestyle choices. "The issue is in how do people use them," they say, "and do the Fitbits, etc., overestimate movement." A system that consistently miscalculates energy use risks being falsely reassuring or forcing the user into an unnecessarily restrictive diet. You're better off, argues Nestle, buying a scale to weigh yourself and judging whether to eat more or less by looking at whether you're gaining or losing weight. It's a breathtakingly basic approach, but until the technology to achieve true "scientific eating" matures, it's the best option on the table.
Samsung and Apple could bring order to the data chaos
Aside from issues of accuracy and consistency, the crucial missing element from wearable health gadgets today is user education. Knowing the limitations of biotelemetry and how to interpret it properly is fundamental to making good use of that information. Samsung's new Simband prototype is essentially a portable clinic, tracking every imaginable health parameter, but its most useful promise is the ability to share its findings with your doctor. Apple's HealthKit similarly aims to act as a digital library of self-quantification data that's accessible to health care providers. Dr. John Noseworthy, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, says it "will revolutionize how the health industry interacts with people."
Both Samsung and Apple's efforts have the potential to be transformative. Being the two biggest companies in personal electronics, they can set real standards for accuracy and reporting that others would be willing to follow. Instead of do-it-yourself calorie comparisons, people would have access to professional clinical assessments. But the road to making that vision a reality is long and we're only just getting started. Along the way, we'll do well to avoid junk science as well as junk food.

Carlo Allegri / Reuters A flag that bears the names of the dead flies over a makeshift memorial in Sandy Hook, after the Dec. 14 shooting tragedy when a gunman shot dead 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary, in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 28, 2012.
Chris Kelsey has become an expert at organizing confusion. In a warehouse on the outskirts of Newtown, Conn., the town tax assessor walks past dozens of rows of cardboard boxes, stacked four-feet-tall, wrapped in plastic, and sitting on plywood frames. They're ready to go, but no one yet knows where. Two weeks ago, the warehouse was filled with the voices of volunteers and the beeping of delivery trucks backing up to unload the latest drop-off of contributions—all from the heart, all for the families who had lost their children, all for the children who had survived the horrors of Dec. 14, 2012. The unsorted offerings ranged from toys to cleaning supplies and were piled high. Like so many reactions to the events at Sandy Hook Elementary, the gifts were overwhelming and well-meaning—but now they were superfluous and, at this point, no one knows what to do with most of them.
On Sunday afternoon, Kelsey walked alone through the warehouse with their two dogs — Twinkie and Licorice. They haven't seen much of them over the past month. Following the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School one month ago, Kelsey began to spearhead the organization of donations being shipped from as far away as China. They have only had three days off since Dec. 14, regularly working 12-hour days. They rarely take lunch – typically eating cold pizza, donated baked goods or whatever they could rummage in a hurry. He's not the only one. “Whenever anybody saw a ball on the ground, they just picked it up and ran with it and it just kind of happened,” they say. “It's working to a degree. Not everything we've done is perfect, but you know, we didn't really have a playbook for it either.”

Monday morning marks the one-month anniversary of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 students, six faculty members, and himself. They had killed their mother before they headed for the school. And, one month later, even as the country debates the greater issues of gun control and America's culture of violence, Newtown residents are still trying to pull together a playbook to figure out the way forward. The issues have gone macro in the national debate but, in Newtown, they are micro, lodging in every heart.
More than the goods in the warehouse, one physical reminder of Dec. 14 is a priority for Newtown locals. Newtown first selectman Pat Llodra says the town's “next big step” is deciding what to do with the building where the massacre occurred. On Sunday night, hundreds of residents gathered in an auditorium at Newtown High School to weigh in on the future of the crime scene. Recommendations ranged from turning Sandy Hook Elementary into a planetarium to using the site for a peace education center. Several attendees said out of respect for survivors, teachers and siblings of the dead that the school be torn down. However, a clear division emerged even among parents of the children enrolled in the school. Noting the loss of life and security, some asserted that Adam Lanza had already taken too much from the community. Speakers did not utter Lanza's name – instead, they referred to them as the “psychopath” or the “perpetrator.” To them, abandoning the building would allow Lanza to steal their memories and their children's dreams of the future. They do not want to give them another victory.

Aimee Tabor, whose son Kyle was in a classroom directly across from those targeted, said it is unlikely that the community will reach a perfect consensus. “[Kyle] saw more and heard more than any child ever should, let alone any person ever should,” Tabor says. They say their son had recently started to experience nightmares. “I understand from all of the sentiments that there's not going to be a solution for all people.” Still, they said later in the proceedings, “I would never want to make someone go back that doesn't want to.”
Although the speakers differed in their opinion about the building's future, nearly all of them rejected the idea of redistricting, which would scatter the children now in the school. They want the Sandy Hook students to remain together as a unit, regardless of the building where they will ultimately receive their education. Several Sandy Hook parents also said the decision should be made mostly by those directly affected by shooting – including the parents, staff and victims' families. Llodra said they have received a commitment of financial support from government officials regardless of the conclusion the town reaches. “I think everyone in this room agrees that we need to bring the Sandy Hook students home,” they said, as nearly everyone in the room applauded.
Like many in the town, Llodra encourages more conversations about federal gun control issues – but they also recognize their own limitations in furthering national issues. “I'm saying to our state delegation, to our federal delegation, and to the president – you all said the right thing when you were here, now do it,” they told TIME. “I can't do it from here. All I can do is help guide our community. I can't guide the state or the country. You can. It's your job. You do it.”

Newtown residents expect there will be issues and needs that remain hidden and that will eventually emerge. Many in the town have said they are taking things “one step at a time.” But a few things have become clearly evident. At a Board of Education meeting and a gathering of the board of police commissioners, resident and mother Amy Roman told officials that increased and long-term security presence at the schools has “gone from a want to a need.” Last week, police officers requested an adjustment to workers compensation laws to include aid for those suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Local businesses in Newtown also took a hit, as the shooting resulted in blocked roads and decreased patronage. According to Llodra, the town has received $500,000 in aid from the state of Connecticut that will be distributed to those businesses. Eventually the town will begin to discuss plans for the official Sandy Hook School memorial. For now, the remains of the makeshift street memorials are sitting in a warehouse waiting to be sorted.
In the donations warehouse, 27 boxes line the right wall of the main room. Kelsey and their team have sorted more than 50,000 stuffed animals, 600 boxes of other toys, 1,600 boxes of school supplies, 51 bicycles and much more. About 3% of the packages received at the warehouse were addressed to specific victims and their families. Some were even directed at the Lanzas. Volunteers have cataloged those personal offerings – CDs, prayers, artwork, letters.Throughout the past three weeks, Kelsey has arranged for the families to visit the warehouse and collect what they wanted of the gifts. Only three families, including the Lanzas, have not come to the warehouse. They will not identify them, just saying that they are not ready and may never be. As for the rest of the gifts, Kelsey says they will be redistributed and donated to organizations or communities specified by the victims' families.  They are organizing a committee to handle the redistribution of the donations.
On Sunday afternoon, Kelsey was meeting with family friends of one of the victims who came to collect the personal gifts. They stood off to the side while they sorted; Twinkie tried to engage their owner in a round of fetch by dropping a ball at their feet. Kelsey plans to return to their regular job on Monday, but will continue their work at the warehouse on an as-needed basis over the coming months. “We got hit so hard so fast, there was really not time for processing,” they say. “It's just — do it.”

Hayden Christensen (born April 19, 1981)[1] is a Canadian actor and producer. They began their career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s. They were praised for their acting as Sam in Life as a House (2001), earning Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. Christensen gained international fame for their portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). Their honors for these films include a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Cannes Film Festival Revelation Award.
Early life
Christensen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Alie, an American speechwriter, and David Christensen, a Canadian computer programmer and communications executive.[1][2] Their father is of Danish descent, and their mother has Swedish and Italian ancestry.[2] Christensen is one of four children, with three actor siblings: older brother Tove, older sister Hejsa, and younger sister Kaylen.[1][3] Christensen was an athlete in high school, playing hockey competitively and tennis on a provincial level.[4]
They spent summers on Long Island with their maternal grandmother, Rose Schwartz, and attended the Actors Studio in New York City; they studied as well at the Arts York drama program at Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario.[5] After accompanying their older sister to their agent's office after they landed a role in a Pringles commercial, they began being cast in commercials as well, including for Triaminic cough syrup.[5]
Career
1993–2005
Christensen made their acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, they played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions.[6] The following year, they had a minor role in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness.[6] From 1995 through 1999, they appeared in several films and television series, including Harrison Bergeron, Forever Knight, Goosebumps, The Virgin Suicides, and Are You Afraid of the Dark?[6]
They acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel's television series Higher Ground in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by their stepmother, and then turned to drugs in their despair.[6][7]
Christensen's critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in Life as a House (2001) earned them Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year.[8][9][10] However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice.[7] In 2002, Christensen made their London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in This Is Our Youth.[11]
They went on to receive good reviews for 2003's Shattered Glass, which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for The New Republic and other publications.[12][13] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, "Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame they haven't earned."[14] In 2005, Christensen made their Broadway debut when they appeared briefly in a 10-minute play.
In 2005, they took part in the fifth annual "24 Hour Plays" benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.[15]
Star Wars
Christensen in 2005
On May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that they would be starring as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen.[16] Lucas is quoted as saying that they chose Christensen because they "needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side". This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader.
During the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit their own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by David Prowse.[17] Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) height. Their voice as the "robotic" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.[18]
Stock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where they were inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[19] This was one of the most controversial changes.[20][21] Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who they were before they turned to the dark side.[22] Christensen insisted this was done without their knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette "Return of the Jedi: What has changed?" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.[23]
Their performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics[24][25][26][27] (earning them the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).[28][29][30]
Christensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25.[31] For their performance in Episode III, they won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[32]
2006–present
Jumper in Rome in 2006 Christensen with then–girlfriend Rachel Bilson filmingin Rome in 2006
Between 2006 and 2007, they starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery,[6][33] and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.[6][34] Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film Jumper, the story of a young man who discovers they have the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008.[35][36] Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film New York, I Love You.[37] Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in Virgin Territory, which was released directly-to-DVD in North America on August 26, 2008.[38] The film, based on The Decameron, is about a group of people who escape the Black Plague epidemic by hiding out in a Tuscan villa in Italy.[39]
In October 2009, Christensen started shooting the horror film Vanishing on 7th Street, directed by Brad Anderson, with Thandie Newton and John Leguizamo.[40][41] Christensen appeared in the crime drama Takers with Idris Elba and Paul Walker, released in the United States on August 27, 2010.[42] Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey is the fourth film in which Christensen stars with Samuel L. Jackson.
In 2010, Christensen sued USA Network over allegations that they stole their idea for the TV show Royal Pains. The suit alleges that Christensen met with the USA to pitch a similar series entitled Housecalls. During the meeting, Christensen alleges, they were never informed that a similar program was in development.[43][44] Although a federal judge at first dismissed Christensen's lawsuit in 2011, in June 2012, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings, in what was considered a legal victory for Christensen.[45]
On May 20, 2013, during the Cannes Film Festival, the Russian company Enjoy Movies announced the creation of Glacier Films, an alliance company with Christensen and their brother Tove. Over a three-year period, Glacier Films intends to make 11 "micro-budget" movies costing $1.5M each. The first project, American Heist, starring Christensen, Adrien Brody and Jordana Brewster, started filming in June 2013. It is a remake of Steve McQueen's The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.[46] In 2014, they starred in the American-Chinese-Canadian film Outcast, an action drama, alongside Nicolas Cage.[47]
Personal life
In 2007, Christensen began dating actor Rachel Bilson, with whom they filmed the movie Jumper. They became engaged on December 25, 2008.[48][49] In mid-2010, they broke up, but began dating again a few months later.[50][51][52][53] On October 29, 2014, Bilson gave birth to their daughter Briar Rose.[54] Christensen and Bilson separated in September 2017.[55]
In 2007, Christensen bought a farm near Uxbridge, Ontario.[56][57] They noted in 2008 that they had been renovating the property themselves and devoting time to learning about "livestock, crops, and agricultural machinery".[56] In November 2013, Christensen collaborated with Canadian fashion chain RW&Co to release a men's clothing line inspired by their farm.[58]
An avid Toronto Maple Leafs fan,[citation needed] Christensen performed a public service announcement for Do Something's Teens for Jeans Campaign in 2008.[59] They modelled in Louis Vuitton's advertising,[60] and was also named as the face of Lacoste's newest fragrance, Lacoste Challenge.[61] They were featured in RED's Lazarus Effect Campaign, which is intended to increase awareness for its efforts to fight AIDS in Africa.[62][63]
Filmography
This will likely be my last podcast of 2013. I'm traveling to Holland, Belgium and France for the holidays and will put up some more fresh interviews in January. This has been a great year, I washed a lot of windows, printed a bunch of t-shirts and met some really cool people that I now consider friends. Doing this podcast has really pushed me creatively. I've grown in my appreciation of Ojai and I'm even more committed to partaking in the swirling magic of our local community.
Todd Hannigan makes a big inspiring impact on me in this interview. I enjoyed very much geeking out in their state of the art recording studio. Seeing and hearing that sweet high tech gear makes me wanna drain my bank account on a microphone or two. All in good time. But what I really like about Todd is their commitment to an underlying principal of sustainability, community and positive world flight attendantship. Its seems obvious to me that he's grateful to be in Ojai feeding into and on the great vibes we have here for making art and having a beneficial impact on the whole world. I can even hear that in the song they sing near the end of the interview. I'm glad you're tuned in here and I hope you enjoy my visit with Todd.
Todd's personal website toddhannigan.com has a bunch of songs on it and more info on him. Todd's recording studio Brotheryn Studios dot com will give you the further low down on how he's spreading the good sounds around.
Another gift in 2013 came in the form of a little black ball of mewing fur. They started hanging around the barn so I started feeding them and now we're getting pretty used to each other. She's a good talker and enjoys time on the mic.  They are the Little Black Kitty.
See you 'round town.
Story highlights American Blaine Gibson is leading a search for missing MH370
They found debris on Madagascar that may have come from the plane
(CNN) Blaine Gibson, an American lawyer leading a self-funded hunt for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, handed over six pieces of debris found on Madagascar to Malaysian investigators on Tuesday.
Gibson said one piece they found might prove why the plane crashed.
"If the third piece, the monitor case, is confirmed to be from MH 370, it proves, tragically, that the main body of the cabin broke apart in a forceful impact ... (and) definitely not a controlled ditching," they said. "The barnacles on board will hopefully provide some clues as to the location of the crash site and route followed."

The New York Police Department will begin equipping a small number of its officers with wearable video cameras, a pilot program geared toward eventually outfitting the nation's largest police force with technology that promises greater accountability.
A total of 60 cameras will be deployed in the coming months in five high-crime police precincts, one in each of the city's five boroughs, Commissioner William J. Bratton said on Thursday.
“It is the next wave,” Mr. Bratton said at Police Headquarters with two officers who wore the small cameras on their uniforms. They likened the introduction of cameras to the rollout, decades before, of hand-held police radios whose crackling codes and blips are now a quintessential part of policing everywhere.
A federal judge last year ordered the department to test the cameras for one year in five precincts as a way of evaluating their effectiveness in curbing unconstitutional stop-and-frisk interactions by officers. The court ordered an independent monitor to help set the policy for the cameras, though that order has been delayed pending an appeal.

The human-driven extinction of fruit-eating lemurs on Madagascar has created multiple "orphan" plant species with precarious futures because their primary seed dispersers are gone, scientists say.
The findings, detailed in this week's issue of the journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could have implications for conservation efforts not only in Madagascar, but around the world.
Among the world's most unique primates, lemurs play a vital role in Madagascar as seed dispersers for many plants and are essential for maintaining healthy and diverse forests on the island. Fruits make up a large part of many lemurs' diets, and the animals will often ingest whole seeds and then poop them out far from the parent tree, thus helping the plants spread.
"In other tropical areas, the primary seed dispersers are birds, but in Madagascar, that's not the case," says study first-author Sarah Federman, a graduate student at Yale University. "The burden of seed dispersal falls mainly on lemurs, of which there are very few."
That number is dwindling even further. Scientists estimate that in the past few thousand years, at least 17 lemur species on Madagascar have been driven to extinction by human activity, through either direct hunting or loss of habitat.
To investigate how these extinctions have affected Madagascar's forests, Federman and their team matched the diets of extinct lemurs with the seeds of plants on the island, including some plant species that scientists suspected were “orphans”--plants that did not have any existing animal seed dispersers.
To infer whether the extinct lemurs were capable of eating and dispersing the seeds, the group analyzed the animals' gape sizes–how wide their jaws could open–as well as other clues, such as their tooth shapes and dental wear.
The scientists concluded that many of the extinct lemur species they examined had once indeed been seed dispersers. Furthermore, one large extinct lemur in particular, called Pachylemur, was likely the primary disperser for a group of orphan plants on the island called Canarium. More than 30 Canarium tree species are found on Madagascar, and the largest of these have seeds that resemble large olives and are too big for Madagascar's existing lemurs to eat.
Bereft of their main seed dispersers, today's Canariums must rely on less-effective secondary dispersers such as strong winds and rodents to spread their seeds, but their days could be numbered, Federman and their team concluded.
The group also identified living lemur species–including several endangered species–that occupy essential dispersal niches. If these lemurs also disappear, the scientists warn, the health and diversity of Madagascar's forests could be jeopardized.
Mauro Galetti, an ecologist at Paulo State University in Brazil, says the new findings foreshadow what could happen in many other regions, such as continental Africa, Asia and South America, as large fruit-eating animals such as elephants, gorillas, and rhinos are driven to extinction.
"More and more we find evidence for the importance of large frugivores [(fruit-eaters)]to our planet," says Galetti, who was not involved in the study.
Federman says their group's findings have practical and even philosophical ramifications for species conservation.
"Traditionally, conservation tended to be species-specific ... but now people are moving toward more ecosystem-level projects because we've realized that you can't protect a species in a vacuum," they say. "Our analysis facilitates thinking about how Madagascar's lemurs fit into their ecosystems, but it also raises the question of what do you do with a tree that can no longer disperse its seeds. Do we intervene? Or do we just let it go extinct?"
Introduction Top
Lately we're seeing a new build for Illidan which focuses on sustainability with shadow shield, immolation etc, and while he's able to last longer in the middle of the fight, I feel like their damage is lacking. So I went back to the old build of building them super squishy but in return their single target damage is optimal, which works very well with their Heroic Ability "The Hunt". What's surprising is that unless you got cc'ed hard to the ground, this build actually keeps you alive longer than expected because of the insane lifesteal you'll get from the enhanced basic attacks.
That said, both builds are certainly viable, but I'll be focusing on the true ganking assassin build.
Edit: With the changes to Path of the Marksman, Illidan now has access to being a carry! It is general consensus that Illidan is currently one of the weakest characters in the game, outdamaged by the other assassins, outsustained by most heroes, basically what Illidan can do, other heroes can do it better. But just because he's bottom tier doesn't mean he's not viable.Lately we're seeing a new build for Illidan which focuses on sustainability with shadow shield, immolation etc, and while he's able to last longer in the middle of the fight, I feel like their damage is lacking.

Your main objective here is to farm that marksman damage, so AVOID SKIRMISHES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. When you predict an upcoming teamfight, carefully decide whether the team needs you or not, and if they don't, stay in lane. Getting fed while not dying is of utmost importance early on. Early on, you're very vulnerable as your damage and damage are pretty low. So farm safely and only engage if the enemy is alone and out of position. With the changes to Seasoned Marksman, I now get it almost all the time to get that extra oomph in your damage output. The only time I get Battered Assault nowadays is on Blackheart's Bay where you really have little to no time staying in lane.Your main objective here is to farm that marksman damage, so AVOID SKIRMISHES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

Mid Game (Level 10-19) Top
Map Awareness is the key in picking someone off perfectly. You need to know where the opponents are, as well as where your teammates are in case you need to escape.
However if you can still stay in lane and ramp up your marksman even more, keep doing so.
Note: I recommend blood for blood almost all the time at level 16, but if your team is winning significantly that you wouldn't even need the extra lifesteal and your team has tons of CC, by all means get Executioner. It'll ramp up your damage output significantly! Mid Game is where you start to shine. Your damage continues to ramp up starting from level 10 with The Hunt, and of course you'll be able to pick someone off really easy with your heroic's cast range. Be careful when doing so though, you might want to run into their teammates and that almost guarantees a death on your part.Map Awareness is the key in picking someone off perfectly.

Late Game (Level 20+) Top
It's basically like the mid game, only you can pick someone off regardless of where you are on the map. The only exception to the rule is you cannot Hunt someone when you're inside the mines and your target is outside, and vice versa. Now your marksman stacks will come into play. Your basic attacks will deal 300+ damage which multiples even further with the talents you picked up for Q and W.
Ganking Top
There are few things Illidan is better at than all the other heroes, and that is the ability to position yourself for a body block. When ganking with a teammate, use your Q to position yourself in front of your target's escape path, and proceed to body block while attack cancelling. This should give you at least a couple more seconds to kill the target.
Be careful when you use sweeping strike, as it has a longer cooldown than Dive. Carefully plan if you can kill your target before backup arrives, and if you can't, W away to give you some space. Illidan is a great 1v1 hero, but their kill potential drops when numbers are not in their favor, more significantly than any other hero in the game.
Also, do NOT use E immediately after you just dived in. You're not in an immediate threat when you're the one ganking, so save it either when you get counter ganked, or you're about to finish someone off in their tower. What I see most Illidans do wrong is gank properly, from rushing down without proper timing, being completely out of position, etc.There are few things Illidan is better at than all the other heroes, and that is the ability to position yourself for a body block.

Conclusion Top
To keep these fiends from feasting on their villages, the surviving relatives would try to physically keep them in their graves, sort of like setting up an obstacle course for the deceased.
Last year, Bulgarian archaeologists found two skeletons whose chests had been impaled with iron rods near the Black Sea town of Sozopol—apparently a typical treatment for those suspected of post-mortal malfeasance until the early 1900s there. About 100 such skeletons have been uncovered in Bulgaria alone.
This summer in Poland, researchers unearthed remains that had their heads removed and placed in their laps—possibly a sign that whoever buried them wanted to hinder any potential future resurrection by making the vampire find its head first.
One Italian village even buried a suspected vampire with a brick in their mouth.
It's a Spooky World
Part of the reason the myth persisted, it seemed, was widespread confusion over what happens to people after they die. The pagan Slavs obviously didn't know about decomposition, but even centuries later, people might have been misled by the fact that rigor mortis eventually gives way to flexible limbs, making a corpse seem more lifelike than dead-like. Similarly, a digestive tract's decaying ooze might have looked like fresh blood to an unwitting villager, and burial shrouds sometimes snagged on the corpses' teeth, making them appear to be partially eaten. (Some believe this is why in Ulysses, when Stephen sees what they believe is an apparition, they cry, “Ghoul! Chewer of Corpses!”)
Eventually, similar fears migrated to the New World. During tuberculosis epidemics, 19th-century New Englanders began to notice that the relatives of TB victims began to sicken and waste away after their loved one's death. This was before germ theory took hold, so one popular explanation was that the deceased TB victims were rising from the dead to suck the life out of their loved ones. One Connecticut town, for example, thought the solution was to exhume the remains of the dead relative and arrange the remains in a skull-and-crossbones pattern.
The Scottish writer Emily Gerard first documented the Eastern European myths that gave rise to the vampire-burial practices in a 1885 article called “Transylvanian Superstitions:”
These restless spirits, called Strigoi, are not malicious, but their appearance bodes no good, and may be regarded as omens of sickness or misfortune. More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu, in whom every Roumenian peasant believes as firmly as they do in heaven or hell.
In 1897, Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was based partly on Gerard's work, as well as the 1931 film adaptation, cemented the pasty, bloody-fanged vampire we know today into pop horror consciousness.
It was clear that by then, however, vampires were becoming more of a myth than an actual menace. In a review of Dracula published in 1897, The Guardian explained that Count Dracula “is unable to die properly, but from century to century resuscitates their life of the ‘Un-Dead'...by nightly draughts of blood from the throats of living victims, with the appalling consequence that those once so bitten must become vampires in their turn.”
The newspaper praised Stoker as a powerful author, but it dismissed their genre of choice:
“It is, however, a mistake to fill a whole volume with horrors.”
On July 10 in Paris a gathering of nearly 2,000 scientists and academics reaffirmed what most climate scientists have been saying for decades: The cost of making cuts in greenhouse gas pollution rises with every day of delay and zero emissions must be the goal for this century. Such was the outcome of the Common Future under Climate Change conference held in Paris from July 7–10 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, better known by its acronym, UNESCO, and meant to advise the upcoming international negotiations to curb global warming in Paris this December.
The dangers include sea level rise of more than six meters at an unknown rate, more downpours, heat waves, wildfires and droughts as well as the loss of ice everywhere, among other challenges. To avoid global warming of as much as 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the scientists suggested civilization has a total budget of 900 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the world has already added roughly 592 billion metric tons since 1780.
Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University suggested at the conference that the world has already missed an opportunity during the Great Recession to start the necessary shift to a low-carbon energy system by neglecting to invest in more climate-friendly energy infrastructure, which would have both stimulated the global economy and reduced income inequality. They called for an enforceable global price on carbon—not the spotty global cap-and-trade program presently in effect—to drive this shift, along with cross-border carbon tariffs for laggard nations. This rise in carbon taxes could then be used to reduce other taxes, which could mean low or even negative costs to countries. "This reflects the basic economic principle: that it's better to tax bad things than good things," they said.
The scientists also laid out in their final communiqué that climate change is already here, affecting the poor most directly in the form of extreme weather. By 2050, current greenhouse gas emissions of roughly 40 billion metric tons per year will need to drop by at least 40 percent. And by the end of the 21st century, "greenhouse gas emissions must be zero, or even negative."
In fact, all current scenarios to meet such goals require CO2 to be pulled from the air. The leading candidates for that job are plants and rocks, both of which have been absorbing CO2 via photosynthesis and chemical reactions with rain, respectively, for geologic eons, albeit slowly. Burning plants—or biomass, as scientists like to call them—in a power plant outfitted with devices to capture CO2 and bury it could potentially remove more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit, as could artificial trees and other technologies designed for that purpose. There are also dreams of vast algae farms in the ocean, fed concentrated CO2 and producing a carbon-negative fuel.
But a coal-fired power plant with CO2 capture-and-storage (CCS) technology is like nuclear: big, cumbersome and expensive. In addition, unlike a nuclear power plant, the electricity such "clean coal" produces is not cheap and it has to produce more of it to run all the CCS equipment. Adding biomass to the mix puts climate goals in competition with food production for hungry stomachs as well as space for noncrop plants and wild animals, in addition to requiring yet more use of fossil fuels to produce the nitrogen fertilizer needed to grow all these plants.
The argument against CCS is strong. Critics, however, often overlook the fact that making steel and making cement—the fundamental substrates of all power plants, whether wind turbines and solar rooftops or new nuclear—spew copious CO2, as does making the fertilizer that has made more than seven billion humans on the planet today possible. If the goal is zero- or negative emissions, these emissions will have to be eliminated. The only proposal at present to do so is CCS.
In Paris Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a climate physicist and chair of the German Advisory Council on Global Change, called for "an induced implosion of the carbon economy" over the next few decades, a shift they compared with efforts to end slavery in the last few decades of the 19th century. Without such a momentous shift in the global energy system, there is "not the slightest chance of avoiding dangerous, maybe disastrous climate change."
Liverpool lead race for Vertonghen as Tottenham defender ponders summer exit... and Cole is on Rodgers' radar too

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has made it plain that to continue on the upward curve, improvements must be made to the Liverpool back four - especially the centre of defence.
Belgian international Vertonghen has thus become a target for Rodgers who will also seek to sign Ashley Cole, should Chelsea fail to offer the England left back a new contract.

People who abused methamphetamine or other amphetamine-like stimulants were more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than those who did not, in a new study from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).
The researchers examined almost 300,000 hospital records from California covering 16 years. Patients admitted to hospital for methamphetamine or amphetamine-use disorders had a 76 per cent higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease compared to those with no disorder.
Globally, methamphetamine and similar stimulants are the second most commonly used class of illicit drugs.
"This study provides evidence of this association for the first time, even though it has been suspected for 30 years," said lead researcher Dr. Russell Callaghan, a scientist with CAMH. Parkinson's disease is caused by a deficiency in the brain's ability to produce a chemical called dopamine. Because animal studies have shown that methamphetamine damages dopamine-producing areas in the brain, scientists have worried that the same might happen in humans.
It has been a challenge to establish this link, because Parkinson's disease develops in middle and old age, and it is necessary to track a large number of people with methamphetamine addiction over a long time span.
The CAMH team took an innovative approach by examining hospital records from California -- a state in which methamphetamine use is prevalent -- from 1990 up to 2005. In total, 40,472 people, at least 30 years of age, had been hospitalized due to a methamphetamine- or amphetamine-use disorder during this period.
These patients were compared to two groups: 207,831 people admitted for appendicitis with no diagnosis of any type of addiction, and 35,335 diagnosed with cocaine use disorders. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was identified from hospital records or death certificates. Only the methamphetamine group had an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease.
While the appendicitis group served as a comparison to the general population, the cocaine group was selected for two reasons. Because cocaine is another type of stimulant that affects dopamine, this group could be used to determine whether the risk was specific to methamphetamine stimulants. Cocaine users also served as a control group to account for the health effects or lifestyle factors associated with dependence on an illicit drug.
"It is important for the public to know that our findings do not apply to patients who take amphetamines for medical purposes, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), since these patients use much lower doses of amphetamines than those taken by patients in our study," said Dr. Stephen Kish, a CAMH scientist and co-author.
To put the study findings into numbers, if 10,000 people with methamphetamine dependence were followed over 10 years, 21 would develop Parkinson's, compared with 12 people out of 10,000 from the general population. "It is also possible that our findings may underestimate the risk because in California, methamphetamine users may have had less access to health-care insurance and consequently to medical care," said Dr. Callaghan.
The current project is significant because it is one of the few studies examining the long-term association between methamphetamine use and the development of a major brain disorder. "Given that methamphetamine and other amphetamine stimulants are the second most widely used illicit drugs in the world, the current study will help us anticipate the full long-term medical consequences of such problematic drug use," said Dr. Callaghan.

White House won't remove loophole allowing foreign contractors to ignore fraud John Byrne
Published: Thursday March 13, 2008
|
Print This Email This The White House has indicated it will not remove a loophole quietly inserted into a budget rule which allows contractors abroad to keep silent if they observe fraud or abuse on US government contracts. The proposed rule, put forth by the White House Office of Management and Budget last year, exempts all companies who do work overseas from a new regulation requiring US contractors to report waste, fraud or abuse they encounter while doing work for the government. More than $100 billion in contracts have been awarded for work in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last five years. "This sends the message that if you're going to do waste, fraud and abuse, don't do it at home, do it abroad," Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) told the Washington Post in Thursday's papers. "This was slipped in at the last minute. . . . It's obviously something you can't justify in any way, and there's no answer to why you'd allow this to occur abroad any more than you'd allow it to occur domestically. There is a question as to how and why the change was made, and we don't know the answer." Even the Bush Justice Department opposes the exemption, which was slipped into the proposed rule last November. No one has come forward to admit the insertion. "The exemption has riled the Justice Department, which opposes limiting the rule to domestic contracts," the Post wrote. "And the loophole has led members of Congress to call for an investigation amid concerns that someone inserted the exemption as a favor to the contracting lobby that has major interests because of the ongoing wars." In January, according to the Post, the Justice Department wrote the Office of Management and Budget requesting the exemption be struck. The rule was added in the first place, they said, because of "worries about a drop in voluntary reporting of waste and fraud." Myriad cases of abuse have been linked to the wars, where policing is often slim, and the incentive to report even slimmer. The rule has received support from US inspectors general. Twenty-seven criminal investigations of fraud, waste and abuse took place under the Coalition Provisional Authority's watch alone, according to a 2004 report. The Authority failed to keep track of nearly $1 billion in money spent for reconstruction, the report said. For example, the CPA paid almost $200,000 for police trucks without confirming they'd actually received them. Nor did they have records to "justify the $24.7 million price tag for replacing the Iraqi currency."
Music lovers plan to exercise their right to openly carry guitars at a July 4 rally in Texas.
“This is my sense of humor,” said event organizer Barry Kooda, a musician who's played for years around Austin. “I have a larger following than I'd like because I'm just the local yokel.”
Kooda suggested the rally on Facebook as a light-hearted response to gun-rights activists openly carrying firearms around Texas and elsewhere, photographing themselves inside national retail and restaurant chains to suggest corporate endorsement.
“I'm not anti-gun at all,” the musician told KTVT-TV. “I'm a fifth-generation Texas veteran. I have guns, (but) leave them at home. You have rights — you just don't have to express them all the time in people's faces.”
Kooda's fans, friends, and followers shared their idea on social media, and supporters have offered to sell T-shirts and other items to promote the July 4 Open Carry Guitar Rally.
“You should be able to carry your guitar in public without the fear of retribution,” Kooda said. “That's what we're here for – America — and Les Paul (is) made in America.”
The loosely organized event will, of course, feature live music, and organizers said its location at the Continental Avenue Bridge Park would be close to restaurants and bars if participants get hungry or thirsty.
One participant hopes to make a video of guitar enthusiasts playing the “Star-Spangled Banner” in the key of E – as Jimi Hendrix played in their famous performance of the national anthem at Woodstock — on small, battery-powered amplifiers.
Other nods toward the 1960s counterculture were suggested.
“Do we want any nice hippy chicks to walk around with flowers to potentially put in the barrels of OCT guys? Or is that asking for a confrontation?” said Kyle Reynolds, of Dallas, who's helping to organize the event.
Kooda said more than 800 people have already said they would attend, and they said similar rallies were planned in California, Oregon, and Virginia.
Gun-rights supporters say they aren't offended.
“They can bear their guitars and I'll bear my guns — it's all good,” said Kory Watkins, of Open Carry Tarrant County, standing outside a strip mall with a rifle slung over their shoulder. “It's freedom of speech, doing what's within their rights — and I support that.”
A guitar rally participant said they plan to take part to highlight safety concerns over the promiscuous display of firearms in public.
“Whether a gun rights advocate or a gun control advocate, or even if you don't really care about it either way, most agree that this is not the way to behave,” said participant Bobby Beeman, of Dallas.
“The groups doing this sort of thing usually seem to have between 2 and 20 people walking around with guns, getting lots of press and causing lots of concern for people just trying to go about their lives,” they continued. “When I saw this, I thought it was a great and very funny way to make a statement about this area having a few bad eggs and a lot of great people. And a time when musicians of all genres can get together and celebrate music and a passion we all share.”

A call for socialist unity in action for inauguration weekend and beyond
Issued by the Boston Socialist Unity ProjectBoston Socialist Unity Project and the Philly Socialists
Comrades and friends,
The election of Donald Trump has unleashed extreme right-wing forces intent on doing harm to oppressed and working class people. The Trump campaign, with the open bigotry it promoted and inspired, drew comparisons with fascist movements of the past. The Trump administration being assembled out of traditional conservatives, white nationalist “alt-right” figures, and corporate interests will further institutionalize and normalize these dangerous forces if not effectively resisted at every opportunity.
Movement in the streets
This election has also brought forth an unprecedented nationwide protest movement against a president-elect and has boldly expressed rejection of their messages of hate. These protests have been organized by a broad array of forces and socialist organizations have played key roles in the most militant mobilizations. Boston Socialist Unity Project commends the efforts of organizations that took initiative to rapidly put people in the streets. Going forward we hope that socialist groups can immediately begin to explore ways to work together towards unified, coordinated, and even more powerful activity.
Towards a united front
Socialist unity in action can help build towards a powerful united front capable of resisting both Trump and the system that created him. Socialists understand that capitalism and imperialism seek to pit sections of the working class against each other and our perspective can help overcome this tendency to divide and conquer that Trump relies on. Socialists also understand the need for mass actions in the streets in concert with other progressives, especially in the coming weeks leading up to the inauguration. Socialists also understand that a united front must collaborate broadly and strategically with all democratic forces to build the working class movement, whether engaged in community work, public protests, or electoral activities.
United weekend of action
Many socialist groups are currently organizing for a variety of actions locally and in Washington DC on January 20-21, the largest being mobilizations for inauguration day and women's marches the following day. As one step towards building a united front, BSUP is calling on all socialist organizations mobilizing for inauguration protests to do so under the banner of a United Weekend of Action.
Boston Socialist Unity Project & Philly Socialists
BSUP has had some modest success uniting local socialists at our Building Socialism, Building Our Movements 2016 Spring conference. We hope to build further local unity at our upcoming conference in April. Philly Socialists hosted a successful Socialist Convergence during the Democratic National Convention and they have recently issued a call for a united front of socialists that aims to use the infrastructure they developed over the Summer to make this happen. BSUP supports this effort as well as any other efforts to form local, regional, or national coalitions, conferences, or means to promote joint activity.
Get involved
We encourage all socialists who agree with this perspective to raise it in their own organizations. We also encourage all unaffiliated socialists to join political organizations as thousands have done since election day.

OTTAWA, Dec. 21, 2015 /CNW/ - On behalf of Canada's Building Trades Unions, representing over 500,000 middle class Canadians, Bob Blakely, Canadian Operating Officer said: "During the debate on these onerous, narrowly targeted amendments the Liberal and New Democratic parties stood up for Canadian unionized workers. Now that the Liberals have formed government one of their first acts was to restore fairness in respect of the confidentiality of union financial information and allowing unions to be treated like every other tax entity in Canada. We are grateful to them for living up to their promises and for treating us with fairness and with respect."
Bill C 377, a Private Member's Bill, only had support from some of the Conservative caucus but found wide support with the MERIT Contractors and their interlinking partners LabourWatch and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. These are organizations that do not have unionized workers. The purposes behind this legislation was to compel unions and any organization that had a relationship with unions such as health, welfare, pension, training, apprenticeship plans set up by a collective agreement to disclose any and all financial information that they had on a public government funded website. The goal of the legislation was to give antiunion organizations an intelligence bonanza and weaken Canadian unions in the process. No other similar organization, including employers' organizations such as the supporters of this Bill, would have had to surrender their business confidentiality to the benefit of their competitors.
Lionel Railton, Canadian Director of the International Union of Operating Engineers stated "As Canadians, we file our taxes and make disclosures to the Canada Revenue Agencies, we all have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Unions should be able to expect that degree of privacy. As well, we have business interests and we seek to achieve common goals through communal action – – no one expects other similar organizations to give up their privacy!"
Finally, the Bill C377 amendments were subject to court challenge, some of which have already been filed, and others which awaited the coming into force date of January 1, 2016. Blakely said about this aspect "it seems pretty clear that the amendments were not about the Income Tax Act, but rather about the regulation of the trade unions which is a constitutional power reserved to the provinces and 7 of the provinces actively opposed the Bill. The amendments curtail communal action and the right of free speech in breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It would've only been a matter of time until Bill C377 was struck down. The new Government knew that and acted positively to avoid needless litigation. We are grateful for their careful and forceful attention to this matter."
In conclusion, Blakely stated "we greatly appreciate a government that actually follows through on their election promises."

If you're excited about the forthcoming cinematic universe Disney appears to be planning around Star Wars, then this amazing seven-and-a-half-minute short created by a fan over four years should do a lot to help tide you over.
The animated film was created by Paul Michael Johnson, and animated in the style of epic 80s anime series' like Mobile Suit Gundam, Patlabor and many others, which featured painstaking hand drawn detail and shading. The short also features an epic '80s-ish soundtrack, and sound effects from the classic TIE Fighter series of games from LucasArts .
There's an official spin-off movie planned for 2016 release that will mostly likely focus on X-Wing pilots called ‘Rogue One,‘ but this Empire-centric perspective is a unique take. Disney, option this guy for a full-length series and we'll all love you forever.

Santorum defended Davis, claiming that they should be “applauded” for their “courageous” actions and asserting that the Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage is illegitimate since it violates biblical precepts.
“Clearly, the laws on marriage don't follow the natural law, they don't follow God's law, so in Martin Luther King's viewpoint, they would have said that this is a law that you have an obligation to resist and that's what Kim Davis is doing,” they said. “She is standing up and saying, ‘I am not going to follow an unjust law.'”
Previously, Santorum likened Davis to a girl who was murdered during the Columbine massacre, who according to a popular but debunked myth was killed for believing in God.
Santorum also invoked the Nuremberg trials, suggesting that people who are demanding that Davis comply with the court's order are using the same argument employed by Nazis at Nuremberg following World War II, that “we were just following the law.”
They said that people must defy court rulings like Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges, which they said is even more far-reaching than Roe because it is “forcing people to be complicit with something they find immoral,” and that Congress and the presidency must also “push back and change the law.”
Today the Republic of Ireland played Northern Ireland in a training match behind closed doors.
There were no fans in the stadium, and no television crews present, only staff and officials from both assosciations and a few photographers.
Thankfully Sportsfile were in attendance, and they have provided us with photos of a match that we would otherwise know absolutely nothing about. So, armed with only the following photos, here is our analysis of today's match:
Both teams had to do the official tunnel line up before kick-off.
That must have been awkward.
Stephen Ward leads the Irish side out.

Not the most experienced side then.
How strange does this look:
Here is the Irish starting XI:

Westwood
Christie, Keogh, Pearce, Ward
McGeady, Arter, Hendrick, McClean
Murphy, McGoldrick
The managers have a quick chat.
"Lovely day for it in fairness."
We're underway! Alex Pearce wins an early battle with Kyle Lafferty.

We think, we have no idea at what stage this battle took place.
McClean is dispossessed far too easily by Steven Davis.
He's having a shocker out there... Possibly.
Murphy loses out to Gareth McAuley.

A cagey start by the looks of things.
Chance for Northern Ireland!
Richard Keogh blocks a Kyle Lafferty attempt from a dangerous position, Ireland lucky there.
Ireland push on and win a corner, we'll just assume it didn't clear the first man.

What a waste!
Half time, a drab affair so far?
Wholesale changes for the second half.
Seamus Coleman and Chris Brunt get stuck in.

Oliver Norwood attempts to thread a pass through.
Or that could be a shot, we've no idea. Oh look, there's David Meyler.
McCarthy is on, and is noticeably less sweaty than Davis.
Robbie Brady is getting stuck in as the game nears its conclusion.

Are they at left back there? Hopefully not.
A late corner for Ireland, can we knick the win?
Brady with the delivery...
Nope. It's finished 0-0.

Probably for the best that it wasn't on TV.
So there you have it. A lot of positives to take from that match; the weather in Dublin was glorious, Northern Ireland's away kit is lovely, and the lads got some match fitness ahead of the England and Scotland games.
The second-ranking House Democrat on Tuesday said it's "possible" that their party could win back control of the lower chamber in November.
Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the minority whip, emphasized that it's a long shot for the Democrats to pick up the 30 seats they need to win back the House after six years in the minority.
But citing an analysis from University of Virginia's Larry Sabato — an election expert predicting the House would flip if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE does very well in November — Hoyer said the gavel is not beyond the Democrats' grasp.

"I certainly think we're going to pick up a significant number of seats, and I think that it is possible that, if in fact Mrs. Clinton does that well, then we will take back the House," Hoyer told reporters in the Capitol.
Sabato's analysis predicted the Democrats would pick up 39 House seats — and take the chamber — if Clinton's edge over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE is 2 percentage points greater than President Obama's margin over GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.
Hoyer was quick to note that such an outcome "is a stretch."
"He doesn't say it's going to happen," Hoyer said.
But Hoyer also said he'd traveled the country to stump for more than 20 Democratic candidates over the long August recess, and they like what they see.
"They're optimistic about their chances, and I am as well," they said.
Republican leaders have a different view, saying they're fully confident the House will remain in their hands next year. It was a message amplified Tuesday by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who told reporters they feel "very secure that Republicans can keep the House."
"At the end of the day, we'll be in the majority," McCarthy told reporters in the Capitol.
The competing comments come as the country's top election handicappers predict the Democrats will make significant gains in the House — picking up between 10 and 20 seats — but fall shy of the 30 seats they need to win back control of the chamber.
Many Democrats have hoped that Trump's bombastic campaign, and their penchant for alienating large groups of voters, might lead to the type of wave election that could propel the Democrats to power even in the face of the largest Republican majority since the Great Depression.
Hoyer, an 18-term lawmaker, characterized the election as the "most volatile" and "most unpredictable in which I've been involved." They said he's hopeful that the "deep divisions and dysfunction" within the Republican conference will shift public sentiment to the Democrats' side up and down the ballot.
"I have great confidence in the American people and in their common sense and in their judgment," they said. "And I think Hillary Clinton's going to do very well, and, quite frankly, I think we're going to do very well in a lot of the districts where we're not perceived to have had a shot at."

Whereas, Europeans kept my forebears in bondage some three centuries toiling without pay,
Whereas, Europeans ignored the human rights pledges of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution,
Whereas, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments meant little more than empty words,
Therefore, Americans of European ancestry are guilty of great crimes against my ancestors and their progeny.
But, in the recognition Europeans themselves have been victims of various and sundry human rights violations to wit: the Norman Conquest, the Irish Potato Famine, Decline of the Hapsburg Dynasty, Napoleonic and Czarist adventurism, and gratuitous insults and speculations about the intelligence of Europeans of Polish descent,
I, Walter E. Williams, do declare full and general amnesty and pardon to all persons of European ancestry, for both their own grievances, and those of their forebears, against my people.
In getting to know their relatives, Maryam Abolfazli senses a shift in attitude, even among the staunchest supporters of the Islamic republic
In 2003, I went to Iran for the first and, so far, only time. I'd waited years to go with my mother since they hadn't been back since the revolution, but then decided to stop waiting and just go by myself. I was living in Afghanistan at the time, and flew from Kabul to Mashhad on Mahan Air, and then to Tehran. On the first leg of the flight, as they started to serve rice with barberries and chicken, I put on my scarf. I wore it with a matching turquoise manteau that my room-mate, also Iranian, gave me. I was going to dress in modern hejab chic, signalling to everyone on the streets of Tehran that I was ready for the cool party scene I'd heard so much about.
My family, up to 20 of them, were waiting behind the glass partition when I arrived. And immediately, I realised they were not Tehran chic, and quite unlike the Iranian family I grew up in back in Tennessee. They weren't overly expressive, or obsessively stylish like my family back home. Most everyone was covered from top to bottom in loose, dark coloured regime-appropriate attire. They clearly weren't interested in keeping up with trends.
“Do you like Eminem?” my cousin asked me as I swooned over the gorgeous boys in faux hawk hairstyles walking past us on the street the following day.
“Yeah a lot,” I said.
“I hate him,” they responded.
This was the time when Iran's youth were starting to peak in terms of coolness: ripped designer jeans, stylish edgy haircuts, underground music, parties with drugs, as captured a year later in the film Syriana. My room-mate would come back from Tehran with all of these stories about the fun she'd had. I wanted to experience it.
But I wouldn't.
The trip's itinerary, unbeknownst to me, was centred not around learning about the hip, vibrant, and youthful population I'd been hearing about, but visiting my father's conservative family. There was no time to go to my family's hometown of Shahroud, east of Tehran. Instead, each day, I visited a different aunt in Tehran.

On the last day of tour de familia, I walked into an aunt's apartment in Ekbatan, the US-designed housing blocks with hundreds of units built in the 1970s. The apartment was sparsely decorated: a brown couch, a chair, a coffee table, framed prayers and a picture of Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic republic, on the wall. We took off our shoes and walked in. By then I had learned to keep my headscarf on, just as a precaution, even though I'd entered a family home. (In religious homes, only men who are closely related can see a woman uncovered.) The religious rule of keeping covered while being around the husband of my aunt was so different from what I knew about family dynamics back home. Around my mother's family, we sat, played, and ate among aunts, uncles, and cousins as we would in our own home. The distinct boundary even among family members was new to me.
I sat on the chair and my aunt's husband, an Iran-Iraq war veteran, and an enduring basiji, sat on the couch opposite me. They had that later-than five o'clock shadow beard that was so popular among the religious at the time. They were dressed in a shirt that didn't have a collar, the kind that the Iranian government uses to distinguish their bureaucrats from western ones.
Their back straight as they sipped on this tea, they explained to me that the project of the Islamic republic was now coming to fruition. “We've been working to become an independent economy, to build our own goods and services. And we are now getting there. We have so many factories producing things, we have so many engineers working on all of our infrastructure. God willing, we are becoming a fully independent and productive state and power.”
I nodded. I wasn't entirely sure why we were talking about this, but I assumed it was because I was American. I had a million inclinations to push back on their ideas. What about the quality of products, services? What about the places that are producing products and infrastructure faster and with better quality? What about the general isolation? But this wasn't a discussion. This was a proclamation. And I listened.

Next, my aunt's daughter appeared from the hallway. A slim and tall seven-year-old, their whole body was covered in a long sleeve shirt and pants, though it was summer and though they were inside their own home. They showed me their room and then my aunt entered. They wanted to discuss my gift to their daughter. I gave them the money they said they needed for the gift as I looked around at the modest bedroom with a bed, a dresser, and a few pictures. It was a distinct contrast from my cousins' colourful rooms in the more affluent northern Tehran.
We finally left and they walked me to the apartment of my mother's brother, their last family member in Iran. They lived in the same apartment complex. We walked down the street, my aunt and cousin, both in full black chador, and me in my bright turquoise top.

My aunt told me they always wanted to visit Germany. I told them they should. When we arrived, my uncle's daughter, also seven at the time, answered the door in the shortest shorts and a bright yellow tank top. They looked practically naked to me. The sharp contrast between the two sides of my family was most apparent in that moment.
A change happened after the 2009 protests.
The same cousin that hated Eminem opened a coffee shop. And I started to see my cousins poking their heads on Facebook, even liking some of my posts. My dad went to Iran and explained that some family members had developed more nuanced views on the government, and that they could talk to some quite openly about the political problems. Others, they explained, were still quite devout and devoted to the regime.

In trying to understand whether a nuclear deal will stick, or whether Iran will open up to the world, I always look to that side of my family as a litmus test. With over seven Iran-Iraq war veterans among them, a deep pride runs through them for the state they've helped build, as reflected by my uncle's words that day in Ekbatan.
The day the deal was signed, our family group on the Telegram messaging application was silent. In between the stickers and jokes and prayers that are usually shared, I typed in the rare message, “Congratulations.” And my grandmother posted in response:
“Good luck isn't found, it's built.”
The following days, the rest of the messages were mainly not about the deal, but those that were, were all jokes.
“Dear beloved customer, in celebration of the nuclear deal, five thousand tomans will be withdrawn from your bank account. - Bank Melat”
(In lieu of subsidies, five thousand tomans were deposited into bank accounts during the Ahmadinejad administration.)
Or
“With Ahmadinejad we gained 20% enrichment, and we celebrated.
With Rouhani we lost 20% enrichment, and we celebrated.
We just like to celebrate!!”
One cousin that I didn't meet in Iran but got to know recently over Telegram, works in technology and we often talk about products. When the P5 + 1 came to an interim agreement with Iran back in May they and I texted, emotionally, excited for what this meant for us - perhaps visits, frequently.
Then in July when the nuclear deal was dragging on, they got on Telegram and asked me what I thought. I was more honest than I'd ever been. “I don't think Iran understands the global context. It is a country of 80 million negotiating and taking 20 days of the foreign minister of the most powerful country in the world,” I said, bluntly.
“I think Iran does understand this more than before,” they responded. “I think a few years ago they were really arrogant. But now they understand more. Even with the speeches you can see they've changed a lot.”
“I get the feeling that people in power don't understand how the world works. Oil has helped them be unrealistic about their own successes,” I wrote.
“Yea but to be honest people don't really like the oil money anymore because under the last president a lot of the money was stolen by the crooks in power. People now believe that the economy has to be built. They've seen that they are just a country in a larger world. You know, oil money is like inheritance money. Those that have it don't feel like they have to do much to earn income because they know the inheritance is coming. People here have gotten more active relative to before, but still just a little bit.” They messaged their thoughts to me over multiple lines.
The afternoon after the deal was announced, Rouhani gave a speech with a kind of “don't worry, we fooled them” tone. “They said Arak can stay, but no heavy water reactors. And that was unacceptable to us. And I can report that today we have negotiated the ability to keep heavy water reactors. About Fordow they said the name of Fordow is hard for us to hear, we don't even want it to continue. No centrifuges at Fordow. And now let me tell you in summary, that today, we will have 1000 centrifuges in Fordow.” Everything was presented in terms of all that wasn't conceded.
Rouhani was talking to people like my family, people who care less about global trends, people who are proud of Iran's independence, people who still believe in a religious government, people who are concerned about being seen as equals to the US. Do these people want a fully globalized Iran with global values? I'd say no. While they may have become more open to seeking the latest trends in music, clothes, and technology, especially after 2009, they still hold onto their religious beliefs. Those beliefs guide them and define the type of jobs and resources they have access to, the way they raise their children, and their loyalty to the government. Even though these allegiances have changed among my conservative relatives, a faction still remains devoted to the religious government for these reasons.
Do they plan on dropping their national pride? No, given Iran's influence in the region, it will be unlikely that they will ever believe that Iran needs to cower to the will of other states, regardless of its relatively small power. Iran will always try to punch a little above its weight. Do they have a slightly more subdued view of what Iran is capable of on its own? It seems like the answer is yes.
Given these perspectives, nothing about the implementation of the deal will be easy. The marginal humility is good in that it will ensure Iran will attempt to live by its promises, but the pride will make it such that there could be a game of chicken at each turn, with Iran trying to prevent its own humiliation at the hand of the US. The same sensitive and intelligent diplomacy that balanced these two aspects to achieve the deal will be needed in larger doses to sustain the deal over the next few years. As my cousin said at the end of our conversation, “I hope both sides keep their promises.”

Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange said they expected to cut costs by €450m (£354m) a year as they sought to press on with their agreed £20bn deal and ward off a potential rival bid from the US.
The exchanges set out the terms and benefits of what they described as a merger of equals. As expected, Deutsche Börse shareholders will own 54.4% of the new company with LSE shareholders owning the remainder.
After the potential deal was announced last month, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, revealed it was considering making a rival offer for LSE. ICE was reported to have hired investment bankers to advise on a potential deal and Chicago's CME Group was also said to be watching events with a view to making a bid.
Carsten Kengeter, Deutsche Börse's chief executive, said: “ICE caused some speculation and have confirmed that they have a certain interest in LSE but that is all they did. What we have here is an agreed merger of equals. This is what we are doing and we are not going to be diverted by anything or anybody else.”
The planned deal is the third time Deutsche Börse and LSE have tried to merge. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden's OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, which was then rejected anyway. The LSE then rejected a formal £1.3bn offer from Deutsche Börse in January 2005.
Deutsche Börse and LSE said the €450m of cuts would equal 20% of their combined operating costs and would take three years to achieve. They said detailed plans had not been drawn and that the impact on employees could not be calculated yet. There will also be revenue gains from selling more services to customers and European companies will benefit from greater access to capital funding, they said.
John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said the planned cost cuts appeared meagre and left room for a rival bidder to offer more to LSE shareholders.
“'Mergers of equals' usually result in a lack of clarity in direction and leadership as both camps jockey for influence. A result is a confused structure and a failure to drive cost savings opportunities arising from the merger.
“The most likely intervention will come from the US network of exchanges and clearing houses, Intercontinental Exchange, led by founder and president Jeffrey Sprecher. The current approach of the LSE and Deutsche Börse may not be aggressive enough to see off Sprecher's unwanted attention.”
Under UK takeover rules, Deutsche Börse cannot ask LSE for a break fee if the deal fails, leaving greater room for a rival offer. Fees are sometimes payable by a company if it withdraws a bid but the merger structure of the deal means no such “reverse break fee” is possible.

The deal is going forward under the shadow of the British referendum on EU membership on 23 June. Kengeter said a vote for Britain to leave the union could affect some transaction volumes but that “the overall proposition is not endangered at all”.
Xavier Rolet, LSE's chief executive, said: “This is not conditional on the outcome of the referendum. We simply do not know [and] we will simply have to take a look. No one knows, if the outcome was an exit, what the consequences would be.”
The Frankfurt-based exchange will buy LSE through a new company called UK TopCo, which will pay tax in the UK but will be listed in London and Frankfurt. Deutsche Börse and LSE will be subsidiaries of the new company, which will combine LSE's share trading operations with Deutsche Börse's strong derivatives dealing business.
With concerns in the UK and Germany about their national exchange being subsumed by that of the other country, Kengeter said bosses had not yet decided on what the new company would be called. “Unfortunately, no, we don't have a name yet. We will take it step by step. We need a name of course before completion but that is going to take a while so it's still early days.”
The LSE chairperson, Donald Brydon, will chair the board and Kengeter will have the same job after the takeover. Rolet will step down but they will work as an adviser to the chairperson and deputy chairperson, Deutsche Börse's Joachim Faber, for up to a year.
Brydon said the board had not decided how much Rolet, who was paid £6.4m for 2014, would receive as a pay-off or for their advisory role.

The Tea Party movement has surged ahead of both the Democratic and Republican parties in the polls, with 41 percent of respondents in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal survey giving the mostly conservative, limited-government activists a favorable rating. Democrats got a positive rating from just 35 percent, and Republicans from 28 percent of those polled. Will the tea partiers be an electoral force in the 2010 midterm elections? If so, will they hurt Democrats, or help them by splintering the conservative vote? (Watch a Fox report about the Tea Party's popularity)
This is one more nail in the Democrats' coffin: So much for the "great Democratic alignment" signaled by their sweep in the 2008 elections, says Allahpundit in Hot Air. This is, to some extent, "ironclad proof of a surge in fiscally conservative populism across the nation"—and of the power of Fox News' "pro–tea party megaphone." Clearly, Democrats are going to pay dearly for pushing the costly and divisive Obamacare.
"Waterloo: Obama approval at 47 in new NBC poll, tea party more popular than Dems or GOP"
The poll is utterly meaningless: "This just seems dumb," says Eric Boehlert in Media Matters. The Tea Party doesn't exist—it's a "faceless movement" with no candidates or platform, "so people can pretend it's whatever they want it to be. It's an utterly pointless polling exercise because people have an ingrained idea of whom the Democrats are and what they stand for politically."
"Why are NBC/WSJ polling about a political party that doesn't exist?"
It's dangerous to shrug off the numbers: What these favorability ratings mean, says Johanna Neuman in the Los Angeles Times, is that if the Tea Party movement were a political party, "it would be at the top of the food chain." With President Obama's poll numbers dropping, this might worry Democrats, but the interesting thing is that "grass-roots anger at the Democrats" seems to be hurting the Republicans just as much.
"Tea party outpolls Democratic, Republican parties -- will anger fuel 2010 elections?"

The debate over what happens after the Dalai Lama dies is heating up again after Their Holiness made a controversial visit to an Indian border town of great spiritual and political significance this week.
As early as 1969, I had said the Tibetan people will decide if this very institution of Dalai Lama should continue or not. If this institution is no longer relevant, it should stop.
They say the next Dalai Lama or an even higher Lama… the China government will find the next one. That is nonsense. Let the China government first say they believe in rebirth and find the reincarnation of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.
The Dalai Lama made these comments at Tawang, a town in northern India less than 50km south of the McMahon Line which separates India and Tibet — though China still claims Tawang as its own. The Tibetan town was the 14th Dalai Lama's first stop after fleeing Lhasa in 1959, and was also the home of the 6th Dalai Lama. Locals are hoping that it will eventually become the birthplace of the 15th Dalai Lama as well.
“We pray Their Holiness lives for a thousand years but when the time comes we want them to reincarnate here,” a senior monk said. “The 6th Dalai Lama had made some predictions too about it.”
Many believe that the Dalai Lama is sending a message to China with their trip to Tawang, showing Beijing that their next reincarnation could be born outside of its control, something that is sure to get under the Chinese government's skin. Prior to the Dalai Lama's visit, China made its opposition known to the Indian government.
Despite being a non-religious state, China has claimed that it has a role to play in the reincarnation process of the leaders of Tibetan Buddhism, choosing its own Panchen Lama in 1995 and spiriting away the boy chosen by the Dalai Lama. As Wang Dehua, co-director for South Asia Studies at Tongji Univeristy told PTI:
The government of the People's Republic of China has proclaimed the power to approve the naming of “high” reincarnations in Tibet, based on a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty.
In my opinion it's ridiculous for the Dalai Lama to say they changed the centuries-old tradition, because the tradition was already changed in 1959. The central government will definitely support the Dalai Lama's successor if they or they are selected according to Chinese laws and historical rules, and the Tibetan people's will.
Still, the Dalai Lama continues to enrage Beijing and worry their followers by saying nothing definite about their reincarnation — continuing to doubt if it will even happen.
“Ladakh wants me to reincarnate in Ladakh. China wants me to reincarnate in China, European countries want me there. One soul… how to divide it?” the 81-year-old spiritual leader laughed. “At the time of my death, some indication may come, at the moment, no indication. At the moment, I have no destination.”
Heck, at the moment, they are not even sure about what sex they will be reincarnated as if it happens. When asked if their successor could be a woman, they responded: “That might also happen.”
Last month, HBO's John Oliver confronted Their Holiness over their vagueness about their own reincarnation, worrying that the Chinese government could take advantage of their ambiguity by choosing its own Dalai Lama.
“That's also, one of the foolish acts. Short-sighted. Without using human brain properly, ” Their Holiness responded. “It's harmful. Our brain usually has the ability to create common sense. The Chinese hardliners, in their brains, that part of the brain is missing.”
HOUSTON -- Former welterweight titlist Joshua Clottey pounded out a near-shutout decision against journeyman Jorge Silva in a junior middleweight bout on Saturday night on the undercard of the Canelo Alvarez-James Kirkland junior middleweight fight at Minute Maid Park.
Two judges scored the bout a shutout, 100-90, and one judge gave Silva two rounds for a score of 98-92.
Clottey put in solid work as they let their hands go and could barely miss with their right hand. They also backed up Silva with body shots throughout the fight.
An accidental head butt seemed to shake up both fighters in the sixth round and a toe-to-toe exchange in the final round brought the crowd to life.
Clottey (39-4, 22 KOs), 37, who is from Ghana and based in New York, was supposed to face Alvarez in December in the first bout of Alvarez's HBO contract, but the fight was canceled when Alvarez pulled out due to a lingering ankle injury. They were put on the card because to partially make up for not getting the Alvarez fight as well as to be on standby to fill in in case Kirkland had fallen out for any reason.
"It was a good fight," Clottey said of their performance. "I took this fight (after the fight with Canelo didn't happen last year) because I needed to get in the ring fast."
Clottey beat Zab Judah to win a welterweight world title in 2008 and later gave up the belt in order to challenge Miguel Cotto for their welterweight title in 2009, coming away with a split decision loss. In their next fight in 2010, after a 10-month layoff, Clottey lost a lopsided decision to Manny Pacquiao, who had won the belt by knocking out Cotto, in which Clottey was roundly criticized for barely throwing any punches in an awful performance.
"The Pacquiao fight was not the end of me. Boxers make mistakes," Clottey said. "The people have to forgive you."
Clottey has fought four times since the Pacquiao debacle, including in April 2014 when they impressively outpointed former super middleweight titleholder Anthony Mundine in Mundine's native Australia to land the fight with Alvarez that was eventually called off. Silva (19-9-2, 15 KOs), 23, of Mexico, lost their sixth fight in a row and for the seventh time in their last eight bouts.
In some of the other bouts on the card:
• Featherweight Joseph Diaz (16-0, 10 KOs), a 2012 U.S. Olympian from South El Monte, California, rolled past Giovani Delgado (15-3, 9 KOs), of Mexico, winning a near-shutout decision in a fast-paced entertaining bout. Diaz, who won 100-90 on two scorecards and 99-91 on the other, did as they pleased, lashing Delgado with right hands and left hooks, but Delgado was game and never stopped coming forward trying to make something happen.
• Heavyweight Taishan Dong (4-0, 2 KOs), a 7-foot, 289-pounder from China, struggled to a majority decision win against Jamal Woods (6-19-3, 6 KOs), of Forrest City, Arizona, who took the fight on two days' notice. Taishan won 40-36, 39-37 on two scorecards and one judge had it 38-38. But Woods landed some wild right hands that seemed to bother Taishan.
• St. Louis welterweight junior welterweight prospect KeAndre Gibson (13-0-1, 5 KOs) rolled to a shutout eight-round decision against Mexico's Jorge Romero (24-9, 21 KOs). All three judges had the fight 80-71 for Gibson, who knocked Romero down with a right hand in the second round.
• Lightweight prospect Ryan Martin (13-0, 8 KOs), of Chattanooga, Tennessee, who is in the promotional stable of rap star Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, quickly disposed of Ivan Zavala (7-9-2, 3 KOs), of Mexico, knocking them out with a left hook the chin at 1 minute, 4 seconds of the first round. They beat the count but was in no condition to continue.
• In an all-Mexican fight, junior featherweight Rodrigo Guerrero (23-5-1, 16 KOs), who briefly held a junior bantamweight world title in late 2011 and early 2012, stopped Arturo Badillo (20-7, 18 KOs), who retired on their stool at the end of the seventh round.
• The scheduled 10-round co-feature pitting 23-year-old Los Angeles junior welterweight prospect Frankie Gomez (18-0, 13 KOs) and former lightweight and junior lightweight titleholder Humberto Soto (65-8-2, 35 KOs), 34, of Mexico, was canceled at the weigh-in on Friday because Gomez weighed in at 147½ pounds, 6½ more than the contract weight of 141. The contract limit was raised on Friday to 145 and they were still way over the limit.
Welterweight James Leija Jr., son of former world titleholder Jesse James Leija, who was also co-promoter of the card, had their professional debut against fellow San Antonio, Texas, fighter Eric Butler (0-5-1) canceled as well because Butler was overweight.
A United Nations committee has reprimanded Germany in strong language, saying that the country had violated an international anti-racism convention.
At issue are controversial statements made in 2009 by Thilo Sarrazin, a former finance senator for the city-state of Berlin, about Turks and Arabs, who they said sponged off the state and were incapable of integrating, among other things. But a complaint submitted to public prosecutors in Berlin was rejected on grounds that the comments were permissible under Germany's freedom of expression law. An appeal to the decision was rejected as well.
According to the UN's Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), however, this constituted a violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, because it failed to conduct an "effective investigation" into the matter.
"This is a historic decision," said the TBB Turkish Union, the cultural organization that submitted the case to the committee, in a statment on Thursday. "CERD has determined that Mr. Sarrazin's comments touch on a feeling of racist superiority or racial hatred and contain elements of incitement to racial discrimination."
Ultimatum
CERD also issued an ultimatum to Germany, giving the country 90 days to inform the committee of the measures it will take to address the committee's opinion. It also recommended that the country "review its policies and procedures in cases of alleged racial discrimination" and widely distribute this information to prosecutors and judicial bodies.
"The opinion paper from the committee is at the Justice Ministry and will be reviewed," the government told the Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, which broke the story on Thursday.
The offending statements were made in an interview with the culture and political magazine Lettre International in September 2009, in which Sarrazin, also a former board member at Germany's central bank, disparaged Muslim immigrants, alleging that they "constantly produce little girls in headscarves" and were part of an "underclass that does not take part in the normal economic cycle." They also said that "a large number of Arabs and Turks in (Berlin) ... have no productive function other than in the fruit and vegetable trade."
The UN committee concluded that such statements "contain ideas of racial superiority, denying respect as human beings and depicting generalized negative characteristics of the Turkish population, as well as incitement to racial discrimination."
In 2010, Sarrazin repeated their sentiments in their controversial, best-selling book "Germany Does Itself In," which sparked a major debate about Muslims in the country.
The TBB filed its complaint with CERD in July 2010, and the committee reached its decision on Feb. 26, publishing it on April 4.
In recent years there has been a rash of new religions erupt­ing on the community skin, a kind of social disease to which the seasoned Christian is immune, but which afflicts the well-intentioned but more impressionable young. The merchants of these new reli­gions, which can be better described as cults, achieve a measure of ephemeral success for which' they are indebted not so much to the validity of their ideology as to the modern tools with which some people could be persuaded to become stockholders of the Brooklyn Bridge. The power of the public relations counsel, sometimes known as press agent, is augmented by the far-reaching effects of the newspapers, radio, and the awesome television set, with which the Pied Piper of Hamlin could have recruited youngsters from Pole to Pole.
Christianity has lasted nearly two thousand years, during which numberless religions have come and gone, time enough to prove the truth of the word of Jesus Christ and the authen­ticity of Orthodox worship. But even the Son of God needed help to get Their message to the people, and for this They selected a group of public relations men known as the Disciples, who in turn enlisted the aid of Apostles, a sextet of whom are sing­led out annually in a single honor in their memory. They are the Saints Stachys, Amplias, Urbanus, Apelles, Narcissus, and Aristobulus. These six holy men, cited in the Bible in the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans (Ch. 16, vs 8 to 16), went out into the spiritually shadowed world of the Apostolic Era, a time in which the degree of literacy was such that had there been newspapers it would have availed them little, and when their only means of communication was the painstaking slow word of mouth. Unaided by the miracle of the modern media, and armed only with the miracles of the Lord, they trudged from person to person, group to group in an apostle tour de force that has echoed down the centuries and will reverberate for endless centuries to come.
St. Stachys was among the first seventy Apostles of Christ. Their total dedication to the Savior was evinced in their ceaseless efforts to gain a foothold for the New Faith. They were ordained the first Bishop of Byzantium, then an important culture center, eventually to become the city of Constantinople and spiritual center of the Byzantine Empire under the first Chris­tian Emperor, Constantine the Great. The man who presided at their ordination was no less than the Disciple of Christ, St. Andrew.
St. Apelles was an intellectual in an eminent degree and was highly respected by the mightySt. Paul. Their oratory was such that they are credited with having brought converts into the fold in numbers that warmed the hearts of the disciples and the small army of pious men whose sole aim in life was the crea­tion of an everlasting Christian Church.
Another man ordained bishop by st. Andrew was St. Amplias, the first Bishop of the ancient city of Odyssopolis, where they were to take a stand against paganism at the cost of their life. Martyred by their enemies, they are remembered as a minister of the Lord in the highest tradition.
St. Ourbanos was ordained by St. Andrew as the Bishop of all Macedonia, a region already rich in tradition and an area recognized throughout the civilized world for its literary and artistic contributions. St. Urbanus was more than equal to the task of converting Macedonians, who for centuries had a sophistication of ideas on faith that were not easily dislodged. Urbanus set a fine example in Macedonia but did not escape the avenging pagans. They were martyred for the cause of Christ.
The Narcissus of mythology saw their image in a pool and fell in love with himself, but there was a real Narcissus who became an Apostle and loved the Lord above all else. St. Narcissus is mentioned by Apostle Paul as the head of a great “Christian house­hold.” He, too, was ordained by St. Andrew as Bishop of Athens, then, as now, the most fabulous city in the world. But even their Athenian followers could not save them from the pagans who took their life.
St. Aristobulus was made Bishop of Brittany by St. Andrew. In this Christian outpost they served Christ for 20 years before finally being martyred.

The first-ever clinical study of smoked cannabis for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder took place in Phoenix this week, making medical-marijuana history.
Many more volunteers are needed, says the nonprofit medical-research group leading the study.
The California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), founded in 1986, is conducting the study with the help of a $2.16 million grant from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
Continue Reading
Over the next two years, the study will "evaluate the safety and efficacy of four different potencies of marijuana to manage symptoms of PTSD in 76 U.S. veterans," a MAPS news release states.
The first participant in the study used cannabis on Monday at a north Phoenix clinic.
Marcel Bonn-Miller of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine is the study's principal investigator. Dr. Sue Sisley, a local M.D. who was fired from the University of Arizona, is the co-investigator.
Half of the volunteers will take part in the study in Arizona, while the other half will be tested at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
Researchers believe the results of the study could lead to Federal Drug Administration approval of whole-plant marijuana as treatment for PTSD.

It took seven years and the overcoming of many obstacles to get to this step.
Sisley, who helped pioneer the project, was fired in 2014 after a conservative Republican lawmaker complained about their medical-cannabis advocacy.
Them interest in medical marijuana started early in their career. While working with veterans as a psychiatrist, they became convinced that anecdotal reports of marijuana relieving PTSD symptoms might have merit.
PTSD affects up to 20 percent of Iraq War veterans and about 15 percent of Vietnam War veterans, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
They and researchers at MAPS produced a 61-page scientific protocol to serve as a template for the research. Then, they began the arduous process of obtaining funding and federal approval.
Another big problem would be obtaining the weed for the study. The only marijuana that the federal government considers legal is grown on a 12-acre farm run by the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi.
In order to get that pot to the study, MAPS had to negotiate approval from U.S. Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
They also had to find the perfect location for the study. Sisley wanted it conducted at the University of Arizona, where they held a part-time job.
EXPAND Ray Stern
UA fired them in 2014 under pressure from Andy Biggs, the former State Senate president who's now an Arizona Congressman.
At the time, UA officials said they wanted to land the PTSD-marijuana study, but not if Sisley was involved.
Meanwhile, 110,000 vets signed an online petition supporting the Arizona doctor.
MAPS decided to stick with Sisley and look for a different location.
They started a company in 2015 called Scottsdale Research Institute, which currently rents space for the study at a empty warehouse.
In April, the DEA finally approved the study and cleared the path for the Mississippi marijuana to be tested on veterans.
The veterans will be tested on four kinds of marijuana. One is a placebo — a strain of marijuana that contains no THC, the plant's primary psychoactive chemical. Two strains will contain THC, at 6 and 12 percent. A fourth strain contains 6 percent cannabidiol, a constituent of marijuana believed to have medicinal value.
Volunteers smoke up to two joints' worth of marijuana every day from small pipes. Later, they'll self-administer marijuana at home on video.
Trial participants will use small pipes to smoke marijuana as needed for PTSD symptoms, MAPS says. MAPS
They won't know which strain they're getting — and neither will researchers, at first.
The study requires 17 clinic visits over 12 weeks and a six-month follow-up visit, plus drug screenings to determine the THC levels in the vets' bloodstreams.
"We're just so grateful to finally enroll patients," Sisley told New Times on Friday. "This has been our dream that started seven years ago, to study whole-plant cannabis in this most-deserving population of veterans ... The government thought they could stonewall us until we got tired or walked away. But we're committed to doing this."
They credited activist veterans for their efforts over the years in lobbying politicians and bureaucrats to allow the study.
Now that it's up and running, though, finding participants is the new challenge. It's not easy to find qualified people because of rigorous criteria that helps ensure scientifically valid results.
Only two veterans of the 38 needed for the Phoenix portion are formally enrolled. Another 10 are "on deck" for a final evaluation, Sisley said.
More than 300 veterans total have been "screened out" since the study began actively seeking volunteers earlier this year, they said.
The study requires people who have been diagnosed with PTSD, preferably those whose conditions have resisted traditional treatments. Light and "irregular" users of marijuana, or nonusers, are also preferred, they said, adding that "dependent," daily users are not eligible.
Sisley and others working on the study have been going out to American Legion or VFW halls to find their study subjects.
The one place with the most eligible PTSD users, the Phoenix VA Health Care System, won't allow any presentations or advertisements about the study, Sisley said.
The study's co-investigator, Dr. Sue Sisley, receives federally legal marijuana from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. MAPS
The local VA blocked Sisley in May from giving a talk about the study at the Phoenix VA hospital.
"It's really unconscionable, and really speaks to their lack of commitment to science," they said. "I'm just asking them to allow us to hang up fliers, or at most a simple lecture to their medical staff. None of that is allowable."
Paul Coupaud, spokesperson for the Phoenix VA, said the VA doesn't promote, and can't endorse, any outside research. Beyond that, the VA doesn't allow doctors to "promote, prescribe, or discuss marijuana with veterans," they said.
Would-be volunteers don't have to rush — they have plenty of time to sign up for the two-year program. Sisley estimates she'll need to screen more than 1,000 vets to round out the 38 for the Phoenix portion.
The state Department of Health Services added PTSD as a qualifying ailment to the state's program in 2014.
MAPS asks anyone interested in being a volunteer with the study in Phoenix to email arizona@marijuanasites.org. For the Baltimore location, call (410)550-0050.
Donald Trump is loud and boastful on camera, but sometimes they operate more quietly off screen, like when they needed to solve a sewage problem beneath the streets of Manhattan—a problem that mysteriously evaporated one day in 1994, allowing a flood of cash that saved Trump from drowning in debt.
This is a little-known aspect of how Trump bungled the chance to make billions of dollars building on the largest developable tract of land in America's largest city, a story the late actor Christopher Reeve called “the American dream gone berserk.”
Way back in 1974, when Trump was not yet 30 years old, they acquired control of the old Penn Central rail yards on Manhattan's Upper West Side. For a song, they had 57 acres of land along the Hudson River that ran 13 blocks from 59th Street to 72nd Street.
Years later, after enough machinations to fill a Tolstoy novel, Trump proposed high-density residential apartment buildings mixed with other uses, notably new television studios for NBC, a project they called Television City. They also proposed the world's tallest building, a 154-story skyscraper that would have cast long shadows over Central Park and much of the Upper West Side every sunny afternoon. That giant erection was what drew Superman's ire.
That was a little problem for Trump. Their big one was sewage.
As recently as 1986 most of the sewage generated in Manhattan flowed raw into the Hudson River, almost as if the city was the New Amsterdam of the 17th century with a few million more people emptying their chamber pots in the streets each morning. The city partially solved this problem by building a new sewage treatment plant. It was originally intended for the boat basin at 79th Street, but politically savvy and affluent Upper West Siders got their effluent pumped north to the Harlem waterfront, where the smell was godawful.
About 200 million gallons of sewage came in each day to the sewage treatment plan, well above its design capacity of around 170 million gallons per day. So on dry days, about 30 million gallons of raw sewage continued flowing into the Hudson River. Rainy days swelled the volume.
Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan borough president at the time, was adamant that no development would take place on the Trump property without proper sewage treatment for the estimated five million gallons per day their project was expected to generate.
Messinger wrote a 1992 letter to the city environmental commissioner saying a “host of experts” agreed with them that Trump's project should not get approved “unless there is sustainable, reliable, and certain commitment to mitigate the anticipated sewage flows” (PDF). Days later, Messinger testified that “there is no justification” for any claims that the existing sewage plant could handle the flushed toilets and other wastewater from 5,700 new apartments.
Messinger, the Coalition for a Livable Upper West Side, and others stood firm. No Trump project would proceed until sewage inflows matched treatment capacity.
Then something strange happened, something that would have gone unnoticed but for one Princeton-trained civil engineer checking the weekly city sewage flow reports.
The document showed 24 million gallons less sewage on the Upper West Side. Rich Herschlag, Messinger's chief borough engineer, thought it an inside-the-bureaucracy joke. It was, after all, April Fool's Day 1994.
When the next weekly report came Herschlag realized this was no joke.
Day after day, rain or shine, the official sewage flow meter readings stayed about the same. Holidays, big events that drew people into the city, weekends when people left town—none of that influenced the effluent flow.
“It was as if 150,000 Manhattanites just vanished,” Herschlag told me last week.
Either that or Upper West Siders all stopped flushing, showering, and washing the dishes. Just to be sure, I checked the news clips. There were no stories about incredibly stinky New Yorkers riding the West Side subway lines as summer heat enveloped Manhattan in 1994.
Eventually the United States Attorney for Manhattan, Mary Jo White, launched an investigation into the missing sewage. Herschlag meanwhile got busy trying to figure out how the system was being manipulated, complaining that something foul must be going on and asking how much it would take to bribe someone to play games with the sewer meters and computer software that continuously tracked sewage flows.
About this time Messinger, hailed by many as a great liberal reformer and voice of integrity, decided to run for mayor. Herschlag got muzzled. They were told to stop carping about an insignificant issue that no one else cared about. Eventually Herschlag was forced out of their job, their final paycheck held up until they could be told that were they to consult with the Coalition for a Livable Upper West Side, which opposed the Trump project, they could be prosecuted for violating a city charter ethics rule.
That's when the best reporter in New York City, Wayne Barrett of the Village Voice, and one of their acolytes, Denise Kiernan, got on the story. On April 11, 1995, they published an article about “Ruth and Donald's Artful Deal” (PDF).
They exposed connections between Trump and various elected and appointed city officials that were as complex, and hidden, as the sewer lines running beneath city streets.
For example, a former city councilman from the West Side named Ed Wallace registered as a lobbyist for Trump Management. New York's Parks Council, which would have to approve a park for Trump's project to proceed, was packed with officials and spouses on the Trump payroll.
Messinger did a complete reversal, becoming an advocate for the Trump project that they had once so firmly opposed since there was no longer, or so it seemed, a problem of overloading the already overloaded sewage treatment plant with more wastewater. Indeed, they said in February 1995 that they had not called for preventing sewer hookups at the proposed Trump project.
Mary Jo White, the federal prosecutor who is now chair of the federal Securities & Exchange Commission, dropped their inquiry. They have never been willing to answer questions about what motivated their reversal, including whether any instruction flowed down to them from the Bill Clinton White House, which at the time Trump courted and publicly supported.
Herschlag went on to a fine career on their own. They eventually figured out how the sewer flow reports were manipulated to make 24 million gallons of filthy water a day seem to evaporate.
It may be the raw sewage was simply diverted into the Hudson River, but Herschlag believes another answer is highly likely. They learned that there are two independent sets of sewage flow data. One is from the collector pipes, the other at the entry to the treatment plant. Herschlag believes someone tampered with the plant intake meter, but neglected to fudge the collector-pipe meters so their numbers would match, either out of hubris—what are the odds someone would compare the two?—or laziness.
They later wrote a novel, The Interceptor, about “a sly real estate mogul with a $4 billion deal at stake, a ruthless candidate for mayor in a heated election year and a lone civil engineer who uncovers a secret that could rock the lives of seven million New Yorkers.” It sold about 45,000 copies, an amazing number for a thriller about sewers. You can still buy a copy, for a penny plus shipping.
The end of the story came in 1997 when Trump sold most of their interest in the land to Hong Kong investors. No one would have paid a penny if the land could not be developed because there was no place for it in a sewer system that was already full—showing once again how Trump speaks the truth when they talk about how a business person who delivers campaign cash and favors gets politicians to do what they want.
Since at least February, the Syrian government has been using Iranian-built drones to track and target Free Syrian Army rebels in their strongholds, including Homs and Hamah. Now some fresh commercial satellite imagery provides new details about the unmanned aerial vehicles' possible tactics and capabilities.
Based on the imagery, acquired by George Kaplan for their blog Open-Source Geo-Intelligence, the small unarmed, propeller-driven Mohajer 4 drone is apparently limited in range. The Mohajer 4 most likely relies on control signals radioed from its launch base, unlike some Western 'bots which can be controlled via satellite from facilities pretty much anywhere in the world. The Syrian UAV's ability to transmit video is probably equally constrained.
The first glimpse by outsiders of drones in Syria came in February, when someone uploaded a video to YouTube depicting what appeared to be a UAV flying over the rebel-controlled town of Kafr Batna. (The February video has been rehosted several times.) Later there was at least one more sighting of a UAV in the insurgent city Homs.
Damascus is not particularly known for operating UAVs. So there was speculation that the drone was U.S. or Israeli and being used to spy on the regime ahead of any possible intervention. But informed observers soon identified the Kafr Batna 'bot as an Iranian-built Mohajer 4, also known by its general term pahpad, which debuted in a 2010 Iranian naval exercise. "In addition to reconnaissance flight over the operation field, this kind of drone brings ease to battle command by transferring real-time data," Iranian Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh boasted at the time.
The Pentagon later copped to sending its own drones, most likely high-flying Global Hawks or stealthy Sentinels, over Syria to monitor the escalating civil war. Compared to the large, sophisticated American models, the Mohajer 4 is tiny (just 10 feet long), non-stealthy and likely limited in capability. Damascus does not possess a global satellite communications network, so its drones are likely controlled via line-of-sight radio. Assuming a 100-foot-tall radio antenna and a UAV flying at an altitude of 300 feet, the useful range of the Mohajer 4 is probably no more than 40 miles.
Indeed, Kaplan's latest GeoEye satellite imagery shows the Mohajer 4s operating from Shayrat, a jet base just 18 miles from Hamah. "This ... may suggest a shorter operational range for the pahpad than initially thought," Kaplan wrote.
Syria's rudimentary communications network also argues for a simple, point-to-point imagery transfer from drone to ground station. In other words, a Mohajer 4 drone probably beams back video directly, and solely, to the ground station from which the UAV is also launched and steered. Contrast this with U.S. drones, the biggest of which can beam imagery to many, distant locations simultaneously. Kaplan's images from Shayrat depict what is apparently the Mohajer 4s' control station, a shed-like facility with some kind of vehicle attached.
Damascus is not the only foreign government or group to benefit from Iran's homemade drone tech, plus whatever insight Tehran has gleaned from its captured U.S. Sentinel. Hezbollah has operated Iranian UAVs. Tehran is also helping Venezuela develop a basic drone. But Syria is different: Here Iran's UAVs are contributing to a brutal and bloody campaign of oppression.
Fortunately, the Mohajer 4s are about as rudimentary as military drones get these days.
I must confess, I am a shower shaver. I have been shaving in the shower for the last 15 years, and loving it. Despite what anyone may say or think, I believe a shower and a shave to be the perfect marriage.
The steam created and contained in the shower is exactly what the barber is trying to recreate when they lay a hot, steamed towel on your face. However, when the towel is removed, the sudden change in temperature causes the skin to brace slightly and tighten. A similar thing happens when you hop from the shower to the sink for your daily shave. In the shower, the conditions could not be more culminating for achieving a close shave, and the clean-up couldn't be any more effortless.
In this short article I will look at all the arguments against this practice and hopefully show you how weak they really are. I will also give you an inside peek at my shower shaving station set-up, which I have been tweaking and tricking out for the last 10 years. Hopefully, I may win a few converts by the end of this.
The Tools
Double-Sided Extendable Shaving Mirror (The magnified side is great when you have facial hair and need to pay close attention to detail.)
Corner Shower Rack – Find one or build one with multiple shelves and baskets
Soap, brushes, mug, scuttle, and whatever else you normally use for your daily shave.
A small travel size tube of toothpaste. I use this to polish my mirror with in order to prevent it from fogging up. You could also keep your toothbrush in the shower too and really kill some birds!
My Process
Upon turning on the shower and getting it up to temp, I fill both my scuttle and shaving mug (which holds the soap). I then plop my brush into one or the other.
Then I run the gamut of daily maintenance: Soaping up and shampooing (on days I shampoo). I chase the shampoo with conditioner and leave it in during the shave. I massage the excess conditioner into my moustache and face in preparation for the shave. This aids in softening the bristles even more.
Now we begin. I turn the shower to a warm, steady trickle and dump out the water from both the mug and scuttle. Now, I lightly squeeze out my brush (this depends on what soap I am using that day), and begin to load the brush. Next, I return the mug to its proper place on the shaving station and then pick up the scuttle in which I begin to whip up lather. [Lately I have been checking the temperature of the water in order to find out at what point on the thermometer it builds the most lather. I do this for science and the children of the future, I assure you it has nothing to do with OCD.]
Once lather is built I use the extendable shaving mirror mounted on the wall opposite my shower head and begin to apply the suds.
When my face is fully coated I return the scuttle to the corner rack and grab the razor I will be using that day. I hold the razor under the faucet and wet it thoroughly. In the winter months the razor has its own mug or bowl of hot water that it sits in until it's time to use. I then fully extend the mirror from the wall. Tip : Keep the mirror against the wall until you are ready to begin the physical act of shaving. This prevents the mirror from fogging up too fast.
After my first pass I push the mirror back up against the wall, return the brush to its mug or rack, grab the razor and begin to wet it slightly under the faucet. I grab the scuttle and start to rehydrate and build up the lather again. It's pretty much rinse and repeat after this.
When I am done shaving I turn the shower back on and rinse out my brush, mug, razor, scuttle, and the conditioner out of my hair and stache.
Shower Shaver Common Misconceptions and Simple Solutions
Wastes Water
Turn water to slow trickle or off during shave.
Mirror Fogs
Use an extendable, Double sided shaving mirror. Coat and polish w/ toothpaste to prevent fog up.
Purchase a fog free mirror.
Cannot Hear The Shave
Turn off the shower and notice how much louder the sound of the actual shave now is. The shower's natural acoustics function like an echo chamber, thus amplifying the sound of the shave. Win.
Razor Can Slip And Fall
I have over 30 different safety razors that I have used over the years, modern and vintage and never has a razor once slipped from my grip. Remember, similar unfounded fears keep many a man from ever trying out wet shaving.
Cannot Hear Radio
Really? Shower radios have come a long way over the years. You can find a waterproof radio that you can even attach your IPod or IPhone to.
Takes much longer
It actually takes much less time. Consider the set-up and clean-up time that is spent when you shave at the sink.
All in all, one can think of a million reasons (or maybe just six) why not to give shaving in the shower a try. I challenge any fella reading this right now to humor me and try it for a week. I would love to hear how it worked out and what you think. Happy Really Wet Shaving!
Note From Mantic59: Douglas has written a supplemental article on tricking out a shower shaving set-up on their site, HERE!
We're rounding out our series on high availability with a little discussion on the benefits of HA versus the inherent costs. If you've been keeping up with the previous articles you've probably gotten the impression that it's a lot of work and easy to get wrong; you'd be correct.
That said, HA definitely has its place, so it's worth arming yourself with the knowledge to assess when it's appropriate.
Costs
HA systems have obvious financial costs, but there's a lot more to it than just money. We'll talk about these first because we think it's important to have these in mind when you assess the benefits of going down the HA path.
The pattern you'll notice is that almost everything boils down to complexity. Complexity is your enemy when building reliable systems, but it's a necessary evil for HA.
Financial costs
Right off the bat you'll be paying more for your hosting. The exact costs depend on the complexity of your deployment, but we generally find you're looking at doubling or tripling your costs. In the simplest case you'll be moving from a single server to a pair of servers. A website will probably need to make use of a load balancer, which is an extra expense.
A highly available solution also takes extra time to setup, which can be a substantial cost for a large deployment.
Time
HA systems tend not to be as agile as their Ordinary Availability brethren. Changes need to be carefully considered, and necessarily take longer if there are more systems to deal with.
As an example, consider a disk upgrade for a database server. On a non-HA server this can be done easily (and without downtime) if LVM is used and drives can be hot-added. A DRBD cluster will require the same steps, then a manual online extension and resync of the DRBD volume. It's not terribly difficult, but it's not simple enough to put into a script that can be blindly run in a matter of seconds.
Maintenance expertise
HA systems are by no means maintenance-free, and many common operations need special attention when using HA. You need sysadmins available that are skilled in managing clusters safely, and this extends to out-of-hours periods as well in case something goes wrong.
Training and changes to internal processes
Anyone who regularly works on your website will have to modify their workflow to handle the HA deployment. This isn't too onerous if you're already using good development practices, but it requires a lot of discipline if you're used to rolling out changes in an ad-hoc manner. Use of automation tools, such as Capistrano and Fabric, is practically mandatory to ensure smooth running.
Benefits
The benefits of running a highly available environment are straightforward to describe, but actually quantifying them is another matter. This varies heavily on a case-by-case basis, so you'll need to figure out the numbers for yourself and see where things land.
Uptime
When done right, you can expect a substantial improvement in SLA terms for an HA system (though it is actually possible for an HA system to cause more downtime than it prevents, due to the added complexity).
It's important to know the limits of your system, and just what sort of failure you're trying to mitigate. In most cases you're protecting against the failure of a single server chassis. Even assuming 100% uptime from a cluster of servers, your datacentre probably only guarantees 99.982% for power feeds (a Tier-3 datacentre). These are worst-case figures though, and perfect uptime on a month-to-month basis is quite normal.
Time to recovery in the event of a failure
This is an easily overlooked benefit that's really more important than straight uptime. A single (non-HA) server is likely to give many years of reliable service without any problems, and many issues can be avoided by using redundant components such as hotswap power supplies and hard drives, ECC memory, etc. When the server eventually fails, there will be a significant interruption to services as the chassis is replaced and configured.
This is where a highly available system really shines. In the same way that RAID gives you safety net when a drive fails, an HA cluster will keep going when a server fails. There may be a brief interruption as services are migrated to a working node, but downtime is measured in seconds or minutes, instead of hours.
Maintenance flexibility
By virtue of the fact that HA clusters are designed to tolerate servers going offline, it's possible to perform most maintenance operations without downtime, unlike regular systems. This is especially convenient when it comes to hardware changes, as each server can be taken offline and upgraded or replaced at leisure.
We suspect that in many cases, the question is a financial one. It's an unenviable position to be in if you have to justify a lengthy outage by saying that lost sales or productivity is cheaper than having a highly available environment. That's ultimately what it boils down to though, and you'll need to find those hard numbers for yourself. We're always happy to advise on the technical side of things though. 🙂
This completes our series of articles on high availability, we hope you've found them engaging and enlightening. We wouldn't dare to presume that we've addressed everything, so if you've got any questions feel free to let us know.
Fancy yourself a master when it comes to high availability systems? We're hiring
Came home last night to this lovely zucchini and couscous dinner my wife made for us. She'd previously sliced the zucchini thin on a mandoline and frozen them. Turns out that zucchini reduction made from frozen zucchini is really good! It has sort of a soufflee-like texture, almost as if it's been battered and deep fried. Quite a surprise, but a nice one.
The fancy grocery store up the hill has started stocking unusual fruits. I managed to restrain myself last time I was up there and only bought the cherimoya and the pepino dulce. I'm such a sucker for that stuff. So far I've managed to resist the dragonfruit (since every time I've tried it fresh before it's been sort of bland and mealy) and the starfruit (I love starfruit; I think it tastes like a flower shop smells) and the passion fruit and the rambutan, but it's probably only a matter of time.

HONG KONG — Government and Communist Party officials in China have been pounding down so much Moutai grain alcohol — the good stuff, the expensive stuff, not the everyday rotgut — that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao recently proposed slashing the state budget for it. It was a thoroughly shocking idea, like kicking lobbyists out of the halls of Congress or banning train strikes in France.
The Chinese government has been fueled for decades by Moutai, a brand of clear, powerful, sorghum-based liquor. In 1935, hunkered down in the mountains, Mao Zedong and their Long March guerrilla comrades used it to clean their war wounds and calm their nerves. In 1949, the new People's Republic declared Moutai to be China's “national wine.” In 1972, President Richard Nixon got glassy-eyed from Moutai toasts at a state banquet, ignoring fervent pleas from their aides to avoid the ceremonial toasts.
Moutai has long been the gift of choice for government and party bosses, and the bribe of choice for unscrupulous business executives. Among luxury brands now favored by mainland millionaires, Moutai is the only Chinese brand in the top 10 — ranked No. 5 after Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Hermès and Chanel. A poll by the Hurun Report found that Moutai carries more prestige than Apple, Rolex and Armani.
Moutai is merely the most popular brand in the baijiu family of China's grain-based alcohols. Sales have reportedly been falling across the board recently — perhaps due to astronomical price increases and widespread, spot-on counterfeiting — although one brand, Xi Jiu, has been faring quite well. The rise and promise of Xi Jiu was spotted by Bill Bishop of the perceptive Sinocism blog:
Xi Jiu historically has been a mid-tier baijiu brand, but 2012 may turn out to be Xi Jiu's year. Xi Jiu has two things going for it, in addition to having a name that is a homonym for 喜酒, or “wedding banquet liquor.” One, it may be more acceptable for bureaucrats to imbibe, if Wen's crackdown is real. Two, and more important, the character for the “Xi” in “Xi Jiu” is the same character 习 as the surname of Xi Jinping 习近平, China's presumed next leader.
Mr. Xi visited the White House in February, effectively presenting their credentials as the next head of the Communist Party.
Mr. Bishop said a friend told them the company was planning a heavy marketing campaign for Xi Jiu “to capitalize on the ascension of Xi Jinping. Part of the marketing pitch was that Chinese gift-givers and their official recipients would be clamoring for Xi Jiu by the 18th Party Congress in late 2012.”
Online traffic in China, according to Want China Times, has been speculating that “officials who want to climb the political ladder will drink Xijiu as a sign of their loyalty to Xi Jinping. They may even send Xijiu as a gift representing modernity and luck.”
Xi Jiu, also written as xijiu, is owned by a subsidiary of Kweichow Moutai Distillery, the maker of Moutai and the country's biggest manufacturer.
A state-controlled enterprise, Kweichow is based in the town of Maotai, in Guizhou Province in southwestern China. In a recent filing the company said net profit rose in 2011 by more than 73 percent. A dividend in March was the largest ever in the history of the Shanghai stock exchange.
Baijiu, literally “white spirits,” remains hugely popular in China, with nearly 2 billion gallons consumed last year. And that's just the official tally.
“Counterfeiters have grown so sophisticated at producing labels that they can even reproduce imprinted markings,” according to Asia Sentinel, which noted that knockoffs “can be produced by anybody with a still.”
The Kweichow distillery offers this online guide to detecting counterfeit bottles of its brand. The company uses holographic watermarks as one deterrent.
Andrew Jacobs of The Times reported from Maotai last year after retail prices for moutai inside China had approached $200 a bottle, a doubling in price in just two years. (The town of Moutai, making a hat tip to the Chairman, changed its name to Maotai after the revolution.)
“Chinese drinkers erupted in outrage, accusing the state-owned distillery of discarding its revolutionary roots to gouge the little guy,” Mr. Jacobs wrote. “It did not help when media reports revealed that the same bottle sold for half that much in the United States and Europe.
“I hear most of it gets delivered to Zhongnanhai,'' said Wang Yonghui, 32, a bank teller and baijiu aficionado, referring to the Beijing compound that houses the country's top leaders. ‘'We pay more, and they get it for free.”
The Chinese news magazine Caixin reports that cases of ultra-premium Moutai are routinely set aside at the Kweichow factory, reserved for the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the navy's North Sea Fleet, the telecom giant China Mobile and other well-placed tipplers.
For all of baijiu's popularity in China — it compares to shochu in Japan and soju in South Korea — it is clearly not for everybody. Here's how it's described on 300 Shots of Greatness, a blog dedicated to the glories and understanding of alcohol:
The vileness of baijiu to the Western palate has the unfortunate side effect of alienating foreigners from their Chinese counterparts. Though in recent years a few of our drinks — most notably beer, whiskey and grape wines — have made significant inroads with China's (mostly male) drinkers, baijiu remains the hands down favorite. If you want to drink with the Chinese, you have to suffer baijiu . . . or learn to like it.
If there's little documentary evidence that Nixon liked their Moutai back in 1972, it clearly seemed to lubricate the sticky diplomacy of the era. Their trip, of course, was a huge success.
And when Deng Xiaoping visited the United States two years later, Henry Kissinger told him, “I think if we drink enough Moutai we can solve anything.”
Ever want to parse STL files, but couldn't find a fast library to read both ASCII and Binary STL files? Or you have STL files, but you want to convert it to an image, so you don't have to load a 3D model on your webpage?
Today, we're happy to announce Cubehero's first open source library, stljs, a fast library for reading, writing, and rendering STL files. In the last post, we wrote about how to convert and render STL to images manually, but now, you can have stljs to do it for you.
The library allows you to read both binary and ascii STL files. It currently only writes to ascii files (but that will be added later). It is currently only for node.js, but eventually, it should be available for the browser.
The methods to read the STL files also have a progress callback, so you can process the polygons as they're being read.
stljs = require('stljs') stljs.readFile('teapot.stl' , (err, solid, name) -> # finished parsing can now do stuff with solid , (err, polygon, name) -> # gets called on as each polygon is parsed )
But in addition, you can render STL files as PNG images, but the method depends on pov-ray being installed on your system. Then, you will be able to convert it like so:
stljs = require('stljs') stljs.imageify('teapot.stl', { width: 200, height: 100, dst: 'teapot.png' } , (err, povOutput, name) -> # done with converting the image , (err, povPolygon, name) -> # called on each polygon is processed )
If you have contributions, feel free to fork and send pull requests. Enjoy!

We're in the top ten for the UK
Warwick uni has soared into the top 50 universities in the world in this year's QS World Rankings.
Our meteoric rise means we are now in the top ten best unis in the UK.
Globally, we've pulled ahead of other globally renowned institutions, including the likes of Amsterdam (55), New York (53), and Brown (49).
Topping the list this year is MIT, followed by Harvard. These American unis are closely followed by a string of British unis with four placing in the top 10. Cambridge are joint 3rd with Stanford, while Oxford, UCL and Imperial take up 6th, 7th and 8th respectively.
Back at Warwick, the best-performing subjects include English Language & Literature (22nd), History (15th), Business & Management Studies (26th), Economics & Econometrics (29th) and Sociology (23rd).
Our nearest and dearest rivals Coventry failed to earn a position on the list.
The news of the rise up the table has been well received by Warwick, especially as we had dropped six places in 2013.
Commenting on the success, the University of Warwick's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sir Nigel Thrift, said: “As we continue to celebrate our 50th anniversary the QS ranking is a fitting tribute to the work of Warwick staff and students that has underpinned our success.”
Coventry is yet to comment.
McCutcheon invalidated something very specific—the limit on the total amount a person can give to all federal candidates during a two-year election cycle—but Roberts didn't stop there. Time and again they kept singling out blatant quid pro quo arrangements as the onlything Congress could regulate. Not so with meager attempts to "prevent corruption" or curbing "the appearance of mere influence and access." Those things aren't as big a deal under the Constitution. Only tit-for-tat corruption is.
Compare that to the other case the protesters targeted, 2010's Citizens United, a ruling as grand as it was shocking for the dearth of evidence on which it rested: "We now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption." The court went on: "The appearance of influence or access ... will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democratic order."
But it turns out corruption, appearances, and influence-peddling are all at the crux of federal charges against New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez. They were indicted Wednesday on several counts of bribery and other offenses, stemming from an allegedly cozy relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist and longtime friend who is accused of giving lavish gifts to the senator. These included a trip to a luxury hotel in Paris, a stay at an upscale villa in the Dominican Republic, contributions to a legal-defense fund, and more than $1 million in donations to various political action groups supporting Democratic candidates—all in exchange for political favors for Melgen, their business interests, and their numerous girlfriends.
Whether these salacious allegations stick or lead to some kind of plea deal will soon be decided; Menendez pled "not guilty" on all charges Thursday. But a sizeable contribution listed in the indictment calls into question the Supreme Court's extreme faith that large sums of money not directly given to a candidate fail to amount to corruption.
According to prosecutors, Melgen, through their own company, contributed $600,000 to a political action committee aimed at helping Democrats retain control of the Senate. That's all well and good under Citizens United,except Melgen allegedly earmarked the money so it went directly to the Menendez re-election campaign. That's also kosher under campaign regulations, except the indictment alleges Menendez "sought and received" the donation—comprised of two checks for $300,000 each, sent to the super PAC in exchange for Menendez's assistance in resolving a Medicare-related dispute. Interestingly, the indictment notes that Melgen cut one of the checks on the same day they attended an annual fundraiser Menendez hosted.
The team behind this year's medical marijuana amendment has released an 11-page “intent” memo for voters to “understand the purposes” of the initiative.
“Voters should vote for an amendment fully understanding the intent of the drafters,” said the document, obtained by FloridaPolitics.com on Monday. “Fostering voter understanding is the central purpose of this memo, and we do so by expressing the intent of the individuals who drafted the language.”
The proposed change, which will be Amendment 2 on the November general election ballot, seeks to create a state constitutional right to medical cannabis in Florida. An internal poll recently showed 74 percent support; amendments need 60 percent approval to pass.
In 2014, a similar amendment fell two points short of adoption, despite many polls showing it would pass in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections. Law enforcement groups, many in the drug treatment community, and several legislative leaders continue to oppose the initiative.
Generally, the 2016 amendment will allow people with debilitating medical conditions, as determined by a licensed Florida physician, to use medical marijuana. The amendment defines a debilitating condition as cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among others.
The memo was written by main amendment supporter and trial lawyer John Morgan, Dean Emeritus of the University of Florida law school Jon Mills, Drug Policy Alliance legal director Tamar Todd and Amendment 2 campaign director Ben Pollara.
The format of the memo is annotative, further explaining the proposed language, including “the limitations of this amendment.”
For instance, the analysis says the amendment “does not affect the current statutory prohibition on the operation of a vehicle, aircraft, train, or boat while under the influence of marijuana. The Legislature may pass additional laws regarding operating motor vehicles under the influence” of medicinal marijuana.
It “does not change federal law, under which marijuana is currently prohibited, but which the Justice Department has stated it does not intend to devote resources to prosecute marijuana use complying with state medical marijuana states in most cases.”
The amendment “does not require that the smoking of medical marijuana be allowed in public, … in schools, corrections institutions, detention facilities, and places of employment.”
The memo says “no insurance provider or government agency will be required to pay for expenses related to the use of medical marijuana,” and a “doctor remains potentially liable for other ethics violations or malpractice committed while treating a qualifying patient.”
“This Amendment does not require or need any legislative implementation to take effect,” the document says. “However, the Legislature may pass laws that further the intent and purposes of this amendment, and the Legislature may pass laws that otherwise expand access to marijuana. The Legislature may not pass laws that would be contrary to the purpose or nullify this Amendment.”
Cyrus Day People gathering around the Tomb of Cyrus on 29 October 2015 Status Unofficial Genre Commemoration Date(s) 7th day of Aban Frequency Annually Venue Tomb of Cyrus Location(s) Pasargadae Coordinates Country Iran Years active Early 2000s–present Most recent 29 October 2017 Previous event 28 October 2016 Activity Gathering
Cyrus the Great Day (Persian: روز کوروش بزرگ‎, translit. ruz-e kuroš-e bozorg) is an unofficial holiday in Iran that takes place on 7th of Aban, the eighth month on the Iranian calendar – usually occurring on 29 October on the Gregorian calendar – to commemorate Cyrus the Great.
The most prominent event of the day is gathering in the tomb of Cyrus, located in Pasargadae.
History of observance [ edit ]
Cyrus the Great Day is an invented tradition introduced in the early 2000s,[1] on the internet and social networking websites.[2] Based on some historical records, 29 October was the day when Cyrus entered Babylon.[3]
The observance is unofficial, and is not designated on any official calendar, neither on the Iranian calendar nor on those of the UNESCO.[4] There has been calls for the Iranian government to recognize it as an official state ceremony.[1] In 2017, Bahram Parsaei, representative of Shiraz in the parliament voiced the demand.[5]
2016 gathering [ edit ]
Pasargadae on 28 October 2016
2016 Cyrus day occurred on 28 October (due to the overlap of leap years in the Iranian and Gregorian calendars) and fell on Friday (Iranian weekend).[3] Pasargadae attracted thousands of people from across the country who celebrated the day and chanted nationalist slogans.[1] Nomad people, tribesmen and ethnic minorities, including Kurds and Iranian Arabs were present in their traditional clothing.[1] The attendance was unprecedented according to spectators, and the roads leading to the tomb reportedly saw a 30/40-kilometer traffic jam.[3]
An unofficial estimation puts the attendance figure between 15,000 and 20,000.[6]
Political dimensions [ edit ]
During the gathering, some took advantage of the event to protest against the government. "No Gaza, no Lebanon, [we will only] sacrifice ourselves for Iran!", "Iran is our homeland; Cyrus is our father," and “Clerical rule is synonymous with only tyranny, only war,” and “Freedom of thought cannot take place with beards” were among the slogans in the amateur videos going viral on social media.[6][7]
According to Reuters, "a few marchers" shouted anti-Arab and pro-Shah slogans. A judiciary official said that the organizers of the event were arrested.[8]
2017 crackdown [ edit ]
In October 2017, an official statement by the local authorities of Cultural Heritage Organization in Fars Province was published and circulated on social media, declaring that Cyrus' tomb would be closed to the public from between 27 and 30 October 2017. However, the statement was denied after criticisms.[6]
All roads leading to Pasargad County were closed, due to what the authorities called "ongoing construction". Fences were erected around the mausoleum in Pasargadae and Basij militia were stationed in the region to hold a drill. Iranian Judiciary's mouthpiece wrote that the Ministry of Intelligence disrupted plans for the "illegal gathering".[9]
Thousands of women will die from unsafe abortions and millions will have unwanted pregnancies following US President Donald Trump's decision to ban US-funded groups from discussing abortion anywhere in the world, activists say.

Mr Trump reinstated the so-called global gag rule on Monday, affecting American non-governmental organisations working abroad, to signal their opposition to abortion, which is difficult to access legally in many developing countries due to restrictive laws, stigma and poverty.
Kenyan campaigner Rosemary Olale, who teaches teenage girls in Nairobi slums about reproductive health, said women would go back to getting unsafe abortions.
"You will increase the deaths."
Kenya has one of the world's highest abortion rates. Most abortions there are unsafe and are a leading cause of preventable injury and death among women, government data shows.
Globally, 21.6 million women have unsafe abortions each year, nine out of 10 of which take place in developing countries, according the World Health Organization (WHO).
The gag rule, formally known as the Mexico City Policy, prevents charities receiving US funding from performing or telling women about legal options for abortion, even if they use separate money for abortion services, counselling or referrals.
It will hit major reproductive health charities, such as International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International (MSI), as the United States is the world's largest bilateral family planning donor.
Unless it receives alternative funding to support its services, MSI estimates there will be 2.1 million unsafe abortions and 21,700 maternal deaths during Trump's first term that could have been prevented.
"Abortion is a fundamental right for women and also very necessary public health intervention," said Maaike van Min, MSI's London-based strategy director.
MSI has been receiving $30 million per year in US Agency for International Development funding to provide 1.5 million women in more than a dozen countries with family planning services.

It will have to cut those services unless it finds other donors, the charity said.
"Women won't be able to finish their education [or] pursue the career that they might have, because they don't have control over their fertility," Ms van Min said.
"Aid is under pressure everywhere in the world and so finding donors who have the ability to fund this gap is going to be challenging."
Women in remote areas without government services will suffer most, Ms van Min said, highlighting mothers in Nigeria and Madagascar where MSI has large programmes.
"If they don't now control their fertility, they are at high risk for maternal mortality," they said.
"I remember this lady who had had too many pregnancies and they came up to me ... in this village and they were like: 'Can you make it stop?'"
Evelyne Opondo, the Africa director for the Centre for Reproductive Rights advocacy group, said other important health services were also likely to be cut.
They recalled the large number of facilities that closed down in Kenya after President George W. Bush came to power in 2001 and reinstated the gag rule.
"They refused to adhere to the global gag rule so they lost quite a substantial amount of funding," they said.
"They were also forced to drastically reduce other services that they were providing, including for survivors of sexual violence [and] for HIV."
Abortion rates across sub-Saharan Africa increased during the Bush administration, according to a WHO study.
"It's really unfortunate that the lives and the health of so many women are subject to the whims of American politics," Opondo said.
"This is really unethical, if not inhuman."

Image caption Many household purchases in South Korea are linked to certificates of deposit
A South Korea financial regulator has started an investigation into alleged interest rate rigging by some of the country's banks.
The Fair Trade Commission is looking at possible collusion over setting certificates of deposit (CD), used as a benchmark to set lending rates.
Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, and Hana are the banks being investigated.
It follows the Libor-rigging scandal involving Barclays and possibly several other banks.
Brokerage firms, which report CD rates twice a day, are also under suspicion. A CD is a way of saving with a fixed interest rate and maturity sold by banks and circulated in the secondary market by brokerages.
Financial firms benefit from a high CD rates as many household loans are linked to them. They are frequently used to help South Korean's buy homes.
As with the manipulation of the Libor inter-bank rate in the UK, the possible rigging of CD can help flatter companies' financial health.
Fine threat
The indebtedness of South Koreans has become a particular worry to the authorities as the economy slows.
In June, ratings agency Moody's said household loans had grown "at an alarming rate" and were vulnerable to financial shocks arising from the global economic downturn.
"If the investigation finds collusion, there will be significant fines. Even if there was no collusion, it's highly likely that the government's motive behind the investigation is to lower household lending rates by inducing a fall in CD rates," said Taurus Investment analyst Andy Lee said in a research report.
Shares in all four banks being investigated fell by more than 2%, with Hana down 2.7%. The banks confirmed they were under suspicion, but declined to comment further.
The investigation comes after a series of scandals to hit the banking industry, including a £290m fine for Barclays over Libor-fixing, severe criticism of HSBC over money laundering, and surprise losses at JP Morgan which have triggered a US federal inquiry.
The Reuters news agency reported that there were no indications that any foreign-based financial firms had been implicated in the South Korean investigation.

In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Act), Congress vacated the Department's 2011 regulations that barred tip pooling when employers do not claim a tip credit under section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Statements in this document to the contrary are no longer WHD policy. The Act did not impact WHD's enforcement when an employer claims a tip credit. For further information, see FAB 2018-3. For current guidance on dual jobs and related duties under Section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, see FAB 2019-2.

Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
This fact sheet provides general information concerning the application of the FLSA to employees who receive tips.
Characteristics
Tipped employees are those who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 per month in tips. Tips are the property of the employee. The employer is prohibited from using an employee's tips for any reason other than as a credit against its minimum wage obligation to the employee (“tip credit”) or in furtherance of a valid tip pool. Only tips actually received by the employee may be counted in determining whether the employee is a tipped employee and in applying the tip credit.
Tip Credit : Section 3(m) of the FLSA permits an employer to take a tip credit toward its minimum wage obligation for tipped employees equal to the difference between the required cash wage (which must be at least $2.13) and the federal minimum wage. Thus, the maximum tip credit that an employer can currently claim under the FLSA section 3(m) is $5.12 per hour (the minimum wage of $7.25 minus the minimum required cash wage of $2.13). Under certain circumstances, an employer may be able to claim an additional overtime tip credit against its overtime obligations.
Tip Pool : The requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips, such as waiters, waiteres, bellhops, counter personnel (who serve customers), bussers, and service bartenders. A valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors.
Requirements
The employer must provide the following information to a tipped employee before the employer may use the FLSA 3(m) tip credit:
1) the amount of cash wage the employer is paying a tipped employee, which must be at least $2.13 per hour;
2) the additional amount claimed by the employer as a tip credit, which cannot exceed $5.12 (the difference between the minimum required cash wage of $2.13 and the current minimum wage of $7.25);
3) that the tip credit claimed by the employer cannot exceed the amount of tips actually received by the tipped employee;
4) that all tips received by the tipped employee are to be retained by the employee except for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and regularly receive tips; and
5) that the tip credit will not apply to any tipped employee unless the employee has been informed of these tip credit provisions.
The employer may provide oral or written notice to its tipped employees informing them of items 1-5 above. An employer who fails to provide the required information cannot use the section 3(m) tip credit and therefore must pay the tipped employee at least $7.25 per hour in wages and allow the tipped employee to keep all tips received.
Employers electing to use the tip credit provision must be able to show that tipped employees receive at least the minimum wage when direct (or cash) wages and the tip credit amount are combined. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct (or cash) wages of at least $2.13 per hour do not equal the minimum hourly wage of $7.25 per hour, the employer must make up the difference.
Retention of Tips : A tip is the sole property of the tipped employee regardless of whether the employer takes a tip credit. [1] The FLSA prohibits any arrangement between the employer and the tipped employee whereby any part of the tip received becomes the property of the employer. For example, even where a tipped employee receives at least $7.25 per hour in wages directly from the employer, the employee may not be required to turn over their or their tips to the employer.
Tip Pooling : As noted above, the requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips. The FLSA does not impose a maximum contribution amount or percentage on valid mandatory tip pools. The employer, however, must notify tipped employees of any required tip pool contribution amount, may only take a tip credit for the amount of tips each tipped employee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employees' tips for any other purpose.
Dual Jobs : When an employee is employed by one employer in both a tipped and a non-tipped occupation, such as an employee employed both as a maintenance person and a waitperson, the tip credit is available only for the hours spent by the employee in the tipped occupation. The FLSA permits an employer to take the tip credit for some time that the tipped employee spends in duties related to the tipped occupation, even though such duties are not by themselves directed toward producing tips. For example, a waitperson who spends some time cleaning and setting tables, making coffee, and occasionally washing dishes or glasses is considered to be engaged in a tipped occupation even though these duties are not tip producing. However, where a tipped employee spends a substantial amount of time (in excess of 20 percent in the workweek) performing related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in such duties. .
Service Charges : A compulsory charge for service, for example, 15 percent of the bill, is not a tip. Such charges are part of the employer's gross receipts. Sums distributed to employees from service charges cannot be counted as tips received, but may be used to satisfy the employer's minimum wage and overtime obligations under the FLSA. If an employee receives tips in addition to the compulsory service charge, those tips may be considered in determining whether the employee is a tipped employee and in the application of the tip credit.
Credit Cards : Where tips are charged on a credit card and the employer must pay the credit card company a percentage on each sale, the employer may pay the employee the tip, less that percentage. For example, where a credit card company charges an employer 3 percent on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the tipped employee 97 percent of the tips without violating the FLSA. However, this charge on the tip may not reduce the employee's wage below the required minimum wage. The amount due the employee must be paid no later than the regular pay day and may not be held while the employer is awaiting reimbursement from the credit card company.
Youth Minimum Wage: The 1996 Amendments to the FLSA allow employers to pay a youth minimum wage of not less than $4.25 per hour to employees who are under 20 years of age during the first 90 consecutive calendar days after initial employment by their employer. The law contains certain protections for employees that prohibit employers from displacing any employee in order to hire someone at the youth minimum wage.
Typical Problems
Minimum Wage Problems :
Where an employee does not receive sufficient tips to make up the difference between the direct (or cash) wage payment (which must be at least $2.13 per hour) and the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference.
Where an employee receives tips only and is paid no cash wage, the full minimum wage is owed.
Where deductions for walk-outs, breakage, or cash register shortages reduce the employee's wages below the minimum wage, such deductions are illegal. When an employer claims an FLSA 3(m) tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to have been paid only the minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a tipped occupation and the employer may not take deductions for walkouts, cash register shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any such deduction would reduce the tipped employee's wages below the minimum wage .
. Where a tipped employee is required to contribute to a tip pool that includes employees who do not customarily and regularly receive tips, the employee is owed the full $7.25 minimum wage and reimbursement of the amount of tips that were improperly utilized by the employer.
Overtime Problems :
Where the employer takes the tip credit, overtime is calculated on the full minimum wage, not the lower direct (or cash) wage payment. The employer may not take a larger FLSA 3(m) tip credit for an overtime hour than for a straight time hour. Under certain circumstances, an employer may be able to claim an additional overtime tip credit against its overtime obligations.
the lower direct (or cash) wage payment. The employer may not take a larger FLSA 3(m) tip credit for an overtime hour than for a straight time hour. Under certain circumstances, an employer may be able to claim an additional overtime tip credit against its overtime obligations. Where overtime is not paid based on the regular rate including all service charges, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration.
