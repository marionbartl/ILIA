By 19 May, all cases had recovered, with the disease reappearing on 4 July. By 10 August, all cases had again recovered.
Background
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.
The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.
Timeline
March 2020
On 24 March 2020, a 21-year-old male and a 57-year-old female who had arrived in the federation from New York City became the first two confirmed cases of COVID-19. Both are nationals of St Kitts and Nevis.
On 28 March 2020, St Kitts and Nevis recorded five additional cases of COVID-19 bringing the total number of confirmed cases to seven. "These cases involved three females and two males who are all citizens of St Kitts and Nevis. The females were aged 10 months, 24 years and 36 years, while the two male patients were 29 years and 39 years," Minister of State with responsibility for Health, Sen. the Hon Wendy Phipps said in a statement. She said all five of these cases are travel related "meaning that the cases were imported into the Federation". "This determination was made based on the patients' travel history to St Maarten and Antigua during the period March 6 to 13, 2020," the junior health minister said.
On 29 March 2020, St Kitts and Nevis recorded one additional case of COVID-19 bringing the total number of confirmed cases to eight. The Minister of State with responsibility for Health, Sen. the Hon Wendy Phipps disclosed that "The patient is a 51-year-old female who is citizen of St Kitts and Nevis and resident on Nevis".
On 31 March 2020, a full lockdown came into effect. From 19:00 31 March until 06:00 3 April, there was a 24-hour curfew.

April 2020
On 1 April 2020, a 9th case was reported. St Kitts and Nevis recorded one additional case of COVID-19 and brought the total number confirmed cases to nine. The patient was a citizen of St Kitts and Nevis and resident on Nevis," Sen Phipps informed the nation at a 3:p,m. update.(2nd on Nevis)
On 4 April 2020, St. Kitts and Nevis recorded one additional case of COVID-19. Junior Minister of Health, Senator Wendy Phipps announced it brought the total number of confirmed cases to 10. The patient was a 66 year-old female who is a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, and resident on Nevis.
On 5 April, the Queen of Saint Kitts and Nevis addressed the Commonwealth in a televised broadcast, in which she asked people to "take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return". She added, "we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again".

This confirmation means that there are now four cases of the coronavirus on Nevis and seven on St. Kitts.
On 10 April 2020, the Minister of State with responsibility for Health, Senator Wendy Phipps, made the disclosure "We now have 12 confirmed positives. The individual is an Indian national who happens to be of the age of 21 years old who had direct contact with a previously announced case" "The person had been placed in quarantine since March 29 when he was first named a contact of a previously confirmed case and was sampled and tested"

Wansdyke (from Woden's Dyke) is a series of early medieval defensive linear earthworks in the West Country of England, consisting of a ditch and a running embankment from the ditch spoil, with the ditching facing north.
There are two main parts: an eastern dyke which runs between Savernake Forest, West Woods and Morgan's Hill in Wiltshire, and a western dyke which runs from Monkton Combe to the ancient hill fort of Maes Knoll in historic Somerset. Between these two dykes there is a middle section formed by the remains of the London to Bath Roman road. There is also some evidence in charters that it extended west from Maes Knoll to the coast of the Severn Estuary but this is uncertain. It may possibly define a post-Roman boundary.
Usage
Wansdyke consists of two sections, long with some gaps in between. East Wansdyke is an impressive linear earthwork, consisting of a ditch and bank running approximately east–west, between Savernake Forest and Morgan's Hill. West Wansdyke is also a linear earthwork, running from Monkton Combe south of Bath to Maes Knoll south of Bristol, but less impressive than its eastern counterpart. The middle section, long, is sometimes referred to as 'Mid Wansdyke', but is formed by the remains of the London to Bath Roman road. It used to be thought that these sections were all part of one continuous undertaking, especially during the Middle Ages when the pagan name Wansdyke was applied to all three parts. However, this is not now considered to be certain.
Defence of an unrecorded border
Wansdyke may be compared to both Offa's Dyke (later, and forming a Mercian border with Wales) and Hadrian's Wall (earlier and forming a border between Britannia and Caledonia) among the largest defensive earthworks in the United Kingdom. Nennius, an 8th-century Welsh monk who had access to older chronicles since lost, describes these defences and their purpose, and links them to the legends of King Arthur.
Nomenclature, dating
The earthwork is named after Woden, indicating that the incoming Anglo-Saxons had no information about the origins of a structure that was there when they arrived, and which was of no significance to locals at that time. Its name occurs in charters of the 9th and 10th century AD. Its relationship to the expansion of the West Saxons was considered in 1964 by J.N.L. Myres, who maintained that Wansdyke was constructed by some sub-Roman authority.<ref>Myres, The English Settlements (1986:156); H. Trevor-Roper, "Wansdyke and the origins of Wessex" in Essays in History</ref> Fowler speculates that it was a fortification intended for use against invading Saxons in the 490s, and abandoned when the news of British victory at Mons Badonicus made it redundant. The name 'Woden's Dyke' eventually became Wansdyke.
East Wansdyke
East Wansdyke in Wiltshire, on the south of the Marlborough Downs, has been less disturbed by later agriculture and building. It is more clearly traceable on the ground than the western part. In places the bank is up to high and the ditch as much as deep. Since at least the tenth century there have been gaps, "gates", in the work. The ditch is on the north side, so Wansdyke may have been intended by the Romano-Britons as a defence against West Saxons encroaching from the upper Thames Valley westward into what is now the West Country. Fowler suggests that its plan is consistent with those of Roman border fortifications such as Hadrian's Wall, not just a military defence but intended to control locals and travellers along the Wessex Ridgeway. He suggests further that the works were never finished, abandoned in the face of a political change which removed their rationale.
Lieut.-General Augustus Pitt Rivers carried out excavations at the Wansdyke in Wiltshire in the late 19th century, considering it the remains of a great war in which the southwest was being defended. In 1958, Fox and Fox attributed its construction to the pagan Saxons, probably in the late sixth century.
West Wansdyke
Although the antiquarians like John Collinson considered West Wansdyke to stretch from Bathampton Down south east of Bath, to the west of Maes Knoll, a review in 1960 considered that there was no evidence of its existence to the west of Maes Knoll. Keith Gardner refuted this with newly discovered documentary evidence. In 2007 a series of sections were dug across the earthwork which showed that it had existed where there are no longer visible surface remains. It was shown that the earthwork had a consistent design, with stone or timber revetment. There was little dating evidence but it was consistent with either a late Roman or post-Roman date. A paper in "The Last of the Britons" conference in 2007 suggests that the West Wansdyke continues from Maes Knoll to the hill forts above the Avon Gorge and controls the crossings of the river at Saltford and Bristol as well as at Bath.
As there is little archaeological evidence to date the whole section, it may have marked a division between British Celtic kingdoms or have been a boundary with the Saxons. The evidence for its western extension is earthworks along the north side of Dundry Hill, its mention in a charter and a road name.
The area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD.
According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the Britons, with victories at Bradford on Avon (in the Avon Gap'' in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD,
and further south at the Battle of Peonnum (at Penselwood) in 658 AD,
followed by an advance west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. It is however significant to note that the names of the early Wessex kings appear to have a Brythonic (British) rather than Germanic (Saxon) etymology.
A section of Wansdyke in Odd Down, which has been designated as an Ancient monument, appears on the Heritage at Risk Register as being in unsatisfactory condition and vulnerable due to gardening.
Modern use of name
The Western Wansdyke gave its name to the former Wansdyke district of the county of Avon, and also to the Wansdyke constituency. It is now in the Bath and North East Somerset unitary authority.

Henry Ritter (24 May 1816, in Montreal – 21 December 1853, in Düsseldorf) was a Canadian-born German genre painter and illustrator; associated with the Düsseldorfer Malerschule.
Biography
His father was a Hanoverian officer, working with the British military, and his mother was English. At a young age, he went to live with an uncle in Hamburg, where he served a commercial apprenticeship. After 1832, he received his first art lessons from Heinrich Jacob Aldenrath and Friedrich Carl Gröger.
From 1836 to 1847, he was a student at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, in the classes of Karl Ferdinand Sohn and Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow. During his last seven years there, he was a member of the Master Class and had his own studio at the Akademie. Most influential, however, were the private lessons he took in 1837 and 1838 from Rudolf Jordan, who took him on trips to the North Sea, became his friend and taught him an ethnographic approach to painting.
In 1842, he married a landowner's daughter from Bonn. Due to an ailment diagnosed as a "nervous fever", he moved to , near Siegburg. He returned to Düsseldorf in 1852 and died there the following year. His remaining works were preserved by Ferdinand Fagerlin, who married his sister-in-law and took over his studio.
He was, perhaps, better known as an illustrator than a painter. From 1847, he was a regular contributor to the satirical . In 1849, he published Der Politische Struwwelpeter, a satire on the recent Revolution and the subject of German unification; based on the children's book, Struwwelpeter. From 1851 to 1853, he provided drawings for albums published by Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter. Among his notable book illustrations are those for a collection of works by Washington Irving.

The Cantata Cycle 1716–1717 (also known as the Concertante Cycle) is a series of cantatas written by Georg Philipp Telemann while he was Frankfurt's Director of Municipal Music. In addition to composing music for civic occasions, he conducted and composed for several churches in the city, including the Katharinenkirche and the Barfüßerkirche where he was Kapellmeister. During his time in Frankfurt (1712–1721), he composed five new year-long cycles of sacred music for the Sundays and holy days of the ecclesiastical calendar. He also completed several cycles which he had begun earlier in Eisenach where he had been the leader of the court singers. After taking up his post in Hamburg in 1721, he continued to supply Frankfurt with cantata cycles—one complete cycle every three years, as part of an arrangement to maintain his citizenship of that city.
Early performances and the texts of the cantatas
The cycle was first performed in 1716/17 simultanuosly in Frankfurt and in Eisenach. It was intended to become Telemann's third cycle of cantatas set completely to texts by his old companion Erdmann Neumeister. However, due to his numerous obligations Neumeister was not able to deliver the texts after Pentecost. Therefore Telemann commissioned the young poet and student of theology Gottfried Simonis (b. 1692) to author the missing texts from Trinity Sunday onwards.
When Telemann repeated the cantata cycle in Frankfurt in 1719/20, Neumeister made a new attempt to deliver the missing texts: he added the texts for the 4th to 6th sundays after Epiphany (sundays that did not exist in 1717, as Easter fell early on 28th of March), plus the sundays from Trinity onwards. However, Neumeister again failed to deliver the texts after the 14th sunday after Trinity, so Telemann again had to improvise: for some of the sundays he wrote texts of his own, and added two new texts by Gottfried Simonis. Some of the texts however are of yet unknown origin.
It was only in his 1726 printing of the cantata cycle's texts, that Neumeister delivered the complete texts. The new texts however were not set to music by Telemann.
Gottfried Simonis on the other hand also supplemented his cycle with texts for the time from Advent to Pentecost, thus completing a full year's cycle. Telemann also composed these new texts and in 1720/21 performed the cantata cycle, which has come to known as Simonis' Neues Lied (or 2nd Concertante Cycle).
Scores
Between 1712 and Telemann's death in 1767 copyists in Frankfurt produced a large collection of performance materials for his religious cantatas, which are currently preserved in the Frankfurt University Library (formerly City and University Library). There are relatively few of these scores available in modern editions. However, the Frankfurt Telemann Society has begun a project in conjunction with Habsburger Verlag to publish modern editions of the scores, particularly the early Frankfurt cantata cycles. These appear in the Frankfurter Telemann-Ausgaben series.

Abdul Rahman Munif published a trilogy novel year 1999. It mainly focused on the personal Iraqi interactions with global events. However, the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt, remaining the thought of French revolution. The English ambitions in the Middle East as it is the power of the Caliphate. Not to forget that it touched on the social and political history of Iraq during the nineteenth century.
Parts
The first part revolves around Daoud Basha and how he got is state chair. Showing the methods of governance in Mesopotamia as all the characters revolved in the Sarai. Unlike the second part, which was liberated from and went out to the streets of Baghdad. Next, he followed the journey of the British Council (Ritch), who was the second main character. However, Bardi's character was the most important character specifically in this part, because it was, she who transformed most of the events from Baghdad to Kirkuk. In the third part, he was assured of his rule through campaigns on both the North and South rebels. In addition, he entered a conflict with the British Council. He did not find a way to prevent the rise of the Basha except by threatening the British military intervention. The annual flood of the Tigris and the unresolved conflict between Daoud Basha and the British Council is how the novel ended.
This novel was from the last novels that was written by Abdul Rahman Munif (1999 – 1997) and what makes it stands out. Some considered it an attempt to return to childhood, especially that he dedicated this work to his mother Noura who instilled the love of Iraq in him. As he added in his novel the Baghdadi dialect in all its daily details, moreover he added the Iraqi view, whether at the level of the ruler generally. Munif tried to say that the history of Iraq applies to history repeats itself. However, one of the critics said that this event in (The Land of Darkness) is Iraq.

The Crock of Gold was the second full-length album by Shane MacGowan and the Popes and was released in November 1997 on ZTT Records. The Crock of Gold followed The Snake, MacGowan's first solo album after the breakup of The Pogues, and was less critically acclaimed than its predecessor. The album is named for the novel by Irish writer James Stephens. To date, it is the last full studio album MacGowan has recorded.
According to Rob Martin, writing for Spinal Column in 1998, "The Crock of Gold has one really solid song after another in the quasi-Celtic folk rock traditional style. The only negative is that there's not too much experimentation on the album. The only real unusual track is 'B&I Ferry', which has a reggae dub style. However, all the songs on the album are exactly what you'd expect from MacGowan. There are songs of lost love, drunken sorrows, loneliness, character portraits, and pride. All contain Shane's gritty and soulful trademark voice (and the vocals actually come off clear on the recordings- always a crapshoot when it comes to MacGowan's pipes). Although it's tough to top the work that MacGowan did with the Pogues, The Crock of Gold is a worthy effort that fans of MacGowan and the Pogues are sure to enjoy."
Like a number of songs by The Pogues, traditional Irish tunes are used as base melodies for some songs; including "Paddy Public Enemy Number One", which combines the tune of "The Man From
Mullingar" with "The Kesh Jig"; and "More Pricks Than Kicks", to the tune "Tabhair Dom Do Lamh".

Rugby league match officials are responsible for fairly enforcing the Laws of the Game from a neutral point of view during a match of rugby league football and imposing penalties for deliberate breaches of these Laws. The most senior match official is the referee. They may be assisted by a range of other officials depending on the level and rules of the competition.
Equipment
The match officials may use the following equipment:
Coin
The referee organises a coin toss with the team captains,prior to the game commencing. To decide who kicks off and what end each team takes initially.
Whistle
Referees must carry a whistle to stop play and then signal to players about many decisions during a game. A referee will let players know when they can take a kick-off or optional kick by using his whistle, for example, as well as to stop after foul play or while awarding a try at other times in a game.
Red card
A red card is used to signal that a player is being sent from the field, or "sent off", for the rest of a match by the referee holding it aloft in the direction of that player. In some competitions a red card is not used and a player is simply pointed to the touch line by the referee.
Yellow card
A yellow card is used to signal that a player is being temporarily suspended from the game. The player is sent to the "sin bin" for 10 minutes, after which time they are allowed to return to carry on playing. In some competitions a yellow card is not used, instead the referee, while facing the player being disciplined, will hold out both hands with fingers and thumbs spread to represent 10 minutes.
Flag
The two touch judges each carry a flag which is used to signal certain things to both the referee and players. If the ball or the player in possession of it goes into touch the touch judge will raise their flag into the air. Touch judges hold their flags in front of them perpendicular to the touch line so that defenders know how far to retreat to be onside in situations when the referee is unable to because of other responsibilities, for example at a scrum. The flags are also waved to draw the referee's attention to incidents and are raised behind the goal posts to signal that a penalty goal or conversion attempt has been successful, or waved at waist-height to indicate an unsuccessful kick. In international and professional matches, touch judge use flags that are electronically hooked up to a receiver worn by the main referee, similar to those used in high-level soccer. By pushing a button on the flag handle, the receiver vibrates or beeps, thus drawing the referee's attention.
Microphone and earpiece
The referee, touch judges and video referee can remain in constant contact by using microphones and earpieces. The referee's microphone is broadcast as part of media match presentations.
Uniform
Match officials on the playing field including the referee, touch judges and in-goal judges all wear an official uniform of a colour distinguishable from those being worn by the two sides playing each other. These uniforms have no special markings to signify the official capacity of the wearer, instead this can be identified by the positioning and equipment of the official.
Refereeing systems
Different refereeing systems are in use:
Laws of the Game
A referee and two touch judges are mandated for games. A timekeeper is an optional official.
International competition
A referee, two touch judges, video referee and timekeeper.
Professional leagues
National Rugby League, Australasia: A referee, two touch judges, video referee, timekeeper.
Super League, Europe: A referee, two touch judges, video referee, reserve referee/official(s), timekeeper, match commissioner, interchange official. In-goal judges are used if the video referee is not being used for a match.
Positions and responsibilities
Referee
The players of each team should be made available for kit inspection. The referee inspects the playing kit of the two teams to ensure it is within the rules, safety is the main concern. The boots worn by players can be of particular interest so as to make sure that there are no sharp edges. The strapping worn by some players has also been scrutinised.
The referee organises a coin toss with the captains of the two teams playing to decide which team kicks off and which end they play at from kick-off.
Referees may take disciplinary action from the moment they enter the playing field until the moment they leave it after they have blown their whistle to signal full-time. The referee may blow for half time and full-time when those periods have elapsed, or after hearing the hooter if responsibility has been delegated.
Potential top level referees must first pass refereeing exams set by a governing body, such as the Rugby Football League in the United Kingdom, before officiating at progressively more senior levels of the sport, gaining experience in amateur competitions and then moving onto the professional leagues where they will progress to the top if good enough. Referees need to be "very fit", with physical training being a requirement at a professional level of competition. Good communication skills, an ability to "handle top athletes with respect and authority" and being able to operate under pressure and scrutiny have been cited as by Stuart Cummings, a former referee, as skills needed to control a game.
Full-time referees have been used in the Super League professional competition since 2007.
Referee's signals
The referee having made a decision should indicate that decision by using a signal.
Touch judge
Two touch judges are used in a rugby league game. They move along each touch line following play. Their main function is to judge when the ball or a player carrying the ball has gone into touch. They also stand together behind the goal posts to judge whether conversions or penalty kicks at goal have been successful.
Touch judges' signals
The touch judges cannot stop play but can signal the referee to enable them to assist the referee.
Video referee
The video referee may be called upon by the referee to examine the play in possible tries. In the Super League competition they can examine play from the preceding play-the-ball. A video referee may also be asked to check whether an attempted 40-20 kick has been successful and sometimes called upon by the referee if there is a stoppage to check events before making a decision. Once a decision has been made by the on field referee, the video referee may not overrule it.
The video referee was first seen in Australia at the 1996 Super League World Nines. The use of the video referee has led to new rule interpretations. In Northern Hemisphere competitions, the video referee is stationed at the ground itself, usually in either the TV production truck or a special booth inside the stadium, while in the NRL a group of video referees make decisions on all matches from "The Bunker", a specially-constructed facility near league headquarters in Sydney modeled after similar instant-replay rooms used by American sports leagues like MLB or the NHL.
In-goal judge
In-goal judges may be used if no video referee system is present at a match to assist the referee in his decision making.
Timekeeper
The referee shall keep the time during a game unless this responsibility is delegated to an appointed official. Delegation of responsibility is usually decided by the rules of a competition, it is standard practice for professional competitions to use an appointed official in place of the referee.
The British Rugby Football League's Operational Rules, for example, require the home team to provide a timekeeper for first team games with the away team being entitled to bring their own to sit alongside their opponent's representative. The timekeepers signal half time and full-time as well as extra time periods if they are played. When time has expired the timekeepers sound the hooter, at this signal the referee will blow his whistle to end play at an existing stoppage or wait for the next one to occur.
A referee can signal by raising both arms to a timekeeper to take account of stoppage time and to stop their watch until signalled again by waving one arm above their head to carry on timing.
A timekeeper may be used to assist the referee in timing the temporary suspension (sin bin) of a player.
Match Commissioner
The Match Commissioner is responsible for the whole game. They ensure the game kicks off on time and any incidents that may arise are brought to the attention of the Rugby Football League.
This is an essential role as it allows the game to run consistently without any interruptions
Interchange Official
The Interchange Official ensures that the interchange process is carried out smoothly and legally. No interchange can take place without the Interchange Official present. Usually, the Interchange Official will be responsible for the home team's interchange and the Reserve Referee/Official will be responsible for the away team's interchange.

Euplectella is a genus of glass sponges which includes the well-known Venus' Flower Basket. Glass sponges have a skeleton made up of silica spicules that can form geometric patterns. These animals are most commonly found on muddy sea bottoms in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. They are sessile organisms and do not move once attached to a rock. They can be found at depths between 100 m and 1000 m but are most commonly found at depths greater than 500 m.
Anatomy
The body shape of Euplectella is cylindrical and vase-like with a hole located at the top of the cylinder structure. This tubular shape is referred to as asconoid. The inner structure of this animal is covered by a layer of choanocytes. Euplectella is a member of the class Sclerospongiae or glass sponges. These sponges are anchored to the seafloor by thousands of spicules. Spicules are long glassy fibers that are covered with recurved barbs. Spicules provide high beam strength support for anchoring and strengthening the structure of this animal. The skeleton of this animal is made of silica that is arranged in cylindrical lattice patterns. These patterns enable flexibility and resilience to damage.
This species often has a symbiotic relationship with shrimp. One male and one female shrimp-like Stenopodidea breed and live inside the Venus Flower Basket, a member of the genus Euplectella. Stenopodidea offspring leave through holes in the sponge. Eventually if Stenopodidea become too large, they become trapped in the basket for the remainder of their lifetime. The pair of Stenopodidea that live inside Euplectella, clean it while the waste produced by Euplectella serves as food for the Stenopodidea.
Reproduction
There is very little known about the reproduction of this species. It can reproduce sexually and asexually. Sea sponges have hermaphroditic properties. When conditions are unfavorable, sea sponges resort to asexual reproduction. This occurs through the presence of an ameobocyte on a deteriorating sponge. Once the deteriorating sponge is gone, the clump of cells remaining begins to grow a new sponge. In sexual sea sponge reproduction, gametes are released into the water by male sponges and are absorbed through the inhalant current of the female sponge. Fertilization occurs when the sperm reaches the ovum. The zygote experiences radial holoblastic cleavage and eventually forms free flowing larvae which develop into new sponge.
Diet
Euplectella are filter feeders. Water is drawn into its central cavity through holes in the sides of the sponge. Organic debris and microscopic organisms are absorbed through this process. They consume bacteria and small plankton.
Life Stages
Euplectella experiences two main life stages: the larval stage or the adult stage. In the larval stage, the larvae is free flowing in the water. This type of larvae is considered trichimella due to its free swimming nature. Eventually, the larvae attached to rocks and metamorphoses into sea sponge. In the adult stage, Euplectella are sessile and attached firmly to rocks through spicules. It is unclear how long Euplectella generally live however other genus of glass sponge have been known to live up to 15,000 years in the wild. Although the intricate skeleton of Euplectella provides some protection from predation, starfish are known to eat them.

Secrets of the Dead, produced by WNET 13 New York, is an ongoing PBS television series which began in 2000. The show generally follows an investigator or team of investigators exploring what modern science can tell us about some of the great mysteries of history. Most programs incorporate primary source material, first-hand accounts, dramatic reenactments, and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to tell the story. The series originated in a series of the same name in the United Kingdom first shown by Channel 4 in 1999. The first two seasons for each country were broadly similar, but thereafter diverged. The US series includes some programs shown in other Channel 4 series (e.g. Secret History). In the case of original British episodes, PBS re-edited, re-branded and finally re-narrated them with various American voice artists. PBS description: "Scientists seek to uncover celebrated mysteries of the past in this occasional British series."
Episode topics have included the Titanic, D-Day, the Shroud of Turin, the Salem Witch Trials, Blackbeard's lost ship, and the first English translations of the Bible.
The PBS series premiered on May 15, 2000, airing four programs in three days (the first episode, concerning the Extreme weather events of 535–536, was a two-parter). Despite an irregular schedule, new episodes continue to air.

Hadlow Cricket Club was one of the early English cricket clubs, formed in the early to mid eighteenth century. Hadlow is a village in the Medway valley near Tonbridge in Kent.
The historic club
A cricket club at Hadlow was known to exist during the 18th century and players from it known to have played during the 1747 English cricket season. F S Ashley-Cooper referred to a quote which described it as "a famous parish for cricket". The Penny London Post reported that a match was to be played between the club and Dartford Cricket Club as "the deciding match". Five players from the club played five from Slindon Cricket Club during the same year.
The last mention of the original Hadlow club is a match against Addington Cricket Club in 1751.
The modern club
Cricket is still played at Hadlow. The modern club was first mentioned in 1819 and the present ground is located off Common Road, to the north of the village. The pavilion dates from 1864 and cost £42.10s to build. The club fields teams in the Kent County Village League.

A complex is an underlying structure that is objectified as a theme (like power or status) by grouping clusters of emotions, memories, perceptions, and wishes in the personal unconscious; opposite of drive. Primarily a psychoanalytic term, it is found extensively in the works of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud.
Overview
An example of a complex would be as follows: if one had a leg amputated when one was a child, this would influence one's life in profound ways, even if they overcame the physical handicap. A person may have many thoughts, emotions, memories, feelings of inferiority, triumphs, bitterness, and determinations centering on that one aspect of their life. If these thoughts were troubling and pervasive, Jung might say they had a complex about the leg.
The reality of complexes is widely agreed upon in the area of depth psychology, a branch of psychology asserting that the vast majority of the personality is determined and influenced by unconscious processes. Complexes are common features of the psychic landscape, according to Jung's accounting of the psyche, and often become relevant in psychotherapy to examine and resolve, most especially in the journey toward individuation or wholeness. Without resolution, complexes continue to exert unconscious, maladaptive influence on our thoughts, feelings, and behavior and keep us from achieving psychological integration.
History and development of the idea
Carl Jung distinguished between two types of unconscious mind: the personal unconscious and collective unconscious. The personal unconscious was the accumulation of experiences from a person's lifetime that could not be consciously recalled. The collective unconscious, on the other hand, was a sort of universal inheritance of human beings, a "species memory" passed on to each of us, not unlike the motor programs and instincts of other animals. Jung believed the personal unconscious was dominated by complexes.
The term complex (; also emotionally charged complexes or feeling-toned complex of ideas), was coined by Carl Jung when he was still a close associate of Sigmund Freud. Complexes were so central to Jung's ideas that he originally called his body of theories Complex psychology. Historically the term originated with Theodor Ziehen, a German psychiatrist who experimented with reaction time in word association test responses. Jung described a complex as a node in the unconscious; it may be imagined as a knot of unconscious feelings and beliefs, detectable indirectly, through behavior that is puzzling or hard to account for.
Jung found evidence for complexes very early in his career in the word association tests conducted at the Burghölzli, the psychiatric clinic of Zurich University, where Jung worked from 1900 to 1908. Jung developed the theory out of his work on Word Association Test. In the word association tests, a researcher reads a list of 100 words to each subject, who was asked to say, as quickly as possible, the first thing that came to mind in response to each word, and the subject's reaction time was measured in fifths of a second. (Sir Francis Galton invented the method in 1879.) Researchers noted any unusual reactions—hesitations, slips of the tongue, signs of emotion. Jung was interested in patterns he detected in subjects' responses, hinting at unconscious feelings and beliefs.
In Jung's theory, complexes may be conscious, partly conscious, or unconscious. Complexes can be positive or negative, resulting in good or bad consequences. There are many kinds of complex, but at the core of any complex is a universal pattern of experience, or archetype. Two of the major complexes Jung wrote about were the anima (a node of unconscious beliefs and feelings in a man's psyche relating to the opposite gender) and animus (the corresponding complex in a woman's psyche). Other major complexes include the mother, father, hero, and more recently, the brother and sister. Jung believed it was perfectly normal to have complexes because everyone has emotional experiences that affect the psyche. Although they are normal, negative complexes can cause us pain and suffering.
One of the key differences between Jungian and Freudian theory is that Jung's thought posits several different kinds of complex. Freud only focused on the Oedipus complex which reflected developmental challenges that face every young boy. He did not take other complexes into account except for the Electra complex, which he briefly spoke of.
After years of working together, Jung broke from Freud, due to disagreements in their ideas, and they each developed their own theories. Jung wanted to distinguish between his and Freud's findings, so he named his theory "analytical psychology".
Jung's theory of complexes with key citations
The ego itself can be thought of as a complex, not yet fully integrated with other parts of the psyche (namely, the superego and the id, or unconscious). As described by Jung, "by ego I understand a complex of ideas which constitutes the center of my field of consciousness and appears to possess a high degree of continuity and identity. Hence I also speak of an ego-complex".
Jung often used the term complex to describe a partially repressed, yet highly influential cluster of charged psychic material split off from, or at odds with, the conscious "I". Daniels described complexes in 2010 as "'stuck-together' agglomerations of thoughts, feelings, behavior patterns, and somatic forms of expression". Concerning its nature as feeling-toned, Jung wrote "[a complex] is the image of a certain psychic situation which is strongly accentuated emotionally and is, moreover, incompatible with the habitual attitude of consciousness. This image has a powerful inner coherence, it has its own wholeness and, in addition, a relatively high degree of autonomy, so that it is subject to the control of the conscious mind to only a limited extent, and therefore behaves like an animated foreign body in the sphere of consciousness."
Some complexes can usurp power from the ego and can cause psychological disturbances and symptoms resulting from the development of a neurosis. Jung described the autonomous, self-directing nature of complexes when he said
On the other hand, Jung spoke of the "differentiating functions" as essentially the healthy development of useful complexes, yet not without bringing about often undesirable side effects.
In Psychological Types, Jung describes the effects of tensions between the dominant and inferior differentiating functions, often forming complexes and neuroses, in high and even extremely one-sided types.
Complexes and subpersonalities
Jung conceptualized complexes as having a high degree of autonomy, describing them as ‘splinter psyches' that form the basis for ‘mini-personalities', whom he called the ‘little people'.
This provided the foundation for later expansion of the idea, most notably by British Psychotherapist John Rowan, who referred to them as subpersonalities, each one operating as a 'semipermanent and semi-autonomous region of the personality capable of acting as a person'.
The work of Rowan and others led to the widespread use of techniques by which psychotherapists encourage clients to express the thoughts, feelings, and attitudes of their various subpersonalities, as a way of facilitating the integration of diverse characteristics, part of what Jung called individuation.

Polydactylus sexfilis, the six-finger threadfin or yellowthread threadfin, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a threadfin from the family Polynemidae which is found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
Description
Polydactylus sexfilis is a medium-sized species, which attains a maximum total length of and a weight of . It has a pointed snout and the head has an almost horizontal profile. There are two separated dorsal fins, the first dorsal fin has 8 spines and the second dorsal fin contains a single spine and 12 or 13 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 11 or 12 soft rays, the base of the anal fin is roughly equal in length to the second dorsal-fin base. The pectoral fin has 15 or 16 rays, and this fin has a length which is equal to 20 to 23% of the standard length, and its tip does not reach the tip of pelvic fin; almost all the rays of the pectoral fin are unbranched except that in the largest specimens some of the rays may be branched. There are six pectoral filaments, the first is the shortest and does not reachthe pelvic fin origin. The second to fifth filaments reach past the pelvic-fin origin and the sixth is the longest and reached to or just beyond the tip f the pelvic fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked and its lobes are non-filamentous, although they are long. The simple lateral line has 60 to 67 pored scalesand runs from the upper end of the gill slit to the upper end of the lower lobe of the caudal fin. The head and flanks are tinged silvery brown dorsally, becoming silvery on their lower flanks. There are 7 to 9 prominent dark longitudinal stripes above the lateral line and 1 to 12 faint stripes below it, these may be absent in smaller fish. The first dorsal fin is black; the second dorsal fin is greyish with the last ray being white. The base of the pectoral fin is greyish black, darkening to black towards the rear. The pectoral filaments are greyish-black with white tips and bases. The front part of the pelvic fin is greyish black with the rest of it being coloured white. The anal fin is greyish-black with its last ray being white. The tail is uniformly greyish black.
Distribution
Polydactylus sexfilis has an Indo-Pacific distribution. It tends to occur mainly around oceanic islands. It has been recorded from Mauritius, Seychelles, Kenya and a number of other islands in the northern Indian Ocean. It is also found from Indonesia north to the island groups of southern Japan and east to the Hawaiian Islands, French Polynesia and Pitcairn Island. It has not been collected from continental Australia but has occurred from Cocos (Keeling) Island.
Habitat and biology
Polydactylus sexfilis is found in shallow water which are less than along sandy and rocky coastal beaches, in lagoons and near reef areas near oceanic islands, often where the water is very turbulent. It feeds largely on crustaceans and fishes. They reach sexual maturity as males when they attain a fork length of and then changing sex to fertile females after an intermediate hermaphrodite stage when they reach a fork length of . Spawning is governed by the phases of the moon.
Fisheries
Polydactylus sexfilis is an important species for commercial fisheries in Hawaii where it is also used in aquaculture. In Hawaiian this species is called moi and in pre colonial Hawaii the moi was reserved for royalty. They were farmed in specially created ponds.
Species description
Polydactylus sexfilis was first formally described in 1831 by Achille Valenciennes as Polynemus sexfilis with the type locality given as Mauritius.

Andrew Bertram Cvercko (November 6, 1937 – December 3, 2010) was an American football guard in the National Football League for the Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins. He played college football at Northwestern University.
Early years
Cvercko attended Campbell Memorial High School. He accepted a football scholarship from Northwestern University, where he was coached by Ara Parseghian. He became a two-way left tackle and a three-year starter.
As a senior, he was awarded the Big Ten Conference Medal of Honor, which is given annually to a male and female athlete at each of the Big Ten institutions, who demonstrates the greatest proficiency in scholarship and athletics.
In 2000, he was inducted into the Northwestern Athletic Hall of Fame.
Professional career
Green Bay Packers
Cvercko was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round (55th overall) of the 1959 NFL Draft, with the intention of playing him at offensive guard. As a rookie, he suffered a knee injury in the season opener against the Chicago Bears and was lost for the year. In 1960, he was a reserve player.
On September 4, 1961, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a draft choice.
Dallas Cowboys
In 1961, he started 10 games at left guard, splitting time with John Houser (4 starts).
In 1962, he started all 14 games at left guard. In the second game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was called for a holding penalty that negated a 99-yard touchdown reception (at the time a league record) from Frank Clarke and because it was in the end zone, it was called a safety, which created a nine-point swing in the game and contributed to a 28–30 loss.
On July 10, 1963, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#82-Jim Curry).
Cleveland Browns
In 1963, he appeared in 2 games as a reserve player. On September 17, he was waived to make room for guard Ted Connolly.
Washington Redskins

On December 3, 2010, he died at his home in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. His brother Jack Cvercko was a football All-American in 1962 and was selected in the 1963 NFL Draft, but a chronic knee injury prevented him from becoming a professional football player.

Capo is the fifth studio album by American hip hop recording artist Jim Jones. It was released April 5, 2011, by E1 Music.
Critical reception
The New York Times called the album chaotic, but often successful in spite of itself. They called his rhymes nimble but cluttered and said he is out-rapped by almost all of his guests here, including Game on "Carton of Milk" and Lloyd Banks on "Take a Bow". They also stated his standout tracks are the lead single, "Perfect Day" and the Wiz Khalifa-esque "Heart Attack" stating that he is so at ease, so comfortable on those tracks, that he begins to sound skillful. John Kennedy of Vibe gave a fairly positive review calling the utopian "Perfect Day" catchy and saying vulnerable moments ("Changing the Locks" and "Heart Attack") round the album out, while hometown collabos ("Take A Bow" with Prodigy, Lloyd Banks, Sen City and "Drops Is Out" with Raekwon, Mel Matrix, Sen City) fly highest.
Commercial performance
The album debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200, selling 21,000 copies in its first week. In its second week, the album sold 8,200 copies.

James Roberts (born 1753) was an enslaved American.
Roberts was born on the Eastern shore of Maryland, during a time of slavery. He was enslaved by Francis De Shields, a colonel in Washington's army. Roberts had fought beside De Shields in the American Revolutionary War, and once the seven-year war with Britain ended, worked for Washington in Philadelphia. Roberts went with De Shields as his servant. When De Shields died, Roberts expected to be set free, but instead was sold to William Ward. Roberts was torn away from his family and then sold at an auction in New Orleans to Calvin Smith.
It is not for me to foretell the end of oppression in this country, but one thing is certain, virtue, sobriety, temperance, economy, education and religion, will fit you for any emergency whatever, and are the best qualifications for free men. That their attainment may be your constant pursuit and most earnest endeavr, is the prayer of one now ready to depart.
While he was enslaved by Calvin Smith he experienced traumatic events on the plantation. His cousin was whipped and put in the stocks only to die a week into being on that very homestead. Soon thereafter, General Jackson traveled to Calvin Smith's to enlist 500 slaves to prepare for the Battle of New Orleans. Roberts was one of these 500 men. When the army arrived in New Orleans, Jackson saw the fear in his men's eyes. To get their spirits up he said,
don't be discouraged, take a second look at them; they are but men like yourselves. Courage will overcome your fears and dread.
The triumph of Jackson's battle had cost Roberts a serious wound to his head as well as a missing forefinger. After the battle was over, the promise that Jackson had made to the enslaved men had evaporated into thin air. They marched to the Kentucky tavern to drink as much as the men pleased.
"Never," said he, "suffer negroes to have arms; if you do, they will take the country. Suffer them to have no kind of weapons over ten inches long. Never allow them to have a piece of paper with any writing on it whatever. You must examine your slaves very closely, for the time is coming when the slave will get light; and if ever his mind is enlightened on the subject of freedom, you cannot keep him. One slave bought from the East will ruin a multitude of those raised here. Before a slave of mine should go free, I would put him in a barn and burn him alive. Gentlemen, take me at my word; for if you do not, you will be sorry for it before many years. Never arm another set of colored people. We have fooled them now, but never trust them again; they will not be fooled again with this example before them. If you do, you will repent of it but once."
After the hearts of these men were broken, the only thing Roberts was allowed to do was go back to work for the master he had learned to despise only to return and observe additional abuse to him and others.
In 1856, Roberts contacted President Pierce located in Washington D.C. for an interview about receiving a pension for his merits in the war. Pierce said that Roberts was nothing more than a horse or a sheep and that it would be a disgrace to take a pension that his master was still receiving and give it to Roberts.

Omiodes blackburni, the coconut leafroller, is a species of moth in the family Crambidae. It is endemic to the Hawaiian islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and Hawaii. The species was first described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1877.
Recorded food plants include Cocos nucifera, but it occasionally also feeds on Pritchardia (including Pritchardia pacifica), banana and introduced palms.
Young larvae feed gregariously on the underside of the leaf of their host plant protected by a thin web of silk. At first they eat the substance of the leaf and leave the opposite epidermis. They soon scatter more or less, and make hiding places by fastening together the lower edges of coconut leaflets. Often several caterpillars can be found in the same place. As they become slightly larger, they eat the whole substance, eating from the edge, and not leaving the epidermis. When the leaflet is mostly eaten, they migrate to other leaflets. Larvae are full grown in about four weeks from hatching. Full-grown larvae are 32–35 mm long and dull greenish, with two dorsal whitish lines.
Pupation takes place in a slight cocoon in the caterpillar's retreat. The pupa is 15–19 mm long and light to dark brown according. The pupal period lasts 11–13 days.

It is a limited company and registered charity, and is Arts Council funded. Activist and writer Deyika Nzeribe was a former chair.
History
Commonword was set up as writing workshop and community publisher of working-class writing in Manchester. Greg Wilkinson was one of the organisation's founder members.
Cultureword
Cultureword is the strand of Commonword established in 1986 as a centre for black and Asian creative writing. Lemn Sissay was working at the organisation as Cultureword's literature worker and convenor of the "Tight Fisted Poets" group, nurturing new writing talent among many of Manchester's BAME writers. This objective remains fundamental to the organisation's stance to this day.
Activities
Commonword runs writers' groups, workshops, events, conferences and competitions to further its aims.
Identity
Identity, Cultureword's weekly group for black and Asian writers, has been running since the late 1980s.
Young Identity
Young Identity (also known as YI) was created in 2006 by Shirley May and Ali Gadema, and is a spoken-word collective aimed at younger writers, aged 13–25. Young Identity has performed all over the United Kingdom, working with a diverse range of writers including Saul Williams, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Ted Hughes Prize Winner Kae Tempest and the late Amiri Baraka.

The United States Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI-U), also known as chain-weighted CPI or chain-linked CPI is a time series measure of price levels of consumer goods and services created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as an alternative to the US Consumer Price Index. It is based on the idea that when prices of different goods change at different rates, consumers will adjust their purchasing patterns by purchasing more of products whose relative prices have declined and fewer of those whose relative price has increased. This reduces the cost of living reported, but has no change on the cost of living; it is simply a way of accounting for a microeconomic "substitution effect." The "fixed weight" CPI also takes such substitutions into account, but does so through a periodic adjustment of the "basket of goods" that it represents, rather than through a continuous adjustment in that basket. Application of the chained CPI to federal benefits has been controversially proposed to reduce the federal deficit.
Background
Currently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics computes each month average prices of 211 different categories of goods and services in 38 different urban geographical areas, totaling 8,018 different elementary indices. From these, higher-level indices are obtained as weighted averages of these elementary indices, using different weights for different categories of goods and services nationwide or for different groups of consumers. One set of weights is used to obtain a consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers (CPI-U). Another is used to compute a CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W). The weights for CPI-U and CPI-W are currently updated in January of every even-numbered year to correct for "substitution bias", the idea that consumers will change their buying patterns to keep their cost of living from rising as quickly as inflation.
To understand "substitution bias", consider for example the price of Granny Smith apples. If the price of those apples increases faster than the price of Red Delicious apples, or if the price of Granny Smith declines more slowly than the price of Red Delicious apples, consumers may decide to purchase more Red Delicious apples; this "lower-level" substitution bias is accounted for in the current CPI-U and CPI-W. However, if the price of apples increases faster than that of oranges, or if the price of apples declines more slowly than the price of oranges, consumers on average will respond by purchasing fewer apples and more oranges. This changes the "market basket" of goods they buy; this "upper-level" substitution is not accounted for in the traditional CPI until the next adjustment which could be up to two years later, but impacts the Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) the next month.
Impact on benefits
Various public and private organizations use CPI data for Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) for programs like Social Security and for provisions of the tax code. Currently most programs are indexed to the CPI-U or the CPI-W.
Changes in consumer prices are used to determine issues such as Cost of Living Adjustments, so any reduction in the official estimate of inflation would reduce payments to workers and retirees. If the official adjustment is greater than the inflation experienced by the recipients of the adjustment, they get an unearned benefit; if it's less than the real inflation, they are penalized—and the expense to those paying wages or retirement benefits are impacted in a complementary fashion. Beyond this, various thresholds in the tax code are also indexed to a CPI: If these thresholds grow more slowly, tax receipts would likely increase.
Application of chained CPI has been suggested as a means of reducing the US federal budget deficit by reducing the rate of growth of government benefits. The Moment of Truth Project estimates that moving to the Chained CPI would reduce the deficit by about $390 billion in the first decade alone, with roughly one third of the savings from Social Security, another third from increased federal revenue (via inflation-indexed tax provisions such as more slowly growing tax bracket thresholds), and the remaining savings from a combination of other spending programs and reduced interest on the debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates switching to the chained CPI would save $340 billion
Applying the chained CPI beginning in 2015 instead of 2014 and accompanying it with "low income protections" would save $230 billion
History of proposals and controversy
In 1996, the Advisory Committee to Study the Consumer Price Index (the Boskin Commission) estimated that in 1996 CPI-W (used to adjust Social Security) over-estimated inflation 1.1 percent. The BLS responded by making changes to the CPI-U and CPI-W, which included an adjustment to compensate for upper-level substitution bias, performed each January of an even-numbered year. In 2002 BLS created the Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) that provides more frequent monthly adjustment for substitution bias.
Proponents of the chained CPI include the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Heritage Foundation. It is also included in the recommendations of various bipartisan commissions designed to reduce the deficit such as Simpson–Bowles, Domenici–Rivlin, and the Gang of Six.
In 2012 and 2013 as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Obama repeatedly proposed the application of chained CPI to social security benefits as a way to address budgetary shortfalls. This position was controversial with many, including Democrats and Social Security advocacy groups.
Some oppose the measure for the reason that changing inflation metrics to the Chained CPI would inappropriately cut the growth in benefits under programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. Opponents include the AARP the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL–CIO and Social Security Works. They claim that the current CPI used for the elderly understates the inflation seniors experience, primarily because the elderly purchase more medical care than younger people, and medical care inflation has exceeded inflation in the rest of the economy.
The Congressional Budget Office said in 1998 that the CPI metric used for cost of living adjustments "grows faster than the cost of living".
According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, “moving to the Chained CPI would address this by using a superlative [chained] index that updates expenditure weights and formulas in order to
address consumer response to substitutions between categories.”
Since 2000 the Chained CPI has on average measured inflation between 0.25 and 0.3 percentage points lower than CPI-U and CPI-W. Opponents of the change note that while the difference is small, it compounds over time, making the reduction in outlays for COLAs for Social Security larger when looked at over a long time horizon.
Opponents also claim that using CPI-W to adjust retirement benefits like Social Security does not properly estimate inflation for seniors, because the elderly have consumption patterns different from urban wage earners and clerical workers (studied for CPI-W). For example, the elderly consume roughly double the medical care of all urban consumers (studied for CPI-U and C-CPI-U) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (for CPI-W); inflation in medical care has exceeded that in much of the rest of the economy. To adjust for this, the BLS computes a consumer price index for the elderly (CPI-E).
However, the CPI-E as an index has a number of flaws. For one, it covers a very small sample size and is in reality just a subset of the CPI-U rather than its own index. More importantly, there is substantial controversy about whether the CPI appropriately measures health care cost inflation – a problem which is particularly pronounced in the CPI-E. As CBO explains, it is unclear “whether the cost of living actually grows at a faster rate for the elderly than for younger people… Some research suggests that BLS underestimates the rate of improvement in the quality of health care and that such improvement may be reducing the true price of health care by more than 1 percent a year. If that is the case, then all versions of the CPI overstate growth in the cost of living, with the overstatement especially large for the CPI-E."
Chained CPI has moreover been criticized for its disproportionate impact on women who live longer, but typically have fewer savings than men. Concerns have also been raised regarding the impact of chained CPI on veterans, and persons with disabilities. The argument is that because veterans and the disabled collect benefits before retirement age, they would stand to lose a more significant share of income from Social Security and other programs over time. Furthermore, Chained CPI has been depicted as a regressive piece of social policy, as persons earning between $30,000 and $40,000 will be disproportionately impacted by the lowering of the inflation adjustment for income.
Distribution effect
Moving to the chained CPI would reduce Social Security benefits by 3% for the bottom 60% of Social Security recipients and 4% for the top 40% of beneficiaries (per estimates for 2050 from the Social Security Administration ).
The Tax Policy Center estimated that changing the Chained CPI would increase the taxes paid by 30% of the bottom 20% of the income distribution, 70% of the next 20% of the population, and nearly all of the people in the top 60% of the income distribution.

Graile was born at Gloucester about 1577. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 10 February 1592 – 1593, graduated B.A. in February 1594–5, and M.A. in 1600. He was afterwards physician of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Gloucester. He was author of , London, 1611, 8vo, dedicated to the president and governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Gloucester. Verses to Sir William Throckmorton and his wife are prefixed. 'The third impression,' with an appendix of original prayers, was issued in 1632, 8vo, and of this edition alone is there a copy in the British Museum.

The King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association or WNMA was a Welsh voluntary association set up to combat tuberculosis.
The lord mayor of Cardiff, alderman John Chappell, convened a meeting in Shrewsbury on 30 September 1910 to decide what form the Welsh national memorial to King Edward VII should take. The meeting decided that the memorial should be an organised campaign to eradicate tuberculosis in Wales and Monmouthshire. £300,000 was raised by the public, half of which was donated by philanthropist David Davies of Llandinam, the Liberal MP for Montgomeryshire, who had a special interest in the fight against tuberculosis. He later became the first president of the WNMA, which was incorporated on 17 May 1912. He invited Thomas Jones, a lifelong friend and guide, to be the WNMA's first secretary.The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act 1921 required local authorities to treat and prevent tuberculosis. However, in Wales the WNMA already existed. The Act gave them statutory responsibility for fighting tuberculosis in Wales.

Charles La Rocque, also spelled Larocque, (November 15, 1809 – July 15, 1875) was a Canadian Roman Catholic priest and third Bishop of Saint-Hyacinthe from 1866 to 1875.
Charles La Rocque was born 15 Nov. 1809 at Chambly-sur-Richelieu, L.C., the eldest son of Henri and Sophie Robert La Rocque. He attended the College of Saint-Hyacinthe on scholarship, as did his cousin Joseph La Rocque. Upon completion of his studies he decided to enter religious life. While preparing for the priesthood, he taught humanities at the College of Saint-Hyacinthe. In 1831 he went to Montreal to complete his studies in theology at the seminary of Saint-Jacques.
He was ordained to the priesthood 29 July 1832, and served as vicar at Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan and Berthier; and as curé at St. Pie de Bagot, Ste. Marguerite de Blainville, and St. John Dorchester. On 15 September 1863, Father Charles was at Burlington, Vermont for the laying of the cornerstone of St. Mary's Cathedral. The Mass was sung by Rev. La Rocque in the open air with the altar placed in the same location as planned once the cathedral was completed. (In 2018 the Diocese of Burlington announced plans to merge the parish with St. Joseph's due to low attendance and sell the property.)
Bishop
Upon the resignation of his cousin as Bishop of the Diocese of Saint Hyacinthe, Charles La Rocque was chosen to succeed him. The new bishop was a highly cultured man with rare financial ability; realizing that the debts of his cathedral called for unusual measures, he closed the episcopal palace and retired with his staff to Beloeil, where he combined the duties of bishop and pastor of this parish. Bishop La Rocque assisted at the Vatican founding the Sherbrooke Diocese. He opened the first house of the Dominicans in Canada by giving them a parish in his titular city, and had the satisfaction of effectively reducing the cathedral debt and placing the diocese on a satisfactory money basis. In 1870, he attended the Vatican Council, but left early due to a serious illness.
Bishop La Rocque died on 15 July 1875 at the Hôtel-Dieu of Saint-Hyacinthe.

Ongan, also called Angan, South Andamanese or Jarawa–Onge, is a phylum of two Andamanese languages, Önge and Jarawa, spoken in the southern Andaman Islands.
The two known extant languages are:
Önge or Onge ( transcribes ); 96 speakers (Onge) in 1997, mostly monolingual
Jarawa or Järawa; estimated at 200 speakers (Jarawa) in 1997, monolingual
A third language, Sentinelese, the presumed language of the Sentinelese people, is thought to be related to the Ongan languages, but this is uncertain, as very little is known about the Sentinelese; estimated 15–500 speakers.
Another language, Jangil, extinct sometime between 1895 and 1920, is reported to have been unintelligible with but to have had noticeable connections with Jarawa.
External relationships
The Andamanese languages fall into two clear families, Great Andamanese and Ongan, plus one presumed but unattested language, Sentinelese. The similarities between Great Andamanese and Ongan are mainly of a typological and morphological nature, with little demonstrated common vocabulary. Linguists, including long-range researchers such as Joseph Greenberg, have expressed doubts as to the validity of Andamanese as a family.
It has since been proposed (by Juliette Blevins 2007) that Ongan (but not Great Andamanese) is distantly related to Austronesian in a family called Austronesian–Ongan,
However, the proposal of a genealogical connection between Austronesian and Ongan has not been well-received by other linguists. George Van Driem (2011) considers Blevins' evidence as "not compelling", although he leaves the possibility open that some resemblances could be the result of contact/borrowing, a position also held by Hoogervorst (2012). Robert Blust (2014) argues that Blevins' conclusions are not supported by her data, and that of her first 25 reconstructions, none are reproducible using the comparative method. Blust concludes that the grammatical comparison does not hold up, and also cites non-linguistic (such as cultural, archaeological, and biological) evidence against Blevins' hypothesis.
Reconstruction
The two attested Ongan languages are relatively close, and the historical sound reconstruction mostly straightforward:
*ə appears to be allophonic for *e before a nasal coda.
Grammar
The Ongan languages are agglutinative, with an extensive prefix and suffix system. They have a noun class system based largely on body parts, in which every noun and adjective may take a prefix according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Another peculiarity of terms for body parts is that they are inalienably possessed, requiring a possessive adjective prefix to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".
The Ongan pronouns are here represented by Önge:
There is also an indefinite prefix ən-, on- "someone's". Jarawa does not have the plural series, but the singular is very close: m-, ŋ- or n-, w-, ən-. From this, Blevins reconstructs Proto-Ongan *m-, *ŋ-, *gw-, *en-.
Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two cardinal numbers: one and two and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.

Abdullah Bozkurt (born 1971) is a Turkish journalist. He was the bureau chief for the Gülen-aligned newspaper Today's Zaman.
Biography
Bozkurt started his work in journalism with the newspaper Zaman. He worked as the New York Bureau Chief and Washington Representative of Zaman Newspaper. Afterwards, he continued the same work for the newspaper Today's Zaman.
In 2011, Bozkurt defended the imprisonment of journalists in the Ergenekon investigation stating that journalists like Ahmet Şık were not being an investigative journalist conducting "independent research", but was hatching "a plot designed and put into action by the terrorist network itself".
Bozkurt has lived outside Turkey since the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. In Turkey, he has a warrant out for his arrest stemming from allegations of membership in the Gülen movement, which the Turkish government considers to be a terrorist group. Terrorism charges are frequently used by the Turkish government against dissident journalists. In June 2020, a segment on the private television station TGRT Haber called for Bozkurt to be "exterminated".
In Sweden, Bozkurt created the Nordic Research & Monitoring Network (or Nordic Monitor), of which he is the director.

Brighton (1938–1990)
also Brighton and Seacliff
The Brighton and Seacliff Football Club was formed in 1938 through the amalgamation of the Brighton and Seacliff clubs. Playing in the Glenelg District Football Association, Brighton and Seacliff formed a brief merger with Sturt for four years during World War II, before resuming as a separate entity in 1946. Brighton and Seacliff was renamed back to just Brighton in 1957 and in 1958 transferred to the South Australian Amateur Football League A3 competition, gaining consecutive promotions to the A1 division over the first two seasons. Brighton remained in A1 until they finished last in 1965, played the next three seasons in A2 before shifting back to the now Glenelg-South Adelaide Football Association in 1969. Brighton remained in the Glenelg-South Adelaide FA until its demise at the end of 1986, by then known as the Southern Metropolitan Football League, when they shifted to the South Australian Football Association (SAFA). Brighton competed in the SAFA competition until the end of the 1990 season, when they merged with Brighton High Old Scholars.

The Brighton High Old Scholars Football Club (BHOS) was formed in 1968 by a group of ex-Students of Brighton High School and entered the South Australian Amateur Football League A6 competition. Following winning the A6 premiership in 1969, they were promoted to A5 and repeated the premiership win to make their way into A4. BHOS made it three-in-a-row in 1971, winning the A4 premiership and securing their place in A3. BHOS remained in A3 for six seasons before securing promotion through a Grand Final loss to Old Ignatians in 1976. BHOS only lasted for three seasons in A2 before being relegated to A3 for the 1980 season. 1981 saw an A3 wooden spoon and relegation to A4, followed by the wooden spoon in the A4 competition in 1982 to land in A5. An A5 Grand Final loss in 1985 to Salisbury College resulted in promotion to A4 and was directly followed by the A4 premiership in 1986. The following season, BHOS again secured promotion via a losing grand final, this time to Goodwood Saints. BHOS merged with the Brighton Football Club at the end of the 1990 season, after they finished bottom of the A2 competition without winning a game. The new club, named Brighton Districts and Old Scholars, continued in A3 in place of Brighton High Old Scholars.

Lake Anne is a reservoir in the unincorporated suburban community of Reston in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The lake is part of the Difficult Run drainage area of the county.
Description
Lake Anne is one of Reston's four manmade lakes. Prior to its development, the land was home to open fields and forests. It was built in 1962 and named after Anne W. Simon, the spouse of Reston's founder. The contents of the lake come mainly from rainfall and surface runoff, as well as underground springs.
Lake Anne is also the name of the historic village center that surrounds the lake. Lake Anne and its adjacent neighborhood form the nucleus of the original Reston development. James Rossant and William Conklin designed Lake Anne Village using a Brutalist architectural style. It was officially dedicated on December 4, 1965.
Reston founder Robert E. Simon spent the last third of his life in Heron House (designed by Rossant and named after the great blue heron found in the area) on Lake Anne.
The village center was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

The Association of Secondary Ticket Agents, or ASTA UK, is the self-appointed Regulatory Body of the Secondary Ticket Industry in the United Kingdom. The Association was established in October 2005, and represents some companies engaged in the selling of tickets to entertainment and sporting events.
The ASTA UK is affiliated with the National Association of Ticket Brokers in the United States. ASTA is recognised by some Government bodies as the representative body for Secondary Ticket Agents. Another body, the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, also represents Primary ticket sellers and resellers.
Code of ethics
The Association requires its members to maintain a high level of ethics in the marketplace and therefore has adopted a set of standards and procedures that govern the conduct of its members.
Bonding scheme
All members of the Association Of Secondary Ticket Agents (ASTA UK) proposed a scheme underwritten by a Lloyd's of London Broker and scrutinised by the Financial Services Authority. The scheme was well received generally but failed ultimately due to a lack of cross-party support.

Eileen Caddy MBE (26 August 1917 – 13 December 2006) was a spiritual teacher and new age author, best known as one of the founders of the Findhorn Foundation community at the Findhorn Ecovillage, near the village of Findhorn, Moray Firth, in northeast Scotland. The commune she started in 1962 with husband Peter Caddy and friend Dorothy Maclean was an early New Age intentional community where thousands of people from dozens of countries have resided in years since. One of the UK's largest alternative spiritual communities, The Sunday Times referred to it, on Caddy's death, as "the Vatican of the New Age".
Early life
She was born Eileen Marion Jessop in Alexandria, Egypt, the second of four children of Albert Jessop, an Irishman, and the director of Barclays Bank DCO; her mother Muriel was English. At six she was sent to school in Ireland, where she lodged with an aunt, and returned to Egypt in the holidays. When she was 16, her father died in Egypt of peritonitis and her family moved back to England. Tragedy struck again two years later, when her mother died of meningitis. Thereafter she was educated at a domestic college, and later bought and ran a pub at an RAF base in Oxfordshire, with her brother for four years.
Soon she met an RAF officer, Squadron Leader Andrew Combe, whom she married in 1939, just months before the beginning of the Second World War; subsequently she travelled to London and America with him, and lastly to Iraq, and had a son and four daughters. Combe was a follower of the group called Moral Rearmament (MRA), and insisted that his wife follow the traditions of the group, which included joining the group's "quiet times", during which they would listen for divine guidance. Though diffident at the time towards the practices which she found restrictive, she later acknowledged the importance of her early attunement to "quiet times" and "listening to inner guidance", regarding it as an important milestone on her spiritual journey.
The beginning of Findhorn
In 1952, while posted at RAF Habbaniya, in Iraq, Combe read an article written by Squadron Leader Peter Caddy who was also posted, met him, and became interested in bringing him into the MRA fold; subsequently Eileen was introduced to Peter and his wife, Sheena Govan, daughter of the founders of the Faith Mission. Due to their shared interests in the occult and spirituality, they immediately took a liking to each other. Soon Eileen was in the circle that formed around Sheena Govan.
Peter Caddy's marriage was already in trouble. Their friend Dorothy Maclean later recalled that Sheena had declared that she was no longer her husband's "other half", and that soon Peter would meet his "true partner".
Eileen and Peter fell in love and in 1953 after returning to England, she asked Combe for a divorce in a letter to him in Iraq, where he was still posted. Combe immediately forbade her from seeing their five children. It was then that a traumatized Eileen visited a private sanctuary at Glastonbury with Peter, where she first claimed to have heard while meditating, the "voice of God", which said: "Be still and know that I am God." Initially she took it as a sign of a nervous breakdown, but in time she began to "love the voice as an instrument from the God within us all". Her subsequent instructions from the "voice" directed her to take on Sheena as her spiritual teacher. Sheena moved away to the Isle of Mull, Scotland, having divorced Peter Caddy. By the autumn of 1956, Peter and Eileen came over to join her nascent group of followers there, along with the two children they already had together. Following a divorce, Eileen married Peter Caddy in 1957, and they had one more son in 1968.
Meanwhile, Sheena's group was fast gaining popularity, and was dubbed the 'Nameless Ones' by the local media, which also called her "the woman Messiah". Subsequently, from 1957, Peter and Eileen Caddy co-managed a run-down hotel in Scotland, the Cluny Hill Hotel in Forres, Moray, which they reportedly resurrected and turned into a four-star hotel following practical guidance given by the "voice". Early in 1962, the couple along with most of the staff were sent by the management to resurrect another of their properties, the Trossachs Hotel, at Perthshire, but when they pleaded to be shifted back to Forres closer to their "mission", they were fired.
Following the resulting period of unemployment, on 17 November 1962 Eileen, her husband Peter, the children and their colleague Dorothy Maclean, moved to a holiday caravan in a trailer park, a few miles from Forres and a mile from the village of Findhorn. There they began practising organic gardening as a means of supplementing their family's food supply. The garden flourished to such a remarkable extent with the help of what they claimed were plant spirit and devas that it eventually attracted national attention, and was featured in a 1965 BBC radio programme. Its supporters included Sir George Trevelyan and Lady Eve Balfour of the Soil Association.
Beginning in 1965 a community, eventually known as the Findhorn Foundation, began to form around the work and spiritual practices of Eileen and Peter Caddy and Dorothy Maclean. The community was featured in several television documentaries by the BBC, starting in 1969, when BBC TV programme Man Alive came to Findhorn, resulting in greatly increased public awareness. Soon the place became a favorite haunt for thousands of new agers from around the world and the community bought the Cluny Hill Hotel in 1975 and turned it into a college, which stands seven miles from the Findhorn Bay Area caravan park, which was bought in 1983 More recently it was profiled by the Channel 4 documentary series, The Haven, in 2004.
In 1971 Eileen, as "guided" by her inner voice, stopped receiving guidance for the community and from then on remained as an inspiring figure within the community. Dorothy Maclean moved to the United States in 1973, while Peter left Findhorn in 1978 after falling for a young female community member; he married twice in the following years, even started a Findhorn-style community in California, but eventually died in a car crash in 1994. Meanwhile, all through the 1980s, Eileen travelled across the world speaking at spiritual gathers, and also writing several books, including her "compendium of daily guidance", "Opening Doors Within", which went on to be translated in 30 languages. Her works include God Spoke to Me, a volume of inspirational messages published in various formats from 1966 onwards, and an autobiography titled Flight into Freedom and Beyond. Finally in 1996 at the age of 76, Eileen stopped giving workshops, as her inner voice "suggested".
Later years
In the late 1960s Eileen had been reconciled with her first family, and in 1997 all her eight children came together for the first time to celebrate her 80th birthday. In 2001 she was named one of the 50 most spiritually influential people in Britain on Channel 4's "The God List".
For services to spiritual inquiry, Eileen Caddy was in 2004 awarded the MBE by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The award was presented by the Lord Lieutenant of Moray, Air Vice-Marshal George Chesworth.
Eileen Caddy died on 13 December 2006 at Findhorn, after leaving instructions that her death "be a cause for thanksgiving, rather than mourning." Today, the original Caddy caravan of the 1960s houses the Findhorn Foundation's Spiritual and Personal Development department, amidst trees and flowers within the Findhorn Ecovillage.

Tomáš Hertl (born 12 November 1993) is a Czech professional ice hockey forward and alternate captain for the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Hertl was selected 17th overall in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Sharks. He is the first player born in the modern Czech Republic after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia to appear in an NHL game.
Prior to being drafted, Hertl played for HC Slavia Praha of the Czech Extraliga.
Playing career
Early career
Hertl started his playing career with HC Slavia Praha in the Czech Extraliga, playing on the U18 and U20 squads in 2009–10. He was the third-highest scorer on the U20 team, scoring 12 goals and 26 assists. On the U18 team, Hertl scored 13 goals and 10 assists. The next season, Hertl was among four players on the U20 team with 40+ points; Hertl had 14 goals and 27 assists. In 2011–12, Hertl was the fourth-leading scorer for Slavia, with 11 goals and 15 assists.
The NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked Hertl fifth among European skaters before the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Sports Illustrateds Allan Muir ranked Hertl as the 18th best prospect in the 2012 draft. ISS Hockey listed Hertl as the 32nd best, while The Hockey News and TSN scout Craig Button listed him as the 24th and 22nd best player, respectively. Among Hertl's advantages include his large body and a good physical and defensive play, which Muir compared to Martin Hanzal. However, Muir also wrote, "Hertl's not the most agile skater or finisher, and he has a tendency to try to do too much." Button stated that Hertl, although not particularly fast, his agility compensates for his speed; Hertl is also an effective passer and when "given the opportunity to shoot, he can be dangerous."
Hertl was drafted by the San Jose Sharks with 17th overall pick in the 2012 draft, and became the first European player drafted with the Sharks' top pick since Czech Lukas Kaspar was drafted in 2004. After being drafted, Hertl rejoined Slavia, scoring 30 points in 43 games.
San Jose Sharks
The Sharks officially signed Hertl to a three-year entry-level contract on 3 June 2013. In the preseason, Hertl scored 3 goals and 1 assist, and joined Joe Thornton and Brent Burns on a line, filling the hole created by Raffi Torres' injury. Hertl made his NHL debut against the Vancouver Canucks on 3 October, 2013 and tallied his first career point with an assist on a goal by Brent Burns. At age 19, Hertl became the first teenager to play in a season opener for the Sharks since Marc-Édouard Vlasic in 2006. Hertl scored his first two NHL goals in the next game on 5 October 2013, against Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes; Hertl became the youngest player to score 2 goals for the Sharks in one game since Patrick Marleau on 17 March 1999. On 8 October 2013, Hertl registered 4 goals against the New York Rangers in a 9–2 victory, making him the fourth youngest player in the NHL to record a four-goal game (19 years, 330 days old) after Jimmy Carson did in the 1987–88 NHL season with the Los Angeles Kings (19 years, 254 days old). Hertl also became the first Shark to score four goals in one game since Owen Nolan in 1995. Hertl was eventually named the October Rookie of the Month, scoring eight goals, which led all rookies, and 11 points in 13 games. However, on 19 December against the Kings, Hertl injured his knee after a collision with Dustin Brown, and was reported to miss at least a month. Hertl had surgery on his MCL and PCL in his right knee on 31 December. A former NHL trainer stated that the "best-case scenario" for Hertl's return was approximately twelve weeks, though Kevin Kurz of CSN Bay Area wrote that Hertl could be out for six to nine months. On 11 April 2014, Hertl was cleared to return to the Sharks against the Colorado Avalanche, ending a 45-game absence. On 17 April, against the Kings, Hertl scored his first career playoff goal.
On 29 June 2016, at the conclusion of his entry-level contract, Hertl agreed to a two-year $6 million extension to remain with the Sharks. He signed a four-year contract extension with the Sharks on 2 July 2018. During the 2018–19 season, Hertl posted 74 points in 77 games as the Sharks advanced to the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Sharks faced off against the Vegas Golden Knights in the first round and in Game 6 Hertl scored a short-handed goal in double overtime to force a Game 7, which the Sharks won 5–4 in overtime. Following this, the Sharks beat the Colorado Avalanche, also in seven games, before being defeated by the St. Louis Blues in the Western Conference Finals.
In January 2020, Hertl participated in the 2020 National Hockey League All-Star Game as an alternate following an injury to teammate Logan Couture; in the Pacific Division's 10–5 semifinal victory over the Central Division, Hertl became the first Sharks player to score four goals in an All-Star Game. On 29 January, he left the Sharks' game against the Canucks with what was revealed to be season-ending tears to the ACL and MCL.
On 16 March 2022, he signed an eight-year contract extension with the Sharks.
International play
Hertl joined the Czech Republic at the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships, scoring 1 goal, as the team finished eighth. The next year, Hertl participated in the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for the Czechs, scoring 3 goals and 2 assists, with the team finishing fifth. He eventually played in the 2013 edition, in which the Czech team finished fifth.
Hertl played with the Czech Republic at the 2013 IIHF World Championship, where he was the youngest player on the team. Due to the knee injury against the Kings in December 2013, Hertl was forced to have surgery and missed out on participating in the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Hertl returned to the Czech team for the 2015 IIHF World Championship.
Hertl was selected to play for the Czech Republic in the 2016 World Cup.
Personal life
In June 2019, Hertl married his fiance Aneta. On 1 July 2020, Hertl and his wife Aneta announced their first pregnancy.

John Rasmussen is a professor of biomechanics at Aalborg University. His research is aimed both at solid mechanics, biomechanics, biomedical engineering and sports engineering.
Education and research
John Rasmussen was educated at Aalborg University, where he graduated as MA in 1986, and three years later received his PhD in computer-aided engineering. In addition to his academic work, John Rasmussen acted as chief executive officer at AnyBody Technology A/S from 2001 to 2008 and subsequently became the CTO of the same company. Furthermore, Rasmussen publishes research on a personal blog.
Rasmussen's research has influenced the theoretical field of structural optimisation in the late 1980s by applying the finite element method as the engine of his research, thus enabling optimisation of practical structures rather than conducting academic examples.
In the late 1990s, he formed the AnyBody Researches Project at Aalborg University, which he is still a leading part of. One of the goals of his research is to develop methods for analysing the biomechanics of the human body involving bones, joints, muscles and tendons.
His research has contributed to the treatment of osteoarthritis, general disability and the optimisation of sports performances. Furthermore, John Rasmussen has initiated a new branch of interdisciplinary biomechanics in cooperation with Aalborg University's Laboratory for Stem Cell Research in the aetiology of pressure ulcers, which has led to new results in tissue engineering.

American Guitar is an album by American guitarist Pat Donohue that was released in 2000.
Reception
Writing for Allmusic, critic Mark Vanderhoff wrote of the album "... a collection of his own compositions and American standards, played in his signature rootsy, jaw-dropping style. While Donohue's own pieces showcase his mastery of fingerpicked acoustic guitar... From start to finish, American Guitar offers top-notch performances that are impressive without being cerebral or sterile. Indeed, a sense of playfulness and fun are present throughout. What really sets Donohue apart from the pack is that he somehow conveys that he's enjoying himself as much as the listener."

"Wandered to LA" is a song by American rapper and singer Juice Wrld and Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released Interscope Records and Grade A Productions as the second single from the former's fourth studio album, Fighting Demons, on December 3, 2021. Juice and Bieber wrote the song with producers Louis Bell and Harv alongside Omer Fedi. Juice first previewed the song in September 2018 before Bieber was added to the song.
Composition and lyrics
"Wandered to LA" is a "glossy pop" song that is set in the key of C major with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Writing for GQ, Grant Rindner felt that the song was "true to the artist Juice was becoming". In the chorus and his verse, Juice details his love for taking drugs. Bieber details putting in the work to make a relationship work in his verse.
Release and promotion
On December 2, 2021, what would have been Juice's 23rd birthday, his team announced the single and its imminent release along with Bieber being added as the co-lead artist. A trailer video was also released on the same day, which details Juice and Bieber separately talking about their respective previous drug addictions and advise their fans to speak out about loneliness.
Critical reception
Writing for Variety, A.D. Amorosi praised Bieber's verse on "Wandered to LA" and said that it was one of his favorites on Fighting Demons, writing that
"the gently jiving and soulful track is there to support Juice's jazziest-ever vocal line, with Bieber offering up a similarly slippery sing-song-iness", adding that "as a guest shot, Bieber and Juice sound as if they're playing off one another – the very point of what a dynamic feature should sound like, whether or not its host is living or deceased". Kyann-Sian Williams of NME opined that over the "breezy guitar strums" of the song, the two artists "detail their relationships", acknowledged Juice rapping about "dark themes" in his verse ("Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up / You see the ghost on her front porch"), but did not agree with Bieber's contribution to the song as the "lines and melodies" in his verse, "although sweet, don't fit in so well with such gothic tone of the song" (“Reminiscing about the days you broke my heart / Thankful that we worked it out – we come so far").

Mark Singleton (1762 – 17 July 1840) was an Anglo-Irish politician. He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain as an MP for the borough of Eye from 1796 to 1799, in the Irish House of Commons in 1800 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the rotten borough of Carysfort in County Wicklow, and then in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as an MP for Eye from 1807 to 1820.
Singleton was the third son of Dublin lawyer Sydenham Singleton (formerly Fowke) and his wife Elizabeth Whyte, only daughter of the Dublin attorney Mark Whyte. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford and at Lincoln's Inn. In 1785 and eloped with Lady Mary Cornwallis, daughter of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, but her father soon endorsed the marriage.
Despite qualifying as a barrister, Singleton turned to the British Army, becoming an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards in 1782. He later served as a major in the Suffolk volunteer cavalry, and a cornet in the Middlesex yeomanry.
Singleton owed his career to the patronage of his father-in-law. After a period as a socialite, Cornwallis's influence secured Singleton's parliamentary seats and his appointment in 1795 as Storekeeper of Ordnance.

SS Platano was a refrigerated banana boat of the United Fruit Company. She was built in 1930, reflagged in 1947, renamed El Toro in 1965 and scrapped in 1966.
Building
Platano was built by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, England, launched on 13 March 1930 and completed that June. United Fruit had a sister ship, , built in the same year by Workman, Clark of Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Platano had turbo-electric transmission built by British Thomson-Houston of Rugby, Warwickshire. Her oil-fired boilers supplied steam to a turbo generator that fed current to a propulsion motor on her single propeller shaft.
Career
Platano was owned by a United Fruit subsidiary, Balboa Shipping Co, Inc, which registered her under the Panamanian flag of convenience. In the Second World War the US War Shipping Administration allocated Platano and Musa to the United States Army Transportation Corps.
On 18 February 1943 the Director of the Naval Transportation Service approved acquiring the two ships as United States Navy auxiliary ships and on 1 March the Auxiliary Vessels Board endorsed the decision. On 16 March the Naval Transportation Service requested that Platano be assigned to the Navy and on 24 March the Auxiliary Vessels Board confirmed this had been done.
Soon the plan was changed, with an older banana boat, SS Ulua being substituted for Musa. On 22 April 1943 the Vice Chief of Naval Operations assigned Platano and Ulua the names and classifications and USS Pictor (AF-27). Ulua was duly acquired, renamed and commissioned into the Navy but Platano was not. The Auxiliary Vessels Board decided on 22 May 1944 to cancel Platanos acquisition, and the cancellation was executed on 26 May.
In 1947 United Fruit reflagged Platano from Panama to the Honduran flag of convenience. By 1964 the company had transferred her from Balboa Shipping to another subsidiary, Empressa Hondurena de Vapores. She kept her original name until 1965, when she was renamed El Toro. She was scrapped in 1966.

The Olean Oilers were a minor league baseball team located in Olean, New York which played primarily in the New York–Pennsylvania League from 1939 to 1966, with a hiatus in 1960. Starting in 1959, the team shared nicknames with its major league affiliates.
A 2012 collegiate team with the same name played in the New York Collegiate Baseball League for several years. Both teams played their home games at Bradner Stadium.
History
Professional team
The team played in the New York–Pennsylvania League from 1939 to 1951 and from 1955 to 1958. The league was known as the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League from 1939 to 1956. Their inaugural home game on 11 May 1939 was played in front of 3,300 spectators.
The Oilers were affiliated with the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1939 to 1948, the St. Louis Browns in 1949, and the Philadelphia Phillies from 1956 to 1958. The Oilers played their home games at Bradner Stadium.
The Oilers' president, Josephine Ross, was the only female president of an affiliated minor league team in 1959.
Collegiate summer team
Starting in 2012, the Olean Oilers name was revived as a member of the New York Collegiate Baseball League. The team began play in the summer of 2012, initially playing on the campus of Saint Bonaventure University before returning to a renovated Bradner Stadium in 2014; a crowd of nearly 2,000 fans watched the Oilers during their first game back at Bradner. In their fourth year of play as an amateur squad, the Oilers won the 2015 NYCBL championship; the next year, the team went on a 24-game winning streak near the beginning of the season, doubling the previous league record, en route to a league record 39 wins and a second consecutive championship, won before a league record 2,876 fans at Bradner. Despite concerns over competitive balance as well as admitted discussions with the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League, the Oilers have shown a general preference to stay in the NYCBL for 2017.

Frank Ernest Howard (1888, Headington, Oxfordshire – 1934, Oxford) was an English architect who worked exclusively in the area of ecclesiastical furnishings and fittings.
He was a pupil of Sir Ninian Compar and carried out much of his work under the auspices of the Warham Guild. He published several books and articles on medieval ecclesiastical architecture and church furnishings which continue to be regarded as authoritative.
Biographical summary
Frank Ernest Howard (1888–1934), commonly referred to as F.E. Howard, was a prolific designer of church furnishings based on his deep knowledge of ecclesiastical art and architecture in the Middle Ages. His work can be found throughout Great Britain but especially within the south of England close to his home base of Oxford where he lived for all his adult life. He also carried out commissions outside the British Isles as a result of his connection with the Warham Guild. His particular expertise and interest was in medieval church woodwork and he was the author, with F.H. Crossley, of an extensive and authoritative work on the subject, English church woodwork : a study in craftsmanship during the mediaeval period A.D. 1250–1550 (1917), a lavishly illustrated volume which was produced to a remarkably high standard, considering its date of publication during the depths of the Great War. Howard was responsible for all of the text and for the majority of the drawings. A second edition appeared in 1927 and was reissued in 1933. A facsimile reprint appeared in 2007, the work still being regarded as an authoritative source on the subject. His other major published work was Mediaeval styles of the English parish church, which was published posthumously in 1936. It is a wide-ranging and detailed guide to the ways in which church architecture evolved during the Middle Ages and is still frequently cited as an authority; a facsimile reprint of this work too appeared in 2007. He was an active member of the Royal Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland from 1909 until his death; he contributed several weighty articles to its transactions, the Archaeological Journal, and presented papers on similar subjects at meetings of the Institute which were not subsequently published.
Howard was a pupil of Sir Ninian Compar whose style and teachings had a strong influence on his own work. He was connected with the Warham Guild following its establishment in 1912 and under its auspices he designed many altars and altar screens (i.e. reredoses), all of which were examples of the English altar favoured by Compar. Further work was carried out for the church fitters, A.R. Mowbray, or was commissioned directly by the churches concerned. His work was always in a medieval style, within which he was capable of producing work that was both historically correct and aesthetically satisfying. As well as designing church furnishings and fittings he was also responsible for the restoration or extension of several churches, work which was always done sensitively and with a feel for the original structure, although by the time he was in a position to undertake such work the opportunities were rare.
Howard died in a nursing home in Oxford at the age of 46 on 15 April 1934. His funeral took place in St Margaret's church, Oxford and he is buried in Abingdon cemetery. Many of his design and working drawings of interior fittings are now held by the English Heritage Archive.

Architectural work
No complete corpus of Howard's work is known to exist. The following list is derived from searches of published works in the fields of church history and architecture (e.g. The Buildings of England and related series) and of the internet. It is very likely that it can be enlarged to a considerable extent from descriptions of his work in local parish histories and similar works. It is also likely that work attributed generically to the Warham Guild, e.g. in Anson's Fashions in church furnishings 1840–1940, p. 312 are in fact by Howard.

Notorhizodon is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period (Givetian stage, about 385 - 391 million years ago). It belonged to the family of Tristichopteridae fishes. Fossils have been found in Antarctica and described by Young et al. in 1992. Notorhizodon probably lived in freshwaters.

A nuclear clock or nuclear optical clock is a notional clock that would use the frequency of a nuclear transition as its reference frequency, in the same manner as an atomic clock uses the frequency of an electronic transition in an atom's shell. Such a clock is expected to be more accurate than the best current atomic clocks by a factor of about 10, with an achievable accuracy approaching the 10−19 level.
The only nuclear state suitable for the development of a nuclear clock using existing technology is thorium-229m, a nuclear isomer of thorium-229 and the lowest-energy nuclear isomer known. With an energy of about 8 eV,
the corresponding ground-state transition is expected to be in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region around 150 nm, which would make it accessible to laser excitation. A comprehensive review can be found in reference.
Principle of operation
Modern optical atomic clocks are by today the most accurate time-keeping devices. Their underlying principle of operation is based on the fact that the energy of an atomic transition (the energy difference between two atomic states) is independent of space and time. The atomic transition energy corresponds to a particular frequency of a light wave, which is required to drive the transition. Therefore, an atomic transition can be excited with the help of laser light, if the laser frequency is exactly matching the frequency corresponding to the energy of the atomic transition. Thus, in turn, the laser frequency can be stabilized to match the corresponding atomic transition energy by continuous verification of a successful laser excitation of the atomic transition. In case of successful stabilization to an atomic transition, the frequency of the laser light will always be the same (independent of space and time).
It is technologically possible to measure the frequency of laser light to extraordinary high accuracy by counting the oscillations of the light wave with the help of a frequency comb. This allows time to be measured simply by counting the number of oscillations of the laser light, that has been stabilized to a particular atomic transition. Such a device is known as optical atomic clock. One prominent example for an optical atomic clock is the ytterbium (Yb) lattice clock, where a particular transition in the ytterbium-171 isotope is used for laser stabilization. In this case, one second has elapsed after exactly oscillations of the laser light stabilized to the corresponding transition. Other examples for optical atomic clocks of the highest accuracy are the ytterbium(Yb)-171 single-ion clock, the strontium(Sr)-87 optical lattice clock and the aluminum(Al)-27 single-ion clock. The achieved accuracies of these clocks vary around 10−18, corresponding to about 1 second of inaccuracy in 30 billion years, significantly longer than the age of the universe.
For a nuclear optical clock the principle of operation remains unchanged, however, with the important difference that a nuclear transition instead of an atomic shell transition is used for laser stabilization. The expected advantage of a nuclear clock compared to an atomic clock is that, figuratively speaking, the atomic nucleus is smaller than the atomic shell by up to five orders of magnitude and therefore (due to small magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments) significantly less affected by external influences like, e.g., electric and magnetic fields. Such external perturbations are the limiting factor for the achieved accuracies of atomic-shell based clocks. Due to this conceptual advantage, a nuclear optical clock is expected to achieve a time accuracy approaching 10−19, a ten-fold improvement over atomic-shell based clocks.
Different nuclear clock concepts
Two different concepts for nuclear optical clocks have been discussed in the literature: trap-based nuclear clocks and solid-state nuclear clocks.
Trap-based nuclear clocks
For a trap-based nuclear clock either a single 229Th ion is trapped in a Paul trap, known as the single-ion nuclear clock, or a chain of multiple ions is trapped, considered as the multiple-ion nuclear clock. Such clocks are expected to achieve the highest time accuracy, as the ions are to a large extent isolated from its environment. A multiple-ion nuclear clock could have a significant advantage over the single-ion nuclear clock in terms of stability performance.
Solid-state nuclear clocks
As the nucleus is largely unaffected by the atomic shell, it is also intriguing to embed many nuclei into a crystal lattice environment. This concept is known as the crystal-lattice nuclear clock. Due to the high density of embedded nuclei of up to 1018 per cm3, this concept would allow irradiating a huge amount of nuclei in parallel, thereby drastically increasing the achievable signal-to-noise ratio, however, on the cost of potentially higher external perturbations. It was also proposed to irradiate a metallic 229Th surface and to probe the isomer's excitation in the internal conversion channel, which is known as the internal-conversion nuclear clock. Both types of solid-state nuclear clocks were shown to offer the potential for comparable performance.
Transition requirements
From the principle of operation of a nuclear optical clock it is evident, that direct laser excitation of a nuclear state is a central requirement for the development of a nuclear clock. Until today no direct nuclear laser excitation has been achieved. The central reason is that the typical energy range of nuclear transitions (keV to MeV) is orders of magnitude above the maximum energy which is accessible with significant intensity by today's narrow-bandwidth laser technology (a few eV). There are only two nuclear excited states known, which possess an extraordinary low excitation energy (below 100 eV). These are 229mTh, a metastable nuclear excited state of the isotope thorium-229 with an excitation energy of only about 8 eV and 235mU, a metastable excited state of Uranium-235 with an energy of 76.7 eV. For nuclear structure reasons, only 229mTh offers a realistic chance for direct nuclear laser excitation.
Further requirements for the development of a nuclear clock are, that the lifetime of the nuclear excited state is relatively long, thereby leading to a resonance of narrow bandwidth (a high quality factor) and that the ground-state nucleus is easily available and sufficiently long-lived to allow to work with moderate quantities of the material. Fortunately, with a radiative lifetime of 103 to 104 seconds of 229mTh and a lifetime of about 7917 years of a 229Th nucleus in its ground state, both conditions are fulfilled for 229mTh, making it an ideal candidate for the development of a nuclear clock.
History
The history of the nuclear clock
A nuclear optical clock based on 229mTh was first proposed in 2003 by E. Peik and C. Tamm, who developed an idea of U. Sterr. The paper contains both concepts, the single-ion nuclear clock, and the solid-state nuclear clock.
In their pioneering work, Peik and Tamm proposed to use individual laser-cooled 229Th3+ ions in a Paul trap to perform nuclear laser spectroscopy. Here the 3+ charge state is advantageous, as it possesses a shell structure suitable for direct laser cooling. It was further proposed to excite an electronic shell state, to achieve 'good' quantum numbers of the total system of the shell plus nucleus that will lead to a reduction of the influence induced by external perturbing fields. A central idea is to probe the successful laser excitation of the nuclear state via the hyperfine-structure shift induced into the electronic shell due to the different nuclear spins of ground- and excited state. This method is known as the double-resonance method.
The expected performance of a single-ion nuclear clock was further investigated in 2012 by C. Campbell et al. with the result that a systematic frequency uncertainty (accuracy) of the clock of 1.5·10−19 could be achieved, which would be by about an order of magnitude better than the accuracy achieved by the best optical atomic clocks today. The nuclear clock approach proposed by Campbell et al. slightly differs from the original one proposed by Peik and Tamm. Instead of exciting an electronic shell state in order to obtain the highest insensitivity against external perturbing fields, the nuclear clock proposed by Campbell et al. uses a stretched pair of nuclear hyperfine states in the electronic ground-state configuration, which appears to be advantageous in terms of the achievable quality factor and an improved suppression of the quadratic Zeeman shift.
The solid-state nuclear clock approach was further developed in 2010 by W.G. Rellergert et al. with the result of an expected long-term accuracy of about 2·10−16. Although expected to be less accurate than the single-ion nuclear clock approach due to line-broadening effects and temperature shifts in the crystal lattice environment, this approach may have advantages in terms of compactness, robustness and power consumption. The expected stability performance was investigated by G. Kazakov et al. in 2012. In 2020, the development of an internal conversion nuclear clock was proposed.
Important steps on the road towards a nuclear clock were a precision gamma-ray spectroscopy experiment which allowed to determine the isomeric energy to 7.8±0.5 eV, the successful direct laser cooling of 229Th3+ ions in a Paul trap achieved in 2011, the direct detection of the 229mTh decay in 2016 and a first detection of the isomer-induced hyperfine-structure shift, enabling the double-resonance method to probe a successful nuclear excitation in 2018. In 2019, the isomer's energy was measured via the detection of internal conversion electrons emitted in its direct ground-state decay to 8.28±0.17 eV. Also a first successful excitation of the 29 keV nuclear excited state of 229Th via synchrotron radiation was reported. In 2020, an energy of 8.10±0.17 eV was obtained from precision gamma-ray spectroscopy.
The history of 229mTh
Since 1976, the 229Th nucleus has been known to possess a low energy excited state, which was constrained to be of below 10 eV excitation energy in 1990 and for which an energy value of 3.5±1.0 eV was determined in 1994. As early as 1996 it was proposed to use the nuclear excitation as a highly stable source of light for metrology by E.V. Tkalya.
At the time of the nuclear clock proposal in 2003 the parameters of 229mTh, in particular its energy, were not known to sufficient precision to allow for nuclear laser spectroscopy of individual thorium ions and thus the development of a nuclear clock. This fact triggered a multitude of experimental efforts to pin down the excited state's parameters like energy and half-life. The detection of light emitted in the direct decay of 229mTh would significantly help to determine its energy to higher precision, however until today all efforts failed to observe a secure signal of light emitted in the decay of 229mTh. The failure of early experiments to observe any direct 229mTh decay signal can partly be explained by a correction of the energy value to 7.6±0.5 eV in 2007 (slightly shifted to 7.8±05 eV in 2009). However, also all recent experiments failed to observe any signal of light emitted in the direct decay, potentially pointing towards a strong non-radiative decay channel. In 2012 and again in 2018 the detection of light emitted in the decay of 229mTh was reported, but the observed signals are subject to controversial discussions within the community.
A direct detection of electrons as being emitted in the isomer's internal conversion decay channel was achieved in 2016. This detection laid the foundation for the determination of the 229mTh half-life in neutral, surface-bound atoms in 2017 and a first laser-spectroscopic characterization in 2018. In 2019 an improved energy value based on internal-conversion-electron spectroscopy could be determined. Also, a secure excitation of the isomer via population of the 29 keV state with synchrotron radiation was achieved. More recently, two additional papers about the isomeric energy were published.
Applications
When operational, a nuclear optical clock is expected to be applicable in various fields. Potential applications may arise in the field where already today's atomic clocks are in operation, like e.g., satellite-based navigation or data transfer. However, also potentially new applications may arise in the fields of relativistic geodesy, the search for topological dark matter, or the determination of time-variations of fundamental constants.
Especially a high sensitivity of a nuclear clock for potential time variations of fundamental constants, e.g., the fine-structure constant, has been highlighted. The central idea is that a nuclear transition couples differently to the fine-structure constant than an atomic shell transition does. For this reason a comparison of the frequency of a nuclear clock with an atomic clock could lead to an extraordinary high sensitivity for potential time variations of the fine structure constant. The achievable factor of sensitivity, however, remains subject to speculation. A recent measurement is consistent with enhancement factors between 1 (no enhancement) and 104.

Newton Longville is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about south-west of Bletchley.
History
The toponym "Newton" is derived from the Old English for "new farm". It is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Nevtone. The affix "Longville" was added in the 13th century after the Cluniac priory of Longueville, Calvados, in Normandy, France, that held the manor of Newton at that time, and to distinguish this village from other places called Newton, particularly nearby Newton Blossomville. In 1441, when its previous holder died without an heir, the Crown bestowed the manor on the Warden and fellows of New College, Oxford.
Parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Faith are late 12th century, but the exterior is largely Perpendicular Gothic.
Newton Longville has a number of cruck-framed thatched houses dating from the mid to late 15th century, with good examples at Moor End.
Newton Longville is twinned with Longueville-sur-Scie in Normandy, France.
The main industry in the village between 1847 and 1991 was brick making. The village had a large brick factory, originally belonging to the Read family, becoming the Bletchley Brick company in 1923, and then taken over by the London Brick Company (LBC) in 1929. The works made Fletton bricks and distributed them all over the country. It was closed in November 1991 after Hanson Trust bought the London Brick Company.
Amenities
Newton Longville Church of England Combined School is a mixed, voluntary controlled primary school, that takes children between the ages of four and eleven. It has slightly over 200 pupils.
Salden Chase
In 2009 Buckinghamshire County Council proposed a new settlement called "Salden Chase" outside Newton Longville, however due to an extended planning process work has not commenced on the development.

Bruce Channel ( ; born November 28, 1940) is an American singer-songwriter best known for his 1962 million-selling number-one hit record, "Hey! Baby".
Career
Channel performed originally for the radio program Louisiana Hayride and then joined with the harmonica player Delbert McClinton, singing country music. Channel wrote "Hey! Baby" with Margaret Cobb in 1959 and performed the song for two years before recording it for Fort Worth record producer Bill Smith. It was issued originally on Smith's LeCam label, but as it started to sell well, it was acquired for distribution by Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury. The song went to number one in the US in March 1962 and held that position for three weeks. Besides topping the U.S. popular music charts, it also became number two in the United Kingdom. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. Channel had four more singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including "Number One Man" (which peaked at number 52), "Come On Baby" (number 98), "Going Back to Louisiana" (number 89), and "Mr. Bus Driver" (number 90, produced by Dale Hawkins in Memphis and recorded by Terry Manning), but none of them was as successful as "Hey! Baby", and he is considered a one-hit wonder.
Channel toured Europe and was assisted at one gig by the Beatles, who were then little known. John Lennon, who had "Hey! Baby" on his jukebox, was fascinated by McClinton's harmonica. A popular legend is that Lennon was taught to play harmonica by McClinton, but by that time Lennon had already been playing the instrument live for some time. The harmonica segment in "Hey! Baby" inspired Lennon's playing on the Beatles' first single, 1962's "Love Me Do", as well as later Beatles records, and the harmonica break on Frank Ifield's "I Remember You."
Channel's only other top 40 recording in the UK Singles Chart was "Keep On" (June 1968), which reached number 12; it was written by Wayne Carson Thompson and produced by Dale Hawkins. "Keep On" also charted in Australia. Channel disliked touring, so he settled as a songwriter in Nashville, scoring a number of Broadcast Music Incorporated award-winning songs during the 1970s and 1980s – "As Long As I'm Rockin' with You", for John Conlee; "Don't Worry 'bout Me Baby", for Janie Fricke; "Party Time", for T. G. Sheppard; "You're the Best", for Kieran Kane; and "Stand Up", for Mel McDaniel. In 1987, "Hey! Baby" was featured in the popular movie Dirty Dancing.
In 1995, Channel recorded his cover of the song "Stand Up" for the Memphis-based record label Ice House. Delbert McClinton reprised his harmonica role on it and several other tracks, including another version of "Hey! Baby". Channel then recorded a project in 2002 with the singer-songwriter Larry Henley (ex-Newbeats), billed as Original Copy.
Channel was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He continues to perform in cruises with other 1960s musicians.

The Willows Sports Complex, currently known as 1300SMILES Stadium through sponsorship, is a grass football stadium situated in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. It has been a predominant rugby league ground as the home ground of the North Queensland Cowboys National Rugby League club. The ground has also been used for rugby union and soccer. From 2009 to 2011, A-League football club North Queensland Fury called it home. Since inception as a rugby league ground, the ground has had sponsored naming rights: Stockland Stadium (1995–97), Malanda Stadium (1998) and Dairy Farmers Stadium (1999–2013). The last NRL match to be played at 1300SMILES Stadium was on Thursday 29 August 2019 between the North Queensland Cowboys and Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs.
History
Willows Sporting Complex
Prior to 1995, the stadium site was occupied by the Willows Sporting Complex. It hosted trotting paceway nights, and was the main pacing venue for the Townsville District. With the admission of the North Queensland Cowboys to the Australian Rugby League competition in 1995, the Willows site was transformed into a basic rugby league venue with a western grandstand as well as eastern side terraces. The northern and southern ends had sloped grass hills.
Stockland Stadium
The Willows Sports Complex was renamed "Stockland Stadium" in 1995 through sponsorship linked with the North Queensland Cowboys. A contract was signed by the Stockland Trust Group for three years giving them the naming rights of the venue. The Joint Board of the old Willows Sports Complex (Townsville City Council and Thuringowa City Council) sub-leased the facility to the Cowboys Rugby League Football Limited, who manage the venue on a day-to-day basis. The first stage of development was funded by a combination of borrowings by the Joint Board, the Queensland Government grants and a considerable amount of community and business donations.
The stadium was first used for any type of football for the North Queensland Cowboys first home game which attracted a crowd of 23,156, a good crowd by Australian Rugby League (now National Rugby League) standards. Crowds continued to push the capacity of the stadium and in 1996 Stockland Stadium was renovated to include both northern and southern seating, where previously there had been only standing room.
Stockland Stadium had the honour of hosting the first-ever game of the only Super League season on 1 March 1997 when the Cowboys hosted new team the Adelaide Rams in front of 17,738 fans. After trailing 16–4 at half time the Cowboys eventually prevailed 24–16.
Stockland ended their sponsorship after three years, which paved the way for long-term sponsor, Dairy Farmers Limited.
Malanda Stadium
The North Queensland Cowboys home stadium sponsor Stockland finished up their sponsorship contract seeing out their three-year deal. A new sponsorship deal was signed with local milking organisation Dairy Farmers who owned the local North Queensland milking dairy in the Tablelands. Season 1998 saw the stadium renamed with a new sponsorship deal "Malanda Stadium". Following the purchase of Malanda Milk by Dairy Farmers, the ground was renamed "Dairy Farmers Stadium".
Dairy Farmers Stadium
Many stages of redevelopment were taken on and gradually completed over the Cowboys growing success. The venue had changed from a disused Harness Racing facility to the current complex. The management and operation of the stadium was handed over to Stadiums Queensland in December 2003 in the hope for more cash inflow and government spending.
In 2005 the eastern terraces were extended, a new replay screen invested, public address system installed, 30 more corporate boxes and upgraded catering facilities as part of the funding injection. The lighting facilities were upgraded for night time broadcasts. 2006 saw the eastern, northern and southern grandstands receiving even further upgrades with the fitting of extra seating and the eastern terrace was extended completely taking over the old eastern hill.
Two of Papua New Guinea's 2008 Rugby League World Cup Group A games were played at Dairy Farmers Stadium, one against England and the other against Australia.
During the 2011 NRL season a capacity crowd attended Darren Lockyer's record-setting 350th NRL match at the ground.
1300SMILES Stadium
It was announced on 19 February 2013 that 1300SMILES had signed a five-year deal for naming rights, bringing Dairy Farmers' fifteen years to an end. 1300SMILES is an Australian dentistry business headquartered in Townsville.
Replacement
A redeveloped stadium was featured as part of Australia's 2022 FIFA World Cup bid. The planning for the bid identified several issues with the existing stadium, particularly sub standard facilities, congestion and limited transport access. Stadiums Queensland identified that some form of redevelopment or replacement was necessary regardless of the failed World Cup bid. In 2011, the Cowboys in conjunction with Stadiums Queensland developed a $185 million plan to replace the aging Dairy Farmers Stadium. The proposed ground would be located at the Saunders Street QR National site close to the Townsville CBD, as part of an urban renewal plan. The existing QR National rail yards are to be relocated in accordance with the Townsville Port Authority Master Plan 2010–2040.
In 2016 a replacement was funded by the Queensland State Government and the Federal Government, the resulting North Queensland Stadium began construction in 2017, with the opening in February 2020, with the first event being an Elton John concert, and the North Queensland Cowboys rugby league team hosting its first game in Round 1 of the 2020 NRL Season against Queensland rivals the Brisbane Broncos.
As at early 2020 the future of the stadium is still unclear with prior reports suggesting it could be used for a new school or redeveloped for housing.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, the carpark at the stadium is being used for a drive-through coronavirus assessment clinic.
On the 25th January 2022, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced a $30 million investment to turn the stadium into a state-of-the-art Queensland Police hub.

Uses
Rugby league
1300SMILES Stadium was predominantly used as a rugby league ground, having been the home ground of the North Queensland Cowboys in the National Rugby League competition, and the North Queensland Young Guns in the Queensland Cup competition. The stadium also hosted an Australian Test match against Papua New Guinea in 2000, an Australian XIII match in 2005, the Super League World 9's tournament in 1997 and charity fixtures with State of Origin Legend matches and Australia Legends v New Zealand Legends. It also hosted England vs Papua New Guinea in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.
With 2012 being an Olympic year and the games being held in London, the annual Rugby League Four Nations, usually held at the end of the NRL season, was not scheduled as a result. This has resulted in an end-of-year test between Australia and New Zealand being scheduled to be held at the Dairy Farmers Stadium on 13 October for its first international match since the 2008 World Cup.
Rugby League Test Matches
List of rugby league test matches played at the stadium.
Rugby union
The stadium was first used for first class rugby union when the touring British and Irish Lions team played a Queensland President's XV team in 2001. In 2003 a number of matches, which involved Japan in the Rugby Union World Cup were played at the ground, averaging a crowd of 19,249. On 12 May 2006 the Queensland Reds played a Super 14 match at Dairy Farmers Stadium in front of a crowd of 10,580. In June 2007 the stadium hosted Australia A and Japan in the IRB Pacific Nations Cup.
Rugby World Cup
The Willows Sports Complex hosted three Pool B games from the 2003 Rugby World Cup which was held in Australia.
Touch Football
The North Queensland Cowboys NRL Touch Premiership touch football sides (men's and women's) have played their home games out of 1300SMILES since the premierships inaugural season in 2018. The first games were played on Saturday, 19 May 2018, with both the men's and women's sides taking on the Gold Coast Titans.
Football (Soccer)
Australia national under-23 soccer team friendly.
In 2009, the stadium became home to Townsville's new club, the North Queensland Fury who played in the A-League, the nation's premier soccer competition. Their licence was revoked in March 2011.

A hybrid integrated circuit (HIC), hybrid microcircuit, hybrid circuit or simply hybrid is a miniaturized electronic circuit constructed of individual devices, such as semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors, diodes or monolithic ICs) and passive components (e.g. resistors, inductors, transformers, and capacitors), bonded to a substrate or printed circuit board (PCB). A PCB having components on a Printed Wiring Board (PWB) is not considered a true hybrid circuit according to the definition of MIL-PRF-38534.
Overview
"Integrated circuit" as the term is currently used refers to a monolithic IC which differs notably from a HIC in that a HIC is fabricated by inter-connecting a number of components on a substrate whereas an IC's (monolithic) components are fabricated in a series of steps entirely on a single wafer which is then diced into chips. Some hybrid circuits may contain monolithic ICs, particularly Multi-chip module (MCM) hybrid circuits.
Hybrid circuits could be encapsulated in epoxy, as shown in the photo, or in military and space applications, a lid was soldered onto the package. A hybrid circuit serves as a component on a PCB in the same way as a monolithic integrated circuit; the difference between the two types of devices is in how they are constructed and manufactured. The advantage of hybrid circuits is that components which cannot be included in a monolithic IC can be used, e.g., capacitors of large value, wound components, crystals, inductors. In military and space applications, numerous integrated circuits, transistors and diodes, in their die form, would be placed on either a ceramic or beryllium substrate. Either gold or aluminum wire would be bonded from the pads of the IC, transistor, or diode to the substrate.
Thick film technology is often used as the interconnecting medium for hybrid integrated circuits. The use of screen printed thick film interconnect provides advantages of versatility over thin film although feature sizes may be larger and deposited resistors wider in tolerance. Multi-layer thick film is a technique for further improvements in integration using a screen printed insulating dielectric to ensure connections between layers are made only where required. One key advantage for the circuit designer is complete freedom in the choice of resistor value in thick film technology. Planar resistors are also screen printed and included in the thick film interconnect design. The composition and dimensions of resistors can be selected to provide the desired values. The final resistor value is determined by design and can be adjusted by laser trimming. Once the hybrid circuit is fully populated with components, fine tuning prior to final test may be achieved by active laser trimming.
Thin film technology was also employed in the 1960s. Ultra Electronics manufactured circuits using a silica glass substrate. A film of tantalum was deposited by sputtering followed by a layer of gold by evaporation. The gold layer was first etched following the application of a photoresist to form solder compatible connection pads. Resistive networks were formed, also by a photoresist and etching process. These were trimmed to a high precision by selective adonization of the film. Capacitors and semiconductors were in the form of LID (Leadless Inverted Devices) soldered to the surface by selectively heating the substrate from the underside. Completed circuits were potted in a diallyl phthalate resin. Several customized passive networks were made using these techniques as were some amplifiers and other specialized circuits. It is believed that some passive networks were used in the engine control units manufactured by Ultra Electronics for Concorde.
Some modern hybrid circuit technologies, such as LTCC-substrate hybrids, allow for embedding of components within the layers of a multi-layer substrate in addition to components placed on the surface of the substrate. This technology produces a circuit that is, to some degree, three-dimensional.
Other electronic hybrids
In the early days of telephones, separate modules containing transformers and resistors were called hybrids or hybrid coils; they have been replaced by semiconductor integrated circuits.
In the early days of transistors the term hybrid circuit was used to describe circuits with both transistors and vacuum tubes; e.g., an audio amplifier with transistors used for voltage amplification followed by a vacuum tube power output stage, as suitable power transistors were not available. This usage, and the devices, are obsolete, however amplifiers that use a tube preamplifier stage coupled with a solid state output stage are still in production, and are called hybrid amplifiers in reference to this.

The Silent Force is the third studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation, released on 15 November 2004, by GUN Records. On 5 August 2008, The Silent Force along with Mother Earth were released in the United States by Roadrunner Records. This album is the first to feature Ruud Jolie on lead guitar, as well as Martijn Spierenburg on keyboards, after Martijn Westerholt had to leave the band due to illness. It is also the first to feature Daniel Gibson as their producer. The album deepened the band symphonic approach, this time featuring more atmospheric songs that resemble the predominant fantasistic lyrics, inspired both by literature and the band members personal lives.
The album spawned three singles that helped to increase the band's popularity in Europe, all of them achieving commercial success in their homeland and several other European countries. The first single, "Stand My Ground", was released in November 2004 and reached the fourth position on the Dutch Top 40. The second single, "Memories", was released on 31 January 2005. The third and final single, "Angels", was released on 13 June 2005. In order to promote the album, the band commenced their The Silent Force Tour in July 2004, playing throughout Europe and also having one concert in Dubai.
The album was met with generally favorable reviews and commercial success, increasing the band's popularity outside the Netherlands. Metal Hammer considered the album important both for Within Temptation's career and the development of the symphonic metal genre as a whole, a position shared by AllMusic. Only one week after its release, the album reached gold status in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Finland, later also achieving double platinum status in their homecountry and gold status in Germany.
Production and recording
The times preceding the composition and the release of The Silent Force were eventful for the band. After some line-up changes and the commercial and critical success of Mother Earth, released at the end of 2000, the band had been feeling pressured and vulnerable, as playing music was considered mainly a hobby for the members up to then. In addition to that, they had also switched labels, from Dutch independent DSFA Records to German GUN Records, which could promote them on a greater scale. This transition was met with contractual turmoil, as the band was still inexperient and their lawyers were not specialized in working inside the music industry.
Plans for the band's third album came to fruition in 2004, and the band entered the studio in the summer that year. Writing took four to five months and recording took eight weeks. The band considered it a dark and tense time, as they were daily shutting themselves in an all-closed studio from 9am to 11pm and having their meals there. According to lead vocalist Sharon den Adel, the darkness of the studio itself contributed to enhance the gloomy feeling that dominated the band at the time.
Now signed to a bigger label, the budget for the recording sessions was improved. Due to that, the band were able to deepen the symphonic inclinations they already had and record with a full orchestra instead of using computerised orchestral sounds. It was, however, a challenging process, as the album was being recorded in the outskirts of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and the orchestra was situated in Moscow, Russia. The process of sending and receiving musical files was slow and laborious, due to the great size of the files and the low internet speed at that time. In spite of considering it stressful, den Adel commented that it all worked out really well in the end, and that the band grow a lot as musicians from that experience. It was the band's first album to be produced by Daniel Gibson.
Lyrics and inspiration
Lyrically, the album took inspiration in fantasy, literature, and the band members personal lives. According to den Adel, the title of the album refers to the forces that sometimes lead people to do certain things. In an interview on Buzznet, she discussed the title of the album:
"The title of our latest album 'The Silent Force' is actually taken from the title of a book from the beginning of the 19th century from a Dutch writer (who lived in Indonesia when he was young) called Louis Couperus. All the songs on this album are in some way related to that book (or at least the title)."
In an interview with Metal Hammer, den Adel commented that the depressing times the band members were undergoing during the writing and recording process reflected on the dark tone in the lyrics of the album. The political turmoil that the Netherlands were facing after the Assassination of Pim Fortuyn also impacted the band. Despite not agreeing with Fortuyn political views, the members were fearing for their future and also the future of their country. This topic was addressed on the song "Stand My Ground". "Angels" is a song about betrayal. It deals with the fact that people one trusts often show themselves untrustworthy. Although the song is written through metaphors, as the band usually do, it was insipired by the record label disputes the band had with their previous label. The song starts with "a fragile falsetto from Sharon" and later builds "into an emotional, symphonic anthem". The song "Aquarius" addresses den Adel's relation of love and fear with the ocean, a fear she developed after watching Jaws as a child.
Release and promotion
In support of the release, the band embarked on a large international tour which spanned from 2004 to 2006, with dates across Europe, including their first festival appearance in the United Kingdom, headlining Bloodstock Open Air, and a one-off show in Dubai. "Stand My Ground" and "Memories", the first singles from the new album, continued the band's run of chart success in the Netherlands, culminating in a second Edison Award. The third single was "Angels". "Stand My Ground" was later to be promoted on the trailer for the film Blood and Chocolate. The band also provided some of the sound track to the videogame Knights of the Temple: Infernal Crusade, released in March 2005. As of 2005, the album had already sold more than 400.000 copies only in Europe.
In January 2006, Within Temptation won the Dutch Pop Prize ( the best Dutch pop contribution) and Dutch Export Prize (best-selling Dutch artist outside the Netherlands); the latter one given to them for the third time in a row. The band also reported that they would start playing at festivals starting in April, in addition to going on an international tour at the end of the year. On 5 August 2008, The Silent Force was released in the US for the first time through Roadrunner Records.
The following music videos were released to promote the album and the tour:
"Stand My Ground"
"Angels"
"Memories"
"Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)" (promo video for the DVD The Silent Force Tour)
On 5 April 2019, "The Silent Force" was released on vinyl for the first time from Music On Vinyl. A limited edition of 5000 copies on clear vinyl were pressed. Inner Sleeve folded as poster with credits and lyrics.
Reception
The album earned generally positive reviews from critics. Critic Martin White from Blabbermouth.net gave the album a score of 9 out of 10 stars, stating that "amazingly enough, the thick instrumentation and Sharon's angelic delivery are never at odds with each other — a rare feat when it comes to music as complex and involved as Within Temptation's is." Although, the listeners rating from Blabbermouth earned a score of merely 6.5 stars out of 10.
The webzine Lords of Metal was very positive and gave the album 94 out of 100, stating that the album is "one of the most outstanding cds's of the year". The website also compared the album with the two previous albums Mother Earth and Enter alleging that "it lacks the variety of Enter or the finesse of Mother Earth – but it remains one of the best albums recorded on Dutch soil in the last ten years."
A review coming from Metal Storm webzine was less positive, saying that it's just "a good album" and stating that the band "lost their magic in their new songs" in comparison with what the band did in their previous albums.
Legacy
As of the tenth anniversary of the album release, The Silent Force received a homage article by TeamRock's Metal Hammer magazine regarding its influence both on Within Temptation's career, the heavy metal genre and symphonic metal subgenre itself. In July 2016, Metal Hammer also released a special issue edition claiming the 100 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century in which The Silent Force was awarded the 33th place, over its influence and commercial success. On regarding the ten essential symphonic metal releases, the magazine also found a place for the album, characterizing it as an "uplifting symphonic-based style that was rendered all the more saleable by the irresistible voice and presence of Sharon den Adel." In 2021, the magazine ranked it as the 5th best symphonic metal album of all time.

The 1934 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election occurred on November 6, 1934. Incumbent Republican governor Gifford Pinchot was not a candidate for re-election. Democratic candidate George Howard Earle III defeated Republican candidate William A. Schnader to become Governor of Pennsylvania. This was the first Pennsylvania gubernatorial election won by the Democratic Party since 1890.
Election eve was marred by the Kelayres massacre, where the local small-town Republican boss and his family fired pistols, rifles and shotguns upon a Democratic rally and parade, killing three that night, and leaving at least a dozen more seriously wounded. News of the attack was front-page headlines across the nation. In Pennsylvania, the attack was strongly politicized in Democratic newspapers and on the radio. There were numerous reports of Republicans voting Democratic due to the attack. Schnader, as incumbent Attorney General, was forced to comment on the attack in strong terms, and to the end of his life, believed the attack cost him the election.

Franco Rocchetta (born Venice, 12 April 1947) is an Italian politician, entrepreneur, philologist and history populariser, who is usually described as the "father" of present-day Venetian nationalism and independentism.
Early life and political career
Since his university years, Rocchetta has been a Venetist, a Europeanist, and a passionate of historical, archeological and linguistic studies, and, as such, he was active in Radical and green movements. Before coming of age, he was investigated for separatist writings on walls and for his solidarity with South Tyrolean activists.
During the 1960s he was a member of the Italian Republican Party and the Italian Communist Party, which he left in order to join Lotta Continua in 1969.
In 1978 Rocchetta founded the "Venetian Philological Society" (of which he was elected president).
Liga Veneta and Lega Nord
In 1980 Rocchetta, who had been a candidate in the list led by Valdostan Union in the 1979 European Parliament election, was instrumental in the foundation of Liga Veneta, whose goal was to reorganise an independent Venetian Republic within a federal Europe. Rocchetta was thus Liga Veneta's long-time national president and practical leader, having seized party's control over Achille Tramarin in 1984 and having been elected to the Regional Council of Veneto in 1985.
Having been a founding member of Lega Nord, along with Umberto Bossi, Franco Castellazzi, Giorgio Conca, Gipo Farassino, Riccardo Fragassi, Marilena Marin, Bruno Ravera, Francesco Speroni and Carla Uccelli, in 1989, Rocchetta led Liga Veneta into Lega Nord, which became a federation from a confederation, in 1991. During the party's founding federal congress, he was elected federal president, a role he would keep until 1994. In the 1992 general election he was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies and, after the 1994 general election, he joined Berlusconi I Cabinet as undersecretary of Foreign Affairs.
In July 1994, after years of juxtaposition with federal secretary Bossi on several institutional, organisational, ethnic, ethic and economic issues, Rocchetta left the party before the end of a congress in which his wife and protégé Marilena Marin was replaced by Fabrizio Comencini as national secretary. After his exit from Lega Nord, he unsuccessfully launched Liga Nathion Veneta. He later joined the Federalists and Liberal Democrats and National Alliance, prior to leaving politics.
Post-Lega Nord activity
Having left the Italian Parliament following the 1996 general election, Rocchetta, while continuing to be an active spokesman for Venetian nationalism, focused on pacifism and antimilitarism. In particular, in 1999 he went to Belgrade for what he described as a "mission of peace", along with some left-wing pacifists, notably including Luca Casarini, Gianfranco Bettin and Vitaliano Della Sala. With his "Center for International Studies" dedicated to Paolo Sarpi, Rocchetta organised several initiatives with representatives of minorities, notably including those with Ibrahim Rugova in favour of a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Kosovo. In 1999 Rocchetta was instrumental in the awarding to Rugova of the honorary citizenship of Venice by then-mayor Massimo Cacciari.
Between the 1990s and the 2000s Rocchetta was honorary consul of the Republic of Macedonia in Venice.
In 2013 Rocchetta returned to active politics after virtually 20 years of absence from the political scene as a member of Plebiscite 2013, a cross-party committee which organised the 2014 referendum on Veneto's independence, which saw the participation of 63.2% of eligible voters and the support of 89.1% among them. Later on Rocchetta, along with Andrea Arman and Giovanni Dalla-Valle, distanced from the Venetist organisation over disagreements with the "Delegation of Ten".
In the 2014 centre-left primary election for selecting the candidate for President of Veneto, Rocchetta voted for Simonetta Rubinato, who lost to Alessandra Moretti.
2014 arrest for alleged terrorism
On 2 April 2014, ten days after the 2014 Venetian independence referendum was held, Rocchetta was arrested, along with a group of Venetian separatists (including leading members of the Venetian Most Serene Government and the European Federalist Free Entrepreneurs), for suspected crimes including criminal association for terrorism and subversion of the democratic order. On 18 April Rocchetta, who had declared his innocence and pacifism since the beginning, was released from prison as a tribunal in Brescia did not uphold the accusations.

Scientology has been referenced in popular culture in many different forms of media including fiction, film, music, television and theatre. In the 1960s, author William S. Burroughs wrote about Scientology in both fictional short stories and non-fictional essays. The topic was dealt with more directly in his book, Ali's Smile/Naked Scientology. The 2000 film Battlefield Earth was an adaptation of a novel by L. Ron Hubbard.
Musicians and playwrights have made reference to Scientology on some of their work, with some pieces treating the topic in a negative light by their references, and at least one in a positive manner. Frank Zappa's 1979 concept album/rock opera Joe's Garage lampoons Scientology in the song "A Token of My Extreme". Scientologist Chick Corea has made reference to Scientology in his work, and two of his albums were influenced by L. Ron Hubbard novels. Maynard James Keenan of the metal band Tool, has been critical of Scientology, and the 1996 song "Ænema" contains a negative reference to L. Ron Hubbard. Both Scientology and the life of its founder L. Ron Hubbard were addressed in the 2003 Off-Broadway musical, A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant. The play took a tongue-in-cheek look at both Hubbard's life and the history of the Church, and received an Obie Award in 2004.
Scientology has also been dealt with in fictional television shows, including sitcoms, cartoons, and dramas. The 2005 South Park episode "Trapped in the Closet" dealt with Scientology, and related the story of Xenu. This episode resulted in a deal of controversy, including the departure of Isaac Hayes, and questions over why the episode was not initially rebroadcast. In season four of the television program Nip/Tuck, characters Kimber and Matt join the Church of Scientology. Issues addressed within Nip/Tuck have included both the Xenu story and a look at deprogramming. In Boston Legal's third season, character Alan Shore helps defend an employer sued for discrimination after firing a Scientologist. The episode delves into some of the employee's more eccentric beliefs as well as a debate on religious bigotry, but Shore ends up winning the case for his client. In the radio sitcom Old Harry's Game, Satan claims he invented Scientology.
Fiction
William S. Burroughs, who briefly dabbled with Scientology, wrote extensively about it during the late 1960s, weaving some of its jargon into his fictional works, as well as authoring non-fiction essays about it. In the end, however, he abandoned Scientology and publicly eschewed it in an editorial for the Los Angeles Free Press in 1970. Burroughs' work Ali's Smile/Naked Scientology contains many writings related to both Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard.
"Operation Freakout", also known as "Operation PC Freakout", was the name given by the Church of Scientology to a covert plan intended to have the author Paulette Cooper imprisoned or committed to a mental institution. The plan, undertaken in 1976 following years of Church-initiated lawsuits and covert harassment, was meant to eliminate the perceived threat that Cooper posed to the Church and obtain revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, The Scandal of Scientology. The events of Operation Freakout are featured, in a thinly fictionalized form, in Giuseppe Genna's 2004 novel In the Name of Ishmael. Scientology is referred to as "Science Religion", Cooper is called "Paulette Rowling" and Mary Sue Hubbard is "Johanna Lewis". The book includes an almost word-for-word transcription of the Operation Freakout planning document of April 1, 1976, with the names of the principal figures substituted as described above.
In the science-fiction setting of Count Zero, a cyberpunk novel by author William Gibson, one of the character's relatives is mentioned to be a Scientologist. L. Ron Hubbard (referred to simply as "Hubbard") is also mentioned as an option of a possible hologram that could appear over someone's bed, another choice included the Virgin Mary.
Film
Scientology is mentioned on a tape recording played in a scene in the 1974 feature The Terminal Man, starring George Segal.
In reviews of the 1999 film Bowfinger, some critics compared the fictional organization "MindHead" to the Church of Scientology. In the film, producer Bobby Bowfinger, played by Steve Martin, encounters difficulties involving actor Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy. Paul Clinton writes in CNN online: "'Bowfinger' could just be viewed as an out-there, over-the-top spoof about Hollywood, films, celebrities and even the Church of Scientology. But Martin has written a sweet story about a group of outsiders with impossible dreams." Andrew O'Hehir writes in Salon that "Too much of 'Bowfinger' involves the filmmakers' generically wacky pursuit of the increasingly paranoid Kit, who flees into the clutches of a pseudo-Scientology outfit called MindHead (their slogan: 'Truth Through Strength')." The Denver Post describes the Kit Ramsey character as "...petulant, paranoid and pampered, like any good star, and also a devotee of a Scientology-like religion." In a review in the San Francisco Chronicle, Wesley Morris describes Ramsey's organization as "a mock-Scientology cult called MindHead - a bit that sprung from Martin's own issues with MENSA." The Albuquerque Journal describes the MindHead organization "a rather thinly veiled but nevertheless amusing blast at Scientology," and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram characterizes it as an "organization that comes across as a thinly veiled send-up of Scientology."
Some critics perceived the 2000 film Bless the Child to be mocking Scientology because the fictionalized cult "The New Dawn" in the film mimicked Scientology's symbols and rhetoric. The following year in 2001, a film titled The Profit parodied Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard.
Paul Thomas Anderson's 2012 film The Master features a religious organization called "The Cause" that has many similarities to Scientology. Also, the character of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman shares a physical resemblance to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.
Two other films that feature new religious movements similar to Scientology are Schizopolis, and The L.A. Complex.
Music
Frank Zappa's 1979 concept album/rock opera Joe's Garage lampoons Scientology in the song "A Token of My Extreme". Zappa uses terminology such as "L. Ron Hoover" and "Appliantology", telling the main character "Joe" that he "must go into the closet" to pursue his latent appliance fetishism. Gary Numan had popular songs laced with Scientology references in the 1980s such as "Me! I Disconnect from You", "Praying to the Aliens", and "Only a Downstat", influenced directly by William S. Burroughs' Scientology-based writings.
The progressive metal band Tool has voiced criticism of Scientology. After releasing their first full-length album Undertow in 1993, the band began touring to promote their new work. In May 1993, Tool was scheduled to play the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the Garden Pavilion belonged to the Church of Scientology, which the band felt clashed with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being". The band's vocalist Maynard James Keenan recalled that he "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience". Scott Schalin reported in Bay Area Music: "Between songs, Keenan, staring first at the lush grounds paid for by devoted L. Ron followers and then into the eyes of his own audience, bayed into the mic like a sheep looking for his shepherd's gate. "Baaaaa! Baaaaa!" the singer bleated." The lyrics to the Tool song "Ænema" contain the phrase: "Fuck L. Ron Hubbard, Fuck all his clones."
Television
An organization with similarities to Scientology, called Selfosophy, was a central part of an episode from the second season of Millennium that aired on the Fox network on November 21, 1997, entitled "Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense." Selfosophy was created by a science fiction writer who had spent time in an insane asylum. Matt Roush of USA Today wrote that the episode was "written with the density of a Simpsons cartoon. You'll scream till you laugh, or laugh till you scream." Michael Patrick Sullivan writing for Underground Online/UGO wrote: "After a year and a half of doom and gloom stories, one of the most astounding television writers of the nineties, Darin Morgan, is allowed his fractured take on Millennium and Frank and author Jose Chung investigate murders that lead them deeply into the world of a pseudo-religion called Selfosophy (read as Scientology). Bizarre is exactly the word for it as Millennium takes sharp aim at itself and has fun with it."
In 2005, Season 9 of South Park, "Trapped in the Closet" Stan is interviewed by a member of The Church of Scientology. The member tells him that he isn't happy, but the Church can help him for a nominal fee. Later he is given a test on an E meter machine. He scores astoundingly high, which leads the members to believe that he is the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. The next day he is confronted by the entire Church of Scientology, including Tom Cruise. Stan tells Cruise that his films are "okay" and that he's not as good as "the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite". Tom locks himself in the closet. He stays there for the entire episode and is later joined by John Travolta, and R. Kelly who speaks in song, as he does in Trapped in the Closet. Meanwhile, Stan is commissioned to finish the Writings of Scientology. One of his major changes is that he wanted to make the church free. One of the leaders of the Church reprimanded him for this. He tries to tell the rest of the church about the scam. Each individual member of the church threatens to sue him, including Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, who have finally come out of the closet.
In 2006, season four of Nip/Tuck, the characters Kimber and Matt join the Church, making them the first Scientologist regular characters on a prime-time TV show. In the latter part of the fourth season, Kimber has a hallucination in which Xenu appears to her. Though the Scientology "tech" and details are portrayed in a simplified way, the show is incorporating the Scientology storyline as a serious subplot, rather than a parody or a one-time jab. In the episode Dawn Budge, Matt moves out of the house after his parents pressure him to leave Scientology.
Both characters eventually leave Scientology in the fifth season.
In April 2015, following the recent release of Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief , Saturday Night Live aired a music video featuring the "Church of Neurotology", a parody of Scientology's 1990 music video "We Stand Tall".
In Series 5 of Peep Show. Jeremy, (played by Robert Webb), and Super Hans, (played by Matt King), go into "The New Wellness centre" (a thinly disguised parody of Scientology). Their intention is to 'out-freak the freak show', or possibly just get warm. However, within hours they are giving all of their possessions to the church, renaming themselves, and indenturing themselves in perpetuity. Mark, (played by David Mitchell) successfully deprogammes Jeremy and by the next episode Super Hans has also left the church.
Theatre
The controversy surrounding the Church of Scientology and the (new) Cult Awareness Network organization was described in the 2002 Stephen Adly Guirgis play, Jesus Hopped the "A" Train. The character Angel tells Mary Jane that individuals who call the Cult Awareness Network looking for help will end up speaking with a Scientologist on the other end of the phone. The play was nominated for a 2003 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award, in the category: "The BBC Award for Best New Play of 2002."
In 2003, the play A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant was produced, which described a tale of the life of L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology, told from the perspective of fictional children of Scientologists. The play won a 2004 Obie Award.
Video games
The survival-horror video game series Dead Space features a religion named "Unitology". Unitologists worship an alien artifact known as "The Marker," and believe that a contagion of reanimated undead creatures known as "Necromorphs" represents the rebirth of humanity as directed by the Marker. Unitologists advance their knowledge of church doctrines by way giving large sums of money to the church in the form of "tithes," as well as by purchasing expensive collections of written works authored by the founder of Unitology, Michael Altman.
In Grand Theft Auto V The Epsilon Program is modeled on Scientology.
A small cult called the Hubologists appear in both Fallout 2 and the Nuka-World DLC of Fallout 4, offering several therapies involving increasingly larger amounts of radiation, and claims of their leader communing with aliens.

Mayor Synagogue (or Synagogue Mejor) is a synagogue on Arap Şükrü (Sakarya) Street in Bursa, Turkey. It was founded by Jews who settled in the Ottoman Empire after being expelled from Majorca. The present building was built in the 15th century or the late 16th century.
The synagogue was in regular use until 1975, when it was closed due to financial constraints. Researchers who visited in 1996 found it abandoned and in danger of demolition. However, according to the Turkish government, the building is still used for special events and for washing the dead.
There is another synagogue in Bursa: Geruş Synagogue.

Ultrasonic machining is a subtractive manufacturing process that removes material from the surface of a part through high frequency, low amplitude vibrations of a tool against the material surface in the presence of fine abrasive particles. The tool travels vertically or orthogonal to the surface of the part at amplitudes of 0.05 to 0.125 mm (0.002 to 0.005 in.). The fine abrasive grains are mixed with water to form a slurry that is distributed across the part and the tip of the tool. Typical grain sizes of the abrasive material range from 100 to 1000, where smaller grains (higher grain number) produce smoother surface finishes.
Ultrasonic vibration machining is typically used on brittle materials as well as materials with a high hardness due to the microcracking mechanics.
Process
An ultrasonically vibrating machine consists of two major components, an electroacoustic transducer and a sonotrode, attached to an electronic control unit with a cable. An electronic oscillator in the control unit produces an alternating current oscillating at a high frequency, usually between 18 and 40 kHz in the ultrasonic range. The transducer converts the oscillating current to a mechanical vibration. Two types of transducers have been used in ultrasonic machining; either piezoelectric or magnetostrictive:
Piezoelectric transducer This consists of a piece of piezoelectric ceramic, such as barium titanate, with two metal electrodes plated on its surface. The alternating voltage from the control unit applied to the electrodes causes the piezoelectric element to bend back and forth slightly, causing it to vibrate.
Magnetostrictive transducer This consists of a cylinder of ferromagnetic material such as steel inside a coil of wire. Magnetostriction is an effect which causes a material to change shape slightly when a magnetic field through it changes. The alternating current from the control unit, applied to the coil, creates an alternating magnetic field in the magnetostrictive cylinder which makes it change shape slightly with each oscillation, causing it to vibrate.
The transducer vibrates the sonotrode at low amplitudes and high frequencies. The sonotrode is usually made of low carbon steel. A constant stream of abrasive slurry flows between the sonotrode and work piece. This flow of slurry allows debris to flow away from the work cutting area. The slurry usually consists of abrasive boron carbide, aluminum oxide or silicon carbide particles in a suspension of water (20 to 60% by volume). The sonotrode removes material from the work piece by abrasion where it contacts it, so the result of machining is to cut a perfect negative of the sonotrode's profile into the work piece. Ultrasonic vibration machining allows extremely complex and non-uniform shapes to be cut into the workpiece with extremely high precision.
Machining time depends on the workpiece's strength, hardness, porosity and fracture toughness; the slurry's material and particle size; and the amplitude of the sonotrode's vibration. The surface finish of materials after machining depends heavily on hardness and strength, with softer and weaker materials exhibiting smoother surface finishes. The inclusion of microcrack and microcavity features on the materials surface depend highly on the crystallographic orientation of the work piece's grains and the materials fracture toughness.
Mechanics
Ultrasonic vibration machining physically operates by the mechanism of microchipping or erosion on the work piece's surface. Since the abrasive slurry is kept in motion by high frequency, low amplitude vibrations, the impact forces of the slurry are significant, causing high contact stresses. These high contact stresses are achieved by the small contact area between the slurry's particles and the work piece's surface. Brittle materials fail by cracking mechanics and these high stresses are sufficient to cause micro-scale chips to be removed from its surface. The material as a whole does not fail due to the extremely localized stress regions. The average force imparted by a particle of the slurry impacting the work piece's surface and rebounding can be characterized by the following equation:
Where m is the mass of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle when striking the surface and to is the contact time, which can be approximated according to the following equation:
Where r is the radius of the particle, co is the elastic wave velocity of the work piece, E is the work pieces Young's Modulus and ρ is the materials density.
Types
Rotary ultrasonic vibration machining
In rotary ultrasonic vibration machining (RUM), the vertically oscillating tool is able to revolve about the vertical center line of the tool. Instead of using an abrasive slurry to remove material, the surface of the tool is impregnated with diamonds that grind down the surface of the part. Rotary ultrasonic machines are specialized in machining advanced ceramics and alloys such as glass, quartz, structural ceramics, Ti-alloys, alumina, and silicon carbide. Rotary ultrasonic machines are used to produce deep holes with a high level of precision.
Rotary ultrasonic vibration machining is a relatively new manufacturing process that is still being extensively researched. Currently, researchers are trying to adapt this process to the micro level and to allow the machine to operate similar to a milling machine.
Chemical-assisted ultrasonic vibration machining
In chemical-assisted ultrasonic machining (CUSM), a chemically reactive abrasive fluid is used to ensure greater machining of glass and ceramic materials. Using an acidic solution, such as hydrofluoric acid, machining characteristics such as material removal rate and surface quality can be improved greatly compared to traditional ultrasonic machining. While time spent machining and surface roughness decrease with CUSM, the entrance profile diameter is slightly larger than normal due to the additional chemical reactivity of the new slurry choice. In order to limit the extent of this enlargement, the acid content of the slurry must be carefully selected as to ensure user safety and a quality product.
Applications
Since ultrasonic vibration machining does not use subtractive methods that may alter the physical properties of a workpiece, such as thermal, chemical, or electrical processes, it has many useful applications for materials that are more brittle and sensitive than traditional machining metals. Materials that are commonly machined using ultrasonic methods include ceramics, carbides, glass, precious stones and hardened steels. These materials are used in optical and electrical applications where more precise machining methods are required to ensure dimensional accuracy and quality performance of hard and brittle materials. Ultrasonic machining is precise enough to be used in the creation of microelectromechanical system components such as micro-structured glass wafers.
In addition to small-scale components, ultrasonic vibration machining is used for structural components because of the required precision and surface quality provided by the method. The process can safely and effectively create shapes out of high-quality single crystal materials that are often necessary but difficult to generate during normal crystal growth. As advanced ceramics become a greater part of the structural engineering realm, ultrasonic machining will continue to provide precise and effective methods of ensuring proper physical dimensions while maintaining crystallographic properties.
Advantages
Ultrasonic vibration machining is a unique non-traditional manufacturing process because it can produce parts with high precision that are made of hard and brittle materials which are often difficult to machine. Additionally, ultrasonic machining is capable of manufacturing fragile materials such as glass and non-conductive metals that can not be machined by alternative methods such as electrical discharge machining and electrochemical machining. Ultrasonic machining is able to produce high-tolerance parts because there is no distortion of the worked material. The absence of distortion is due to no heat generation from the sonotrode against the work piece and is beneficial because the physical properties of the part will remain uniform throughout. Furthermore, no burrs are created in the process, thus fewer operations are required to produce a finished part.
Disadvantages
Because ultrasonic vibration machining is driven by microchipping or erosion mechanisms, the material removal rate of metals can be slow and the sonotrode tip can wear down quickly from the constant impact of abrasive particles on the tool. Moreover, drilling deep holes in parts can prove difficult as the abrasive slurry will not effectively reach the bottom of the hole. Note, rotary ultrasonic machining is efficient at drilling deep holes in ceramics because the absence of a slurry cutting fluid and the cutting tool is coated in harder diamond abrasives. In addition, ultrasonic vibration machining can only be used on materials with a hardness value of at least 45 HRC.

In algebraic number theory, the Ferrero–Washington theorem, proved first by and later by , states that Iwasawa's μ-invariant vanishes for cyclotomic Zp-extensions of abelian algebraic number fields.
History
introduced the μ-invariant of a Zp-extension and observed that it was zero in all cases he calculated. used a computer to check that it vanishes for the cyclotomic Zp-extension of the rationals for all primes less than 4000.
later conjectured that the μ-invariant vanishes for any Zp-extension, but shortly after discovered examples of non-cyclotomic extensions of number fields with non-vanishing μ-invariant showing that his original conjecture was wrong. He suggested, however, that the conjecture might still hold for cyclotomic Zp-extensions.
showed that the vanishing of the μ-invariant for cyclotomic Zp-extensions of the rationals is equivalent to certain congruences between Bernoulli numbers, and showed that the μ-invariant vanishes in these cases by proving that these congruences hold.
Statement
For a number field K we let Km denote the extension by pm-power roots of unity, the union of the Km and A(p) the maximal unramified abelian p-extension of . Let the Tate module
Then Tp(K) is a pro-p-group and so a Zp-module. Using class field theory one can describe Tp(K) as isomorphic to the inverse limit of the class groups Cm of the Km under norm.
Iwasawa exhibited Tp(K) as a module over the completion Zp and this implies a formula for the exponent of p in the order of the class groups Cm of the form
The Ferrero–Washington theorem states that μ is zero.

Webb Memorial State Park is a public recreation area located on a peninsula that extends nearly half a mile into the Hingham Bay area of Boston Harbor in Massachusetts. It is composed of three connected drumlins and a low marsh area. The state park forms the only mainland portion of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area.
History
In the 1860s, the peninsula became part of the Bradley Fertilizer factory and was used for dumping industrial waste. In the 1950s, it housed the missile launchers for a Nike missile site. The IFC (Integrated Fire Control) and radar systems for this site were located on Hog Island (now called Spinnaker Island) on the other side of Hingham Bay. The missile site was deactivated in 1974. In 1977, it was transferred to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and work started on its conversion into a state park. Webb Memorial State Park opened in 1980. It was named for Weymouth police officer William Webb.
Activities and amenities
The park offers skyline views of Boston, fishing, picnicking, and walking trails.

Lake Rotomā (also spelled Rotoma) is the fourth largest lake of the 11 lakes in the Rotorua Lakes district, or the Hot Lakes district as it was known in the early decades of the 20th century. The Rotorua lakes are located in New Zealand's North Island in the Bay of Plenty Region. Lake Rotomā is the easternmost in the chain of three lakes to the northeast of Lake Rotorua The other two are Lake Rotoiti and Lake Rotoehu. Rotomā is located halfway between the city of Rotorua and town of Whakatāne.
Lake Rotomā has a high water quality with visibility up to around 13 metres deep. The lake has a maximum depth of 83 metres in the northern part and 73.5 metres in the southern part.
Geography
Lake Rotomā was formed within the Rotomā Caldera when lava flows from a large crater explosion blocked its outlet 9,500 years ago. The hills fringing the south and east of the lake are made up of rhyolite from eruptions from its own caldera, the Haroharo and Tarawera all in the Ōkataina Volcanic Centre, and this has meant that Lake Rotomā has no surface outlets. However, the presence of springs has suggested an underground discharge of lake waters. The water level of Rotomā reaches an excessive high or low level every 10–15 years. In times of extreme low levels, the sunken island "Motutara" in the lake may be exposed.
History
Road
Before the road around Lake Rotomā was constructed, there were several Māori trails over the Rotomā hill which could be used to get between Rotorua and the Eastern Bay of Plenty by foot, but these trails were too narrow and uneven to be used by horses. Travellers from Rotorua could only get as far as Tikitere on the rough track.
In May 1895 work commenced on the Tikitere to Rotoma road. By July, there were three road gangs working on different sections of the road, and work began over the difficult section over the Rotomā hill in the summer of 1895–1896. A proper road was also constructed from Te Ngae in Rotorua through to Tikitere.
Once the road was completed, horse-drawn traffic commenced and public coaching services began. The first such service was started in 1907 by the R.M. Company, who ran a service twice a week from Rotorua to Ōpōtiki carrying mail and up to three passengers. In 1910 the R.M. Company upgraded to a large coach drawn by five horses which could hold 10 passengers.
In 1916 Colletts of Rotorua started the first regular motor car service, using Cadillac service cars. The average travel time from Rotorua to Whakatāne was 5 hours, but like the horse-drawn coaches, the service cars could take up to 9 hours to travel this distance depending on the driving conditions. The road surface gradually improved, decreasing the travel time to 3 hours by the late 1920s. Today, this journey takes just one hour and 20 minutes.
In 1947, 60 men were employed on the construction of the Rotorua to Whakatāne highway, as increases in traffic had caused problems on the road which was barely 12 feet wide.
In the winter of 1956 the lake level of Rotomā rose very high, causing the road to be shifted to higher ground. More serious flooding occurred in 1962, and the famous "cheese cutting" landmark was destroyed and used to build up the road. The cheese cutting was a large wedge shaped rock formed during road construction in 1895–1896 when the road gangs cut the road through a hill with picks and shovels and left a portion of the hill standing.
Establishments
Various establishments have come and gone at Rotomā, and most were set up to service the passing traveller's desire for rest stops, refreshments and accommodation.
Past establishments
"Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office", later renamed "The Kettle Store and Tearooms", then "The Kettle Store and Garage".
"T & K Service Station"
"Stillwater Lodge & Motel"
"Rotoma Accommodation House"
"El Toreador Dine and Dance"
"Atkinson's Fishing Lodge", later renamed "Merge Lodge"
"Rotoma Traders"
In 1912 it could take up to 9 hours to cover the distance between Rotorua and Whakatāne, and changing stations for the horses had been set up every 14 miles from Rotorua. The changing station at the west end of Rotomā became a popular rest stop. John Baker ran a post office and tearooms here, and built up a reputation for his corned beef. Mr. Baker offered the traveller a choice of corned beef with potatoes and cabbage or corned beef sandwiches.
The Pilbrow family arrived in Rotomā in 1948 after purchasing the Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office. They expanded the business to include a general store, and renamed it The Kettle Store and Tearooms. They then built a garage for motor repairs, and the business became The Kettle Store and Garage. Petrol pumps were later installed by the Pilbrow family to create T & K Filling Station. There was an extremely high level of rainfall in 1961 which caused serious flooding problems, and the business was badly affected. The floodwater raised the petrol tanks out of the ground and the road had to be built up to act as a stop-bank. A pump was in action 24 hours a day for weeks to prevent the water from completely flooding the premises.
The Pilbrow family also created Oxford Road.
The original homestead which became known as Atkinson's Fishing Lodge was built early in the 1900s by Mr and Mrs C. Atkinson who farmed near the lake and had an orchard on the opposite side of the road. The homestead was turned into a lodge which became very popular with fishermen. The lodge was renamed Merge Lodge by Geoff and Roy Warwick, formerly of Kawerau, who took over ownership in 1960. The lodge had six bedrooms, a billiard room, two kitchens, two lounges, and a store out the front. There is now a caravan park at the site of Merge Lodge.

"Suicide Beach"
The bay at the foot of the Rotomā hill where Manawahe Road commences had the nickname "Suicide Beach" in the past due to the occurrence of a murder-suicide there in May 1925. The real story was lost over time, with the majority of Rotomā local residents holding the belief that it had been a young honeymoon couple who committed suicide there together. However, in actuality it was a 38-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl; understood to have been romantically attached. The man, Carl Olsen, had told the girl's father of his love for her. In an attempt to separate the pair, the disapproving parents sent the girl, Molly Moors, to live with an aunt in Hastings. Without her aunts knowledge, Olsen picked Molly up in his car and it was assumed they were on their way to Hamilton when they met death at the shores of Rotomā. The event was well covered by newspapers of the time and was referred to as the "Rotoma Tragedy". Olsen and Moors are buried next to each other in the Rotorua Cemetery, and their graves were probably originally marked with wooden crosses. The original crosses disintegrated over time leaving the two graves unmarked for many years before being remarked with new matching wooden crosses in May 2011.
Sunken island
Four buoys in the southern portion of Lake Rotomā mark the location of Motutara, the sunken island, which sits just under the lakes surface. Occasionally the lake level drops low enough to expose the top of the island.
There was once a Māori village on the island, and according to the legend, an old Tohunga resided there amongst the other inhabitants. His name was Te Rarau-mai-Waho, and he was very powerful and dangerous. The cloud the old Tohunga cast over the island was lifted only on the occasions where he went to visit some of his relations in Kawerau and around Putauaki, Mount Edgecumbe. One night he returned from such a visit and called out to the people of the island from the lake's edge by Matahi lagoon, ordering them to send him a canoe. Nobody responded to his demands, and in his anger the Tohunga put a curse on the island and its inhabitants. The people of the island heard the angry Tohunga's terrible screams, but did not realise the horrible retribution he would take. The curse caused the island to slowly sink, and by morning it was completely underwater; the only signs of the village being bodies and pieces of wreckage floating on the surface of the lake. Some people had escaped by swimming to the shore of the lake, and these people eventually settled in the South Island. The Waikato Underwater Club has examined Motutara. Two platforms or terraces were found, and some hāngi stones were found at the peak. It has been suggested that if the Pā had been palisaded it may have still been there today.
Settlement
The 2006 census revealed that 1,863 people usually live in the wider Rotomā area; 0.7 percent of Bay of Plenty Region's population. However, the lakeside portion of the Rotomā area has a much smaller permanent population, as many of the dwellings are used only as holiday homes. The most common ethnic group in the wider Rotomā area is Māori, at 49.9% of the population. This compares to a 27.5% Māori population for the Bay of Plenty Region as a whole.
Early settlement
The early road construction crews commented on the lack of Māori settlement in Rotomā and in the neighbouring Lake Rotoehu. However, fortified pā sites, food pits, cultivation areas and burial sites have been discovered around the shoreline of Rotomā and the surrounding hills . The tribe Ngāti Tūwharetoa may not have lived permanently at Rotomā but at least took out a temporary camping existence there to take advantage of the hunting and fishing opportunities on offer. Later, Ngāti Tūāhuriri, a sub-tribe of Ngāti Pikiao took up residence at Rotomā. Māori living at nearby Rotoiti credited the frequent conflict between Māori and Pākehā as the cause of the dispersion of this Māori population, and they had left Lake Rotomā by the time the road construction began in 1895.
A census for the years 1874 to 1891 shows nil for Rotomā. In 1896 a census shows a population of 33, understood to be the occupants of the camp set up for the road workers and their families at the east end of Oneroa beach by the lagoon.
Oxford Road
In 1948, Mr and Mrs T.H. Pilbrow and their children arrived at Lake Rotomā from Oxford in Canterbury. They had purchased the Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office, which was situated on 25 acres of land.
In a district of predominantly leasehold land, the Pilbrows realised the value of their 25 acres of freehold land and decided to subdivide it in 1950. Sixty-three sections were surveyed, the majority each a quarter acre, and four of these were taken by the Rotorua County Council for a reserve. Seventeen sections were along the main road, but a new road was required to access the sections to the rear. The Pilbrows named the new road "Oxford Road" as a reminder of their hometown.
Education
Lake Rotomā School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .
The first school was opened on 2 February 1928 in the old tearooms building with Mr. E.G. Sutherland teaching the 8 students. Mr Sutherland stated that it was "probably the worst building in New Zealand. However, when the weather was too bad we just declared a holiday – and nobody seemed to worry"
A new school was built and opened in its present location on Soda Springs Road on 25 May 1936 with 29 students.
The roll fluctuated due to numerous residents living at Rotomā on a temporary basis. The mills in the area, Tunnicliffe's Mill and Rendall's Mill, helped establish a more stable population at Rotomā and caused further overcrowding at the school. In 1973 the roll reached 55 and there were appalling working conditions for staff and children. On 14 August 1973 the majority of parents kept their children at home as a protest against the lack of action to improve standards. There was widespread media coverage and in October the Minister of Education ordered that a new school be built, and it was opened on 16 November 1974.
From 1948, Mr Tam Pilbrow operated the first bus service to the school, using a Hillman car. In 1952 the service was taken over by George Graham, and Mr. Pilbrow's son Ken, who operated a Bradford van from the Kettle Store. Mr Gavin Wyllie bought the Kettle Store and Garage, and in 1958 he commenced transporting children to the school in his V.W combie van, but when Rendall's Mill closed at the end of that same year, there were not enough children for him to continue the service.
Conservation
Due to invasive plant introduction, the native plants have been outcompeted within the lake and crayfish populations have declined considerably. The local tribe Te Arawa has been involved in efforts to remove the invasive weeds and restore the crayfish populations by attaching woven flax mats called uwhi to the bottom of the lake that limit the growth of the invasive plants while the thinner native plants are able to thrive. Burlap and rubber mats were unsuccessful as they would lift off the lake bottom from the accumulated gas from the decaying plants.

"Pickin' Up the Pieces" is the first song recorded by pioneer country rock band Poco. Written by founding member Richie Furay, the song was the title track of Poco's first album.
History
After Buffalo Springfield broke up, members Richie Furay and Jim Messina decided to make a band with pedal steel guitar player Rusty Young, with whom they had recorded the Furay-penned Springfield song "Kind Woman". This was Furay's first Poco-intended song. According to Young, "Richie played 'Pickin' Up The Pieces' for us back in 1967. ... It was obviously a comment on leaving one thing behind and carrying on," referring to the breakup of Buffalo Springfield and the new beginnings with Poco.
Attitude and Impact
The single, though not commercially successful, was nonetheless undoubtedly instrumental in the creation of the then-new genre country rock. Richie Furay said of "Pickin' Up the Pieces": "To me it summarized the attitude we wanted to convey in our music: good, wholesome & positive. There was so much negativity going on in the world in the early 70s and it needed a refreshing sound. The country rock sound we were creating, would be it. We were innovators, pioneering the way for a whole new 'Southern California sound' that many groups who followed would capitalize on."
In popular culture
The song appears in the Mod Squad episode "Death of Wild Bill Hannachek"

H. Mehboob (; 1926–22 April 1981) was an Indian musician and playback singer. He was one of the most successful playback singers in the Malayalam film industry during the 1950s and early 1960s, with a good number of hit songs in his kitty.
Biography
Mehboob was born in Mattancherry, Kingdom of Cochin (now part of India), into a family beset with stark poverty. He spent his childhood in the nearby Bengal battalion military camp polishing shoes while his mother did clean jobs. At the camp Mehboob picked up different languages and songs from soldiers drawn from various parts of the country, some Britishers too.
Mehboob grew up to become the singer of choice for the various pre-nuptial ceremonies conducted by rich families in Cochin. He made his name, friends and admirers from here. Mehboob had no real home, but he lived with his friends. Many of his early songs were written by Mepalli Balan and Nelson Fernandes, with that special Mattancherry flavour. These songs were never recorded. It was Pankaj Mullick who recognised Mehboob's singing ability for the first time. He recommended Mehboob for several "Kacheris" and Mohammed Rafi concerts.
Mehboob became quite famous throughout Cochin in late 1940s itself. Cochin based actor Muthiah recommended Mehboob to music director Dakshinamoorthy, who was looking for a new voice for the film Jeevitha Nouka. Mehboob recorded three songs including the popular "Akaale Aarum Kaividum" for this film, widely known to be the first superhit film in Malayalam. (This song was a ditto copy of "Suhani Raat Dhal Chuki" from Dulari. It was later in 1985, re-recorded by K. J. Yesudas and this version is featured in the currently available prints of the film.) With the success of this song, Mehboob was shot to fame and became the most sought after singer of that time. In 1954, he recorded "Manennum Vilikkila", for the landmark film Neelakkuyil, which became a tremendous success. He went on to record numerous hit songs for composers M. S. Baburaj, K. Raghavan, G. Devarajan, R. K. Shekhar and many more. Most of his songs were folk music based comic numbers and had lyrics by P. Bhaskaran.
Mehboob has also recorded numerous songs for stage plays, gramaphone records and other programmes, which is perhaps many times more than he recorded for films. He was also an inevitable performer in "Mehfils" and other concerts. Mehboob was never a careerist. He was known to be an alcoholic and finally died nearly an impoverished man, aged 56. H. Mehboob road in Mattancherry, Kerala, was named after Mehboob, to pay respect for his contribution in the field of music and also as his remembrance.
Many of his songs were remixed and used in later Malayalam films. A part of the song "Theerchaayilla Janam", written by Kannan Pareekutty and sung in 1956, was rendered by actor Mohanlal for the 1999 film Usthaad. The 2013 film Annayum Rasoolum used the songs "Kandu Randu Kannu" (composed by M. S. Baburaj and written by P. A. Kasim for the 1973 film Chuzhi) and "Kayalinarike" (written by Meppalli Balan). The 2013 film ABCD: American-Born Confused Desi featured the song "Nayapaisayilla" from the film Neelisally (1960).

The Talaud Islands Regency () is a regency of North Sulawesi province, Indonesia. The Talaud Islands form an archipelago situated to the north-east of Sulawesi, with a land area of 1,251.02 km2. It had a population of 83,434 at the 2010 Census, increasing to 94,520 at the 2020 Census. The largest island is Karakelong, on which lies the regency seat in the town of Melonguane.

The Church of St. James the Greater Apostle is a parish in Sokolniki, Września County, Poland, built in the thirteenth century. Its consecration took place in 1416. The current church, constructed in neo-baroque style, was built 1926 and consecrated by August Hlond on 28 August 1932. It is one of 10 parishes within the deanery. On 6 September 2009, the Board of Greater Poland approved the list of operations for the Rural Development Programme for the years 2007 to 2013. The district thus received a grant to repair the church roof.

Langlois & Wentworth, Inc. was an American company founded in 1933 that recorded radio shows for broadcast. Its Lang-Worth label recorded jazz and popular music on discs sold to radio stations.
History
The company was founded by Cyril Ouelette Langlois, Sr. (1893–1957) and Ralph Clarke Wentworth (1891–1954) and was based in New York City. Transcription discs were sold on a subscription basis and, at the time, none were sold to the public. Like other transcriptions companies, the company tried to move away from using music that required its subscribing radio stations to pay additional fees to copyright holders, and began to use music in the public domain. By 1935, the company had eliminated the use of copyrighted music, although the policy was later relaxed. In the 1940s, the music service library was divided into two groups: The "5000" service with white labels reserved for ASCAP music, and yellow labels, reserved for non-ASCAP licensed music, which included BMI, SESAC, public domain music, and others.
Lang–Worth Feature Programs, Inc.
In 1935, Langlois & Wentworth founded a new division called Lang–Worth Feature Programs, Inc., a radio transcription service that was completely copyright-free, except the copyrighting of its own work. Most of the music was in the public domain, but some was purchased, at great expense. The "C.S." on its labels indicated that the music was "cleared at source by Lang-Worth." The company purported to have the largest collection of public domain music in the world and, for its subscribers, offered a library of over 300 selections with a guarantee of 120 new selections every month.
The service filled the gap during the musicians' strike against the major record companies between 1942 and 1944, although Lang-Worth continued to do business for a number of years after WWII. The company was headquartered in New York at Steinway Hall and had a printing plant at 55-20 Grand Avenue, Maspeth, Queens, New York.
Lang-Worth artists included the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Woody Herman, Elton Britt, Henry Jerome, and Patti Page.
Founders & management
Cyril Ouelette Langlois, Sr., was a former advertising executive from Detroit, and later, a Newspaper advertising professional in New York, and a graduate of University of Detroit Mercy. Cyril Langlois' sons, Cyril Ouelette Langlois, Jr. (1922–1986), a 1944 graduate of the University of Rochester, and John D. Langlois (born 1918–1978), became president and vice president, respectively. Wentworth had been a musician, actor, radio announcer, and was a graduate of the University of Washington.
Provenance
On March 14, 1942, Wentworth sold his interest in the company to Emile Cote (né Louis Emile Côté; 1898–1980), a singer and choral director who was active in radio. In 1946, Cote left the company to become head of A&R at National Records. At some point after that, Ray Norman purchased the entire catalog of Lang-Worth radio transcriptions. In 1982, George H. Buck, Jr., purchased the entire catalog from Ray Norman for $110,000.

Active Desktop is a feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0's optional Windows Desktop Update that allows users to add HTML content to the desktop, along with some other features. This function was intended to be installed on the then-current Windows 95 operating system. It was also included in Windows 98 and later Windows operating systems up through 32-bit XP, but was absent from XP Professional x64 Edition (for AMD64) and all subsequent versions of Windows. Its status on XP 64-bit edition (for Itanium) and on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Server 2003 is not widely known. This corresponded to version Internet Explorer 4.0 to 6.x, but not Internet Explorer 7.
HTML can be added both in place of the regular wallpaper and as independent resizable desktop items. Items available on-line could be regularly updated and synchronized so users could stay updated without visiting the website in their browser.
Active Desktop works much like desktop widget technology in that it allowed users to place customized information on their desktop.
History
The introduction of the Active Desktop marked Microsoft's attempt to capitalize on the push technology trend led by PointCast.
Active Desktop allowed embedding a number of "channels" on the user's computer desktop that could provide continually-updated information such as web pages, without requiring the user to open dedicated programs such as a web browser. Example uses include overview over news headlines and stock quotes. However, its most notable feature was that it allowed Motion JPEGs and animated GIFs to animate correctly when set as the desktop wallpaper.
Active Desktop debuted as part of an Internet Explorer 4.0 preview release in July 1997, and came out with the launch of the 4.0 browser in September that year. for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, as a feature of the optional Windows Desktop Update offered to users during the upgrade installation. While the Windows Desktop Update is commonly referred to (improperly) as Active Desktop itself, it is actually an entire Windows shell upgrade from v4.0 to v4.71, or v4.72, with numerous changes to the Windows interface, resulting in an appearance and functionality level nearly indistinguishable from the then yet-to-be-released Windows 98. Features include the option to allow uppercase filenames (the old v4.0 desktop would forcibly display uppercase filenames in title case), configurable one-click hot-tracking file selection, customizable per-folder HTML display settings, QuickLaunch mini-buttons on the Taskbar next to the Start button, upgraded Start Menu allowing drag and drop item reordering and allowing to right-click context menus for item renaming, etc. With the update, Windows Explorer featured an Address bar in which Internet addresses can be entered and seamlessly browsed.
Active Desktop never attained any significant degree of popularity, as its drawbacks included high use of system resources and reduction in system stability. The component was retained in Windows XP but was replaced by a feature named Windows Sidebar in Windows Vista. Sidebar in turn was called Windows Desktop Gadgets in Windows 7, which also allows components to be added to the desktop, but it was also discontinued due to security issues; Windows 8 replaced it with live tiles in the Start screen, which were replaced with Widgets in Windows 11. Windows Server 2003 R2 32-bit is the most recent Microsoft operating system to support Active Desktop. It appears that the 64-bit version of Windows XP no longer supports Active Desktop. However, it still provides the option to display Web pages and channels built with Microsoft's Channel Definition Format (CDF) on the desktop.
The HTML displaying capabilities are now mainly used for creating original wallpapers and adding search boxes to the desktop. For example, a user could copy the following code to display Wikipedia's search-box on the desktop:
<form
action="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search"
id="searchform"
name="searchform">
<input
accesskey="f"
id="searchInput"
name="search"
type="text"
value="" />
<input
id="searchGoButton"
name="go"
type="submit"
value="Go" />
</form>

In geometry, the triakis icosahedron (or kisicosahedron) is an Archimedean dual solid, or a Catalan solid. Its dual is the truncated dodecahedron.
Cartesian coordinates
Let be the golden ratio. The 12 points given by and cyclic permutations of these coordinates are the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Its dual regular dodecahedron, whose edges intersect those of the icosahedron at right angles, has as vertices the points together with the points and cyclic permutations of these coordinates. Multiplying all coordinates of this dodecahedron by a factor of gives a slightly smaller dodecahedron. The 20 vertices of this dodecahedron, together with the vertices of the icosahedron, are the vertices of a triakis icosahedron centered at the origin. The length of its long edges equals . Its faces are isosceles triangles with one obtuse angle of and two acute ones of . The length ratio between the long and short edges of these triangles equals .
Orthogonal projections
The triakis icosahedron has three symmetry positions, two on vertices, and one on a midedge:
The Triakis icosahedron
has five special orthogonal projections, centered on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: hexagonal and pentagonal. The last two correspond to the A2 and H2 Coxeter planes.
Kleetope
It can be seen as an icosahedron with triangular pyramids augmented to each face; that is, it is the Kleetope of the icosahedron. This interpretation is expressed in the name, triakis.
If the icosahedron is augmented by tetrahedral without removing the center icosahedron, one gets the net of an icosahedral pyramid.
Other triakis icosahedra
This interpretation can also apply to other similar nonconvex polyhedra with pyramids of different heights:
First stellation of icosahedron, or Small triambic icosahedron, or sometimes called a Triakis icosahedron (among others)
Great stellated dodecahedron (with very tall pyramids)
Great dodecahedron (with inverted pyramids)
Stellations
The triakis icosahedron has numerous stellations, including this one.
Related polyhedra
The triakis icosahedron is a part of a sequence of polyhedra and tilings, extending into the hyperbolic plane. These face-transitive figures have (*n32) reflectional symmetry.

All Saints Academy (formerly The Northfields Technology College) is a mixed secondary school located in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England.
All Saints educate 11- to 16-year-olds, as well as mainly from the town of Dunstable and some surrounding villages. In addition, the school offers further education for 16- to 18-year-olds through its sixth form department.
History
The school was launched under the direction of Frank Underwood on 14 January 1936, with 336 students. It was then known as Northfields Senior Elementary School. As a consequence of the Education Act 1944, Northfields then became a secondary modern school.
Following the 1967 Plowden Report, Bedfordshire LEA decided to implement the three-tier education system of lower, middle and upper schools in the county. By the end of the 1970s, Northfields was redesignated as a comprehensive upper school.
The school was among the first to operate a farm on site, with children looking after the animals, under Mr Jones (Science teacher) advice. There was a barn for caged chickens, calves & food stock. In outside pens were pigs, cows & chickens, eggs were collected & either hatched in an incubator in the technicians room or sold, the pigs & cows went through a full life cycle before entering the food chain. A part of the farm was given over to crops and farming methods. The farm lost importance in the early-1970s when part of the land was taken for the new sports hall & Mr Jones left, as a result the farm lost its viability. Headmaster at the time was Mr David Fone, Deputy Head Mrs Baines.
In the early 1980s under David Fone, the school took part in an experiment to promote the use of computers in schools and as a result received special funding which paid for BBC Model B computers in almost every classroom and every subject. The computers were linked by an early form of network. Some homework was done on computer and saved on network directories. There was also an attempt to fully computerise the school records. As a result of this David Fone received an OBE in 1989.
The school went through a period of decline, and was put into special measures in the early 2000s. However the school improved, and was renamed The Northfields Technology College after the school gained specialist status as a technology college.
The Northfields Technology College closed on 31 August 2009. It reopened the next day as the new All Saints Academy. The school now specialises in Science and Business, and relocated to a new multi-million pound purpose-built school on the same site in 2012.
All Saints are sponsored by the St Albans Diocese of the Church of England and the University of Bedfordshire. Manshead CE Academy in Dunstable is also sponsored by the Church of England, and objections were made at the time about possible religious influences on education in Dunstable as a whole (Queensbury Academy is the only secondary school not be linked to the Church in Dunstable).
In 2014 the school started to admit pupils from the age of 11, becoming a secondary school. In 2015 the academy received an Inadequate Ofsted rating and has been placed in special measures. The principal, Tom Waterworth resigned and Mrs Furber has taken over management of the school.

Cameraria obstrictella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Maine, Vermont and Pennsylvania in the United States.
The wingspan is 7–8 mm.
The larvae feed on Quercus species, including Quercus acuminata, Quercus alba, Quercus montana, Quercus muehlenbergii, Quercus rubra, Quercus tinctoria and Quercus velutina, as well as Myrica cerifera. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a tentiform mine on the upperside of the leaf. The mine is a rather broad Y-shaped tract, sometimes crossing the midrib. The flat, oval, silken cocoon is spun in the leg of the Y.

The Centaurides (, Kentaurides) or centauresses are female centaurs. First encountered in Greek mythology as members of the tribe of the Centauroi, the Centaurides are only occasionally mentioned in written sources, but appear frequently in Greek art and Roman mosaics. The centauress who appears most frequently in literature is Hylonome, wife of the centaur Cyllarus.
Names
As a proper noun, Centauride or Kentauride refers specifically to a female of the tribe of the Centauroi or Kentauroi (Κένταυροι), commonly rendered in English as the common noun "centaurs"; as a common noun, centauride refers to any female centaur. Centauress is the more usual term in English, but centaurelle and centaurette may also occur.
Literary depictions
In the "Imagines", the rhetorician Philostratus the Elder gives a brief description of the Centaurides:
In the "Metamorphoses", Ovid gives a brief description of Hylonome:
Shakespeare refers to centauresses in King Lear, Act IV, Scene VI, lines 124–125:
"Down from the waist they're centaurs,
Though women all above".
Other appearances
A British family named Lambert used a female centaur holding a rose in her left hand as a heraldic device, and depicted this figure in their monuments. However, they were unable to establish official authority for these arms, and in the eighteenth century changed them to a male centaur holding a bow.
In Walt Disney's film Fantasia, Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony is illustrated with scenes from Greek mythology, in which male and female centaurs, referred to by the studio as "centaurettes", feature prominently. The centaurettes appear in various situations, some of which depict them affecting the mannerisms of fashionable women in 1940. The centaurettes are shown in a variety of colours other than human skin tones, including blue, and were originally drawn bare-breasted, but applying the Hays code, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America forced the animators to cover their breasts with garlands. Changing attitudes toward racial stereotypes in the 1960s led to the cutting of scenes depicting black centaurettes waiting on the others.
The song Witch Of The Westmoreland, originally sung by Barbara Dickson on the folk album From The Beggar's Mantle, features a benevolent witch, described in the song as "[o]ne half the form of a maiden fair/And a jet-black mare's body."
Since the late 2000s, as a part of the monster girl trend in Japan, female centaurs have appeared in several Japanese anime and manga such as Monster Musume and A Centaur's Life.

In mathematics, in the field of ordinary differential equations, Sturm separation theorem, named after Jacques Charles François Sturm, describes the location of roots of solutions of homogeneous second order linear differential equations. Basically the theorem states that given two linear independent solutions of such an equation the zeros of the two solutions are alternating.
Sturm separation theorem
If u(x) and v(x) are two non-trivial continuous linearly independent solutions to a homogeneous second order linear differential equation with x0 and x1 being successive roots of u(x), then v(x) has exactly one root in the open interval (x0, x1). It is a special case of the Sturm-Picone comparison theorem.
Proof
Since and are linearly independent it follows that the Wronskian must satisfy for all where the differential equation is defined, say . Without loss of generality, suppose that . Then
So at
and either and are both positive or both negative. Without loss of generality, suppose that they are both positive. Now, at
and since and are successive zeros of it causes . Thus, to keep we must have . We see this by observing that if then would be increasing (away from the -axis), which would never lead to a zero at . So for a zero to occur at at most (i.e., and it turns out, by our result from the Wronskian that ). So somewhere in the interval the sign of changed. By the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists such that .
On the other hand, there can be only one zero in , because otherwise v would have two zeros and there would be no zeros of u in between, and it was just proved that this is impossible.

Poso Regency is a regency of Central Sulawesi Province of Indonesia. It covers an area of 7,112.25 km2, and had a population of 209,228 at the 2010 Census and 244,875 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2021 was 248,345. The principal town lies at Poso.
History
In 1999, Morowali Regency and Tojo Una-Una Regency were created out of eastern portions of Poso Regency. In 2007 there were calls to divide the remaining Poso Regency into two regencies to overcome religious-based conflicts; one new regency in the southeastern and western sectors would by named Tentena Regency (comprising the first twelve kecamatan listed below), while the residual Poso Regency in the northeast sector (bordering the Gulf of Tomini) would consist of the last seven kecamatan listed below
Administrative districts
At the time of the 2010 Census, the Poso Regency was divided at 2010 into eighteen districts (kecamatan), but an additional 19th district (Pamona Pusalemba) was subsequently added by splitting off the western and southern villages of Pamona Utara District. The districts are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2021. The table also includes the location of the district administrative centres.
Social
Religions
Poso District Religious Office noted that the majority of the population in Poso is Protestant, with the number of adherents as many as 122,389 inhabitants. This is followed by 95,417 Muslims, 9,739 Hindus, 1,425 Roman Catholics and 267 Buddhists, respectively. The number of places of worship in Poso, consisting of 270 mosques, 500 Protestant churches, 36 Catholic churches and 71 temples.
Islam is the first religion which spread widely in Poso. Although the process is not known, Islam certainly been entered in Poso around the end of the 18th century. The migration of Mandar tribe of western Sulawesi region also proved influential in this process. This process culminated in the events in which Mandar people living in the area of Kadombuku (now Lage), forcing the local tribal people to convert to Islam and end up with a series of tribal wars between Mandar and Kadombuku. Christianity began to spread in the late 19th century, when a Dutch missionary, Albert Christian Kruyt sent by a Christian mission agency of the Netherlands Missionary Society to begin missionary in Central Sulawesi. After working for seventeen years, their efforts paid off when hundreds of people from To Pebato baptized on Christmas Eve, 25 December 1909. Central Sulawesi Christian Church (GKST) is a church organization that was established on 18 October 1947 in Tentena. GKST serves Central, West and South Sulawesi. In 2006, 188 thousand people registered to become members, and there are 376 congregations served by 625 priests.
Tourism
Tambing Lake is located in Lore Lindu National Park, 3 hours drive from Palu and 100 meters away from Palu-Napu Road. In 2014, there are 3,000 foreign tourists visited Tambing Lake which is known as Endemic Bird Paradise with 30 percent of 270 kinds of birds are endemic.
Ecology
Sulawesi black Ebony, also known as diospyros celebica, naturally can be found in Central Sulawesi (Parigi, Poso, Donggala), South Sulawesi (Maros), West Sulawesi (Mamuju) and Maluku. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has issued their red list in 2000 and D. celebica belong to the category of vulnerable species, which means that ebony is at the limit of high risk for extinction in the wild (vulnerable to exploitation).
Most of the endemic fauna in Poso is located in the area of cultural and natural heritage, such as Lake Poso and Lore Lindu National Park. Whitten (1987), Maurice Kottelat, and L.R. Parenti states that there are several species of endemic biota that is only found in Lake Poso, such as Xenopoecilus poptae (Adrianichthys poptae); Adrianichthys kruyti, Weberogobius amadi and Nomorhamphus celebensis. Other endemic fish is Anguilla celebensis, Xenopoecilus sarasinorum, Xenopoecilus oophorus (adrianichthys oophorus), Adrianichthys roseni; gastropods such as Miratesta celebensis; and some small shrimp (Caridina sp).

Coin Hopping—Washington D.C. is a board game designed by J. F. Cartier it was published in 2007. To play the game each player assumes the role of an interest group and tours Washington, D.C. in an effort to control the three branches of government.
The game board is an illustrated map of Washington, D.C. Movement across the board is controlled by the placement of coins and changes dynamically during the game. This is similar to previous board games developed by the same designer.
Coin Hopping—Washington D.C. is designed for 2-6 players, ages 8 and above. This game is a designer board game, a genre made popular by games such as Settlers of Catan, and is an educational game.
Recognition
Coin Hopping—Washington D.C. has won the awards, iParenting Media and Dr. Toy's 100 Best Children's Products for 2008.
Gameplay
Game objectives There are two objectives in the game. One is to create a stack of four coins. The other is to "control the government" by placing citizens in the Capitol, White House, and Supreme Court. The first person to have simultaneously a stack of four coins and a citizen in each of the three offices is the winner.
The board The game board is an illustrated map of Washington D.C. Each space on the board is represented by a Washington D.C. landmark, including the White House, the Capitol and the Supreme Court. Each player brings a penny, a nickel, a dime and a quarter to the game, and these are placed on spaces on the board.
Movement on the board Players move around the board by "coin hopping". Players can move their pawns to any adjacent space on the board that has a coin on it. A player's turn ends when the player's pawn lands on a space without a coin. Additionally, a player can pick up a coin from one space and carry it with the pawn to another space. This allows the player to move a coin to an empty space or create a stack of coins. The goal is to create a stack of coins which includes one penny, one nickel, one dime and one quarter. Any player who places the fourth coin on a stack gets to claim that stack and remove it from the board. Destination cards allow the player to jump to a specific destination on the board and can be used strategically to move quickly across the board.
Placing citizens in office Each player has five citizens than can be placed into office at the White House, the Capitol or the Supreme Court. When a player lands on the Capitol, one of the player's citizens may be added to the Congress. When a player lands on the White House, one of the player's citizens may be made the President. There is only one president at a time, so any previous office holder is sent home. When a player lands on the Supreme Court, one of the player's citizens may be appointed as a Justice, but only if the player also controls the presidency. This means that the player must get to the Supreme Court before the player's president is removed from office by another player.
Advanced gameplay In basic gameplay only the President has special powers (i.e. placing a citizen in the Supreme Court), but in advanced game play the powers of the three branches of government are balanced.When a player places a citizen in the Capitol, a bill affecting gameplay may be sponsored and voted on. If the bill passes, it is made into a law. Any law may be contested by a player with a citizen in the Supreme Court. Additionally, Lobbyists are given a role in affecting the vote in Congress.

Time and the Wind is a musical revue by composer Galt MacDermot and lyricist by Norman Matlock. Directed and choreographed by Louis Johnson with musical direction by MacDermot, the show premiered Off-Broadway at the John Houseman Studio Theater on July 27, 1995 with costumes by Bernard Johnson and lighting by Deborah Constantine. The show was produced by Eric Krebs and AMAS Musical Theater Inc. It starred Christopher Jackson, Carol Denise, Russell Joel Brown, Suzanne Griffin, Johnetta Alston, and Carl Hall. In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote, "The show calls itself "a New York musical revue," but aside from "Gentle Rain," which compares people to cockroaches, the lyrics include few references to urban life. The predominant musical style is the gospel-flavored pop-soul that flourished 25 years ago but has long since been usurped by funk, rap and hip-hop."
Plot
The show follows the relationship arcs of three unidentified romantic couples: a young streetwise couple, a 30 something yuppy pair, and a middleaged argumentative couple.

Pete Pifer (born December 10, 1944) is a former American football fullback who played for Oregon State from 1964 to 1966. He was the first player in Pacific Athletic Conference history to rush for 1,000 yards twice and won both the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy and the Pop Warner Trophy in 1966.
Early years
Pifer grew up in Ridgecrest, California, and played football at Sherman E. Burroughs High School.
Oregon State
Pifer enrolled at Oregon State University and played for the freshman football team in 1963.
As a junior in 1965, Pifer rushed for 1,095 yards and six touchdowns. His single-game totals included 131 yards against both Washington and Utah and 126 yards against USC. His 1,095 rushing yards was an Oregon State single-season record, and ranked fifth nationally among major college football players. He was selected as the first-team fullback on the 1965 PAC All-Conference football team. He was also selected as the most valuable player on the 1965 Oregon State Beavers football team.
As a senior in 1966, he rushed for 1,088 yards and 12 touchdowns. He led the Pac-8 Conference in both rushing yards (1,088) and scoring (72 points). He was also the first player in Pacific Coast Conference history to rush for 1,000 yards twice. At the end of the 1966 season, he received the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy, edging Mel Farr and Gary Beban as the outstanding college football player on the Pacific Coast. He also won the Pop Warner Trophy for 1966. He was also selected as Oregon State's most valuable player for the second consecutive season, finishing his career as Oregon State's all-time career rushing leader with 2,233 yards. Oregon State coach Dee Andros called him "the best football player I've ever coached."
Later years
Pifer was drafted by the New York Giants in the 11th round of the 1967 NFL Draft and played during the 1967 season for the Westchester Bulls of the Atlantic Coast Football League. After retiring from football, Pifer owned a McDonald's franchise in Morgantown, West Virginia, and later a restaurant in Springfield, Oregon.
In 1990, he was inducted into the Oregon State Athletics Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.

The Whenua Hou diving-petrel (Pelecanoides georgicus whenuahouensis) is a highly endangered subspecies of the South Georgia diving petrel that is endemic to New Zealand.
The subspecies was first described by Johannes H. Fischer and collaborators in 2018. While formerly considered a unique population of the South Georgia diving petrel, differences in habitat preference and analyses of phenotypic differentiations indicates that it could be considered as a distinct species. Only one extremely small population (less than 150 individuals) currently exists, breeding on the predator-free Whenua Hou island. There, it displays the unique nesting practice of burrowing into the sand dunes overlooking Sealers Bay, unlike the South Georgia diving petrel which nests on rocky slopes or flat land.
Based on subfossil remains, this subspecies formerly nested on Auckland Island and Stewart Island, and possibly on the Chatham and Macquarie islands as well. It was extirpated from Auckland due to nest destruction by New Zealand sea lions, while on Stewart it was extirpated due to nest predation by the introduced Polynesian rat. The remaining population itself is highly threatened by storm events; one such event in 2003 led to the collapse of many dunes, killing many birds. They are also threatened by the advance of coastal forest and invasive grasses and herbs over the dunes, as well as sea level rise due to climate change. While the petrel's foraging areas are unknown, an oil spill over this area would be devastating for this subspecies.

Cheer Up is a live album by trombonist/tubist Ray Anderson, drummer Han Bennink and guitarist Christy Doran which was released on the hat ART label in 1995.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek stated "This trio's first recording, the wonderful Azurety, met with acclaim by critics and music fans alike for its gleeful abandon, musically astute terrorism, and tunes that were stop-on-a-dime tight. The trio, which was initially together just for a tour, is now a working unit and this second recording proves it. ... This date is killer -- a blast to listen to. Guaranteed to cheer you up, even if you don't need it".

Jean-Marie Louis Dedecker (born 13 June 1952) is a Belgian politician.
In 1999 and 2003, Dedecker was directly elected to the Belgian Senate for the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD). In 2004 Dedecker ran for a seat in the Flemish Parliament, after taking his seat in the Flemish Parliament, Dedecker was elected by his colleagues as a community senator as well. He was expelled from the VLD, and eventually sided with the N-VA party for a brief time in November–December 2006. In January 2007, Dedecker presented his own political party— Lijst Dedecker—that participated in the 2007 general election. Against all expectations, Lijst Dedecker got 5 elected in Parliament, and 1 in Senate.
Dedecker became well-known first for his long career as a judo coach, with his judokas winning for Belgium unprecedented number of medals (among them four times Olympian gold), and then for his politics. In 2004, as a pure outsider, he won 38% of the votes for the VLD party leadership against the party establishment. He was expelled from the VLD though in October 2006.
Within the VLD he was one of the members that favours breaking the cordon sanitaire around the Vlaams Belang.
In 2006 (as VLD member) he published a book, Rechts voor de raap, which became a national best-seller.
In 2015 he was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal think tank Libera!.
Since 2019, he has been the mayor of Middelkerke. In the 2019 Belgian federal election, he was elected to parliament once again as an independent candidate on the N-VA's list.
VLD exit
The 2006 Belgian municipal elections were lost by the VLD, also in Ostend, where Dedecker was a candidate. In Ostend, they lost out to the Socialist Party (SP.A), for which party president Johan Vande Lanotte was a candidate in the city. In the run-up to the elections, Vande Lanotte and Dedecker clashed severely, with Dedecker claiming that Vande Lanotte, as councilor and socialist party "strong man," made Ostend the "Palermo of the North Sea." The local VLD party in Ostend, led by Bart Tommelein, does want to pursue a city coalition with the Socialist though. Dedecker however stated, on election night, that the VLD with this result cannot be part of any coalition. Two days later, the national head of the VLD, Bart Somers, intervened, by stating that Dedecker will be removed from the VLD. Somers stated that in the last few days Dedecker has showed himself to be a "inveterate troublemaker who keeps on creating damaging battles in his own party." Dedecker responded that "first they use me to attract votes in the local elections, only to put me on the street once the votes have been counted." Bart Tommelein later on accused Dedecker of being "the largest Calimero of Flemish politics."
It was not unlikely that Dedecker would step over to VLOTT, a party being led by Hugo Coveliers. Coveliers was also a VLD member, but was ejected when he clashed with then party head Karel De Gucht. He openly invited Dedecker to start a VLOTT division in West Flanders. In an opinion article for De Standaard Coveliers wrote: "...I predicted I would not be the last one. There were still some independent minds running around that had to be tamed...Jean-Marie Dedecker goes out the same way: the party leader of the SP.A decides that the VLD has to bring a sacrifice, which the VLD executive eagerly fulfills.... They thereby relinquish themselves of a tough contender. These corruptible politicians would simply not allow any criticism.... There is no one left to oppose them now Dedecker is liquidated.... With his liquidation, the VLD merges left, soon to turn left, to the left side of society. Far away from the original liberal voters and principles." Coveliers claims he was ejected from the VLD on command of (then) SP.A leader Steve Stevaert. Some believe the same thing happened to Dedecker, on command of Socialist Party leader Johan Vande Lanotte.
N-VA entry and exit
After being expelled from the VLD Dedecker looked into starting a new liberal party, which might have seen the involvement of Hugo Coveliers of VLOTT, and law professor Boudewijn Bouckaert. He made it clear that he would not join the Vlaams Belang, the largest right wing party of Flanders. In November 2006, Dedecker founded the right-liberal thinkthank Cassandra. On 30 November 2006 it was announced that Dedecker joined the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) on behalf of the N-VA party board, because it proved difficult in Belgium to meet the electoral threshold of 5% with a new party.
The Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V), with whom the N-VA had an electoral cartel agreement, stated they didn't want to be in league with Dedecker and broke off the association. On 9 December 2006, the N-VA party congress decided they preferred the cartel with CD&V over Dedecker; afterwards Dedecker resigned from the party he joined only ten days earlier.
Belgian cycling doping affair
In September 2006, Dedecker told the press that he had the names of three Belgian cyclists, who went to Italy for illegal doping treatments. In January 2007, Belgian cyclist Johan Museeuw admitted that he took stimulants during the last years of his cycling career, and that he confided this earlier to Dedecker. The newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws claimed on the basis of various accounts of people close to Quick Step-Innergetic manager Patrick Lefevere, that Lefevere has pushed cyclists to use illegal stimulants. Lefevere is now suing Dedecker for €75,000 over his earlier allegations about doping use among Belgian cyclists.
The information Dedecker gave in September 2006 led to house searches throughout Belgium in June 2007 of persons related to cycling. The judiciary found various illegal substances during the search.
LDD
On 3 January 2007, Dedecker announced that he would set up a new political party. On 4 January 2007, Dedecker explained his plans by stating that he wanted to be the Flemish party political equivalent of Geert Wilders and Pim Fortuyn. He called his project a healthy right-wing political formation.
On 6 January, a preparatory meeting was held in Ostend with some sympathizers, including Boudewijn Bouckaert (ex-VLD), former mayor of Ledegem Paul Vanhie, Walter Govaert, former alderman of Keerbergen John Lambrechts (also ex-VLD) and Saïd Bouharrak, a consultant of Belgian- Moroccan descent. Dedecker officially presented his new party on 19 January 2007. In the 2007 Belgian federal election, he was elected to the House of Representatives for his new party. In October 2009 he published the book Headscarf or Blindfold in which he criticized mass migration and advance of Islam in Europe. Following the 2010 Belgian federal election, Dedecker resigned as leader of the LDD and stepped down from national politics.
Return to politics
On 14 October 2018, Dedecker was elected as mayor of Middelkerke. In the 2019 Belgian federal election, he stood for the West Flanders constituency as an independent candidate affiliated to the N-VA's list. He was elected with 40,781 preferential votes and sat as an independent in the Chamber of Representatives. In October 2020, Dedecker stated in an interview that he will resign from parliament as he wanted to give priority to his mayorship.

Wolf's Castle Halt railway station was on the Clarbeston Road and Letterston line of the Great Western Railway. It served the villages of Wolf's Castle and Ford between 1913 and 1964.
History
The Clarbeston Road and Letterston Railway, s subsidiary of the Great Western Railway (GWR), was opened on 30 August 1906, but at first there were no intermediate stations. However, there was a signal box at Wolf's Castle, because although most of the route was built as double track, a portion near the middle, which included Spittal Tunnel and the cutting through Treffgarne Gorge, was single-track, and it was necessary to have signal boxes at each end of the single-track section. The single-track section was later doubled, but although the temporary signal boxes at Spittal and Treffgarne closed with the introduction of full double-track working on 17 December 1906, Wolf's Castle signal box was retained to break the section, allowing two trains to proceed in the same direction between Clarbeston Road and Letterston simultaneously; there was also a crossover.
The first of three intermediate stations to open on the line was Wolf's Castle Halt on 1 October 1913. It was situated from Paddington (via the Severn Tunnel), and was on a level stretch of line to the east of the signal box. The stations to either side in 1923 were and . Unusually for a GWR halt, the two platforms were built of brick rather than wood, as were the shelters. The up platform was long, and the down platform was long. The station nameboards stated "Wolf's Castle Halt for Treffgarne Rocks". The service was operated using GWR steam rail motors running between and ; there were three trains a day in each direction.
The crossover was removed in 1924, and the signal box was taken out of use on 17 February 1925; it was transferred to .
The station closed on 6 April 1964, as did all the other stations between Clarbeston Road and Fishguard Harbour.
In 2011, the waiting shelters on the platforms no longer exist and the line has been reduced to a single track positioned about halfway between the platforms, which would prevent any future use. The track is also raised on an embankment of ballast, so even if it was still alongside the platform the train doors would be some distance above the platform height.

William Smith (15??-16??) was an English sonneteer, poet, and friend of Edmund Spenser. He participated in The Phoenix Nest (1593), England's Helicon (1600) and published a sonnet sequence Chloris or The Complaint of the passionate despised Shepheard in 1596.
Works
Smith in 1596 published a collection of sonnets, entitled Chloris, or the Complaint of the passionate despised Shepheard, printed by Edmund Bollifant, 1596. The volume opens with two sonnets, inscribed "To the most excellent and learned shepheard, Collin Cloute" (i.e. Spenser), and signed "W. Smith"; in a third sonnet addressed to Spenser at the close of the book Smith calls Spenser his patron. The content consists of 48 sonnets, and a poem in 20 lines, called Corins Dreame of the faire Chloris. Corins Dreame was transferred to England's Helicon (1600 and 1614). The work was reprinted in Edward Arber's English Garner, viii. 171 sqq.
Attributions
Verse signed "W. S." has sometimes been attributed to Smith, but purely as a matter of conjecture. Cases include commendatory verse for John Grange's Golden Aphroditis, 1577, and Nicholas Breton's Wil of Wit, 1606.
Richard Heber owned a manuscript A New Yeares Guift, or a posie upon certen flowers, described as presented to Mary Sidney by the "author of Chloris" ; it is now in the British Library, MS. Addit. 35186. Plays signed "W. Smith" assigned at some points to Smith were by Wentworth Smith.

The white-bellied wren (Uropsila leucogastra) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is found in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.
Taxonomy and systematics
The white-bellied wren is the only member of genus Uropsila, but its taxonomy at the subspecies level is uncertain. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) names five subspecies, the nominate Uropsila leucogastra leucogastra, U. l. pacifica, U. l. centralis, U. l. restricta, and U. l. brachyura. The Handbook of Birds of the World adds U. l. musica. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Birds of the World mentions musica in its text but does not list it; it does list two others in addition to the above five, U. l. grisescens and U. l. australis. Cornell qualifies their additions by noting that australis "may be separable" and that grisescens is "doubtfully valid" because it was based on soot-discolored specimens.
Description
The white-bellied wren is long. Males weigh and females . The nominate subspecies has a medium brown crown, upperparts, and tail; the rump is slightly reddish and the tail has many thin dark bars. It has a gray-white supercilium, a medium brown stripe behind the eye, and gray cheeks mottled with brown. Its throat, chest, and upper belly are gray and the flanks and vent area buff. The other subspecies differ somewhat in the intensity of the brown of the upperparts and the bars on the tail.
Distribution and habitat
The white-bellied wren has two widely separated populations. U. l. pacifica is found in western Mexico from southern Nayarit south into Guerrero. The other subspecies are found from southern Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico south into the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, and northern Guatemala, and (slightly separately) in northern Honduras.
The white-bellied wren inhabits a range of woodland types from the semi-arid forest of western Mexico to the humid rainforest of the Yucatan Peninsula. In northeastern Mexico it frequents thickets of wild pineapple (Bromelia pinguin). In elevation it ranges from sea level to .
Behavior
Feeding
The white-bellied wren forages for insects and spiders in vegetation "from ground level to a considerable height". In the southern part of its range it joins mixed-species flocks following army ant swarms.
Breeding
The white-bellied wren's breeding season extends from at least late March to June. Its nest is shaped like a chemical retort, an oval ball with a downward pointing funnel entrance. It is woven from fine grass and "decorated" with lichens, moss, and other materials. It is usually placed in a spiny location such as a Bromelia thicket or an Acacia tree. The clutch size is usually four eggs. Both sexes apparently incubate the eggs and both do feed the young.
Vocalization
The white-bellied wren's song is "a short series of 6 rapid up-and-down notes, descending at end", rather bubbly in the eastern population but not the western. Its calls include a "low 'chek', scolding chatter, and hard dry cracking rattle."
Status
The IUCN has assessed the white-bellied wren as being of The Least Concern. It is reasonable common in much of its range, tolerates some habitat disturbance, and is found in several protected areas.

WEJS (1600 AM) is a classic country radio station in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States branded as "Bigfoot Legends". WEJS' first air date was August 1, 1979.
WEJS previously programmed a mix of general-interest and conservative talk radio from Salem Radio Network and Westwood One, alongside sports talk from Fox Sports Radio. The station also carries high school sports, Pennsylvania College of Technology athletics, and national sports from Sports USA Radio Network.
History
The then-WJSA was originally an AM only radio station authorized to operate during the daytime at 1600 on the dial. Though not a Christian format, the station did air some daily devotional programs. In the fall of 1980, the station's owner, Williamsport businessman Ken Breon, sought the help of John Hogg, seeking his expertise on broadcast engineering and programming. Within the year, Hogg was made General Manager. Under Mr. Hogg's management and with Mr. Breon's agreement and involvement, the station changed format to full-time Christian programming. The AM station also extended its hours of operation and improved coverage.
The birth of WJSA-FM
24 years ago, Mr. Hogg identified an available FM frequency which would provide extended coverage and allow 24 hours a day service. Two years later the FCC granted the application and Light for Life... WJSA-FM began broadcasting on November 1, 1984 with a power of 3,000 Watts at 93.5 FM. A new company to operate the facilities was formed, Covenant Broadcast Company, a partnership between Ken Breon and John Hogg.
Expanding the FM coverage
Almost immediately, Mr. Hogg identified the opportunity for several stations in the area to upgrade their signal strength by changing frequencies. This required cooperation of those stations and FCC approval took the next 12 years! In the early spring of 1997 this power upgrade was realized and Light for Life...WJSA's frequency was changed to 96.3 FM with a power equivalent of 25,000 Watts.
2014 changes
Effective January 17, 2014, Covenant Broadcast Company sold WJSA to Todd Bartley's Pioneer Sports Productions, LLC at a purchase price of $50,000.
On January 21, 2014, the station's call sign was changed to the current WEJS. The station dropped the Christian radio simulcast with former sister station WJSA-FM (96.3 FM) and FM translator W263AG (100.5 FM), and started broadcasting a sports radio format as 1600 AM ESPN.
2015 changes
Bartley transferred WEJS' license to his wholly owned Colonial Radio Group of Williamsport, LLC on August 17, 2015.
2016 changes
On May 18, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County issued an Order granting a motion by First Citizens Community Bank that a Receiver be appointed to take control of the radio stations and assets of Colonial Radio Group of Williamsport, LLC and to facilitate the sale of the stations and pay the proceeds to the bank.
2017 changes
On March 1, 2017, WEJS switched affiliations from ESPN Radio to Fox Sports Radio.
In July, 2017, WEJS ended its simulcast with sister-station WLYC and rebranded itself to "NewsTalk 104.1 & 1600", airing a mix of conservative talk, news, and sports.
2020 changes
On April 8, 2020, Terry Ginn, Receiver, filed an application on FCC form 316 for the involuntary assignment of license of the stations pursuant to the Court of Common Pleas' Order of January 15, 2019 due to the current owner's refusal to sign any Asset Purchase Agreement for the stations or otherwise cooperate in the sale of the station to the prospective
purchaser.
On May 16, 2020, WEJS was taken silent by Terry Ginn, the court appointed receiver of the previous licensee while the receiver and the prospective buyer negotiates an asset purchase agreement and files for the assignment of the station. The station was to return to operation after the consummation of the assignment of the station by the prospective new licensee.
On May 29, 2020, an asset purchase agreement for WEJS, sister-station WLYC, and associated translators between Terry Ginn, Receiver and Seven Mountains Media, LLC & Southern Belle, LLC was filed with the FCC with a closing date within 15 business days after the final order has occurred. The purchase was consummated on October 5, 2020, at a price of $100,000.
2022 changes
On February 1, 2022 WEJS changed their format from news/talk to a simulcast of classic country-formatted sister station WLYC 1050 AM Williamsport, branded as "Bigfoot Legends".

Leuchars Station is a British Army installation located in Leuchars, Fife, on the east coast of Scotland, near to the historic town of St Andrews.
Formerly RAF Leuchars, it was the second most northerly air defence station in the United Kingdom (the most northerly being RAF Lossiemouth). The station ceased to be an RAF station in April 2015 when control of the site was transferred to the Army.
History
RAF Leuchars
The Royal Air Force station at Leuchars opened on 16 March 1920, although its association with the military can be traced back to 1911 when military balloons were operated at the site. During its history the site was used as a RNAS fleet fighter station and later as a RAF Coastal Command airfield. Throughout the Cold War and beyond, the station was home to fighter aircraft which policed northern UK airspace. The station also hosted an annual International Airshow.
Transfer to the Army
On 18 July 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox announced that RAF Leuchars would close as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, with the station being transferred to British Army control in 2015 and the Typhoon aircraft based at Leuchars moving to RAF Lossiemouth in Moray.
In preparation for the closure, RAF Leuchars Mountain Rescue Team disbanded in November 2013 whilst No. 58 Squadron of the RAF Regiment and No. 6 Force Protection Wing disbanded on 10 May 2014. No. 6 Squadron was the first Typhoon unit to depart Leuchars, heading for its new home at Lossiemouth in June 2014. No. 1 Squadron followed on 8 September 2014, at which point responsibility for Quick Reaction Alert (North) was transferred from Leuchars to Lossiemouth.
Control of Leuchars was transferred to the British Army on 31 March 2015, when it was renamed Leuchars Station. The term 'station' was used as the size of the installation is smaller than a garrison but larger than a barracks and to reflect the range of armies and RAF occupants. The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards gradually relocated from Germany in the spring and summer of 2015 along with 2 Close Support Battalion of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and 110 Provost Company, Royal Military Police. The transition from RAF to Army control was considered to have gone smoothly by Fife Council in terms of its impact on the local community.
In February 2018, local councillors suggested that the name of the installation be changed as it could be confused with Leuchars Railway Station.
RAF Typhoon FGR4 aircraft and the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North capability operated from Leuchars between 10 August and the week commencing 16 October 2020 whilst the intersection of RAF Losisemouth's two runways was resurfaced.
Role and operations
In December 2018, there were approximately 750 members of the UK regular armed forces, 30 members of the full time reserve service personnel and 100 civil servants based at Leuchars.
British Army
The primary Army unit based at Leuchars is the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. It is a cavalry regiment which specialises in the reconnaissance role. It is equipped with the Jackal 2 armoured fighting vehicle and the Coyote tactical support vehicle.
Other army units included 2 Close Support Battalion of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and 110 Provost Company of the Royal Military Police.
Royal Air Force
The station continues to be home to several RAF units, including No. 612 (County of Aberdeen) Squadron RAuxAF, the East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron incorporating No. 12 Air Experience Flight, and the headquarters of Scotland and Northern Ireland Region and South East Scotland Wing of the Air Training Corps.
The airfield is maintained by the RAF as a diversion airfield for military aircraft.

Iris Versari (12 December 1922 – 18 August 1944) was an Italian partisan from Emilia-Romagna who was decorated with a Gold Medal of Military Valour on 16 April 1976.
Biography
Early life
Daughter of Angelo Versari, Iris lived with her family in Tredozio, a small town near Forlì. From a young age, Iris shown her strong spirit by escaping the unwanted attention she received from the male members of the wealthy families of Forlì where she worked as a handmaid. This humiliation shaped her strong character. This humiliation shaped her strong personality.
Shortly after Iris got back home in Tredozio, in Autumn 1943, her family decided to hide in their house a partisan brigade.The family house was set on fire by the Nazis on 27 January 1944. Versari managed to escape, but her family (her father, mother and two of her three brothers) were arrested. Her father was sent to trial and sentenced to four years in prison, then he was interned in a Nazi concentration camp Nazi concentration camp, where he died.
Contribution to Italian Resistance movement
In January 1944, Iris joined the Italian partisan brigade commanded by Silvio Corbari, fighting alongside him and also becoming his lover. Together, they took part to many brave actions against the Nazi forces.
On 18 August 1944, at dawn, in Ca' Cornio (near Tredozio), the house where Iris was hiding with Silvio Corbari, Arturo Spazzoli and Adriano Casadei was surrounded by Nazi troops. Informed about their presence by a spy, the troops tried to break in the house.
Although she could not move because her leg was wounded in a previous gunfight, Iris managed to kill the first soldier who entered the house. But then she realized she could be an obstacle to her comrades' escape and decided to kill herself. Despite her sacrifice, Corbari, Spazzoli and Casadei were caught and killed.
Her dead body, together with those of her comrades, was hung under the colonnades of Castrocaro Terme and then on a lamp post in Piazza Aurelio Saffi, the central square of Forlì, so that everyone could see them.
Acknowledgements and honours
Two upper secondary schools in Italy are named after Iris Versari: a trade school in Cesena (FC) and a senior high school in Cesano Maderno (MB). Streets in Forlì, Cesena (1949) and Rome (1993) were also named after her.
In 2007, a bill was presented to commemorate the women that took part to the Italian resistance movement, which would establish the construction of two monuments depicting Iris Versari, one in Forlì and one in Portico and San Benedetto (FC).
Versari was decorated with a Gold Medal of Military Valour on 16 April 1976:
A young woman of modest origins, in her twenties, following the tradition of the brave people of Romagna she did not hesitate to put herself at risk to fight the arrogant oppression of the invader, by joining a local partisan brigade. Daring and intrepid, she took active part in numerous guerrilla actions, distinguishing herself as a leader and a valiant fighter. During her last fight, when the enemies surrounded her and other partisans in an isolated farmhouse, though being injured and unable to move, she exhorted her companions to break the encirclement and, fighting fiercely, facilitated their escape. After having shot down the enemy officer who first entered the farmhouse, aware of the fate that awaited her if she fell alive into the hands of the cruel enemy, she killed herself. Thus she sacrificed her young life to those ideals she had nourished in her short but glorious existence. – Terra di Romagna, 9 September 1943 – 18 August 1944

Mark Edgley-Smith [the hyphen disappeared at some point] (20 March 1955 – 26 July 2008) was a British composer. He was born in Wimbledon and educated at Tiffin School, Kingston upon Thames. There it was soon apparent that he was equally gifted as artist (which was how he would later earn his living), composer, and litterateur/wit. It was at Tiffin that he began to compose seriously and had his first composition lessons, from David Nield. He won a scholarship (1974) to read music at the Queen's College, Oxford.
Edgley Smith's style could be diatonically tuneful, as in the Vancouver Songbook, a project of part-songs for the Vancouver Bach Children's Chorus. At other times it was highly complex and chromatic (The House of Sleep). Sometimes these extremes can be found in a single work, as in the five madrigals to poems by e e cummings (1994), which won a competition for new choral music and were later released on CD. In 2001 his setting of Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky, commissioned by the Cheltenham Festival of Music, was premièred by members of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. Other works have been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (Songs my Auntie Taught Me), the Fine Arts Brass Ensemble.(Fanfares for Forgotten Occasions), the Tippett Quartet (string quartet) and the composer-pianist Robert Keeley («People of Liberated City …»).
Mark Edgley Smith had a daughter, Anna February Edgley-Smith (born 25 February 1983), and a son, Milo Henry Edgley-Smith (born 4 May 1999). He died in Cheltenham, aged 53.

John Colin Theodore Page (20 May 1930 – 14 December 1990) was an English cricketer, cricket coach and manager. He played for Kent County Cricket Club as a right-arm bowler between 1950 and 1963. Page played in 198 first-class matches, taking 521 wickets. He was later the manager and coach of Kent and the director of youth coaching at the club and is considered to have been a major factor behind the success of the county side during the 1970s.
Playing career
Page was born at Mereworth in Kent in 1930. He first appeared for Kent's Second XI in 1948, before being taken on by the side as a fast-medium bowler in 1949. He made his senior debut for the side in 1950, and six matches that season were followed by three in 1951, but he was not impressing as a fast bowler. He began to transition to bowling off spin in 1952 and soon broke into the side on a more regular basis, playing 18 matches and taking 61 wickets during the season.
He continued to play regularly for Kent's First XI until 1959 and was awarded his county cap in 1957, although during the winter he worked at a paper mill in Aylesford. He took 12 wickets in a match against Northants in 1954, spun Kent to victory with 6/33 on a rain-affected Lord's pitch in 1955, and took 69 wickets at an average of less than 19 in 1957, including eight wickets in an innings against Warwickshire, his career best innings figures. Although he took 86 wickets in 1958 and 72 in 1959, his Wisden obituary wrote that it "seemed that he had reached his ceiling", and he was offered the position of Second XI captain in 1960.
In this role he was to help nurture talent with the intention that the county might compete for honours in the future. His side won the Second XI Championship three times, and future England internationals Alan Knott, Derek Underwood, Mike Denness and Brian Luckhurst all passed through the team. He played occasionally for the First XI, making 11 appearances between 1960 and 1963, and was still playing Second XI cricket in 1974.
In total Page made 198 first-class appearances, taking taking 521 wickets at an average of 28.72. He was a poor batsman and scored only 818 runs at an average of 5.48 runs per innings.
Coaching career and death
Wisden called Page's appointment as Second XI captain in 1960 the "turning-point" in his career. The players he captained were the nucleus of the Kent side which won the 1967 Gillette Cup and went on to claim eight one-day cricket trophies during the 1970s. He was particularly instrumental in promoting Brian Luckhurst to the county's First XI, recommending him when an opening became available for a batsman in 1961, and was influential in Luckhurst's recall to the side in 1962 and in his promotion to opening batsman the following season. Luckhurst went on to play almost 500 times for Kent and in 21 Test matches for England.
The side had also won the 1970 County Championship, their first Championships since the period before the First World War, and when Page succeeded Les Ames as Kent's manager in 1975 the side were joint winners of the Championship in 1977 and won the competition outright the following season. According to Paul Farbrace, who coached Kent and the Sri Lanka national cricket team, he favoured man-management rather than expert coaching, although he clashed with Mike Denness soon after becoming manager, leading to Denness leaving the club. In 1981 Page became Kent's Director of Youth Cricket, a role he held until shortly before his death. He lived at Offham and was Chairman of Offham Cricket Club between 1968 and 1971.
Page died in a car crash at Tunbridge Wells in 1990 whilst driving home from a coaching session at Sevenoaks. He was aged 60. A scholarship in his memory is presented to a Kent Academy player each year.

Helmien Willie Rambaldo (born 13 November 1980) is a Dutch former cricketer who played as a right-handed batter and occasional right-arm off break bowler. She appeared in one Test match, 46 One Day Internationals and 10 Twenty20 Internationals for the Netherlands between 1998 and 2011, and captained the team between 2007 and 2011, including in the side's inaugural Test and WT20I. She played domestic cricket for Boland in South Africa between 2003–04 and 2006–07.
Life and career
Born in The Hague, Rambaldo's older sister, Caroline Rambaldo, also played international cricket for the Netherlands. Both sisters played their club cricket for Quick Haag (nl). Helmien Rambaldo made her ODI debut in July 1998, aged only 17, scoring two runs against Denmark in what was the first ODI played in Germany (at the Mikkelberg-Kunst-und-Cricket Center). Slotting into the side as a top-order batter, her next matches in that format came at the 1999 European Championship in Denmark. Her performance there was unremarkable, with only 16 runs from three innings, but she maintained her place in the Dutch squad for its next major tournament, the 2000 World Cup in New Zealand. At the World Cup, Rambaldo was selected for only three of a possible seven matches, but top-scored with 38 against Sri Lanka, opening the batting with Maartje Köster.
When the Netherlands toured Pakistan in April 2001, Rambaldo featured in six of their seven ODIs against the Pakistani national team, and finished the tournament behind only Pauline te Beest and Carolien Salomons for runs scored. In the sixth game, as the ninth player brought on to bowl, she finished 2/13 from five overs – her first ODI wickets and what were to be her best bowling figures. In 2003, Rambaldo moved to South Africa to study sport science at Western Cape's Stellenbosch University. She continued to play for the Netherlands throughout her degree, but also played cricket for her university and for Boland in the South African provincial set-up, until graduating in 2006.
In July and August 2007, South Africa went on a tour of the Netherlands, playing three ODIs and a Test – the first (and so far only) Test match played by any Dutch team, men or women. The Test was Rambaldo's first international match as captain, with Carolien Salomons having stepped down the previous year. She would remain the side's captain until she stepped down prior to the 2012 season. At the 2008 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa, Rambaldo played a key role in helping the Netherlands to a semi-final. In a group-stage game against Bermuda, she was player of the match, scoring 59 from 55 balls opening with Violet Wattenberg, and helping the Dutch team to a 196-run win. Later in the tournament, in the semi-final against Pakistan, Rambaldo caught Pakistani number-eleven batsman Sadia Yousuf at short cover to give Lotte Egging a hat-trick, the first by a Dutchwoman.
Rambaldo only recorded one half-century in her ODI career, 67 against Sri Lanka in the 2010 Women's Cricket Challenge in South Africa. Her next-best had been 46 against Japan in the 2003 IWCC Trophy. Rambaldo finished her career with 723 runs from 46 ODIs, in both cases behind only Pauline te Beest and Carolien Salomons for the Netherlands. She captained the Netherlands in one Test, 25 ODIs, and ten T20Is, with the team winning only a single match under her captaincy in those formats – an ODI against Ireland at the 2011 European Championship, by two wickets.

Oxen, cows, beef cattle, buffalo and so on are an important motif in Chinese mythology. There are many myths about the oxen or ox-like beings, including both celestial and earthly varieties. The myths range from ones which include oxen or composite beings with ox characteristics as major actors to ones which focus on human or divine actors, in which the role of the oxen are more subsidiary. In some cases, Chinese myths focus on oxen-related subjects, such as plowing and agriculture or ox-powered carriage. Another important role for beef cattle is in the religious capacity of sacrificial offerings.
Terminology
The Chinese character 牛 () used for "ox" is rather non-specific. It can refer to a male, castrate or not, or to a female, young or old, of various species of the bovine family which have been domesticated for use as draft animals, with their strength being harnessed for various purposes, especially carting loads and various types of farm work, such as plowing. Niú also can be construed as singular or plural. However, male cattle used for hard labor are often castrated in order to make them more tractable, as well as providing better quality meat when finally consumed.
Background
Myth versus history
In the study of historical Chinese culture and other ethnic cultures in the area of what is now China, many of the stories that have been or are told regarding various characters and events have a double tradition: one of which traditions present a more historicized version and a more rationalized account, and, another version which presents a more mythological and perhaps fantastic account (Yang 2005:12–13). This is also true of the accounts involving to mythological bovids.
Bovids
Oxen, in some cases, are real creatures, of the bovine subfamily. Some have been domesticated, and used in China (or what is now China), for several millennia, doing such tasks as related to agriculture, hauling, or other applications requiring great strength. Despite the use of mechanical innovations such tractors and other modern machinery, the ox has not been totally replaced, and many areas still follow traditional methods, and tell variations of traditional myths involving oxen.
Taxonomy
The family Bovidae includes almost 140 species of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals with characteristic unbranching horns covered in a permanent sheath of keratin in at least the males, but in terms of domestic cattle in China, this widespread family tends to be represented by the genus Bos in the north, similar to the familiar European and American domestic cattle; the Bubalus ("water buffalo"), generally in the warmer and wetter areas of the south, such as the Yangzi River valley; and, the yak (also in the genus Bos), in the higher and colder elevations of the more westward regions. There were many crosses between the various types, including with the zebu (taxonomically another Bos), and many specialized breeds developed over the millennia.
Agriculture
Various types of oxen have been domesticated in the area of what is now modern China for thousands of years, used for agriculture, transportation, for food, and other purposes. These generally powerful creatures have had a significant role in turning and tilling the soil with the plow, hauling loads by pulling an oxcart, turning millstones and waterwheels, and in the case of the yak, being saddled and ridden by humans or carrying loads mounted on their backs. The water buffalo also is ridden, though in a more bareback style. Sometimes the animals are raced for sport, or otherwise used for entertainment. The use of ox dung has had an important role both as a fertilizer and as fuel. Horns, bones, and hides of oxen have been employed for many purposes. Horns to make spoons and cups, bones for various purposes, and hides for leather. Many myths and religious beliefs have arisen around these various types of oxen during this multimillennial interaction between humans and oxen.
Chinese mythology
Chinese mythology refers to those myths found in the historical geographic area of China. This includes myths in Chinese and other languages, as transmitted by Han Chinese as well as other ethnic groups (of which fifty-six are officially recognized by the current administration of China) (Yang 2005:4). Various motifs of oxen exist in Chinese mythology. In some cases the focus of the motif is on an ox or oxen as the protagonist of the action, in other cases they appear in a supporting role, sometimes as the locomotive power propelling a cart, wagon, a plow, or providing the rotary power to turn a grindstone or millwheel.
Ox star(s)
The Chinese ox star (or constellation) corresponds more-or-less with the constellation Capricornus. The Ox mansion (牛宿, pinyin: Niú Xiù) is one of the Twenty-eight mansions of the Chinese constellations. It is one of the northern mansions of the Black Tortoise. The determinative star is beta Capricorni (β Capricorni), known as 牛宿一 (Niú Su yī, literally, the First Star of Ox); or, rather, β Capricorni appears to be a star, to the naked eye, but actually resolves into double star systems, according to modern astronomy, and even with just slight magnification appears to be a double star.
Ox-Herd and Weaver-Girl
One of the myths involving the interaction of humans or divine beings and oxen is related to a popular holiday held on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month. In Chinese mythology, there is a love story of Qi Xi ( literally, "the Seventh Night"), in which Niulang (the Cow-Herd) (, Altair) and his two children (β and γ Aquilae) are separated from their mother Zhinü (the Weaver-Girl) (, lit. "Weaving Girl", Vega) who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way. Niulang was very upset when he found his wife was taken back to heaven. Upset by the separation, the ox saw this happens and became a boat for Niulang to carry his children up to Heaven. The ox actually was once the god of cattle, but downgraded as he had violated the law of Heaven. Niulang once saved the ox when it was sick.
However, one day per year, on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, magpies make a bridge so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nü can be together again for a brief encounter. This is the explanatory myth behind one of the major Chinese holiday festivals, sometimes known as "Chinese Valentines Day" or Qixi Festival - two of its many names.
Zodiacal ox
The "Chinese zodiac" consists of a twelve-year cycle, each year being associated with a certain creature. The second in the cycle is the Ox. One account is that the order of the beings-of-the-year is due to their order in completing a contest of racing across a river, in the so-called Great Race: the race being to determine which creatures, in which order, would be the namesakes of the twelve-year cycle. The race was run, and swum, the finishing line being across a great river. The Rat and the Ox crossed easily enough, the Ox due to being large and powerful and adept both on land and in water: the Rat asked the good-natured Ox for a ride on its back, but then ungratefully jumped off at the last minute to cross the finish line first. This is told to explain why the Rat and the Ox do not get along together.
List of ox years, with accompanying signs
The Year of the Ox is denoted by the Earthly Branch character 丑. In the Vietnamese zodiac, the water buffalo occupies the position of the Ox. The 12 animal years vary according to a biquinary year change cycle, which varies according to the 5 elemental changes as well as varying by the 2 yin and yang states. The 1961 – 1962 Year of the Ox is a Yin Metal Ox Year: as the cycle repeats itself every 60 years, so is the 2021 – 2022 Year.

How the Heavenly Oxen came to Earth
According to a myth told by Chinese peasants, the original plow-oxen lived in Heaven, as the Ox stars. However, the Emperor of Heaven, taking pity on the starving people of the Earth, and wishing to help them, sent the Oxen with the message that if they worked hard, they would starve no more, and that they could be sure to have a meal at least every three days. The Oxen got the message mixed-up, and instead told the people that the Emperor of Heaven promised them that if they worked hard, that they would be able to eat three times a day. This put the Emperor of Heaven in a bit of a predicament, since the people on their own would not be able to accomplish this. Therefore, to punish the oxen for getting the message wrong, and not to appear himself to be a liar, he restricted the Oxen to the Earth, where they became regular oxen, working the farms helping the people of Earth with their farm work.
Shujun
Shujun is a Chinese god of farming and cultivation, also known as Yijun and Shangjun. Alternatively he is a legendary culture hero of ancient times, who was in the family tree of ancient Chinese emperors descended from the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi). Either way, Shujun is considered to be a relative of Di Jun and Houji, and a minister of Yellow Emperor. Shujun is specially credited with inventing the agricultural practice of using a draft animal of the bovine family to pull a plow to cultivate the soil prior to planting, loosening and turning it, thus greatly enhancing agricultural productivity, and then teaching this skill to others (Yang, 2005: p. 201).
Hai
Hai is also said to have been the first to have domesticated the cow and invented the oxcart. (Yang (2005), p. 70).
Composite ox beings
Various creatures, including legendary people and mythical creatures have some ox features which contribute to the parts out of which they are constituted. These include the Ox-Head guardians of Hell, the partially ox-featured god and mythological figure Chiyou, and others.
Ox-Heads
Ox-Head () and Horse-Face () are two fearsome guardians or types guardian of the Underworld in Chinese mythology, where the dead face suffering prior to reincarnation. As indicated by their names, Ox-head has the head of an ox, and Horse-face has the face of a horse. They are the first people a dead soul meets upon arriving in the Underworld; in many stories they directly escort the newly dead to the Underworld.
Chiyou
Chiyou was a war god and inventor of weapons, descended from Yan Di. Some sources describe him as being ox-headed. Lihui Yang describes Chiyou as having a six-handed human body, horned, four-eyed head with swords and spears for ears and temples, and ox hooves (2005: p. 92).
Taiyuan
In the villages of Taiyuan, sacrificing the head of an ox to Chiyou is considered improper, because he was ox-headed himself (Yang, 2005: p. 93).
Miao
Some Miao people consider Chiyou to be their ancestor. They worship oxen, which they consider to be lucky and heroic, and protective bringers of prosperity, and they wear ox horn motifs embroidered on their clothes or decorated on silver ornaments (Yang, 2005: p. 93).
Totemic ancestors
According to their mythology, as recorded in Chinese sources, the Kyrgyz people who were red-haired and had white faces claimed to be the descendants of a mating in a mountain cave between a cow and a god (Schafer, 1963: p. 73).
Religious Sacrifice
An important role of cattle was in the capacity of serving as a religious sacrifice. An animal or animals would be ceremoniously slaughtered as a presentation to one or more deities or ancestral spirits. A portion of the sacrificial remains would be dedicated to these, and the rest generally would be distributed to the human participants of the ceremony, and eaten. Special dwarf breeds specially for this purpose seem to have existed during the Zhou dynasty: one type being the "millet ox", 稷牛 (Schafer, 1963: pp. 73, 298, 376).
Sacrificial tradition was probably the root of the Chinese New Year ceremony of "beating the Spring Ox" 打春牛. The last, together with its spirit driver Mangshen 芒神, was made of clay and consequentially whipped and smashed to pieces, as a symbol of instigation of the spring agricultural growth. Spring Ox is one of the usual motifs of the New Year pictures and agricultural almanacs.

During the Tang dynasty, it was reported that the natives of Kucha (now part of Xinjiang), as part of their New Years ceremonies, would utilize fighting oxen (and other fighting animals) in order to foretell whether and how much their herds would increase or decrease during the course of the ensuing year (Schafer, 1963: p. 73–74).
Origin of earthquakes
According to a widespread Gansu province myth, earthquakes have their origin in the annoyed shrugging of the ox which bears the earth on its back (Yang, 2005: 178).
Symbolism in art
Ox herdboys riding oxen have been used as a motif in painting and graphic arts to symbolize the ability of the mind to control the body. That is, philosophically, symbolizing the ability of intellectual will to rule bodily strength and its physical urges.
Quotes
"Since antiquity the Chinese had had many varieties of oxen, including fantastic races with motley hides, developed for the manifold sacrifices to the archaic gods" — Edward H. Schafer (1963), p. 73.

The Estonian Drama Theatre () is a theatre in Tallinn, Estonia. It has the role of a national theatre for Estonia. The Estonia Theatre is located next door.
History
The building that houses the Estonian Drama Theatre was originally built for the German theatre of Tallinn and completed in 1910 to designs by Saint Petersburg architects Nikolai Vassilyev and Alexey Bubyr. The style is Art Nouveau or, more specifically, National Romantic.
An Estonian-language drama school was set up in Tallinn in 1920 by , and from this the Estonian Drama Theatre was formed in 1924. It was originally called the Drama Studio Theatre and rented the stage of the German theatre. In 1939 the theatre however purchased the building and has been housed there ever since. The theatre was renamed the Estonian Drama Theatre in 1937. During the Soviet occupation the theatre was called the Viktor Kingissepp Tallinn National Drama Theatre but it reverted to its old name in 1989, prior to Estonia's re-gained independence.
Theatre
The theatre today fulfills the role of an Estonian national theatre. It has three stages, with 436, 170 and 70 seats each. Both classical plays and new productions, including experimental plays, are staged at the theatre. Since it was founded, the Estonian Drama Theatre has cooperated with and staged plays by playwrights such as Hugo Raudsepp, August Kitzberg, Eduard Vilde, A. H. Tammsaare, Mats Traat, Jaan Kross and Oskar Luts. During the 1980s, the theatre took on a political role as it staged plays with themes critical to the Soviet occupation and in favour of Estonian independence by writers like Jaan Kruusvall and Rein Saluri.

Competitive Foods Australia (CFA) is the largest franchiser of restaurants in Australia. It is owned and operated by Jack Cowin. Its units are Hungry Jack's and, previously, some KFC stores.
Holdings
Hungry Jack's
Hungry Jack's is the exclusive Australian master franchisee of Burger King Corporation. Competitive Foods Australia owns over 400 Hungry Jack's stores.
When Burger King decided to expand its operations into Australia, it found that its business name was already trademarked by a man running a small takeaway food shop in Adelaide. Thus, Burger King was forced to change the name when it decided to open stores in the country – the only time this has happened in its corporate history. Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, Jack Cowin, with a list of possible alternative names that the Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. The names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury. Cowin selected the "Hungry Jack" brand name, one of Pillsbury's US pancake mixture products, and slightly changing the name to a possessive form by adding an apostrophe 's' thus forming the new name Hungry Jack's. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in Perth in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's.
Hungry Jack's currently owns and operates or sub-licenses all of the Hungry Jack's and Burger King restaurants in Australia. As the master franchise for the continent, the company is responsible for licensing new operators, opening its own stores and performing standards oversight of franchised locations in Australia.
KFC
In 2013, Competitive Foods sold all 44 of its KFC stores to Collins Foods for $55.6 million.
Legal issues
Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's
In 1991, Hungry Jack's Pty Limited renewed its franchise agreement with Burger King Corporation which allowed Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee. However, one of the conditions of the agreement was that Hungry Jack's had to open a certain number of stores each year for the term of the contract. In 1996, shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed, Burger King Corporation made a claim that Hungry Jack's had violated the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to to expand the chain at the rate defined in the contract and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd, began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and throughout the Australian regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. Additionally, Burger King Corporation sought to limit Hungry Jack's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.
As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his company Competitive Foods Australia, began legal proceedings in 2001 against the Burger King Corporation claiming Burger King Corporation had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. The Supreme Court of New South Wales agreed with Cowin and determined that Burger King Corporation had violated the terms of the contract and awarded Hungry Jack's A$46.9 million. In its decision, the Court said that Burger King sought to engineer a default of the franchise agreement so that the company could limit the number of new Hungry Jack's branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, which was a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.
After Burger King Corporation lost the case, it decided to terminate its business in the country and sold its operations and assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand's master franchisee. TPF administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make Hungry Jack's the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to ensure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. TPF transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack's, which subsequently renamed the majority of the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack's. While Hungry Jack's is now the exclusive master franchisee for Burger King in Australia and has the right to allow new Burger King locations in the country, no new locations have opened and only a small handful of Burger King restaurants remain in New South Wales.
Yum! Brands and CFA
In October, 2007 a similar issue arose between KFC parent Yum! Brands and CFA over Yum's refusal to renew the franchise agreement in Western Australia. Yum was reported to have made an offer to CFA for the properties that was below market value, which CFA refused. The issue has drawn a large amount of scrutiny in the local press and inspired local Labor MP Paul Papalia to call upon the Western Australian and Australian Federal governments to launch inquiries on the issue.

Giovanni Gaetano Bottari (15 January 1689, Florence – 5 June 1775, Rome) was Vatican librarian and counsellor to Pope Clement XII.
Biography
Before he became Vatican librarian, he was director of the grand-ducal press of Tuscany and professor of ecclesiastical history and controversy in the Sapienza.
He is the author of several treatises about art and artists. Amongst his works is Dialoghi sopra le tre Arti del Disegno, published in Lucca, 1754. In these dialogues he criticizes the role of patrons, who "understand little of art" (Dialoghi II & III). He was also principal editor of the new edition of the Vocabulario della Crusca and of the celebrated Vatican edition of Virgil (1741).
Bottari was acquainted to Piranesi. He probably collaborated on Piranesi's answers to the letters of Pierre-Jean Mariette, and Piranesi dedicated his Antichità Romane de' Tempi della Repubblic to Bottari.

Lipocystis is a genus of parasitic alveolates of the phylum Apicomplexa.
Species in this genus infect insects.
Taxonomy
This genus was created by Grell in 1938. Grell observed the parasite during his work for his PhD thesis.
The only recognised species in this genus is Lipocystis polyspora.
Description
The life cycle of this parasite occurs within the fat body of the host. Transmission is via the oro-faecal route.
The infective sporozoites are fusiform. Once ingested the sporozoites invade the wall of the gut en route to the fat body.
After invasion the sporozoites enlarge into rounded micronuclear meronts (nuclear diameter = 1 micron).
This first round of merogony produces merozoites with small nuclei which their turn become meronts.
The second generation meronts produce two types of merozoites either with large nuclei which again give rise to merozoites or spheroidal gamonts.
The gamonts enlarge and pair in syzygy.
This pairing in its turn leads to the formation of multimucleate gametocytes.
These gametocytes form gametes which are released and fuse.
After gamete fusion a zygote results.
Within each zygote up to 200 navicular (boat like) oocysts may form.
Each oocyst contains 8 sporozoites.
Host records
This species infects the scorpion fly (Panorpa communis).

The Spot is a locality in south-eastern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Spot is located in the south-eastern part of the suburb of Randwick, around the intersection of Perouse Road and St Pauls Street. It is a vibrant part of Randwick and consists of a collection of shops, restaurants, cafes and a cinema.
The Spot is a heritage conservation area and has many heritage listed buildings, such as the Ritz Cinema and Pan Arcadian House, a 1930s Masonic Temple and most notably the facade of shops on the corner of Perouse Road and St Pauls Street which follows a curved pattern, necessary for the tram route which used to extend to Coogee Beach.
The Royal Hotel and Randwick shopping centre are a short distance away. The area is well served by public transport with regular buses from the Sydney CBD and Bondi Junction.
Name
The Spot lies at the geographic centre of a residential suburb that some maps identify as “St Pauls”. The post office located at The Spot is also officially "St Pauls 2031." However, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales does not list “St Pauls” as an officially registered place name within the Randwick Local Government Area.
The locality name of "The Spot", too, is not officially registered with the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales and, despite wide use, would appear to remain unofficial.
History
Early days of the colony
Research by a local historical society has revealed that The Spot probably lies on trails that were made through the bushland by members of the earliest European settlements in Sydney Cove. Centrally placed at The Spot is a plinth on which is mounted a plaque that notes:Between January and March, 1788, members of the Lapérouse expedition at Botany Bay and the First Fleet at Sydney Cove passed this place on goodwill visits. Their route is followed closely by parts of Avoca St., Frenchmans Rd. and Perouse Rd. Randwick.
'Struggletown'
During the early years of the Randwick municipality, the area to the west of The Spot (Barker and Botany Streets) was home to labourers and workmen who built some of the finer homes in the Randwick area. The area was often referred to as 'Struggletown' or, less commonly, 'Irish Town'. The Struggletown name lives on near The Spot, in the form of the business name of the local veterinary clinic in Barker Street.
Cultural activities
The Ritz Cinema
The Ritz Cinema, built in 1937, is an example of the art deco cinema architecture that found a home in Australia during the 1920s and 1930s. The architect, Aaron Bolt, is known for his classic art deco buildings throughout Sydney, such as his commissions for grand apartment buildings in Potts Point.
Since its construction, the cinema has been owned by, among others, the Hoyts cinema group and the Brigidine Sisters (an order of nuns running the adjacent Brigidine College). In the late 1980s, the current owners planned to demolish the existing cinema and to redevelop the site. However, Randwick City Council and the then Minister for Planning intervened and a Permanent Conservation Order was imposed on The Ritz building in March, 1993. The current owners refurbished the building in the late 1990s, adding additional cinemas to the original single principal cinema theatre in order to allow The Ritz to survive in the era of competition with larger multiplex cinema chains.
In 1997, The Ritz Cinema was placed on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Council. This record notes that:
The Ritz Cinema is the only one of three remaining theatres of this style in an unaltered state still used as a cinema in New South Wales and is one of the few surviving examples of the hundreds of cinemas which were built during the 1930s, one of the most creative periods of cinematic design in Australia... The Ritz, which has operated almost continuously as a movie theatre since 1937, has social values as a community cultural entertainment centre in the Randwick area. The place is also highly valued by the Art Deco Society... The Ritz is significant for its intact and well detailed Art Deco design and is a prominent element in the St Paul's Road urban precinct ...
The Spot Food and Film Festival
Since 2008 Randwick City Council has held an annual food and film festival at The Spot featuring special screenings of films at The Ritz, live performances and food stalls. The Spot Food and Film Festival is run as a part of the Coogee Arts Festival.
Australian Film Walk of Fame
In 2008, The Australian Film Festival, The Spot Chamber of Commerce and Randwick City Council established the Australian Film Walk of Fame, which is a "recognition of successful Australian artists in the film industry" and consists of a series of brass plaques set in the pavement on the northern side of St Pauls Street outside the Ritz Cinema. The Council has noted that The Spot Food and Film Festival will provide an ongoing opportunity for additional notable persons to be inducted into the Walk of Fame in the future. The first person recognised in the Walk of Fame was Australian actor Charles "Bud" Tingwell, whose plaque stands outside the Ritz Cinema. Other Australian cinema identities commemorated in the Walk of Fame include: Michael Caton; Roy Billing; Steve Bisley; and Claudia Karvan.
Architectural heritage in the area
Under the Randwick Local Environment Plan 2012 a number of buildings in the vicinity of The Spot are listed as heritage items and the immediate locale a designated Heritage Conservation Area. Buildings within the Heritage Conservation Area around The Spot include:
13 Lee Street - an Edwardian residence built c 1910 (item I402 )

The Travancore Cochin Republican Praja Party was a political party in Travancore-Cochin, India. The party was floated in 1951 by a group of wealthy plantation owners, led by A.V. George. A.V. George was the general secretary of the party and A.C.M. Anthraper was its president. The party had a right-wing profile.
The party fielded seven candidates in the 1951 Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly election. In spite of having plenty of money for their campaign, none of its candidates were elected. Together they obtained 53,034 votes (1.56% of the votes in the state). A.V. George himself finished in second place in the Kottayam constituency, with 8,649 votes
(29.07%).
The party was dissolved in 1952.

He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) journal Polymer Chemistry, a principal investigator within the Soft Matter Materials Laboratory at QUT and associate research group leader at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
Education and career
After his undergraduate studies of chemistry at the Universities of Constance and Goettingen (Germany), Christopher Barner-Kowollik earns his PhD in physical chemistry (Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Goettingen in 1999. Following postdoctoral research with Prof. Tom Davis at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, he held academic positions at the Centre for Advanced Macromolecular Design (CAMD), and was appointed Full Professor of Polymer Chemistry in 2006 at the same institution. In 2008 he moved back to Germany, where he became the Chair of Macromolecular Chemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). There he was the founding director of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 1176 'Molecular Structuring of Soft Matter' established by the German Research Council (DFG). He is a founding PI and thrust speaker in the DFG Excellence Cluster 3D Matter Made to Order. While he relocated in 2017 to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), where he was awarded an Australian Laureate Fellowship and appointed Director of QUT's Soft Matter Materials Laboratory, Christopher Barner-Kowollik continues to be an associate group leader at the KIT's Institute of Nanotechnology and the Institute of Polymer Chemistry and Chemical Technology, after heading a full research group at the KIT until 2020. In December 2019, Christopher Barner-Kowollik was appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Vice-President of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
Research
Initially his research was in the field of polymer chemistry and polymer reaction kinetics. His research has expanded towards the fusion of polymer chemistry with organic and photochemistry. Current research areas include the development of advanced wavelength-orthogonal reactions and their photophysical understanding, most notably opening the field of action spectra for photochemical covalent bond formation and cleavage, translated to the photochemical synthesis of highly defined macromolecular architectures. The developed photochemical platform finds application for the design of 2D and 3D photolithographic processes as well as in biosystems including single cell scaffolds. Christopher Barner-Kowollik has published over 700 peer-reviewed research papers which have been cited close to 40,000 times.

Cameraria ostryarella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New York, Connecticut and Vermont in the United States.
The wingspan is 6–7 mm.
The larvae feed on Ostrya species, including Ostrya virginiana and Ostrya virginica. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a blotch mine on the upperside of the leaf. As many as four or five may occur in one mine. The hibernating larvae pass the winter in circular silken-lined chambers, the outline appearing on the upper epidermis as a circular narrow ridge.

Baruch Abuhatzeira (; born 1941), also known as Baba Baruch, is a Moroccan-Israeli Kabbalist rabbi and spiritual adviser who operates in Netivot, a blue-collar town in southern Israel. He is the son of the leading Moroccan rabbi Israel Abuhatzeira, also known as the Baba Sali, and thus scion of the Abu Hasira/Abuhatzeira family.
Baruch was born in Arfoud in the Tafilalt region in eastern Morocco. There, he was educated by his father. During his youth Baruch spent several years in Paris. In the mid-1960s, Baruch emigrated to Israel with his father, and he decided to pursue a political career. He was elected deputy mayor in Ashkelon, and served on the city council as the leader of the local MAFDAL (National-Religious Party) faction. In this position, Abuhatzeira was convicted for taking bribes and served a five year sentence in Maasiyahu prison. After his release, Abuhatzeira joined his father Baba Sali, and was with him during the last three months of the Rabbi's life.
During the shiva (week of mourning) on the death of the Baba Sali, Abuhatzeira donned his father's robe and announced himself as the Baba Sali's heir. Subsequently, however, the daily newspaper Hadashot published Abuhatzeira's letters to a woman who was not his wife, which he had written during his stint in prison. Abuhatzeira sued to prevent publication of the letters, but was denied, in part on the basis that the community he desired to lead had a legitimate interest in knowing his character.
Abuhatzeira is the arch-rival of another Netivot mystic, Yaakov Israel Ifargan. In 2010, Netivot's city comptroller, Shimon Alon, allegedly at Abuhatzeira's, was arrested on suspicion of paying a young woman to seduce Ifargan and photograph him in intimate positions, with the aim of tarnishing his image.

Tickle Channel () is a narrow channel in the south part of Hanusse Bay, from 1 to 3 nautical miles (6 km) wide and 5 nautical miles (9 km) long, extending northward from The Gullet and separating Hansen Island from the east extremity of Adelaide Island. First seen from the air by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) on a flight in February 1936. Surveyed from the ground in 1948 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), who applied this descriptive name. In Newfoundland and Labrador a tickle is a narrow water passage as between two islands.

The IKV-3 "Kotka" is an FAI Open Class glider that was designed by Tuomo Tervo and Jorma Jalkanen. The prototype first flew in 1966. It was produced initially by IK-Vasama and KK. Lehtovaara.
The name IKV is an acronym for Ilmailukerho Vasama, the Vasama gliding club that sponsored the project.
Design and development
The IKV-3 was designed and the sole example produced between 1964-1966.
The wings are built from pine with a birch-plywood skin to 55% from the leading edge. The wing employs a Wortmann FX62-K-152 airfoil at the wing root, a Wortmann FX62-K-153 mid-span and a Wortmann FX60-126 at the wing tip. The ailerons are 3.1m long and are constructed with foam plastic ribs and covered with plywood. The wing also features eight-section dive brakes for glidepath control. The horizontal and vertical stabilizers as well as the flaps are covered with plywood and have foam plastic ribs. The rudder is covered with aircraft fabric.
The fuselage is built from pine, with fibreglass from the nose to behind the wing and plywood aft of there. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel equipped with a drumbrake.

Todd Hido (born 25 August 1968) is an American photographer. He has produced 17 books, had his work exhibited widely and included in various public collections. Hido is currently an adjunct professor at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco.
Life and work
Hido was born August 25, 1968, in Kent, Ohio, and graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School in 1986. He graduated in 1991 with a B.F.A. from Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts and School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Between 1991 and 1992 he studied at Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island. In 1996 he gained an M.F.A. from California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland, California. Among his professors was the photographer Larry Sultan, who will later become his mentor.
Much of Hido's earlier work involves photographs of urban and suburban housing across the U.S.. Hido accidentally approached what would be one of his best-known themes, when driving at night on the West Coast, he started photographing houses in different neighborhoods. The houses often seemed isolated and had mostly in common the presence of a window with the light on. From this research it came his book House Hunting, published in 2001.
He then started to include figures, mostly female nudes in interiors, and also to depict rural landscapes. In 2006 he published the monograph Between The Two. Hido combines interior photos and portraits taken of models and actresses, maintaining an aesthetic similar to that of its first publication. Also in this book there are night shots of buildings. No text or description were inserted, so as to leave the viewer total freedom of interpretation. In 2018, he released Bright Black World, his first work photographed outside the U.S. with environmental overtones.
Hido says he is influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, Edward Hopper, Stephen Shore, Robert Adams, Walker Evans, Nan Goldin, Emmet Gowin, Larry Sultan, Alfred Stieglitz, Andreas Gursky and Rineke Dijkstra. Commissioned by Italian brand Bottega Veneta, he photographed actress Lauren Hutton as well as models Joan Smalls and Vittoria Ceretti for the brand's spring/summer 2017 advertisements.

Pantosaurus ("all lizard") is an extinct genus of plesiosaur from the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) of what is now Wyoming. It lived in what used to be the Sundance Sea. It was originally named Parasaurus ("near lizard") by Othniel Charles Marsh in reference to Plesiosaurus, but that name was preoccupied, and Marsh changed it. The species Muraenosaurus reedii is in fact a junior synonym of Pantosaurus. The holotype YPM 543 is a partial articulated skeleton, partially prepared to yield a distal humerus, four articulated carpals, a fragment of the coracoid, and several isolated cervical vertebrae from the Upper Member of the Sundance Formation. Other material includes USNM 536963, USNM 536965, UW 3, UW 5544 and UW 15938.
Palaeobiology
Pantosaurus possesses between 35 and 40 cervical vertebrae, which are very similar in proportion and morphology to those of Muraenosaurus leedsii from the Oxford Clay Formation (Callovian, Middle Jurassic) of England. The forelimb of Pantosaurus however can be differentiated from that of Muraenosaurus, such as the relatively large size of the radius and the corresponding humerus-radius articulation. No Pantosaurus cranial material has yet been discovered.
Feeding
The discovery of an partially digested embryonic ichthyosaur (probably Baptanodon) inside of a fossil referable to Pantosaurus striatus was the first evidence of the consumption of ichthyosaurs by plesiosaurs.

The Casa del Cabildo, also called Palacio de la Gobernación, is located in the Plaza de la Proclamación. It is currently the seat of the Government of the Bolívar Department, whose capital is Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia.
The Cabildo originally had a seat in another house, whose upper floor served as the residence of the governors as they passed through the administration of Cartagena, while the lower floor served as a prison.
Starting in 1614, the city began to ask for a new building for the town hall and the city jail. After delays and long procedures, the city bought a house in the main square from the Holy Office and had it torn down to build the town hall, the portals with shops for the notaries and the grain store. However, this project fell apart when the Holy Inquisition presented objections at the last minute.
Several years passed without the work being done, until in 1676 the new building was built. The Casa del Cabildo de Cartagena is in the style of the Castilian town halls, which are characterized by the double galleries open to the square.
The Cabildo has a terrace, balconies and balustrades on the façade, also has a body with three arches on each floor.
The Casa del Cabildo is a historical monument of the first order, since apart from having been the seat of the colonial City Council, an inn for governors and commanders of the stronghold of Cartagena de Indias, and visited by viceroys, prelates, liberators and presidents, among other illustrious guests, in its main hall the Declaration of the Independence of Cartagena was signed on November 11, 1811.

Chronoamperometry is an electrochemical technique in which the potential of the working electrode is stepped and the resulting current from faradaic processes occurring at the electrode (caused by the potential step) is monitored as a function of time. The functional relationship between current response and time is measured after applying single or double potential step to the working electrode of the electrochemical system. Limited information about the identity of the electrolyzed species can be obtained from the ratio of the peak oxidation current versus the peak reduction current. However, as with all pulsed techniques, chronoamperometry generates high charging currents, which decay exponentially with time as any RC circuit. The Faradaic current - which is due to electron transfer events and is most often the current component of interest - decays as described in the Cottrell equation. In most electrochemical cells this decay is much slower than the charging decay-cells with no supporting electrolyte are notable exceptions. Most commonly a three electrode system is used. Since the current is integrated over relatively longer time intervals, chronoamperometry gives a better signal to noise ratio in comparison to other amperometric techniques.
There are two types of chronoamperometry that are commonly used, controlled-potential chronoamperometry and controlled-current chronoamperometry. Before running controlled-potential chronoamperometry, cyclic voltametries are run to determine the reduction potential of the analytes. Generally, chronoamperometry uses fixed area electrodes, which is suitable for studying electrode processes of coupled chemical reactions, especially the reaction mechanism of organic electrochemistry.
Example
Anthracene in deoxygenated dimethylformamide (DMF) will be reduced (An + e− -> An−) at the electrode surface that is at a certain negative potential. The reduction will be diffusion-limited, thereby causing the current to drop in time (proportional to the diffusion gradient that is formed by diffusion).
You can do this experiment several times increasing electrode potentials from low to high. (In between the experiments, the solution should be stirred.) When you measure the current i(t) at a certain fixed time point τ after applying the voltage, you will see that at a certain moment the current i(τ) does not rise anymore; you have reached the mass-transfer-limited region. This means that anthracene arrives as fast as diffusion can bring it to the electrode.
History
In 1902, F. G. Cottrell deduced the linear diffusion on a planar electrode according to the diffusion law and Laplace transform, and obtained the Cottrell equation: , where i is the current in amps, n is the number of electrons, F is Faraday constant, A is the area of the planar electrode in cm2, C0 is the initial concentration of the analyte in mol/cm3. D is the diffusion coefficient for species in cm2/s, t is the time in s. Under controlled-diffusion circumstances, the current-time plot reflects the concentration gradient of the solution near the electrode surface. The current is directly proportional to the concentration at the electrode surface.
In 1922, Jaroslav Heyrovský reiterated the chronoamperometric method when he invented the polarographic method. It can use the basic circuit of the polarograph. To connect the fast recorder or oscilloscope, the dropping mercury electrode is not used, instead, the static electrodes such as suspended mercury, mercury poll or platinum, gold and graphite are used. In addition, the solution is not stirred. In the presence of the inert electrolytes, the mass transfer process is mainly diffusion. Jarroslav Herovsky derived the chronopotentiometric method from the Cottrell equation. Chronopotentiometry is an electrochemical method that can generate a stable current that can flow between two different electrodes.
Application
Controlled-potential (bulk) electrolysis
One of the application of chronoamperometry is controlled-potential (bulk) electrolysis, which is also known as potentiostatic coulometry. During this process, a constant potential is applied to the working electrode and current is monitored over time. The analyte in one oxidation state will be oxidized or reduced to another oxidation state. The current will decrease to the baseline (approaching zero) as the analyte is consumed. This process shows the total charge (in coulomb) that flows in the reaction. Total charge (n value) is calculated by integration of area under the current plot and the application of the Faraday's law.
The cell for controlled-potential (bulk) electrolysis is usually a two-compartment (divided) cell, contained a carbon rod auxiliary anode and is separated from the cathode compartment by a coarse glass frit and methyl cellulose solvent electrolyte plug. The reason for the two compartment cell is to separate cathodic and anodic reaction. The working electrode for bulk electrolysis could be a RVC disk, which has larger surface area to increase the rate of the reaction.
Controlled-potential electrolysis is normally utilized with cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry is capable to analyse the electrochemical behavior of the analyte or the reaction. For instance, cyclic voltammetry could tell us the cathodic potential of an analyte. Since the cathodic potential of this analyte is obtained, controlled-potential electrolysis could hold this constant potential for the reaction to happen.
Double potential step chronoamperometry
Double potential step chronoamperometry (DPSCA) is the technique whose working electrode is applied by the potential stepping forward for a certain period of time and backward for a period of time. The current is monitored and plotted with respect to time. This method starts with an induction period. In this period, several initial conditions will be applied to the electrochemical cell so that cell is able to equilibrate to those conditions. The working electrode potential will be held at the initial potential under these conditions for a specified period (i.e. usually 3 seconds). When the induction period is over, the working cells switch to another potential for a certain amount of time. After the first step is completed, the working electrode's potential will stepped back, usually to the potential prior to the forward step. The whole experiment ends with a relaxation period. Under this period, the default condition involves holding the working electrode potential of initial state for another approximate 1 seconds. When the relaxation period is over, the post experiment idle conditions will be applied to the cell so that the instrument can return to the idle state1. After plotting the current as a function of time, a chronoamperogram will occur and it can also be used to generate Cottrell plots.
Two methods from chronoanalysis
Chronopotentiometry
The application of chronopotentiometry could be derived into two parts. As an analytical method, the range of analysis is normally in the range of 10−4 mol/L to 10−2 mol/L, and sometimes it will be as accurate as 10−5 mol/L. When the analysis is in the extreme lower range of concentration, lower current density could be used. Also, to get the accurate concentration determination, the transition time could be extended. In this area of analysis determination, chronopotentiometry is similar to polarography. Waves that are separable in polarography is also separable in chronopotentiometry.
Chronopotentiometry is an effective method to study electrode mechanism. Different electrode will have different relationship between E and t in the chronopotentiometry graph. In this situation, E is the electrode potential in voltage and t is the reaction time in seconds. By the method of studying the relationship between E and t in the chronopotentiometry graph, we can get the information of mechanisms of electrode reactions, such as the electrode reaction of hydrogen peroxide and oxalic acid. The chronopotentiometry experiment could be done in a very short time period, so it is a good method to study the adsorption behavior at the electrode surface. By studying the chronopotentiometry graph of electrode after adsorption of iron ions, it is proved that the adsorption of platinum on iron ions exists. By studying the chronopotentiometry graph of platinum electrode adsorbing iodine, it is proved that the adsorption of iodine occurs in the form of iodine molecules, not iodine atoms.
Chronocoulometry
Chronocoulometry is an analytical method that has similar principle with chronoamperometry, but it monitors the relationship between charge and time instead of current and time. Chronocoulometry has the following differences with chronoamperometry: the signal increases over time instead of decreasing; the act of integration minimizes noise, resulting in a smooth hyperbolic response curve; and contributions from double-layer charging and absorbed species are easily observed.

"Como Tú No Hay Dos" (English: Like You There Ain't Two) is a song by Mexican singer-songwriter Thalía featuring American singer and rapper Becky G, from the former's twelfth studio album Amore Mío (2014).
The song, written by A. Matheus, Andy Clay, Rassel Marcano and Gomez, and produced by Armando Avila, was released by Sony Music Latin as the second single from the album in the United States on January 20, 2015.
Background and release
The song was released on January 20, 2015. The track features Spanglish vocals by both singers, with Thalía leaning more towards Spanish compared to Gomez's Spanish-sprinkled English verses. The fact that the song was in Spanglish was received as a surprise since Thalía rarely sings in English.
Live performance
Thalía and Becky G performed the song at the Premios Lo Nuestro 2015. The performance drew attention because of two incidents: one after Becky G turned her head away as Thalía was going to kiss her forehead and another when Thalía messed up the choreography and accidentally placed her hand on Becky's private area.
Music video
The music video was released on March 19, 2015, on Thalía's official YouTube channel. The video shows Thalía and Becky singing and dancing in a rave-like setting.

The Mashonaland Eagles is one of five cricket Zimbabwean cricket franchises. They are based in the Harare Metropolitan and Mashonaland Central area and play both first-class and limited overs cricket. They play their home matches at Harare Sports Club in Harare.
Franchise history
In the 2009–10 season, Zimbabwe Cricket following the decline of the standard of cricket, decided to use a new set of teams in all the first-class, List A and T20 domestic formats of the game. A total of 5 teams were named, and the Mashonaland Eagles franchise was based in Harare.
2009–10 Logan Cup
Coming into this tournament, Mash Eagles were the favourites. They performed according to expectations by winning the tournament, by drawing the Mid West Rhinos in the final (they finished winners in virtue of finishing top of the group pool, and also coming first in the group.
On 14 September, the Eagles made their first-class debut against the Mountaineers. It was also the tournament opener. The match was drawn.
They then drew with Mid West Rhinos, and then got their first-ever first-class victory when they crushed Southern Rocks by 234 runs. They then continued their campaign with a six-wicket victory over Matabeleland Tuskers and another six-wicket win over Mountaineers. Another six wicket victory followed over Mid West Rhinos, and then a draw was achieved against the Southern Rocks at Masvingo. This was followed by a crushing nine-wicket win over the Tuskers, which was followed by a draw with Mountaineers. Following another draw with Mid West Rhinos, the Eagles then crushed Southern Rocks by an innings and 19 runs. Following this, they suffered the first ever first-class loss, a seven-wicket defeat to the Tuskers. The final against Mid West Rhinos was drawn, but Eagles finished champions on virtue of finishing first in the group pool.
2009–10 Faithwear Metbank One-Day Competition
Mash Eagles began their Faithwear Metbank campaign with a 4-wicket loss to Mountaineers, but duly bounced back to finish third in the pool and qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-final, they were defeated by the Mid West Rhinos by 2 wickets, thus getting eliminated.
2009–10 Stanbic Bank 20 Series
Mash Eagles had an excellent start to their debut Twenty20 campaign as they beat Matabeleland Tuskers by 5 wickets at Harare. They continued their good form throughout the group matches, eventually finishing first in the pool with 17 points.
On virtue of finishing top, Eagles faced Mountaineers who had finished second in the group phase. They were the hot favourites to win the game and the series, considering the fact that the Eagles had downed the Mountaineers by 82 runs at Harare in their last encounter, with the Eagle's premier spinner, Ray Price taking remarkable figures of 5/12 in 2.5 overs in a total Mountaineers batting total of 59. However the final culminated in a nine-wicket upset loss for the hosts as renowned internationals and former schoolmates Hamilton Masakadza (64*) and Tatenda Taibu (37*) led Mountaineers to the inaugural Stanbic Bank Twenty20 trophy.
2010–11 Logan Cup
Mashonaland Eagles (the defending champions) had a poor Logan Cup. They finished in fourth place, just 2 points better than last-placed Southern Rocks. Whats more, they did not record a single win (they lost six matches and drew six).
2010–11 Metbank Pro40 Championship
Mashonaland Eagles had a disastrous Pro40 campaign finishing absolutely bottom of the pool with just 2 wins from 8 matches. This saw them not get a place in the semi-finals, and were thus eliminated out of the competition.
2010–11 Stanbic Bank 20 Series
After disastrous Logan Cup and Pro40 campaigns, Mash Eagles signed off the season in style by winning the second Stanbic Bank 20 Series. They became champions by defeating Mid West Rhinos in a thrilling one-run win. They were captained admirably in the tournament by former Zimbabwean great Grant Flower, and contained international stars such as Andrew Hall, Ryan ten Doeschate, and Nick Compton. They had earlier qualified for the final in a nervy, tense, unsure, one-wicket win over Matabeleland Tuskers.
2011–12 Logan Cup
Mash Eagles opened the new season with a 3-wicket win over Southern Rocks at Masvingo. They continued that momentum with a heavy 132-run win over Mountaineers. As of proceedings till now, Mashonaland Eagles is at the second position of the group, with 2 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss in 4 matches.
Coca-Cola Pro50 Championship
The Mashonaland Eagles won the title in the 2011–2012 season, after winning 6 of their 8 games during the season.
2011–12 Stanbic Bank 20 Series
Mash Eagles warmed up for the series with a three-match T20I series against the Kenya national cricket team. The Mash Eagles won the first match by 3 wickets mostly due to Nathan Waller's miserly spell of 1/14 in 3 overs and an unbeaten 34 off 29 by Forster Mutizwa. This was followed by another 2-wicket win over the visitors. This also secured the series. However, Kenya managed an upset 3-wicket win the last T20I, thanks to a brilliant unbeaten 42 off 21 balls by Rakep Patel, who batted down the order.
For this series, the Eagles signed up international stars such as Ryan ten Doeschate, Rory Hamilton-Brown, and Peter Trego. They however, had the worst possible start to the tournament as Matabeleland Tuskers, who were strengthened by the signings of international class players, such as Chris Gayle and Paul Horton, steam-rolled them by 7 wickets. They lost all their initial three matches, and looked all but eliminated, but had a timely 70-run victory against Southern Rocks that put them back into contention. They then defeated Mid West Rhinos by 53 runs to earn a spot in the playoff final against Matabeleland Tuskers.
In the playoff final, they defeated the favourites Tuskers in a shock win by 23 runs in the Duckworth–Lewis method. Ryan ten Doeschates exploding 121* off 58 took the Eagles to a massive 207/7, they defeated the Tuskers despite exploding half-centuries by both Chris Gayle and Steven Trenchard. In the final they were defeated by the champions Mountaineers and the Eagles had folded for 115 thus losing by 27 runs despite chasing a target of 143.
Players
When the franchise made their debut in the 2009–10 Logan Cup, they then had Zimbabwean international and domestic cricketers. Key players at that time included skipper and all-rounder Elton Chigumbura, batsmen Ryan Butterworth, Barney Rogers, the aggressive Cephas Zhuwao, all-rounders like the skipper himself, and Greg Lamb, wicket-keepers like Regis Chakabva, Forster Mutizwa, and bowlers like Douglas Hondo, Darlington Matambanadzo, and Ray Price. Their first major overseas signing was England's Chris Silverwood, who played in the 2009–10 Stanbic Bank 20 Series.
For the 2010–11 season, the Mash Eagles had many developments in their squads. Andrew Hall, who had played one-day internationals for South Africa, and was a former Northamptonshire captain, was named the player coach, while former Zimbabwean great Grant Flower was the coach. They also signed up Nottinghamshire fast bowler Charlie Shreck and South African-born Somerset batsman Nick Compton. However, the results were disappointing with poor Logan Cup and Pro40 tournaments. They however signed off the season in style with a thrilling one-run win over Mid West Rhinos in the final of the Stanbic Bank 20 Series, thus securing the trophy.
When the initial contracts of the 2011–12 season were announced, captain of the previous two seasons Elton Chigumbura was dropped as he had joined the Southern Rocks. Wicket-keeper batsman Forster Mutizwa was named as his replacement. However, later on Stuart Matsikenyeri took over as captain for the Stanbic Bank 20 Series. Also newcomers included bright prospects such as opening batsman Sikandar Raza and fast bowler Nathan Waller. Major omissions initially also included the franchise's stalwart spinner, Ray Price, but later made a comeback to the team.
For the Stanbic Bank Twenty20, former captain Chigumbura made his comeback to the team. For the later part of that tournament, overseas player Rory Hamilton-Brown captained the side. The squad also included players like Peter Trego, and Ryan ten Doeschate (retained from previous season). The Eagles had a fine tournament, finishing in second place to Mountaineers.
For the 2011–12 season, Kevin Curran was named as Mash Eagles coach, replacing Flower.

The ivory-billed woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus flavigaster) is a species of bird of the order of Passerformes, which are perching birds. It is in the family Furnariidae (ovenbirds) and the subfamily Dendrocolaptinae (woodcreepers).
It is a rather large, fairly common woodcreeper of tropical forest in both dry and humid areas of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and heavily degraded former forest.
The ivory-billed woodcreeper feeds mainly on larger trunks, often probing into bromeliads and moving methodically. Note the long stout bill, which is mostly pale (but not really ivory colored), and the bold streaking on the head, back, and underparts.
Its length is 20–26·5 cm (7.8--10.5 inches; the male weighs 40–62 g (1.4--2.2 oz), and the female weighs 35–56g (1.24–2 oz).

Carlos Zerpa (born 1950 in Valencia, Venezuela), was a 20th-century Latin American painter. He moved to live in Milan in 1973 to study printmaking and photography at the Scuola Cova, and design with Bruno Munari at the Instituto Politécnico. Zerpa was a self-taught painter, by 1974 he was creating installations and performance pieces. He returned to Venezuela in 1980, but spent two years in New York: (1982 to 1984). By 1984 he ceased performing and concentrated on making objects. His work is in many ways autobiographical. It recalls department store displays cases which serve as stages for his homages to the past.
Zerpa also trained in design, photography and printmaking, paintings, drawings, sculptures, performances and installations, He exhibited internationally and won many awards. Carlos Zerpa trained in Italy, Germany, and United States; he blended kitsch with references to Giotto, van Gogh, Picasso, and Duchamp. His focus was towards historical themes in terms of spatial and temporal shifts was addressed to several Venezuelan artist one of them being Carlos Zerpa. The preoccupation with time seems especially relevant in a country whose historical development does not go back much before the eighteenth century. Carlos Zerpa and Miguel von Dangel chose as their referent the period of the discovery of the new world and just prior, through a mythology of its human and animal inhabitants primarily located in the Caribbean and the area now occupied by Venezuela. Zerpa after Christopher Columbus encountering “new tribes, strange animals and lush forests” Carlos capitalized these myths as well as on his grasp of Western art history, from which he appropriated liberally.
Influence:
Carlos Zerpa series the” India Nova's” El Dorado was greatly influenced by Theodor de Bry, a Flemish designer, engraver, and printmaker. Zerpa valued de Bry's work that his most recognized series was his interpretation on acrylic painting series called “El Dorado” which was based on the fanciful chronicles and records of European explorers and visually on prints by the Belgium artist. Zerpa deliberately created a secondhand visual account of an already distorted Eurocentric one by borrowing from de Bry; he perpetuated the farce by enhancing/ modifying a modern-day mythology for the new world. Zerpa did his own version of “El Dorado” the de Bry's 1594 print of an Indian ruler being dusted with gold before a ritual ceremony. In Zerpa's garishly colored painting, the Indian ruler stands in a classical contrapposto while the attendants sponge him with paint and blow the gold powder onto his naked body. A dark eagle hovers menacingly above. Zerpa reversed the figures to account for the fact that the source was a printed image. The eagle in his painting substitutes for a mountain in de Bry's print. Zerpa managed to incorporate personal genuine totaling, for example by reversing the figures seeing as it was a printed image it was easily manipulated, he also replaced the mountain on de Bry's print with an eagle. There is major diversity on both de Bry's piece with Zerpa depiction of “El Dorado”, but both equally respond individual. Zerpa's transformation of “El Dorado”(1987;PL. 12.8), “The Golden One” was a very stylistic approach with vibrant neon colors lavishing from the ground up. The totality of the golden one deems modern, pop art capturing historical events from time in an original method.
Another work by Zerpa “Acefalo A cephalous, or (The Headless one 1987), he parodies accounts of a headless tribe with an arrow-bearing figure whose face is on his chest. In one of his typical anachronisms, Zerpa includes a barely detectable chair in the sky above the figure, appropriated from van Gogh's painting of his bedroom in Arles.
Other works by the Carlos Zerpa series are, [El Dorado], [The Golden One] in the Nova series of 1987, acrylic on canvas 192x132 cm which exhibited at Caracas, Mercantil Collection. Other paintings Zerpa interprets [Acephalous, or The Headless One](1987), [This Golden Whale] (1987), [Trito, an Adam in the Tropics] (1986). Zerpa had solo exhibitions at the Museo de Arte Carillo Gil in Mexico City in 1993 and at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas in 1994.

Antony Thachuparambil (8 December 1894 – 9 June 1963), popularly known as the Missionary of Chelakkara was an Indian Syro-Malabar priest and social reformer who worked in the backward area of Chelakkara, Thrissur District, Kerala, India. He was declared Servant of God by the Holy See in 2009 for his Heroic Virtues.
Early years
Antony Thachuparambil was born on 8 December 1894 in Kottat, a suburban village of Chalakudy in Kerala to Poulose and Rosa. He had his early schooling in Chalakudy Government High School and college education in St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli. He continued his pastoral education at Mary Matha Major Seminary, Thrissur and was ordained on 22 Dec 1924.
Social career
Thachuparambil started his career in 1928 as the first Chaplain of Chelakkara, a backward forest area in Thrissur. There, he worked among the poor and he built St. Mary's Forane Church, a school for girls (Little Flower Girls High School), a destitute home for children which was later renamed Fr. Antony Balabhavan, a convent for nuns, Little Flower Convent and a health clinic which later grew to become Jeevodaya Mission Hospital.
Canonization
Thachuparambil is said to be credited with several miracles which are being considered and verified by Roman Catholic Church. His contributions for the overall development of Chelakkara, reportedly irrespective of the caste, creed or colour, were considered by the Roman Catholic Church when deciding upon initiation of his canonization process. Paul Pulikkan was appointed the postulator and as the first step towards canonization, Antony Thachuparambil was declared Servant of God by the Roman Catholic Church on 9 December 2009. In December 2020, the diocese court completed the formalities and prepared an 8090-page document detailing the priest's life and works, to be submitted to the Holy See.
In the media
Shalom Television aired a documentary on the life of Thachuparambil as an episode under their series, Saints Town in 2015.

The 2019 Tonga measles outbreak began in October 2019 after a squad of Tongan rugby players came back from New Zealand. The epidemic as of 8 December is currently ongoing. As of 5 January, there have been 612 cases of measles.
Background
Beginning in 2017, the WHO began tracking measles outbreaks in the Asia Pacific Region. Measles has been spreading throughout the Pacific region, with outbreaks in Tonga, Fiji, Australia, Cambodia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Samoa, the Philippines and New Zealand. Previously, measles had been believed to be eradicated in the Asia Pacific Region, with the last reported case in 2014, prior to the outbreak.
Samoa, Tonga and Fiji have all declared states of emergency to tackle their 2019 measles outbreaks. When contrasting the scores of deaths in Samoa to the lack of fatalities in Tonga and Fiji, this is put down to the far higher vaccination rates in Tonga and Fiji compared to the 31% in Samoa.
Most of the cases have been on the island of Tongatapu where the first cases started, with 88% of all cases located on Tongatapu and 10% located on the neighboring island of Vava'u.
Vaccine hesitancy
The outbreak has been attributed to a sharp drop in measles vaccination in Samoa from the previous year, following an incident in 2018 when two infants died in Samoa shortly after receiving measles vaccinations, which led the country to suspend its measles vaccination program. The reason for the two infants' deaths was incorrect preparation of the vaccine by two nurses who mixed vaccine powder with expired anaesthetic. The nurses responsible were sentenced to 5 years in prison with manslaughter charges and Samoa began arresting anti-vaccination advocates. The United States' Center of Disease Control sent representatives to Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji to coordinate vaccine efforts and combate vaccine misinformation.
Government response
Ministry of Health chief executive, Siale 'Akau'ola, said more than 12,000 people had been re-vaccinated. This vaccination program targeted school children and 6-11 month-old infants. A second vaccination program was conducted in February 2020, targeting children ages 1–9 years old. The vaccination rate in Tonga was over 90% which might stem the infection rates seen in Samoa and New Zealand. In November, 2019, the Tongan Minister of Education shut down all primary schools until the beginning of 2020.
International response
UNICEF has sent almost 300,000 vaccines to Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Tokelau and Tuvalu, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji have also declared states of emergency. The WHO and UNICEF have developed a toolkit for Pacific Island Nations following the outbreak to aid in further measles prevention. Tonga closed all schools for several days while American Samoa required all travelers from Tonga and Samoa to present proof of vaccination. The United States' Center for Disease control placed a Level 1 travel ban to the Kingdom of Tonga following the outbreak.
Since 1 October, UNICEF has delivered 12,000 measles vaccines to Tonga. UNICEF later provided 6,000 additional doses of the vaccine cold chain following the success of the first administration. Through domestic and internationally coordinated efforts, 44,605 individuals under the age of 24 were vaccinated by January 2020. This included administration of supplementary vaccines for previously vaccinated individuals in conjunction with routine childhood vaccination.
On 10 December, American Samoa declared a measle outbreak and closed public schools and park gatherings and suspended all entry permits for those travelling through Samoa and Tonga to American Samoa.

Americans in China (Chinese: 在華美國人; Pinyin: zài huá měiguó rén) are expatriates and immigrants from the United States as well as their locally born descendants. Estimates range from 72,000 (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) to
Estimated number in China
In 2005, the number of Americans living in China reached a historic high of Most expatriates living in China come from neighboring Asian nations. An estimate published in 2018 counted 600,000 people of other nations living in China, with 12% of those from the US; that means approximately 72,000 Americans living in China.
Based on data collected in 1999, when 64,602 Americans lived in China, most lived in Hong Kong (48,220 in 1999), with smaller numbers in Beijing (10,000), Guangzhou (3,200), Shanghai (2,382), Shenyang (555) and Chengdu (800).
Hong Kong
Since the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, There are more Americans than Britons living in the territory, and 1,100 American companies employ 10% of the Hong Kong workforce.
Mainland China
According to the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China conducted in 2010, there are 71,493 Americans residing in Mainland China, the second largest single group of foreign nationals behind Koreans. Americans have been coming to China for job opportunities since 1994. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, a growing number of Americans in their 20s and 30s headed to China for employment, lured by its faster-growing economy and good pay in the financial sector. Many of them teach English, a service in demand from Chinese businesspeople and students and a growing number are arriving with skills and experience in computers, finance and other fields.

Stephen Johnson Turre (born 12 September 1948 Omaha, Nebraska) is an American jazz trombonist and a pioneer of using seashells as instruments, a composer, arranger, and educator at the collegiate-conservatory level. For years, Turre has been active in jazz, rock, and Latin jazz – in live venues, recording studios, television, and cinema production.
He has recorded over 20 albums as a bandleader, and appeared on many more as a contributor or sideman. As a studio musician, Turre is among the most prolific living jazz trombonists in the world. He has been a member of the Saturday Night Live Band since 1985.
Family and early life
Turre is one of five children born to James Boles Turre (1921–1997) and Carmen Marie (née Johnson). His father was of Northern Italian ancestry and his mother was of Mexican ancestry. His grandfather Ernest Turre was a founder of the San Francisco 49ers with Tony Morabito. His four siblings are Michael James Turre (b. 1946), Suzanne Turre (born 1952), Michele Anita Turre (born 1953), and Peter Joseph Turre (born 1957). Michael and Peter are musicians – saxophone-woodwinds and drums, respectively.
Turre was raised in Lafayette, California (San Francisco Bay area). He began playing trombone at age ten, during his fourth grade in school. In his early teens, he played in a band with his elder brother, Michael. Although he entered California State University, Sacramento, on a football scholarship, he studied music theory there for two years before transferring to the University of North Texas College of Music, where he studied from 1968 to 1969 and played in a band led by trumpeter Hannibal Peterson.
Turre has been a resident of Montclair, New Jersey.
Turre has been married twice. His first wife was Susan J. Beard, whom he married in 1970 in Dallas, Texas, and divorced in 1972 in San Francisco. His second wife was cellist Akua Dixon (born 1948) from 1978 to 2012, with whom he had two children, Andromeda Turre, a Jazz vocalist and composer and Orion Turre a Jazz drummer.
Career highlights
In 1968, Turre played with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. In 1970 he recorded with Carlos Santana, and in 1972 he toured with Ray Charles. He has been trombonist for the Saturday Night Live band since 1985 and has taught jazz trombone at the Manhattan School of Music since 1988.
For years (since 1970), Turre has been an exponent of seashells – conch in particular – as serious musical instruments. According to Turre, encouragement came from Kirk who was known for using a vast array of saxophones, flutes and other instruments. Turre has a collection of shells of various sizes, most of them picked up during his travels in the Caribbean and elsewhere. The shells have their mouthpieces carefully cut and are tuned to specific pitches. When playing them as a soloist, he frequently switches between shells, as each is limited in its register (the smallest shells, for example, have a practical register of only a fifth). His largest shell, from the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, has a range between the D and E below middle C, and was painted by a Cuban artist. He also leads "Sanctified Shells," which is a "shell choir" made up of brass players who double on seashell (using shells from Turre's collection, which he loans out for rehearsals and performances). The group released its first, eponymous album in 1993. Turre has had a long experience with Latin jazz and is a skilled player of the cowbell and Venezuelan maracas.
Turre has been a member of the Juilliard School faculty for years – since 2008, and previously from 2001 to 2003.
Education
Turre earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst through the University Without Walls in 1980 with a focus in Afro-American Music and Jazz.

The Chinese trumpetfish, Aulostomus chinensis, is a demersal marine fish belonging to the family Aulostomidae.
Description
Aulostomus chinensis is a medium-sized fish which grows up to 80 cm in length. Its body is elongated and compressed laterally, with a long, tubular snout which has a small barbel at its inferior extremity. The protusible mouth can be extended forward to catch prey. On the top posterior part of the body, the dorsal fin is composed of two parts, the first anterior is a set of isolated spines and the second is a small ray fin. This latter fin is similar in shape to the anal fin which is just under. The pelvic fins are located in the middle of the body and are small, with one basal black spot.
The body coloration can be uniform or mottled in a range of grey, brown, or dark green. Some fish are uniformly bright yellow. The rear part of the body is normally black with white dots. Two black spots are present on the tail. The compound set of the long caudal peduncle and the caudal fin is yellowish, whatever the fish coloration. Caudal fin usually has two round black spots, at least one black spot occurs on the top and sometimes a second spot on the low part.
Distribution and habitat
This species is found in tropical and subtropical waters from the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, but not in the Red Sea.
It lives in clear and calm waters in rocky and coral reefs from the surface to 120 m deep.
Behaviour
The Chinese trumpetfish is diurnal and solitary. It is a clever stealth hunter with two techniques to catch its prey. The first is the ambush, consisting of lying in wait for a potential prey close to hard coral, black coral bush, or gorgonian. The second is the discrete tracking, where the trumpetfish stays close to some big fishes (groupers, carangids) or even hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) until it has the opportunity to approach unsuspecting prey. The Chinese trumpetfish feeds on small fishes and crustaceans.

U. Gary Charlwood (born 1941) is a German-born Canadian businessman, Executive Chairman and CEO of Charlwood Pacific Group, Founder & Executive Chairman of CENTURY 21 Canada, and Chairman CEO & Founder of Uniglobe Travel International. In 2017, Charlwood was ranked as the 92nd richest person in Canada. In 2015, Charlwood was named The Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate by the Swanepoel Power 200.
Early life and education
Born in Germany, he moved to London in 1948 to join his mother, who had remarried after his father's death. Later he attended University of Southampton.
Career
Charlwood serves as the executive chairman of Charlwood Pacific Group, which owns Century 21 Canada, Century 21 Asia-Pacific, Uniglobe Travel International, Centum Financial Group and Real Property Management Canada. These companies have more than 1,700 franchise locations with more than 26,000 support staff in 561 cities in 67 countries, making it one of the largest international franchise systems in Canada, reportedly by REM (magazine).
He established UNIGLOBE Travel International in 1979, which is one of the largest travel agencies in number of outlets in the world.
In 1975 U. Gary along with Peter H. Thomas bought the franchise rights for Century 21 Real Estate Canada. But unfortunately, the Century 21 concept was shut down by the Real Estate Council of BC, as it was claimed that franchising was illegal in the real estate brokerage business. Charlwood challenged the ruling in court and won, following which he successfully opened the door to a wide array of American brokerages now commonplace in Canada, including RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker and, more recently, Royal LePage. CENTURY 21 Canada was the first real estate brokerage company with offices coast to coast in Canada. Currently, Century 21 remains one of the largest companies in Canada with more than 400 locations and 10,000 system members. The Charlwood Pacific Group also holds 50% ownership in Century 21 Asia Pacific. His Canadian and Asian Century 21 companies have a combined 939 franchisees, employing 19000 salespeople as of June 2016.
In 2002, he founded Centum, a mortgage brokerage franchise brand. His Canadian and Asian Century 21 companies have a combined 939 franchisees, employing 19,000 salespeople, as of June 2016.,
In 2010, he acquired the Real Property Management (RPM) rights for Canada, a Utah based company which manages properties for real estate investors.
Before starting his own company, Charlwood also worked for Western Airlines (now Delta Air Lines) and CP Air (now Air Canada).
He was elected as Chairman of the International Franchise Association of Washington, DC, the only non-American to ever hold the position.
Awards and recognition
Charlwood Pacific Group received the Canadian Franchise Association Hall of Fame Award in 2016.
He was included in the Swanepoel Power 200 list for 2014-15 as #80th Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate.
He was inducted to the Hall of Fame by the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) in 2009.

John Vallely (born October 3, 1948) is an American former professional basketball player from Balboa Island, Newport Beach, California who played for UCLA and in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
High school career
Vallely attended Corona del Mar High School, where he was a guard turned forward. He was selected to the all California Interscholastic Federation team and twice captured All Irvine League honors.
College career
As a 6'2" forward for Orange Coast College, Vallely averaged 26 points per game and broke 18 scoring records. He was selected a junior college All-American. He dribbled with his left hand and shot with his right hand. He was especially good at shooting an outside jump shot.
After transferring to UCLA in 1968, he became an integral member of the Bruins' backcourt in 1968. Vallely was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at UCLA. In his first season, he was the Bruins' third leading scorer (12.9 ppg) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden's "attack and gamble offense". He was a member of the UCLA teams that won national titles in the 1969 NCAA tournament and the 1970 NCAA tournament. Vallely majored in economics at UCLA and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior.
He was selected to the twelve man 1968 Olympic trials team coached by Jerry Tarkanian which competed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Professional career
Vallely was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA Draft. He sat on the bench much of the time, playing behind Pete Maravich, Lou Hudson, Walt Hazzard, and Herm Gilliam. Vallely was acquired by the Houston Rockets in November 1971 along with 6'7" forward Jim Davis.
He served as player-coach for the Belgium Lions of the European Professional Basketball League in 1975.
Personal
Vallely married Karen, a woman he met at Orange Coast College, where he studied prior to attending UCLA. They wed around the time he was selected in the NBA. The couple had two children, Eric and Erin. Erin died of a rare form of cancer of the soft muscle tissue in September 1991. Eric starred as a volleyball player while he was a student at UCLA.
Illness
Vallely was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. He had a single stem cell treatment which was unsuccessful. He received a second offer from a stem cell donor bank, which received a nearly exact match from a winemaker who lived near Frankfurt, Germany. This time the treatment was a success. Vallely was able to meet his donor following a two-year waiting period.

Reigomys primigenus is an extinct oryzomyine rodent known from Pleistocene deposits in Tarija Department, southeastern Bolivia. It is known from a number of isolated jaws and molars which show that its molars were almost identical to those of the living Lundomys. On the other hand, the animal possesses a number of derived traits of the palate which document a closer relationship to living Holochilus, the genus of South American marsh rats, and for this reason it was placed in the genus Holochilus when it was first described in 1996. The subsequent discoveries of Noronhomys and Carletonomys, which may be more closely related to extant Holochilus than H. primigenus is, have cast its placement in Holochilus into doubt, and it was ultimately made the type species of a separate genus, Reigomys.
Taxonomy
Material of Reigomys primigenus was collected in 1924 and 1927 by Elmer Riggs of the Field Museum of Natural History, but the animal was not described until 1996, when Scott Steppan formally named it as a new species of the genus Holochilus and diagnosed it, contrasting it to related species. The material Riggs collected includes nine mandibles, three maxillae, and five isolated molars. The specific name Steppan gave to the animal, primigenus, means "primitive" in Latin and refers to the primitive features of the animal when compared to its relatives Holochilus and Lundomys. In order to determine the relationships of his new species, Steppan carried out a cladistic analysis, in which he also included the oryzomyines Holochilus, Lundomys, Pseudoryzomys, and Cerradomys, as well as the non-oryzomyine Sigmodon. His results supported a close relation between R. primigenus and extant Holochilus, with Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys more distantly related.
In 1999, another rodent from the same group was described: Noronhomys, a recently extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H. primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.
The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Machado et al. (2014) confirmed that living members of the genus Holochilus are more closely related to Noronhomys and Carletonomys than to H. primigenus. The authors moved H. primigenus to its own genus, which they named Reigomys.
Description
Reigomys primigenus was a large rat, though smaller than both Lundomys and living Holochilus, characterized by an S-shaped ("sigmodont") crown on the third lower molar. Features of the molars are nearly indistinguishable from those of Lundomys and include cusps located opposite each other, enamel valleys that barely reach the midline of the molars, and short mesolophs and mesolophids (accessory crests). Other notable features include a robust mandible (lower jaw) with a steeply rising coronoid process, short incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) that barely extend between the first molars, and a short bony palate that hardly extends beyonds the third molars, all of which are shared with extant species of Holochilus to the exclusion of Lundomys. Also unlike in Lundomys, there is an additional small root present at the labial (outer) side of the first upper molar. In eight specimens that could be measured, the length of the lower toothrow is 6.79 to 7.58 mm, averaging 7.28 mm; the first lower molar is 2.62 to 3.08 mm long, averaging 2.89 mm, and 1.75 to 1.93 mm broad, averaging 1.85 mm in seven measured teeth; the only preserved complete upper toothrow is 6.64 mm long; and the first upper molar is 2.63 to 2.70 mm long and 2.03 mm broad in two specimens.
Distribution and ecology
Remains of Reigomys primigenus come from several localities in river sediments of the Tarija Formation in Tarija Department, which have been paleomagnetically dated to about 0.7 to 1.0 million years ago (chrons Clr.ln to early Cln, Ensenadan South American land mammal age). Other sigmodontine rodents found there include Andinomys, Calomys, Kunsia, Nectomys, Oxymycterus, Phyllotis, and another akodontine, probably Akodon, Necromys, or a related genus. The deposits were deposited by a river and the paleoenvironment was probably a floodplain or channel. Reigomys primigenus is not known from any other localities and is considered to be extinct.

Armijo High School is a public secondary school located in Fairfield, California, United States. It is the oldest of the three high schools in the Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District, the other two being Fairfield High School and Angelo Rodriguez High School. It is named after the Armijo family, who purchased one of the original six land grants in Solano County awarded to General Mariano Vallejo. The school serves about 2600 students in grades 9 to 12 from the central part of Fairfield and Suisun City.
The school started in 1891 with 30 students in a single classroom located in the Crystal Elementary School building. In 1893, a separate wooden building was built for use as the high school. In 1915, the school moved to a large stone building on Union Avenue in downtown Fairfield that is now used as the Solano County courthouse. It stayed there for nearly 50 years until construction was completed in 1964 on a newer facility located on Washington Street, roughly two blocks from the Union Avenue location. In 2019, the Fairfield-Suisun School District board voted unanimously to replace the "Armijo Indian" mascot. As of 2020, the school's mascot is "The Royals".

The Chariot (VII) is the seventh trump or Major Arcana card in most traditional tarot decks. It is used in game playing as well as in divination.
Description
A figure sits in a chariot, although he holds no rope, he is pulled by two sphinxes or horses. There is often a black and white motif, for example one of the steeds may be black and the other white. The figure may be crowned or helmeted, and is winged in some representations. The figure may hold a sword or wand. The Thoth Tarot deck has the figure controlling four animals.
The mallet, or gavel, on the chariot's coat of arms is a masonic symbol representing self control.
A canopy of stars above the charioteer's head is intended to show "celestial influences".
Interpretation
According to A.E. Waite's 1910 book Pictorial Key to the Tarot, the Chariot card carries several divinatory associations:
7. THE CHARIOT.—Succour, providence; also war, triumph, presumption, vengeance, trouble. Reversed: Riot, quarrel, dispute, litigation, defeat.
Alternative decks
Other names for the card are The Centurion or Victory.

Two human polls comprised the 1968 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.
Legend
AP Poll
For the 1968 season, the AP Poll returned to ranking 20 teams per week, after ranking only 10 per week from 1961 to 1967. This was also the second time (first since 1965) that the final AP Poll was conducted in January after the completion of bowl season, rather than at the end of the regular season. The final poll would continue to be conducted after bowl season from this season forward.
Final Coaches' poll
The final UPI Coaches Poll was released prior to the bowl games, in early December.Ohio State received 28 of the 34 first-place votes; USC received four and Penn State two.
Notre Dame did not participate in bowl games from 1925 through 1968.
Prior to the 1975 season, the Big Ten and Pac-8 conferences allowed only one postseason participant each, for the Rose Bowl.
The Ivy League has prohibited its members from participating in postseason football since the league was officially formed in 1954.

Momal Rano or Mumal Rano () is a romantic tale of Momal and Rano from the Sindhi folklore and Rajasthani folklore. It is a multifaceted story that entails adventure, magic, schemes, beauty, love, ordeals of separation and above all romantic tragedy.
The fame of the story is ascribed to Ganj or Shah Jo Risalo; the poetry book Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai wrote, which also included other stories like Umar Marui, Sohni Mehar, Sassui Punhun, Noori Jam Tamachi, Sorath Rai Diyach and Lilan Chanesar. The protagonists of these seven tales are women; hence, including Momal, all have remained cultural icons in Sindhi Literature and known as the Seven Heroines () of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Earlier, apart from Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, several other poets, like Shah Inat Rizvi, for instance, wrote verses on this tale and many others after Latif's demise, like Tajal Bewas and Shaikh Ayaz (to quote a few) tried upon the same tale; hence all broadened the perspective of the tale from different angles. Nonetheless, Momal-Rano is considered to be one of the most popular folktales in Sindhi and Rajasthani literature.
The story also appears in Shah Jo Risalo and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from Sindh, Pakistan. The other six tales are Umar Marvi, Sassui Punnhun, Sohni Mehar, Lilan Chanesar, Noori Jam Tamachi and Sorath Rai Diyach commonly known as the Seven Queens of Sindh, or the Seven heroines of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai.
Historical context
The story is considered to have occurred in the geographical belts of Rajasthan, India as well as Sindh, Pakistan. The belt that covers the geography of Rajasthan in relation to the story is Lodrawa or Lodhruva in Jaisalmer district; while the area in Sindh is Momal Ji Maari (Momal's Mansion) and her father's house in Ghotki district of the province. The story occurred in the times of Hameer Soomro, the King of Umerkot or Amarkot (now a district in the south-east of Sindh province in Pakistan), possibly in the mid-14th century.
Story
The king of Amarkot, Hameer Soomoro, along with his ministers, Rano Mahendhra, Seenharro Dhamachanni and Daunro Bhatyanni, used to go for hunting in the far flung areas of Amarkot and sometimes could even cross the boundaries of their little country for the adventure. Once during a hunting spree, these four men were encountered by a person who came across them accidentally.
They did not disclose to the fellow who they were and what they did. But the fellow engaged them in the story of what happened to him in the preceding days. He was a prince from the area near Kashmir, who had heard the legend of Momal's beauty and charm and got so inspired that he pursued the adventure, but when he approached the area where Momal lived, he was not only overpowered by her enchanting beauty but also the tricks and schemes played by her female servants/sisters, who not only robbed that prince of his wealth and material but also so confused him in multiple puzzles that he could do nothing else but save his life and run.
The story told by this prince was sufficient to intrigue those four friends. They extracted information from the prince about Momal's whereabouts and decided to pursue the same adventure.
The place where Momal lived was near Lodhruva, in the north-east of Umerkot. She lived with her seven (some historians say nine) sisters, the most famous of which being Somal and Natir, (some consider her to be Momal's servant rather than sister) in a palace called Kak Mahal (The Palace of Kak). It was a magical palace with labyrinths, puzzles, fake ponds, illusions and much more. It was a legend that anyone who wanted to be a suitor for Momal would undergo several obstacles, and the one who succeeded in reaching the palace unharmed would possibly be accepted as her consort. As the history suggested, almost everyone who approached Momal and her sisters/servants was robbed of everything including their lives excluding a few like the prince from Kashmir who told the stories of his devastation.
Momal enjoyed legendary beauty. Somal was famous for intelligence; while Natir was known as a schemer. They worked collectively to enchant the suitors and overpower them. They could not let the suitors experience an easy task of puzzles they designed for them. As the luck would have it, Rano Mendhro, who was famously intelligent and brave, was the only person to successfully reach the palace, utterly unharmed. Momal was fairly impressed and that led him to be accepted as her consort. The King Hameer, along with other two ministers, left Rano Mendhro at Kak and left for Umerkot.
Rano and Momal kept meeting each other for long and their love story gained profundity of feelings from both sides. However, King Hameer felt jealous about Rano to have succeeded in overpowering the most beautiful woman in the world he personally knew. So he kept a check on Rano and asked him not to meet Momal. Rano being his minister had to abide by the orders of his King friend. But his passion about Momal did not let him stay peacefully away from her. So usually he left for Ludhruva on his camel in the evening after work and returned to Umerkot by the next morning. Whenever he did that, which he did pretty often, he tried to stealthily go and meet Momal, it was pretty long distance though. Somehow he was caught one day and the king imprisoned him. But for the old friendship sake the king released him with conditions not to meet Momal again. But this had not to happen. He continued the same pursuit.
Once Rano was unable to reach Kak, so Momal, out of passion and extreme wait for her beloved, asked her sister Somal to wear clothes like the ones Rano used to wear and slept by her side. The moment Rano arrived, he mistook Somal as Momal's lover and, in utter disgust, left the palace for Umerkot leaving behind his cane. As Momal woke up, she saw his cane and realized Rano had been to her room and seen her with Somal, rather mistaken Somal to be some man, and perhaps gone for good. This was too much for her. Momal waited for his return but to no avail. At last, when the push comes to shove, she resorted to go out for Rano in Umerkot. Disguised as a man, she finally searched him and stayed in Umerkot for some time. In a short span of time, Rano came to learn it was Momal, who had disguised herself. So he tried to go away from her. Then she pleaded him to forgive her for her mistake, which was basically not an intentional trick but an outburst of passionate feelings about Rano, and nothing else. Rano was too obstinate to forgive her. Out of desperation, she jumped in raging fire. When Rano came to learn this, he followed her in the same flames and got consumed by the same.
Historicity
The story of Momal-Rano is a combination of both fact and fiction. The names of places related to the tale are real, both within the boundaries of the province of Sindh and Rajasthan. However, the ideas of magic, Kak, concerns as to how Rano was able to travel so fast from Umerkot to Lodhruva almost every day etc. make it a legend. The story of Momal Rano has also been compared with the legend of Orpheus. In the Greek myth, Sirens, beautiful yet dangerous creatures, lured nearby sailors with their enchanting voices/music and led their ships to wreck on the rocky coast of their island, Anthemoessa, looted and destroyed the seafarers. Identically Momal and her servants/sister did the same at Kak Mahal. Orpheus was the one to overpower their music with his lyre and saved his ship. Rano overpowered the magical world of Momal and her company.
Metaphorical significance
The love of Momal and Rano is an allegorical metaphor for the love of the soul and divine. The separation and longing between two lovers parallels the separation of the Divine and the human soul and longing of both the divine and the human soul to merge and dissolve into each other much like Momal and Rano were unified in the burning fire. The human soul, ruh, longs for Allah and in absolute overpowering self abnegating devotion cares nothing for the world or society and seeks union with divinity in the crazed love experienced by Sufis.
Popular culture
The Momal Rano love story continues to inspire numerous modern songs, including Dastaan-e-Moomal by The Sketches from Coke Studio Pakistan (season 11) Episode 5.

The Battle of Go Cong was a small battle during the Vietnam War. It took place on September 3, 1963 near Gò Công, Tiền Giang Province, after the General Staff of the Viet Cong (VC) called for "another Ap Bac" on South Vietnamese forces. The intent of the operation was to drive out the VC who had survived the earlier Ap Bac engagement. The battle was won by American and South Vietnamese forces, after inflicting heavy casualties on the VC, using artillery to slaughter VC fighters fleeing American special operation troops who ambushed them with intense sniper fire. It was later discovered that the 91 of the captured VC troops were new recruits, and did not have weapons.

South Carolina Highway 292 (SC 292) is a state highway in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The highway connects Duncan and the Inman area, via Lyman.
Route description
SC 292 begins at an intersection with SC 290 (West Main Street) in Duncan, within Spartanburg County. It travels to the east-northeast, crosses railroad tracks, and curves to the northeast. It crosses over the Middle Tyger River and enters Lyman. The highway crosses railroad tracks before passing Lyman Park. At Groce Road, SC 292 turns left and travels to the north-northwest. Three blocks later, it intersects U.S. Route 29 (US 29). The two highways travel concurrently to the west for one block, crossing railroad tracks along the way. The two highways intersect the western terminus of SC 129. SC 129/SC 292 travels to the north-northeast and immediately begin curving to the northeast. The only intersection along their short concurrency is with the southern terminus of SC 358 (Holly Springs Road). SC 292 travels to the north-northeast and crosses the North Tyger River before leaving the city limits. It curves back to the north-northeast and crosses Lake Cooley. It crosses Lawsons Fork Creek and enters Inman Mills. The highway travels southeast of Inman Mills Park. At the intersection with US 176 (Asheville Highway), the highway leaves Inman Mills and enters Inman. It curves to the northwest and turns right onto Prospect Street. Just after leaving town, it crosses Greene Creek. It crosses over Meadow Creek just before an interchange with Interstate 26 (I-26). A short distance later, it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SC 9 (Boiling Springs Road).
Major intersections
Lyman connector route
South Carolina Highway 292 Connector (SC 292 Conn.) is a connector route that mostly exists within the east-central part of Lyman. There is a relatively short portion in nearby Wellford. It is an unsigned highway.
It begins at an intersection with the SC 292 mainline, where that highway turns left off of Spartanburg Road and onto Groce Road. The connector route takes Spartanburg Road to the northeast. Just after an intersection with the northern terminus of Ridge Road and the southern terminus of Elliott Road, it begins a curve to the southeast. During that curve it leaves Lyman and enters Wellford. At Astor Street, it turns left and takes that street to the northeast for one block, to its eastern terminus, an intersection with U.S. Route 29 (US 29).

Background
Born in Taihape, Chase came from a very large family of at least 18. His brothers, Frank, Richard and Colin have been involved in music.
His brother Frank had a record released on the PYE label in 1969, "The Frog"/"Popeye Dance".
His youngest brother Colin Rex Chase was a Jazz drummer. Colin who also played in the A to Zeev Big Band, and funk band Jones Cartel, died of cancer on 10 March 2015.
Career
1970
In May 1970, along with Lyn Calman, and Tui Fox, Chase was one 15 entertainers selected from over 1000 entries for Studio One's New Faces. In July of that year he won the Wanganui Talent Quest. In August, he won the 1970 New Faces competition. On the week ending with 5 September 1970, Billboard reported his single "What Greater Love" entering the New Zealand charts at position 10. The single backed with "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" was released on the Ode label. His previous single "Sound Of Love" backed with "My Special Prayer" was also released on Ode. In October 1970, Chase was photographed with competition winner Pam who had entered a promotional competition for the film Woodstock, which was organised by Kings Theatre in Wellington. The prize was tickets to the film's premiere, the 3 record LP soundtrack, and dinner with Chase.
1971
In April 1971, Chase and Lew Pryme appeared at Mt. Crawford Prison, and it was reported by Billboard that they were the first pop singers to so. In June 1971, his pressing "Today I Killed A Man I Didn't Know" was released on HMV. This was his first release for the label. The single was backed with "World Of Lavender Lace". Almost straight away, the single became a hit on the Top 20 chart. It also became a finalist in the 1971 Loxene Gold Disc awards. He released another single that year on HMV. It was "If You'd Like To Be A Lady" backed with "Teresa".
1972 to 1974
In 1972, he had four singles released on HMV. They were "Eye For The Main Chance" bw "Bless Your Sweet Little Soul", "Anderson and Wise" bw "Fantasy", "Angel She Was Love" bw "To Hurt A Friend", and "Midnight Magic Man" bw " Fantasy". "Eye For The Main Chance", and "Anderson And Wise" did well, with the latter reaching the finals of the 1972 Studio One Contest.
His final single in the seventies was "Maria Isabella" bw "Spanish Eyes" in 1973. It was released on the EMI label. It became a finalist in the 1973 RATA Awards. In February of that year, Chase and his wife relocated to Sydney, Australia. In June 1973, he appeared on part 4 of a Studio One series in a competition for the 1974 Commonwealth Games pop tune.

One of the singers he was competing against, Kamahl, was singing an Anderson and Wise composition. This was the same song-writing team (Ted Kaptiklis aka Ted Taptiklis and Tony Kaye) that wrote his hit "Anderson And Wise".
Chase made two appearances on The Ernie Sigley Show in 1974. The first was on 20 June. Bill and Boyd, Allison Durbin, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Bronwyn Gordon appeared as well. Chase performed the "Rockin' Robin medley". The next time was on 22 August. Other guests included Yvonne Barrett, David Belcher, and Mary Ann Leyden.

Collaboration with the Islamic State refers to the cooperation and assistance given by governments, non-state actors, and private individuals to the Islamic State (IS) during the Syrian Civil War, Iraqi Civil War, and Libyan Civil War.
Allegations of state support
Israel
The Syrian government and Iranian officials have accused Israel and the United States government of supporting ISIS. Israel has strongly denied the accusations.
Syria
During the ongoing Syrian Civil War, President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian government have been accused by activists of collusion with ISIL.
Many Islamist prisoners were released from Syrian prisons during the Arab Spring protests in 2011, which many authors have suggested a indicated strategic attempt to strengthen jihadist factions over other rebels, and eventually contributed to forging ISIL.
The Syrian government has reportedly paid for the protection of oil pipelines and importation of oil from Al-Nusra after Al-Nusra's capture of two major oil pipelines in Banias and Latakia. and jointly ran a gas plant in Tabqah using intermediates. The facility supplied electricity to government-held areas, while sources claim government-run power plants supplied Al-Nusra held areas. A report in 2015 suggested that ISIL kept gas flowing to Assad regime-controlled power stations. Furthermore, ISIL allowed grain to pass from Rojava to government-controlled areas at the cost of a 25% levy. In 2017, US and European officials said that oil sales to the Syrian government were ISIL's largest source of revenue.
An unpublished IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center database analysis showed that only 6% of Syrian government forces attacks were targeted at ISIL from January to November 2014, while in the same period only 13% of all ISIL attacks targeted government forces.
The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has stated that the Syrian government has operatives inside ISIL, as has the leadership of Ahrar ash-Sham.
In 2015, the United States embassy in Syria stated that the Syrian government was "making air-strikes in support" of an ISIL advance on Syrian opposition positions north of Aleppo. The president of the Syrian National Coalition, Khaled Koja, accused Assad of acting "as an air force for [ISIL]", with the Defence Minister of the SNC Salim Idris stating that approximately 180 Syrian government officers were serving in ISIL and coordinating the group's attacks with the Syrian Army.
In April 2017 report by UK information provider IHS Markit stated that the Islamic State fought Syrian government forces more than any other opponent between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017. According to the report, "43 percent of all Islamic State fighting in Syria was directed against President Assad's forces, 17 against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the remaining 40 percent involved fighting rival Sunni opposition groups".
Turkey
The Turkish government has been criticised for allowing ISIL to use Turkish territory for logistics and channelling recruits. It has also been accused of selling arms and intelligence to ISIL, as part of its campaign against the People's Protection Units (YPG). That ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's Syrian hideout was found just a few kilometers away from Turkey also raised suspicions whether Turkey was doing enough against ISIL. Iraqi intelligence officers also claimed that they have observed several journeys by relatives of Al Baghdadi between Syria and Turkey. Turkey denies the allegations of assisting ISIL, pointing to multiple terrorist attacks ISIL has committed against civilians in Turkey, as well as multiple military confrontations between ISIL and the Turkish government. The Kurdistan Democratic Party in Iraq similarly deny the claim that Turkey is providing aid to ISIL. According to an intelligence adviser quoted by Seymour Hersh, a "highly classified assessment" carried out by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2013 concluded that Turkey had effectively transformed the secret U.S. arms program in support of moderate rebels, who no longer existed, into an indiscriminate program to provide technical and logistical support for al-Nusra Front and ISIL.
Saudi Arabia
In June 2014, former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki accused the government of Saudi Arabia of funding ISIL. The Saudi Arabian government rejected the claims.
Some media outlets, such as NBC, the BBC, The New York Times, and the US-based think tank Washington Institute for Near East Policy have written about individual Saudi donations to the group and the Saudi state's decade-long sponsorship of Salafism and Wahhabism around the world, but concluded in 2014 that there was no evidence of direct Saudi state support for ISIL.
In an August 2014 email leaked by WikiLeaks, apparently from former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to then counselor John Podesta, a memo states that the governments of both Saudi Arabia and Qatar "are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region."
Lebanese former minister Charbel Wehbe also accused Saudi Arabia of supporting ISIL.
Qatar
Qatar has long been accused of acting as a conduit for the flow of funds to ISIL. While there is no proof that the Qatari government is involved in this movement of funds, it has been criticised for not doing enough to stem money sent by private donors in the country. According to some reports, US officials believe that the largest portion of private donations supporting ISIS and al Qaeda-linked groups now comes from Qatar rather than Saudi Arabia.
In August 2014, German minister Gerd Müller accused Qatar of having links to ISIL, stating: "You have to ask who is arming, who is financing ISIS troops. The keyword there is Qatar." Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah rejected this statement, saying: "Qatar does not support extremist groups, including [ISIL], in any way. We are repelled by their views, their violent methods and their ambitions."
United States
Rand Paul, junior U.S. Senator from Kentucky, has accused the U.S. government of indirectly supporting ISIL in the Syrian Civil War, by arming their allies and fighting their enemies in that country. The US assisted the Syrian opposition from 2013 to 2017 (see CIA-led Timber Sycamore program) and according to some authors some of the US proxies worked with ISIL. Donald Trump has claimed that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton "[were] the founder[s] of ISIS".
Foreign nationals
A United Nations report showed that 25,000 "foreign terrorist fighters" from 100 countries had joined "Islamist" groups, many of them working for ISIL or al-Qaeda. The US-trained commander of Tajikistan's Interior Ministry OMON police special forces, Gulmurod Khalimov, has been raised to the rank of "Minister of War" within the Islamic State.
One of the most prominent commanders of ISIL in Syria, Abu Omar al-Shishani, served previously as a sergeant in the Georgian Army before being medically discharged, later imprisoned, becoming radicalized, then fleeing the country.
A 2015 report by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University found 71 individuals charged in the United States with supporting ISIL, 250 travelling or attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq from the United States to join ISIL, and about 900 active domestic ISIL-related investigations.
An October 2016 World Bank study found that "ISIL's foreign fighters are surprisingly well-educated." Using the fighters' self-reported educational levels, the study concluded that "69% of recruits reported at least a secondary-level education" of which "a large fraction have gone on to study at university" and also that "only 15% of recruits left school before high school; less than 2% are illiterate." The study also found that foreign fighters are often more educated than their countrymen where those "from Europe and in Central Asia have similar levels of education to their countrymen" while those "from the Middle East, North Africa, and South and East Asia are significantly more educated than what is typical in their home nations." The report notes that its conclusions that terrorism is not driven by poverty and low levels of education which conforms with previous research. However, the report did find a strong correlation "between a country's male unemployment rate and the propensity of the country to supply foreign fighters". Many European countries have allowed their citizens that joined ISIL to be prosecuted by Iraq.
Pakistan
Former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai accused Pakistan for supporting ISIS during interview with ANI that Afghanistan has evidence of Pakistan's support to ISIS.He added that there is no doubt to the above statement.
Foreign nationals by country
Australia
In August 2018, Australia stripped the Australian citizenship from five terrorists who had travelled to fight with the Islamic State and barred them from entering Australia again. This was only possible because they had double citizenships because international law stops the measure from being used on individuals with only one citizenship. The five brought the total to six.
Belgium
Up to 2018, an estimated 450 individuals had travelled from Belgium to join the civil war in Syria and Iraq. Of those, 75 were linked to the Sharia4Belgium network. In July 2018, courts announced that Belgium had no obligation to bring children of Islamic State members to Belgium.
Denmark
In November 2017, Denmark stripped a Turkish man of his Danish citizenship after having been sentenced for terror offenses related to the Islamic State, which left him with a citizenship of Turkey.
France
Up to 2018, an estimated 1700 individuals had travelled from France to join the civil war in Syria and Iraq.
Germany
Up to 2018, an estimated 940 individuals had travelled from Germany to join the civil war in Syria and Iraq.
India
Up to 2019, about 100 Indian nationals had joined the IS in Syria and Afghanistan while 155 individuals had been arrested for IS-related connections. Many of these came from the southern Indian state of Kerala and also from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. These numbers are considered relatively low despite India having the third-largest population of Muslims [as of 2020]. The limited involvement of Indian Muslim fighters in calls for global jihad was also observed during the Soviet–Afghan War, and various reasons have been given for this. These include the limited influence of Salafi-Wahabbism in India, inability of IS sympathizers in India to travel to IS controlled territories due to logistical factors and poverty among Indian Muslims, the existing presence of Pakistani militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad with which the IS is in open strife, and the opposition of Indian Islamic leadership to such groups (with 70,000 Barelvi clerics issuing a fatwa condemning IS and similar organisations in 2015).
Netherlands
The Parliament of the Netherlands voted in 2016 for legislation to strip Dutch citizens who join ISIL or al Qaeda abroad of their citizenship, also if they have not been convicted of any crime. The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister Ard Van der Steur stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands. In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship.
In the 2012 to November 2018 period, more than 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighters in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIL. The remaining quarter have joined Al-Qaeda affiliated groups such as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham or Tanzim Hurras al-Deen.
Sweden
Up to 2018, an estimated 300 individuals had travelled from Sweden to join the civil war in Syria. In March 2018 Kurdish authorities reported they had captured 41 IS supporters with either Swedish citizenship or residence permit in Sweden, of which 5 had key positions in the organisation and one was the head of the ISIL propaganda efforts.
United Kingdom
Cabinet minister William Hague stated in 2014 that up to 400 British citizens had joined ISIL. The government instituted a practice where if those who had joined had double citizenships were stripped of their British citizenship to prevent them from arriving back in the UK. By 2017, 150 individuals had been stripped of citizenship and were thus unable to enter the United Kingdom again.
Groups expressing support for ISIL
The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) has identified 60 jihadist groups in 30 countries that have pledged allegiance to or support for ISIL as of mid-November 2014. That many of these groups were previously affiliated with al-Qaeda suggests a shift in global jihadist leadership towards ISIL.
Members of the following groups have declared support for ISIL, either fully or in part:
Boko Haram (until 2016)
Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia)
Jund al-Khilafah
Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem
Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid – (pledged support to ISIL; the majority of the group split off after its leader pledged allegiance to ISIL)
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan
Jundallah (Pakistan)
Caucasus Emirate (multiple Caucasus Emirate commanders switched allegiance to ISIL)
Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade
Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao
Jemaah Islamiyah
Abu Sayyaf
Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters
Ansar Khalifa Philippines
Islamic Defenders Front (FPI): Pledged allegiance and support to ISIL in 2014. Only revealed in 2020 by the government upon its ban.)
Lions of the Balkans
In Islamic State territory
Syria
In response to the effort to take Raqqa by the Syrian Democratic Forces, whose main component is the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), some Syrian Arabs in Raqqa sided with the Islamic State.
Iraq
Sunni Arabs in Iraq have been accused of collaborating with ISIL against Assyrians, and Yazidis, and Shias. ISIL marked Christian homes with the letter nūn for Naṣārā and Shia homes with the letter rāʾ for Rāfiḍa, derogatory terms used to describe Christians and Shias by some Sunni Muslims. Properties were confiscated and given to local ISIL supporters or foreign fighters. Local Sunnis were reported to have betrayed Yazidis once ISIL arrived, or colluded in advance to lure them into staying put until the ISIL invaded.
57 members of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region participated in the massacre of at least 1,566 Shia cadets from the Iraqi Air Force on 12 June 2014.

Municipio I is an administrative subdivision of the municipality of Rome, encompassing the centre of the city.
It was first created by Rome's city council on 19 January 2001 and has a president who is elected during the mayoral elections. On 11 March 2013 its borders were modified and it was expanded with the incorporation of part of the abolished Municipio XVII. Since then all the rioni of Rome, which are the city's historic districts, form part of Municipio I together with the localities Delle Vittorie and Eroi.
Subdivision
Municipio I is divided into 11 localities:
Rioni
Since 2013 the territory includes all 22 rioni:

Municipal Government
The president of the municipio is directly elected by citizens. The Council of the municipio is elected every five years, with a system under which voters express a direct choice for the President or an indirect choice voting for the party of the candidate's coalition. If no candidate receives at least 50% of votes, the top two candidates go to a second round after two weeks. This gives a result whereby the winning candidate may be able to claim majority support.
Last election occurred on 5 and 19 June 2016:

The Constitution of the State of New Mexico () is the document governing the political framework of the U.S. state of New Mexico. It was adopted by Constitutional Convention on November 21, 1910, ratified by vote of the people on November 5, 1911, and became effective upon admission to the union on January 6, 1912.
1910 Constitutional Convention
The constitution was drafted by 100 delegates elected by the people of New Mexico. Of the 100 delegates, there were 71 Republicans, 28 Democrats, and one socialist. Worried that the conservative federal government would refuse to extend statehood to New Mexico, the Republican-control convention framed the constitution to be conservative and non-controversial.
New Mexico Democrats did not agree with the contents of the constitution and fought the Republicans at each step. The Democrats organized a separate party convention on December 19, 1910, and drafted thirteen objections to the constitution draft. The Democrats were primarily concerned with the difficulty of the amendment process, the unequal distribution of the legislature, and the lack of provisions addressing recall votes. However, their objections did not change the final proposed constitution draft that the people voted on. On January 21, 1911, the constitution was approved by the people with a three-to-one majority. And on January 6, 1912, New Mexico was admitted to the Union.
Constitutional Amendments
Flood amendment
As originally drafted and sent to the United States Congress, the New Mexico Constitution contained a number of limitations on the process for making amendments. These included
a requirement of a two-thirds vote of the legislature in order to propose amendments,
that in addition to a bare majority, all amendments must be ratified by at least 40% of those voting in the election, with a 40%+ vote in at least half of the counties, and
a limitation on the total number of amendments that could be submitted to the people per election.
Congress was not sympathetic to these anti-populist provisions, and as a prerequisite to admission as a state required that the people ratify an amendment that would provide for a simple majority vote in the legislature, for ratification by simple majority vote of the people, and do away with the limitation on the total number of amendments. This prerequisite came to be known as the "Flood amendment" as it was proposed by Henry de la Warr Flood, a Democrat from Virginia, at the instigation of Summers Burkhart secretary of the New Mexico State Central Committee of the Democratic Party. The Flood amendment did permit two restrictions on the majority ratification, one for amendments to the elective franchise and the other for amendments to the protection of educational access of Spanish speakers or those of Spanish descent.
Between 1912 and 1969, the New Mexico constitution was amended 73 times.
1969 Constitutional Convention
In 1967, the legislature decided that a new convention should be called to rewrite the entire constitution. Voters approved of a constitutional convention on November 8, 1968.
The convention occurred in one 60-day session in 1969 and had 70 delegates, one from each of New Mexico's legislative districts. Of the 70 delegates, there were 48 Democrats, 21 Republicans, and one independent. The convention focused on condensing and streamlining the constitution. The final draft reduced the 1910 constitution from 24 articles and 24,000 words to 14 articles and 15,000 words.
However, the voters rejected the new constitution by the narrow margin of 63,387 to 59,685.
Current Constitution
The constitution current has twenty-four articles. The articles each deal with a separate area of governance.
Article I: Name and Boundaries
Article II: Bill of Rights
Article III: Distribution of Powers
Article IV: Legislative Department
Article V: Executive Department
Article VI: Judicial Department
Article VII: Elective Franchise
Article VIII: Taxation and Revenue

Article XVII: Mines and Mining
Article XVIII: Militia
Article XIX: Amendments
Article XX: Miscellaneous
Article XXI: Compact with the United States
Article XXII: Schedule
Article XXIII: Intoxicating Liquors
Article XXIV: Leases on State Land
Article II contains a bill of rights. Article IV sets up the legislature branch composed of no more than 42 members of the Senate and 70 members of the House of Representatives. Article V creates the executive branch headed by a governor. The branch consists of a governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, state treasurer, attorney general and commissioner of public lands. The judicial branch is created by Article VI and consists of the Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals, and District Courts. Other court may be established. The Supreme Court has five justices, who are elected for eight years.

The Ramna Kali Mandir () is a temple in Dhaka that was originally built in the time of the Mughal Empire. It was also known as the "Ramna Kalibari". The temple is dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Kali.
Location
It is beside the former Dhaka Racecourse, now Suhrawardy Udyan. The entire temple complex occupies almost and is on the south side of Ramna Park, opposite the Bangla Academy.
History
The original temple was destroyed on March 27, 1971 by the Pakistani Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War. It was the site of a massacre of mostly Hindu people.
In Nepalese folklore, the Ramna Kali Temple was founded by the devotees of the Goddess Kali. The devotees had come to Bengal from the Himalayas.
Although the temple had stood for centuries, it was largely developed in the early 20th century. The temple was developed under the patronage of Rani Bilashmoni Debi, wife of Rajendra Narayan (18821913). At this time, the temple was one of Dhaka's tallest landmarks.
Design
The architectural design of the temple changed over the centuries in which it stood. In front of the temple was a large dighi (pool) which was a popular place for worshipers and visitors to swim. The temple has a tall shikhara (tower). Next to the temple was the Ma Anandamoyee Ashram (), a place of worship with a residential complex and facilities for washing.
The design of the temple is documented in pictures taken at Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's address of 7 March 1971. This is likely the last time the temple was photographed by journalists or historians.
Demolition and genocide by the Pakistan Army
On March 25, 1971, in the night, the Pakistan Army launched "Operation Searchlight" in order to suppress a Bengali nationalist movement in what was then East Pakistan. The operation triggered a genocide and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Most of the targets of Operation Searchlight were young Hindu men, intellectuals, students and academics. Operation Searchlight focused on prominent Hindu sites including the Jagannath Hall (a hostel for Hindu students on the Dhaka University campus) and the Ramna Kali Mandir.
On March 27, 1971, the Pakistan Army entered the Ramna Kali Mandir complex and, within one hour, killed more than 1000 people. Several Muslims who had sought refuge in the temple complex were also killed.
Until 2000, accounts of the demolition of the temple relied largely on the oral testimony of survivors of and witnesses. In 2000, Awami League, the governing political party, opened a public enquiry. In September 2000, the chairman Justice KM Sobhan, presented a preliminary report.
Only around 50 victims of the massacre have been identified; relatives of the other victims are either deceased or have left Bangladesh. A worldwide appeal has been made for any surviving relatives of the Ramna Kali Mandir massacre victims to contribute names of their deceased family members to be listed on a future memorial.
Rebuilding
The Ma Durga Mandir and the Radha Krisna Mandir are present in the area of the Ramna Kali Mandir. Others are planned. The Government of India has pledged money for reconstruction efforts. Indian President, Ram Nath Kovind, visited the historic Ramna Kali temple in Dhaka during his visit to Bangladesh for the 50th Victory Day celebrations.
Completion and Inauguration
On December 17th 2021, Shri Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the reconstructed Ramna Kali temple in Ramna, a part of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka where the landmark Suhrawardy Udyan (the former Ramna Race Course) is located. The First Lady of India, Mrs. Kovind, and their daughter accompanied the President of India in the stated ceremony.
“The historic Ramna Kali temple is a symbol of the spiritual and cultural bonding among the people of India and Bangladesh.”, Mr. Kovind said at the ceremony.
After Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, a small temple was set up at the site for people to offer prayers. A reconstruction of the complex was announced in 2017, when then External Affairs Minister of India, the late Sushma Swaraj, inaugurated 15 development projects in Baridhara, Dhaka.

Jumbo shopping centre (), commonly referred to as simply Jumbo, is a shopping center in Vantaa, Finland. With its gross leasable area of , it is the largest shopping and entertainment center in the Nordics.
Jumbo was completed in October 1999. It currently employs approximately 1,500 people. It has two hypermarket chains: Prisma (owned by S Group) and K-Citymarket (owned by Kesko).
History
Jumbo's foundation was laid before the recession of the 1990s due to the great demand that arose in the area for a shopping center. The construction companies Haka and Polar purchased the area and its surroundings from the consumers' co-operative Elanto and named the newly established development company Vantaanportti Oy. The company also purchased the neighboring residential areas and business park land. In October 1999, Jumbo was completed. In its first year, the shopping center attracted 6 million customers, with the number of customers rising since. An expansion was completed in 2005.
In 2008, the Flamingo entertainment center was built next to Jumbo. Prior to completion, it was referred to as "Jumbo Park", as it is connected to the shopping center and the two centers act in co-operation rather than competition. Together, the two are referred to in Finnish as Viihdekauppakeskus (entertainment shopping centre).
In 2019, Jumbo merged with the Flamingo entertainment center, making it the largest shopping and entertainment center in the Nordics, with a leasable area of .

The 6th Airborne Brigade () is a brigade of the Polish Armed Forces, headquartered in Kraków. The formation specializes as airborne forces and air assault troops, being intended to conduct assault operations from either aircraft or helicopters at a high state of readiness.
History
The 6th Airborne Brigade derives its traditions from the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, whose commander was Brigadier General Stanisław Sosabowski, today the patron of the unit. The unit's direct lineage stems from the 6th Infantry Division (of the Polish People's Republic post Second World War) which was reformed in 1957 into the 6th Pomeranian Airborne Division, which in turn was reformed in 1986 into the 6th Pomeranian Airborne Brigade.
Role
The 6th Airborne Brigade serves as the Polish Army's air-mobile unit ready to conduct operations at a high state of readiness. The brigade is equipped and trained to carry out rapid landings either as paratroopers or through insertion by helicopters. In this role, the brigade can launch surprise raids to capture strategic targets such as bridges, airports and other positions deep behind enemy lines and maintain their position until being relieved by friendly ground forces.
The brigade can also carry out a number of other roles if required. These include conducting the evacuation of non-military personnel from hostile environments, supporting Polish Special Forces operations, and taking part in peace keeping missions with the UN and other organisations.
Structure
The brigade is currently composed of five separate battalions; 1 command battalion, 3 airborne infantry battalions, and 1 logistics battalion. The command battalion provides command and control for the brigade and also provides a reconnaissance company, a company of sappers, and an anti-aircraft battery. The airborne battalions consist of: a command company, 3 rifle companies, a mortar company, a logistics company and a medical support team. The brigade's logistics battalion is tasked with supplying any material supplies needed by the brigade during an operation.
Brigade units are stationed in three separate garrisons , its structure is as follows:
6th Airborne Brigade "Brig. Gen. Stanisław Sosabowski" in Kraków
6th Command Battalion in Kraków
6th Airborne Battalion in Gliwice
16th Airborne Battalion in Kraków
18th Airborne Battalion in Bielsko-Biała
6th Logistic Battalion in Kraków

At the 2007 Military World Games, the track and field events were held at the G. M. C. Balayogi Athletic Stadium in Hyderabad, India from 15 – 18 October 2007. A total of 36 events were contested, of which 22 by male and 14 by female athletes. Kenya topped the medal table with five gold medals and a total of 12 – the track and field competition accounted for all of the African nation's medals at the games, which brought them sixth place on the overall games medal count. Russia took second with four golds and eight silvers, having the joint greatest medal total. Poland, the People's Republic of China, and Saudi Arabia also achieved four gold medals. Athletes from thirty three of the participating countries reached the podium at the four-day competition organised by the Conseil International du Sport Militaire, which had no obvious dominant nation.
The competition featured a number of athletes who had been successful at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics: Hrysopiyi Devetzi—the world triple jump bronze medallist—won her event, as did hammer throwers Zhang Wenxiu and Primož Kozmus. Some World Championships medallists found themselves in the silver medal spot on the military stage, including Daniela Yordanova (1500 m), Anna Chicherova (high jump), and Shadrack Korir (1500 m).
Samuel Francis set a new Games record in the 100 metres, but his attempt to double his medals in the 200 metres was thwarted by a false start elimination. John Cheruiyot Korir retained his title in the 10,000 metres in a Games record time. The men's high jump competition was unusual in that all the medalists achieved the same height (2.26 m) which made them all Games record holders, although the medals were decided on count-back. A total of seven Games records were broken or equalled at the 2007 edition of the Games.

The Myth of the Negro Past is a 1941 monograph by Melville J. Herskovits intended to debunk the myth that African Americans lost their African culture due to their experience of slavery. The book was the first publication of the Carnegie Corporation's Study of the American Negro and took 15 years to research. Herskovits argued that African Americans had retained their heritage from Africa in music, art, social structure, family life, religion, and speech patterns. The book became controversial because it was feared its arguments could be used by proponents of racial segregation to prove that African Americans could not be assimilated into mainstream American society.

The school has to decide whether Key Stage 3 contains years 7, 8 and 9- or whether year 9 should be in Key Stage 4 and the students just study subjects that will be examined by the GCSE exams at 16. Sheringham had decided to take the latter approach.
The timetable is planned a 50 period fortnight.
Key Stage 3
In 2019, Key Stage 3 students studied:
Key Stage 4
Students study a core curriculum with a German or French, History or Geography and two optional subjects selected from a short list.
Ofsted Inspections
In 2012 Ofsted carried out an interim assessment of the school and confirmed the previous judgement of Good. In 2014 it was inspected again and judged Good.
Houses
Sheringham High School has four houses named after famous Norfolk people. Carter house named after adventurer Howard Carter, Cavell named after nurse Edith Cavell, Nelson after Lord Admiral Nelson and Sewell after author Anna Sewell.

Xingang Fengtian Temple (), sometimes romanized as Fongtian Temple, is a temple located in Xingang Township, Chiayi County, Taiwan. The temple is a county-level monument and the destination of the annual Dajia Mazu Pilgrimage.
History
Bengang is the historical name of a major port city along the Beigang River which flourished as both a trade center and a pirate's haven. In 1700, a temple named Tianhou Temple was founded in the city and dedicated to Mazu. However, the Bengang was very prone to flooding, and a flood in 1799 destroyed Tianhou Temple completely. Half of the temple relics were taken to the nearby Chaotian Temple in modern-day Beigang, while the other half was taken Xingang, a new settlement east built by displaced Bengang residents. In Xingang, the relics were temporarily stored inside a small Tudigong temple.
In 1811, Xingang residents built Fengtian Temple to house the rescued relics under the leadership of Qing general Wang De-lu. After the flood, Fengtian Temple and Chaotian Temple argued about who was the true successor to the destroyed Tianhou Temple, so in 1826, Wang negotiated a compromise: the head Mazu statue belonged to Fengtian Temple, the second Mazu statue belonged to Chaotian Temple, and Wang would take the third Mazu statue to his residence in Xibei Village south of Xingang. Even with the agreement, the two temples are still at odds to this day.
In 1905, Fengtian Temple was destroyed due to earthquake damage. The temple's restoration lasted from 1906 to 1917 and was led by , a well-known woodworker of the era.
On August 18, 1985, Fengtian Temple was protected as a county-level monument for its "historical, cultural, and artistic value."
In 1988, the Dajia Mazu Pilgrimage changed its destination from Chaotian Temple to Fengtian Temple. That year, Dajia's Jenn Lann Temple made changes to the pilgrimage that implied seniority over Chaotian Temple, which angered the latter. Fengtian Temple officials proposed that the pilgrimage should end in Xingang instead, and the pilgrimage has never returned to Beigang ever since.
Architecture
Fengtian Temple is a south-facing complex on County Highway 164 inside downtown Xingang. There are three halls on the central axis: the Sanchuan Hall, Main Haill (for Mazu), and the Rear Hall (for Guanyin). There is one flanking hall on each side housing Wenchang Dijun, Guan Yu, Chenghuangye, and Huye. A modern, four-story hall in the far back contains a variety of other deities.
As with most temples in Taiwan, the temple is built in the Hokkien architectural style. The street-facing Sanchuan Hall, designed by Wu Haitong, has Cochin ware decorations on the swallowtail roof and stone pillars inscribed with various religious symbols.
Traditions
Near Lantern Festival, a statue of Mazu is placed in a litter and paraded through Xingang. The ceremony is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage in Chiayi County.
In Taiwanese folk religion, Huye (虎爺) is a tutelary deity in the form of a tiger, said to be the protector of children. In Fengtian Temple, Huye is worshipped on its own altar in the right flanking hall, which differs from most temples that place it at the base of other deities's altars.
Japanese plaque
Fengtian Temple possesses a gold plated plaque from the Imperial House of Japan dating from 1928. The plaque was crafted in Myōshin-ji in Kyoto as a Japanization campaign and was gifted to twenty major temples across Taiwan. Fengtian Temple's plaque is considered the best-preserved copy in Taiwan.

The Imperial Natural History Museum or Imperial-Royal Natural History Court Museum of Austria-Hungary was created by (Kaiser) Emperor Franz Joseph I during an extensive reorganization of the museum collections, from 1851 to 1876, and opened to the public on August 10, 1889. Located in Vienna, the Museum was named in German as "K.k. Naturhistorisches Hofmuseum" (with "Hofmuseum" translated as "Court Museum").
Later, the Museum became part of the Natural History Museum of Vienna, Austria (in German, "Naturhistorisches Museum Vienna" or NHM-Wien).
When officially begun in 1876, Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter (1829–1884) became the first superintendent of the Imperial Natural History Museum, after having been, from 1860, professor of mineralogy and geology at the Imperial-Royal Polytechnic Institute in Vienna. In 1886, Austrian geologist and paleontologist Franz Ritter von Hauer became second superintendent of the Imperial Natural History Museum (more at "History" below).
The main building for the Museum was constructed between 1871 and 1891.
See more about the current museum at: Naturhistorisches Museum.
History
In the mid-19th century, there was much interest in the natural sciences, and the encouragement of this interest was a concern of the young sovereign, Franz Josef I: The newly built museum was inscribed: "Dem Reiche der Natur und seiner Erforschung —Kaiser FRANZ JOSEF I" ("To the realm of nature and its exploration —Emperor FRANZ JOSEPH I"). The new Imperial-Royal Natural History Court Museum thus documented the benevolent sentiment of the Imperial Household. Excavations for the construction of the new Museum of Nature started in the fall of 1871, and construction was completed more than ten years later.
On April 29, 1876, Emperor Franz Joseph I signed the document certifying the Natural History Court Museum, and Ferdinand von Hochstetter was appointed as the managing director of the museum. Hochstetter proposed a new organization for the museum and its collections. Four departments having far-reaching autonomy were created as successors to the older Cabinets; the Imperial-Royal Mineralogical Court Cabinet was divided in an Imperial-Royal Mineralogical-Petrographical Department and an Imperial-Royal Geologic-Paleontologic Department. The petrologist and meteorite specialist Aristides Brezina became director of the former and was supported by scientific colleagues: Friedrich Berwerth, with Felix Karrer and Rudolf Koechlin providing voluntary unpaid services. Felix Karrer became Secretary of the Wissenschaftlicher Club (Science Club) and founder of the Mineralogy collection of the department. By 1886, Rudolf Köchlin became scientific assistant and, later, maintained an inventory of the collection and even kept a diary.
Hochstetter died on July 18, 1884, and did not live to see the completion of the building for whose founding he had been so actively engaged. His successor as superintendent was Franz Ritter von Hauer, a geologist and paleontologist.
In the presence of the Emperor, the new "K.k. Naturhistorisches Hofmuseum" (Imperial-Royal Natural History Court Museum) was inaugurated on August 10, 1889. Initially, it was open to visitors four days per week—free on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, on Tuesdays for an admission price of one florin. The museum building and the collection it contained were highly popular: from August 13, 1889, to the end of December 1889 the museum counted 175,000 visitors, of which most (134,000) visited the museum during the 19 Sundays over this time span alone.
During 1889, the "Mineralogisch-Petrographische Abteilung" (Department of Mineralogy-Petrography) was under the directorship of Aristides Brezina.
In 1889, the museum purchased the renowned collection of William Earl Hidden from Newark, New Jersey (USA) for a sum of ƒ15,000 with the aid of an advance from the "All-highest Family Fund" of the Imperial Household. This loan had to be repaid in a series of complicated transactions, effected within a timeframe of ten years (i.e. through the sale of mineral doublets, meteorite sections, and precious-metal redemptions). Unfortunately these redemptions also included samples of silver and gold from the former "Ambrasian Collection" of Archduke Ferdinand II, an irreplaceable loss and impairment to the collection. Despite this, the acquisition of the "Hidden Collection" is of special significance for the Viennese museum. After all, the collection had been considered at that time as the second best private mineral collection in the United States, outranked only by the famous Clarence S. Bement Collection, which was later to be acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
In the same year of 1889, several items from the former private collection of Crown Prince Rudolf, whose death was reported as suicide, were passed on to the department, although apparently this had been against his will: the Crown Prince had left his natural history collection to Viennese teaching institutions. In accordance with these terms, the geologic and paleontological collection and his mineral collection were to be passed to the "K.k. Hochschule für Bodenkultur" (Imperial-Royal University for Agriculture). Instead, the glass imitations of precious stones and some other mineralogical items were entrusted to the Imperial Natural History Court Museum.
Koechlin became an assistant in 1892 and was promoted to assistant custodian in 1896. In the same year, Friedrich Berwerth was put in charge of the department, taking over from Aristides Brezina, who retired on August 30. Voluntary, unpaid assistance, from 1896 to the end of the monarchy was provided by Felix Karrer, alternately by Anton Pelinka, Hermann Graber, Friedrich Wachter and Karl Hlawatsch. In one last transaction before the collapse of the monarchy, the museum managed to purchase, during the years 1906–1907, the magnificent collection of Staatsrath Freiherr von Braun (totalling more than 2,500 items, doublets not included). There followed the far less important collections of August von Loehr and Rudolf von Görgey, although those were not entirely taken into inventory until after the Second World War, the delay being due to war and subsequent poor economic conditions (the same had happened to the collection of Friedrich Freiherr von Distler, acquired in 1932).
A patron of note at the start of the 20th century was Kommerzialrat Isidor Weinberger. He was one of the great sponsors of mineralogy, and the collection of the Natural History Court Museum is indebted to him for many beautiful specimens. Thus, the large specimen of amethyst sample from the Serra do Mar in Brazil, weighing about , donated by Weinberger, is today a particularly prominent component and can be admired in the Hall of Precious Stones of the museum. Particularly valuable are the more than 500 meteorite thin sections, formerly owned by Aristides Brezina, custodian and former director, which Weinberger had purchased and later presented to the Museum.

Zuma became the 4th President of South Africa after the general election in 2009, and chose Khumalo to be his First Lady from 2009 to 2014, after which he chose one of his other wives, Nompumelelo Ntuli Zuma, to succeed her. She is the founder of the Sizakhele MaKhumalo Zuma Foundation.

In computer science, the precision of a numerical quantity is a measure of the detail in which the quantity is expressed. This is usually measured in bits, but sometimes in decimal digits. It is related to precision in mathematics, which describes the number of digits that are used to express a value.
Some of the standardized precision formats are
Half-precision floating-point format
Single-precision floating-point format
Double-precision floating-point format
Quadruple-precision floating-point format
Octuple-precision floating-point format
Of these, octuple-precision format is rarely used. The single- and double-precision formats are most widely used and supported on nearly all platforms. The use of half-precision format has been increasing especially in the field of machine learning since many machine learning algorithms are inherently error-tolerant.
Rounding error
Precision is often the source of rounding errors in computation. The number of bits used to store a number will often cause some loss of accuracy. An example would be to store "sin(0.1)" in IEEE single precision floating point standard. The error is then often magnified as subsequent computations are made using the data (although it can also be reduced).

Dow Jones & Co. Inc. v Gutnick was an Internet defamation case heard in the High Court of Australia, decided on 10 December 2002. The 28 October 2000 edition of Barron's Online, published by Dow Jones, contained an article entitled "Unholy Gains" in which several references were made to the respondent, Joseph Gutnick. Gutnick contended that part of the article defamed him. A key judgement was that the suit could be brought in Australia.
Facts
The article in question was entitled Unholy Gains, by William Alpert, published in Barron's 2000 Oct 30. Australian courts described the details of the article in their written opinion on the case, as follows:
"[The article] "states that some of his business dealings with religious charities raise "uncomfortable questions" . . . . The author then uses some language that the media have appropriated from the law courts, implying that a balanced trial with equal opportunity to participate by all concerned has taken place: that a "Barron's investigation found that several charities traded heavily in stocks promoted by Gutnick." . . . (emphasis added) The article associates the respondent with Mr Nachum Goldberg who is apparently a convicted tax evader and another person awaiting trial for [[stock manipulation]] in New York."
In court it was proven that only five copies of the Barron's print edition were sent from New Jersey to be circulated in Australia, but that none had actually arrived in the Jurisdiction. Gutnick therefore resorted to the internet based publication in order to show an actionable tort in the jurisdiction. The Internet version of the magazine had 550,000 international subscribers and 1700 Australian-based credit cards.
Geoffrey Robertson QC argued for the publisher Dow Jones as to whether it was considered to be "published from" where it was uploaded in New Jersey or "published into" where it was downloaded by subscribers in Victoria, Australia. The argument was on publication and jurisdiction.
Decision
In a unanimous decision, all seven High Court justices decided that Gutnick had the right to sue for defamation at his primary residence and the place he was best known. Victoria was considered the place where damage to his reputation occurred. The High Court decided that defamation did not occur at the time of publishing, but as soon as a third party read the publication and thought less of the individual who was defamed.
Dow Jones was forced to admit in court that "there was no reason to believe Mr Gutnick was a customer of Mr Goldberg or had any criminal or improper relations with Mr Goldberg." (quote from an Australian Broadcasting Corporation story)
The High Court's ruling effectively allows defamation plaintiffs in Australia to sue for defamation on the internet against any defendant irrespective of their location. "If people wish to do business in, or indeed travel to, or live in, or utilize the infrastructure of different countries, they can hardly expect to be absolved from compliance with the laws of those countries. The fact that publication might occur everywhere does not mean that it occurs nowhere." (per Callinan J at para 186)
Equally, however, the majority of the Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ handing down a joint decision) stated that they disagreed that this would cause open-slather defamation actions in Australia: (at para 54 of the decision)
The case was highly controversial and the subject of much commentary from legal analysts.
The case was appealed by the author, to the UN under the right of direct petition for individuals. In the teeth of that application prepared by Geoffrey Robertson, Tim Robertson SC, Mark Stephens (solicitor) and Sydney based lawyer Paul Reidy, the case was settled on 15 November 2004, Dow Jones settled the case, agreeing to pay Gutnick some of his legal fees.

Priscilla the Great is a five-part series of novels, written by Sybil Nelson. The first book of the series, Priscilla the Great won the Strongest Start Novel competition, and was named a Flamingnet Top Choice Book. It was also Booklopedia's 2010 Most Hilarious Read.
In all, there are five books in the series by Nelson (who also writes young adult novels under the pen name Leslie DuBois):
Priscilla the Great (Create Space 2011, )
Priscilla the Great: The Kiss of Life (Create Space 2011, )
Priscilla the Great Too Little Too Late (Create Space 2011, )
Priscilla the Great: Bring the Pain (Create Space 2012, )
Priscilla the Great: The Time Traveling Bullet (Create Space 2012, )
Nelson says that the inspiration for the novels comes from her experiences as a math teacher at Ashley Hall, a private girls day-school in Charleston, South Carolina.
Plot
The story revolves around a girl named Priscilla Maxine Sumner, and her family and friends. Her family is made up of her father, Greg Sumner, her mother, Quindolyn, and her three brothers, Josh, Chester, and Charlie. Priscilla learns that she has powers, but is doubtful of them at first. It is learned that her older brother, Josh, also has powers, but keeps them a secret. Their mother, who at first claimed to be a pharmacist, is actually a superhero, and passed down her powers to her children, which helps them later in the books save their family and friends. This article is about the first book in the series.
At the beginning of the book, Priscilla is captured by an unknown, but familiar, source, and tied up to a chair. It is soon learned by her that her kidnappers are going to attempt to kill her, so she is forced to come up with her own plan to escape.
The story then goes to what happens leading up to the kidnapping. Priscilla is at a party at the most popular girl in her grade, Cali Crawford's, house. She claims the only reason she is there is because her brother, Josh, is dating Cali's sister. Priscilla is then complaining about her "not cool" one-piece swimsuit, when her long-time crush, Spencer Callahan goes up to talk to her. Priscilla gets so nervous she says she eats "bad salsa" and rushes to the bathroom. Flushed, she wipes her face with a towel, but it mysteriously turns on fire. She runs to the kitchen, where her oldest brother, Josh, finds her, and takes her home.
Priscilla then phones her best friend, also a genius, Tai, and tells her about the party, and in tears. Tai can't find any reasonable explanation for what happened. When it almost happens again, Priscilla gets into a weird position, with all limbs outstretched, where her dad walks in. He thinks that Priscilla is performing a weird dance, and tries to do it himself. Priscilla laughs, and Tai, who is under her bed (the phone is, actually), is talking very loudly. Greg, her father, then says to come downstairs in a half-hour, because they are going to video-chat with their mom, a supposed pharmacist. Priscilla asks where she is, and her dad says, "Dubai, Brazil". Tai then tells her Dubai is nowhere near Brazil.
In the next chapter, Priscilla goes downstairs to video-chat with her mom. When her mom asks a couple "motherly" questions, such as "How is school"?, Priscilla responds every time with "Why would you care?". Her father eventually has enough of it, and sends her up to her room.

"Train" is a song written and performed by British musical group Goldfrapp for their second album Black Cherry (2003). The song was produced by Goldfrapp and received a very positive reception from music critics. It was released as the lead single in the second quarter of 2003 and reached the top thirty in the United Kingdom, where it became Goldfrapp's first top thirty single. The original title of the song was "Wolf Lady", which makes reference to the lyrics in the second verse of the song. The lyrics of "Train" are based on Alison Goldfrapp's observations while in Los Angeles, California. She stated that the song describes wealth, drugs, and sex with "a sort of disgust of it and at the same time a sort of need to indulge in these things."
The song is featured in sports video game FIFA Football 2004.

STONEGHOST or "Stone Ghost", is a codename for a network operated by the United States' Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for information sharing and exchange between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Some sources say that New Zealand is also participating, and that Stone Ghost therefore connects, and is maintained by the defense intelligence agencies of all Five Eyes countries.
Stone Ghost does not carry Intelink-Top Secret information. In the past, it was known as Intelink-C and may also be referred to as "Q-Lat" or "Quad link". It is a highly secured network with strict physical and digital security requirements. The network hosts information about military topics, and about SIGINT, foreign intelligence and national security.

Royal Canadian Navy intelligence officer Sub-Lt. Jeffrey Delisle pled guilty on 10 October 2012 to charges including having downloaded and sold information from the Stone Ghost system to the Russian spy agency GRU. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, minus time served on February 6, 2013, for contravening the Security of Information Act.

Background
The television series is a re-imagining of Agustin dela Cruz's blockbuster classic flick Mga Basang Sisiw (a Pinoy idiomatic expression which means pitiful/hopeless/in dire condition). Produced and released by BSH Films in 1981, the movie stars Julie Vega, Janice de Belen, Cheche Perez de Tagle, Sheryl Cruz, Niño Muhlach and Helen Vela, who also served as producer.
Production and development
April 2013, GMA Network announced that they would adapt Mga Basang Sisiw into a soap opera, posing the theme: "No matter how bad life seems, someone always shares and understands one's confinement in such a desperate state." Head writer Richard Cruz enhanced the original plot by adding twists, subplots and additional characters. The series was executive produced by Kaye Atienza-Cadsawan and directed by Ricky Davao. The creative team was composed of Afternoon Prime Head, Roy Iglesias; Creative Consultant, Kit Villanueva Langit; Program Manager, Hazel F. Abonita; Headwriter, Richard Dode Cruz; writers, Luningning Ribay and Christine Novicio; and Brainstormers, Gilda Olvidado and Liberty Trinidad.
The series features eleven regular speaking roles. The majority of the ensemble cast was assembled in March/April 2013. Lani Mercado and Raymond Bagatsing were the first two actors to be chosen. The role of Vicky Santa Maria was originally offered to LJ Reyes who declined, so it was given to Maxene Magalona – her first "anti-hero" role. Magalona described her role as "super villain" and further stated "later in the series, it will be shown why my character is behaving that way, cold and cruel. [...] people will also sympathize with my character when they understand why she's acting that way." Gardo Versoza, veteran actress Caridad Sanchez and Mike Tan were the last actors to be cast. Tan described his role Rigor Manalastas as a "grey" character and "you either love him or hate him."
Ratings
According to AGB Nielsen Philippines' Mega Manila household television ratings, the pilot episode of Mga Basang Sisiw earned a 13.5% rating. While the final episode scored a 15.3% rating.

All Across This Land is the eighth studio album by Blitzen Trapper, released on October 2, 2015.
Conception
In a lengthy essay regarding the concept and construction of All Across This Land, the official Blitzen Trapper site compared the album to earlier albums like Furr and American Goldwing: "[All Across This Land] is a top-down, tightly defined piece of classic rock and roll, full of big riffs, bigger hooks and compelling, instantly relatable lyrics ... 'I think it's a return to the sort of more "classic" Blitzen Trapper thing, for sure,' [songwriter Eric] Earley says."
Earley also elaborated on the songwriting process: "Those two albums [Furr and American Goldwing], I wrote all the songs at once and they all hang together. But the records that came in between, they were written over the course of a year-and-a-half or so ... For All Across This Land, he continues, “I had all the songs written and demoed in a three or four month span. And I think they work together because everything came in such a short period.”
Pre-release
In April 2015, the band premiered one of the new tracks from the album, "Rock N' Roll Was Made for You," at a show supporting the recent Live Harvest album. Band member Marty Marquis indicated that more of the record would be previewed in tour dates leading up to the release of the record; later, website Missoulian confirmed this, reporting, "Fans attending Wednesday's show can expect to hear tracks from both albums [Live Harvest and All Across This Land] sprinkled into the band's live set."
Following the show, the official Twitter account of the band verified that several of the songs played the previous night were cuts from the new record: "Lonesome Angel," "Rock N Roll Was Made For You," "Mystery & Wonder," "Across the River," and "All Across This Land."
In February 2015, producer Gregg Williams released an in-studio snippet of Eric Earley recording a guitar solo for the new song, "Mystery & Wonder," recorded at The Trench Studios.
In July 2015, both the band's American label, Vagrant Records and their British label Lojinx published a press release for All Across This Land, highlighting the songwriting and craft of the new record: "Blitzen Trapper may have experimented successfully with a multitude of styles; however, the band has been built on a strong foundation as, above all else, a ROCK band. Their live shows consistently reinforce that fact, and those who have experienced their performance would agree. All Across This Land once again confirms that Blitzen Trapper possess the unique ability to create thoughtful, melodic, finely crafted songs on one hand, and deliver full throttle, infectious rock on the other. From the opening riff of the title track and first single, this is quite evident as it unfolds into a flurry of guitars, bass and drums. The band eases back as well by featuring some lead singer and songwriter Eric Earley's strongest writing yet, particularly on the semi-autobiographical 'Mystery and Wonder.' The track's reflective and nostalgic tone was inspired by the band's beginnings, the chemistry that develops over time and the music they have created through the years. Another album highlight is “Lonesome Angel” with its easy ‘70's AM radio feel.
"While All Across This Land features some of Earley's finest songs to date, the rest of his bandmate's performances – Erik Menteer (guitar), Michael Van Pelt (bass), Marty Marquis (guitar/keys), Brian Adrian Koch (drums) – elevate each track thus taking Blitzen Trapper to their highest artistic peak yet."
To accompany the press release, both labels also offered an album trailer for the new record; four days later, Lojinx and Vagrant confirmed the release and made a free download of album track "Lonesome Angel" available. On August 13, 2015, website PopMatters released a preview of the album's title track, "All Across This Land," with an accompanying "visualette," stating that the song is "a return to the sunny, riff-oriented classic rock sounds the band has excelled at for so long ... [t]apping into the sun-dappled sounds of early-1970s blues rock, classic Laurel Canyon rock, and of course the perpetual influence of Neil Young and Crazy Horse."
The web version of pop culture magazine Entertainment Weekly premiered the entire album as a stream on September 25, 2015, and quoted singer/songwriter Eric Earley about the origins of the album: "I just went back to the bands that influenced me in high school, like the Replacements and R.E.M., Uncle Tupelo." Earley also highlighted the lingering impact of his father's death on the record, saying, "He's been gone for many years, but I wondered if I ever really knew him ... Who's to say meditating on the thought, ‘What if I was to just cross over? Just to talk to my dad?' isn't real?"
On September 28th, 2015, media review/commentary site The A.V. Club premiered the first full-length music video for the album - the title track, "All Across This Land" - directed by Alicia J. Rose. The video imagines the band in various stages of recent rock-and-roll history, regressing from the CD era, back through cassettes, 8-track, and finally vinyl records. Says A.V. Club's Dave Anthony, "the album sees the band return to the classic-rock strut of its Sub Pop years, with riffs that go full-on Southern rock ... [in] the video for the album's title track ... the band dons a few different get-ups that reference various eras of rock history [and] rides around in the back of a well-painted van, it takes in the sights and sounds of the country, then let them spill out in 'All Across This Land.'"
As part of a unique promotion of both the vinyl record and independent music stores, the band hand-designed 100 copies of the vinyl album and shipped them to stores all over the country. From the Blitzen Trapper website: "In conjunction with the release of the new album on October 2nd, 100 select independent record stores in the US will each have one copy of All Across This Land on vinyl with sleeves hand-designed, autographed and numbered by the band. Head in to your local shop and maybe you'll be lucky enough to find one. Make sure to take a photo of it in the store and post it to social media with #TrapperTreasure and the store name."
Reception
When the song "Lonesome Angel" was released in advance of the record, website Brooklyn Vegan summed it as "the kind of folk rock you might expect a band who covered an entire Neil Young album to write (and like other Blitzen Trapper songs, there's a strong Dylan influence here too)." Paste Magazine also reviewed the song, stating, "Anchored by a delightful harmonica hook, driving piano and country-tinged slide guitar, the track sounds like a long-forgotten gem from ‘70s AM radio, striking the perfect balance between the Eagles and Bob Dylan while still managing to sound current. It's the perfect soundtrack to a drive along the California coast with the windows down." Closer to release date, the site expanded its review to the whole album, praising the record as "a throttle-up, open-highway sort of album, full of easygoing melodies and fist-pumping guitar hooks ... an album 15 years in the making, as the musicians are both in command of their talents individually and completely dialed in as a band."
Paste also compared the song "Nights Were Made For Love" to Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run; similarly, review site Soundblab found Springsteen influences, stating, "If the song had a sax solo, you'd swear it was a cover of some deep cut from Darkness on the Edge of Town or Tunnel of Love. Just the same, it's a strong song on an album full of them." Soundblab further appreciated the "sincerity" of the record, stating, "If their latest release is such an indicator, Blitzen Trapper may just have reached the pinnacle of that journey of self-identity." AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, applauding the apparent shift in the band's intent: "No longer concerned with making even the slightest feint toward delicate indie rock sensibilities, Blitzen Trapper settle into the '70s on All Across This Land." AllMusic further championed the production of the album, down to the sequencing, and stated, "Blitzen Trapper's period trappings -- which, outside of the occasional old-fashioned synth purloined from 1985, are meticulously accurate -- are the key to their charm, because they devote as much attention to their arrangements and productions as they do their songs."
Entertainment Weekly called the album "sunny ... bigger, synthier, warmer. Its guitars are brighter, more soaked in reverb." But, of the album's introspective final track, "Across the River," they state, "Earley makes it immediate and affecting, weaving a filigree portrait of longing for those long gone that only those who've wondered what they have to do to see someone again will understand." UK publication Uncut gave the album an 8 out of 10, enthusing, "Bandleader Eric Earley has a gift for shaping roots-rock tropes into sturdy songs with creamy hooks, and his band's strongest LPs, '08's Furr and '11's American Goldwing, hew faithfully to familiar forms. Blitzen Trapper's rock-solid eighth boasts a pair of instant grabbers" in the title track and the song "Lonesome Angel."
The album landed at #15 on Record Shop Radio Show'''s Top 30 Albums of 2015, and online radio station WFUV listed it among their "Best of 2015. Meanwhile, OPBMusic ranked the title track one of the best songs of the year, stating, "Blitzen Trapper's 2015 release All Across This Land'' finds the band at their rock ‘n' roll best. The title track is rhythmic, catchy and fun, and feels like the kind of song you want to kick off a great road trip with … and then just keep listening to throughout the entire journey."

Bernie Alpha Ibini-Isei (born 12 September 1992), also known simply as Bernie Ibini, is a professional soccer player who plays as a winger and a forward. Born in Nigeria, he represented Australia internationally.
Early life
Bernie Ibini-Isei immigrated to Australia from Nigeria when he was a child, and grew up in Sydney's Canterbury-Bankstown region. His passion for soccer was obvious from a very young age, and at the age of six years old he was registered to play for his local club Earlwood Wanderers.
He has a sister, Princess Ibini-Isei, who is also a soccer player, playing for Sydney FC in the W-League and the Australian team.
Club career
Ibini started playing soccer for New South Wales Premier League club Blacktown City at youth level. He was immediately recognized as a player with immense potential and was selected to join Westfields Sports High School.
Central Coast Mariners
In 2009, he was signed by the Central Coast Mariners to join their youth team in the A League competition. In 2009, he received the Golden Boot Award in the National Youth League and was quickly promoted to the senior team, where he made his debut on 12 February 2010, in their round 27 clashes against Wellington Phoenix at Westpac Stadium in Wellington. Ibini-Isei made his starting debut for the Mariners against the Gold Coast and scored in a 3–1 win. After just his third start for the Central Coast Mariners Ibini-Isei scored the second goal for the Central Coast Mariners against Perth Glory. His speed and skill quickly gained the attention of the Australian under 20 National Team coach to play a key role in the U20 World Cup.
His consistent development and performances earned Bernie a two-year contract extension with the club, and on 1 February 2012 it was announced that he had signed a two-year contract extension with Central Coast Mariners.
Shanghai East Asia
On 4 June 2013, after his superb performances in the 2012/2013 Asian Champions League round of 16 clashes against Guangzhou Evergrande, Central Coast Mariners received a record bid for Ibini from Shanghai East Asia FC who were keen to add to their squad list for the Chinese Super League. Three days later his move to newly promoted Chinese Super League side Shanghai East Asia, was complete with Ibini signing a three-year contract. This move made Ibini one of the most expensive under 21 players 21 in Asia. Bernie made an immediate impact in the Chinese Super League with his speed and skill playing as a wide striker. However, in November 2013, due to the unexpected tragic death of his father Ibini gained permission to return to the Australian A League, and previous club Central Coast Mariners on loan on compassionate grounds. The loan move took effect on 8 January 2014 and was until 31 May 2014 after which he was then to return to Shanghai.
Loan to Sydney FC
In May 2014 Ibini signed for Sydney FC on loan, making his debut in round 1 of the A League season against Melbourne City. Ibini scored his first goal in the Sydney Derby in a 1–1 draw. In the last three rounds of the A league season Ibini scored three goals: a contender for goal of the season against Perth Glory, a lob over the goalkeeper against Newcastle United and a solo goal against Wellington Phoenix. Although Sydney wanted to keep Ibini, he was recalled by Shanghai on 3 June 2015 Ibini played in every A-League fixture for Sydney during the 2014–15 season.
Club Brugge
Following his release from Sydney, due to his contract ending on 1 May, Ibini missed out on playing against 2014–15 Premier League champions Chelsea in a friendly at ANZ Stadium. It was shortly announced thereafter that Ibini had gained permission from Shanghai East Asia to travel to Belgium for a medical with Club Brugge with Shanghai unlikely to retain him due to their foreign player quota already filled. He signed a three-year deal with the club on 5 June 2015. It was announced that Ibini would wear the number 11 shirt.
Second loan to Sydney FC
After being ruled out for the 2015–16 Belgian Pro League season due to a broken leg he suffered in his first training session with Club Brugge, it was announced on 21 July 2016 that Ibini would return to Sydney FC on a loan deal once again. He made his return from injury in an FFA Cup semi-final against Canberra Olympic on 19 October 2016, coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring a late goal in a 3–0 win.
Vancouver Whitecaps FC
On 9 May 2017, Ibini signed with Major League Soccer club Vancouver Whitecaps FC on a one-year deal with an option to make it a two-year deal. On 8 August 2018, the Whitecaps announced that they and Ibini-Isei had "mutually agreed to a contract termination" to allow him to sign with Emirates Club of the UAE Pro League.
Jeonbuk Hyundai
In January 2019 Ibini signed with Korean side Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. He left Jeonbuk, and arranged a transfer to Esteghlal only for the contract to be rescinded after Ibini failed a medical clearance at the club.
International career
Ibini made his debut for the Australian U-20 team in 2011, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 win against Germany U-20.
On 7 March 2011, he was selected to represent the Australia Olympic football team in an Asian Olympic Qualifier match against Iraq.
On 10 October 2014, he made his debut for the Australian senior team, starting in a friendly match against the United Arab Emirates in preparation for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy is a historical study of the different forms of shamanism around the world written by the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade. It was first published in France by Librarie Payot under the French title of Le Chamanisme et les techniques archaïques de l'extase in 1951. The book was subsequently translated into English by Willard R. Trask and published by Princeton University Press in 1964.
At the time of the book's writing, Eliade had earned a PhD studying Hinduism in India before becoming involved with far right politics in his native Romania. After the rise of the communist government, he fled to Paris, France in 1945, where he took up an academic position and began studying shamanism, authoring several academic papers on the subject before publishing his book.
The first half of Shamanism deals with the various elements of shamanic practice, such as the nature of initiatory sickness and dreams, the method for obtaining shamanic powers, the role of shamanic initiation and the symbolism of the shaman's costume and drum. The book's second half looks at the development of shamanism in each region of the world where it is found, including Central and North Asia, the Americas, Southeastern Asia and Oceania and also Tibet, China and the Far East. Eliade argues that all of these shamanisms must have had a common source as the original religion of humanity in the Palaeolithic.
On publication, Eliade's book was recognised as a seminal and authoritative study on the subject of shamanism. In later decades, as anthropological and historical scholarship increased and improved, elements of the book came under increasing scrutiny, as did Eliade's argument that there was a global phenomenon that could be termed "shamanism" or that all shamanisms had a common source. His book also proved to be a significant influence over the Neoshamanic movement which developed in the western world in the 1960s and 1970s.
Background
Mircea Eliade was born in Bucharest, Romania in 1907. Attending the Spiru Haret National College, he subsequently studied at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters from 1925 through to 1928. Traveling to India to study the country's religions, in 1933 he received his PhD for a thesis devoted to a discussion of Yoga. Writing for the nationalist newspaper Cuvântul, he spoke out against antisemitism but became associated with the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group. Arrested for his involvement in the far right, following his release in 1940 he gained employment as a cultural attaché to both the United Kingdom and then Portugal. Following the Second World War, Eliade moved to Paris, France, fearing the rise of a communist government in Romania. Here, he married for a second time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu.
Together with Emil Cioran and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat Alexandru Busuioceanu, helping him publicize anti-communist opinion to the Western European public. In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and Ananda Coomaraswamy found him a job as a French-language teacher in the United States, at a school in Arizona; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy's death in September. Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal Critique, edited by French thinker Georges Bataille. The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel Noaptea de Sânziene (he visited the country a third time in 1952). He collaborated with Carl Jung and the Eranos circle after Henry Corbin recommended him in 1949, and co-edited the Antaios magazine with Ernst Jünger. In 1950, Eliade began attending Eranos conferences, meeting Jung, Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, Gershom Scholem and Paul Radin. He described Eranos as "one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world."
Working from France, Eliade had begun to study shamanism from a global perspective, publishing three papers on the subject: "Le Probléme du chamanisme" in the Revue de l'histoire des religions journal (1946), "Shamanism" in Forgotten Religions, an anthology edited by Vergilius Ferm (1949), and "Einführende Betrachtungen über den Schamanismus" in the Paideuma journal (1951). He had also lectured on the subject in March 1950 at both the University of Rome and the Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente.
Synopsis
In his foreword, Eliade explains the approach that he has taken in the book, noting that his intention is to situate world shamanism within the larger history of religion. Disputing any claims that shamanism is a result of mental illness, he highlights the benefits that further sociological and ethnographic research could provide before explaining the role of a historian of religions. Describing shamanism as "precisely one of the archaic techniques of ecstasy", he proclaims that it is "at once mysticism, magic and "religion" in the broadest sense of the term."
Chapter one, "General Considerations. Recruiting Methods. Shamanism and Mystical Vocation", details Eliade's exploration of the etymology and terminological usage of the word "shamanism".
Arguments
Definition of "shamanism"
Within his study of the subject, Eliade proposed several different definitions of the word "shamanism". The first of these was that shamanism simply constituted a "technique of ecstasy", and in Eliade's opinion, this was the "least hazardous" definition. Shamanism is a flexible custom that is embedded in a framework of cosmological beliefs and practices. Shamans believe there is a spiritual connection between everything in the universe, and therefore, do not consider Shamanism to be a religion, nor a science. Instead, Shamanism can be viewed as healing or helping technology. For Shamans to access the power they are given by spirits, they go on a spiritual journey. Other definitions for the word "shamanism" are used interchangeably. "Medicine man", "sorcerer", "spirit healer", and "magician" are a few examples used to describe people with these "magico-religious" powers. These "magico-religious" people, or Shamans, believed in and used unconventional techniques in their flexible practices—like spirits, sacred herbs, and the supernatural—in order to heal other people. Shamans are theoretically justified in their practice and can be known as masters of spirits who have a specific group of mastered spirits.
Reception
Discussing the Norse practice of Seiðr in her book Gods and Myths of Northern Europe (1964), the academic Hilda Ellis Davidson described Eliade's French-language book as the "fullest recent study of shamanism".
Further criticism of some of Eliade's positions came from the English historian Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol in his book, Shamans: Siberian Spirituality and the Western Imagination (2001). Hutton took issue with Eliade's claim that divination only played a minor role in Siberian shamanism, claiming that Eliade had produced no data to substantiate such an assertion, and that the ethnographic evidence actually indicated that the opposite was true. He saw this as part of a wider problem whereby Eliade had ignored certain "varieties of native practitioner" from his "chosen image of shaman" and had been "intent on generalizations." Hutton also argued that Eliade's description of traditional Siberian cosmology oversimplified great diversity among the various Siberian indigenous groups and that Eliade's claims that Siberian shamanism revolved around a vision of death and rebirth was similarly erroneous.
For the 2004 English-language re-publication of Shamanism by Princeton University Press, a new foreword was commissioned from the academic Indologist Wendy Doniger. At the time, Doniger held the position of Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago. Having been a personal friend and colleague of his for many years, Doniger used her foreword to defend him from accusations that he was either a fascist or an anti-semite, and evaluated his work in Shamanism. Drawing comparisons with anthropologist James Frazer and philologist Max Müller, she accepted that while he advanced the knowledge of his time "within a body of assumptions that we no longer accept", his work inspired "an entire generation" of scholars and amateurs in the study of religion.

Success continued with a second championship in 2005–06, the season in which the club became Crewe Alexandra. They spent two seasons in the National League North (tier three), with the highest placing of 4th in 2006–07, before being relegated back to the Midland Combination. Currently (2021–22 season), they are playing in the Premier Division (tier five) of the North West Women's Regional Football League.
The team's best season in the Women's FA Cup has been a fourth round appearance in 2007–08. In the Cheshire County Cup, they have been finalists on three occasions and won the trophy once, in 2004–05.
In 2012–13, the Alex won silverware in the shape of the NWWRFL Plate by beating Kendal Ladies 7–1 in the final played at The Pavilions in Runcorn. In the same season, the club also established a Development Squad, playing in the Cheshire Women's & Youth Football League to enhance the playing squad.
The club's best known player is Kerry Davis, a prolific striker who scored a then record 44 goals in 82 appearances for England (1982–1998). Her record was beaten in February 2012, when Kelly Smith scored her 45th goal while playing against Finland in the Cyprus Cup.

I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon is a book combining film stills and photographs with transcripts of the last filmed interviews with Federico Fellini conducted by Canadian filmmaker Damian Pettigrew in Rome in 1991 and 1992. The interviews are edited and introduced by Pettigrew with a preface by Italian film critic and Fellini biographer Tullio Kezich.
Designed as a companion to the feature documentary, Fellini: I'm a Born Liar (which, in contrast, uses a single photo of Fellini as a baby), the book has 125 film stills of Fellini at work and many unpublished photographs recently restored by the Cineteca del Comune di Bologna (Italy) .
Summary
Introduced by novelist Italo Calvino to Federico Fellini (1920–1993) on the set of Fellini's And the Ship Sails On in 1983, Pettigrew shot in-depth interviews with Fellini, material later used in his documentary.
Returning to their original q&a, he extracted a compilation of Fellini's responses.
Arranged alphabetically according to subject, the transcripts focus on the maestro's late philosophical views leavened with quips and one-liners, the enigma of memory and inspiration, style and aesthetics that were conducted expressly as a filmed testament in collaboration with Pettigrew. Sepia scrapbook photos appear alongside b&w stills from 8½, La Dolce Vita, La Strada, I vitelloni, and others while color images are selected from classics such as Amarcord, Fellini Satyricon, And the Ship Sails On, Intervista, City of Women, Roma, and Juliet of the Spirits. Production photos capture Fellini on Cinecittà sets, directing and gesticulating.
Reception
In his on-line Film Comment review, critic Michael Rowin judged the volume as "one of the great documents of Fellini in his own words, as well as a beautiful photographic journey through his cinema".
Publishers Weekly also reviewed the book favorably, describing the page designs by Brankica Kovrlija as "beautiful... festooned with torn-paper effects and flamboyant fonts, a stylish setting to display" quotes from the film transcripts that run "the A-to-Z gamut from actors ('An actor's face and body are more important to me than plot structure'), Anita Ekberg ('a glorious apparition!') and Antonioni, to clowns, death, God, guilt, Hollywood, music, puppets, vagabonds, Visconti and women, 'the source of man's creativity.' As screenwriter Tullio Kezich notes in his foreword, Fellini is a 'matador of words' ".
Reviewers Odell and LeBlanc at Bookmunch wrote: "Flamboyant, witty yet showing signs of insecurity and angst, Fellini is as open as he is defensive. From the flippant ("God may not play dice but he enjoys a good round of Trivial Pursuit every now and again") and the surreal (dreams of Picasso making him omelettes), the moving (his brief epitaph to Nina Rota) and the insightful (the genesis of some of his most beloved projects), Fellini Lexicon has plenty to enjoy either as a straight read or to dip into."

Tobias Matthew (also Tobie and Toby; 13 June 154629 March 1628), was an Anglican bishop who was President of St John's College, Oxford, from 1572 to 1576, before being appointed Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1579 to 1583, and Matthew would then become Dean of Durham from 1583 to 1595. All three positions, plus others, were appointed to Matthew by Elizabeth I. Eventually, he was appointed Archbishop of York in 1606 by Elizabeth's successor, James I.
Early life
He was the son of Sir John Matthew of Ross in Herefordshire, England, and of his wife Eleanor Crofton of Ludlow. Tobias was born at Bristol on 13 June 1546.
Matthew was educated at Wells, Somerset, and then in succession at University College and Christ Church, Oxford. He proceeded BA in 1564, and MA in 1566.
Ties to Elizabeth I
He attracted the favourable notice of Elizabeth I, and his rise was steady though not quite rapid. He was first appointed a public orator in Oxford in 1569, and then President of St John's in 1572, Dean of Christ Church in 1576, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 1579, Dean of Durham in 1583, Bishop of Durham in 1595, and Archbishop of York in 1606.
Years as Archbishop
In 1581, Matthew had a controversy with the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and published at Oxford his arguments in 1638 under the title, Piissimi et eminentissimi viri Tobiae Matthew, archiepiscopi olim Eboracencis concio apologetica adversus Campianam. While in the north he was active in forcing the recusants to conform to the Church of England, preaching hundreds of sermons and carrying out thorough visitations.
In 1617, he delegated his trusted lieutenant Phineas Hodson to advise Roger Brearley, who had founded the Grindletonian nonconformist sect and been accused of heresy as a result, on how he might reconcile with the Church of England.
Final years and death
During his later years he was to some extent in opposition to the administration of King James I. He was exempted from attendance in the parliament of 1625 on the ground of age and infirmities. His wife, Frances, was the daughter of William Barlow, Bishop of Chichester. His son, Tobie Matthew was an MP and later a convert to Roman Catholicism. He died at Cawood on 20 March 1628 at 81 years old; he was buried in the Lady Chapel of York Minster.

5-Carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) is a tryptamine derivative closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin.
5-CT acts as a non-selective, high-affinity full agonist at the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors, as well as at the 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 receptors with lower affinity. It has negligible affinity for the 5-HT1E and 5-HT1F receptors. 5-CT binds most strongly to the 5-HT1A receptor and it was once thought to be selective for this site. Recently, a close derivative of 5-CT, AH-494 has been shown to function as an agonist of 5-HT7, although being more selective over 5-HT1A.

Jožef Krajnc, also spelled Josef Krainc, Josef Krainz (17 February 1821 – 22 February 1875) was an Austro-Hungarian lawyer, philosopher and politician of Slovenian ancestry.
Life
Krajnc was born in Škale, today part of Velenje, to a farmer of the same name. From 1832 until 1841 he attended the Gymnasium in Celje, graduating with the Matura. From 1841 until 1845, he studied philosophy and law in Graz, obtaining a doctorate in both disciplines. From 1842 on, he financed his studies as a private tutor to a wealthy landowner's family in Graz and Bad Radkersburg. From 1845 on, Krajnc worked as judicial advisor first to the city council of Radkersburg, then to the council of Graz. For a short time in 1847, he worked as a judge in Graz.
In the course of the March Revolution, Krajnc served as a member of the Austrian Reichstag from 1848 to 1849, filling in for Vinzenz Gurnigg, who did not accept his mandate. Among other duties, Krajnc was a member of the Reichstag's constitutional committee.
From 1850 on, Krajnc taught civil law at the University of Graz, first as an extraordinary, from 1852 on as ordinary professor. His courses were given in Slovene. After his chair was dissolved in 1854, he worked for a short time as a consultant to the Austrian ministry of finances in Laibach, before receiving a teaching position for civil, business and exchange law at the Handelsakademie in Hermannstadt in 1855. Krajnc kept this position until 1870, when he became professor of Austrian civil law and German common law at the University of Innsbruck.
In 1871, Krajnc was appointed professor of civil law in Prague. This appointment soon turned into a political issue. The climate at the University of Prague was dominated and severely poisoned by deep animosities between German-Austrians and Czechs, both among teaching staff and among students. Many German-Austrians perceived Krajnc as a protégé of Austria's Minister of Education Josef Jireček, who was of Czech ancestry, and took the sudden and forced early retirement of Krajnc's German predecessor as an affront. A group of German-speaking students, among their leaders Fritz Mauthner, caused his inaugural lecture to end in riots. A note of protest against Krajnc's appointment was written by German-Austrian students at the University's faculty of law and directed to the Austrian Ministry of Education, but to no avail.
Krajnc died in Prague in 1875.
Family
Jožef Krajnc married Maria Petritsch in 1858. The marriage produced two sons and one daughter.

The Festival Ludique International de Parthenay, otherwise known as the Festival de Jeux or FLIP, is a games festival held in the town of Parthenay in western France. The festival is held over a period of 12 days in early July. Most of the festival is held out of doors throughout the streets and squares of the town centre, although some elements are held indoors or under canvas. A shorter indoor version of the festival (FLIP d'hiver) runs in November.
The festival is organised by the communauté de communes of Parthenay, with the support of many different partners and sponsors. The first festival was in 1986. In 2011, it ran from 6 to 17 July.
No festival was held in 2020.
Villages
Traditionally, the festival is divided into a number of themed 'villages' spread throughout Parthenay. For example, in 2008, the festival comprised the following villages:
Village des Créateurs
Village des Jeux
Village des Jeux et Environnement
Village des Jeux Sportifs
Village des Jouets
Village des Jeux Médiévaux
Village Multimédia
Village Récréatif
Village des Jeux de Simulation
Village des Jeux Traditionnels
In addition to the themed villages, various board games are left scattered throughout the town's shopping streets. The town's congress hall holds a computer games fair, and various organised team games are held in the Place du Drapeau.

Doezum is a village in the municipality of Westerkwartier in the Dutch province of Groningen. It had a population of around 725 in January 2017.
History
The village was first mentioned in 1475 as "Uteradosum alias Dosum". The etymology is unclear. Doezum is a road village which developed in the Early Middle Ages.
The lower part of the tower of the Dutch Reformed church dates from the 12th century. The church was altered and extended several times. In 1808, it received its current shape and most of the tower of the tower was rebuilt. Between 1954 and 1957, it was restored, however a Roman-style entrance was added which was never part of the original design.
Doezum was home to 593 people in 1840. It used to be part of the municipality of Grootegast. In 2018, it became part of Westerkwartier.

Tiny Brauer (born Harold J. Brauer; June 26, 1909 – March 19, 1990) was an American film actor. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Brauer appeared in over 20 films between 1946 and 1966.
Career
Brauer is best known for his role as the "heavy" in several Three Stooges short subjects, particularly in Three Loan Wolves, Fright Night, and Sing a Song of Six Pants.
Though he made less than a dozen appearances with the slapstick comedy trio, he was one of only two supporting actors who appear on film with all four configurations of the Stooges (i.e. third Stooge played by Curly Howard, Shemp Howard, Joe Besser, and Curly Joe DeRita). Emil Sitka was the other supporting actor to achieve this goal.
Over the course of his 20-year career, Brauer was billed under several different names. In addition to his work with the Stooges, Brauer also worked with Jimmy Durante and Schilling and Lane.
Death
Brauer was the guest of honor at the April 1989 Three Stooges convention held in Trevose, Pennsylvania. He died of natural causes just shy of a year later on March 19, 1990.

Filippo Beroaldo, sometimes called "the Elder" to distinguish him from his cousin Filippo Beroaldo the Younger, and also known as Philip or Philippus Beroaldus (7 November 1453 – 17 July 1505) was an Italian humanist active as a professor at the University of Bologna.
Life
Born in Bologna in a local noble family, Filippo Beroaldo studied with Francesco Puteolano, who worked at the University of Bologna as a professor of rhetoric and poetry, and was active as editor of early printed editions of Ovid, Catullus and Tacitus. On the return of Puteolano to Milan, Berolado was made the new professor of rhetoric and poetry in 1472, despite being only 19 years old.
In 1475, he left Bologna and travelled to Parma and Paris, where he befriended Robert Gaguin, but by 1479 he was back in Bologna, where he would remain as professor until he died in 1505.
Beroaldo was a very popular teacher. It was said that up to 300 students followed his lectures, and that 200 students left the university after his death. His students included some of the children of Giovanni II Bentivoglio, Filippo Beroaldo the Younger (1472–1518, cousin of Beroaldo), Hermann von dem Busche, Polydore Vergil, Andrzej Krzycki, Jodocus Badius, and Giovanni Battista Pio, who both later became professors at Bologna. Berolado also sometimes worked as a diplomat for Bentivoglio. He is considered to be the leading Italian humanist from 1494 on, after the death of Poliziano.

The northern caiman lizard (Dracaena guianensis) is a species of lizard found in northern South America.
Appearance
The northern caiman lizard is built similarly to its cousin the tegu, with a large heavy set body and short but powerful limbs. Its head is bulky and often a red or orange color. Their jaws are heavily muscular to help aid in eating its normal prey of snails, crawfish and fresh water clams. It also has a few adaptations that help it in its watery habitat. It has a long and flattened tail, similar to its namesake, the caiman. The long tail helps the northern caiman lizard to successfully swim and dive. A clear third eyelid is thought to act like a pair of goggles underwater.
The body of the northern caiman lizard is very similar to that of a crocodile. It is typically a bright green with slight dark green banding. There are horned raised scales along the dorsal of the back. This helps to provide some protection against predators.
These lizards can reach up to long and weigh up to .
Distribution and habitat
D. guianensis can be found in the south American countries of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and the Guianas. It lives in swampy habitats and other wooded areas which are flooded. It is mostly aquatic and is an excellent climber. It spends most of its time basking on branches overhanging waterways such that it may be able to flee from predation by disappearing underwater.
The lizard's wild population number is unknown. There has yet to be a study on them in their natural habitat. Much of what we know about them comes from captive animals in zoos and aquariums, as well as in the homes of hobbyists.
This species was heavily hunted for their hides. In 1970 they were provided protection and the export of their skin dropped. Now local populations are safe where their habitat is protected. Captive farms have since been set up to provide animals for the leather trade. In recent years a number of these animals have found themselves in the pet trade.
Habits
The northern caiman lizard spends most of its time in or near water. At night, it hides in trees and bushes. Caiman lizards in the wild will take a variety of prey: snails, fish, amphibians, crabs, crawfish, clams, invertebrates and other freshwater inhabitants all can make up a caiman lizards diet. However they do specialize in snails. It takes the snail in the jaws, raises its head up so that the prey will slide into the back of the mouth, then crushes it with its back teeth. It then spits out the pieces of shell. The lizard has been known to even kill and eat Amazon river turtles by crushing the shell by the edges and eating the softer parts chunk after chunk. It will occasionally hunt rodents. It has also been known to burrow like its cousin the tegu.
In captivity
The northern caiman lizard has been hard to keep in captivity. Due to their natural diet consisting almost purely of snails, most wild caught adults will refuse to eat anything else. Some zoos and aquariums have had success in keeping and breeding them.
In the last five years, farmed baby northern caiman lizards from South America have made their way into the pet trade around the world. These hatchlings are more willing to accept other food sources. Even so, this is not a lizard which by any means is easy to keep or raise in captivity. They have strong jaws that are capable of delivering painful bites. Their aquatic lifestyle means they need a large pool or tank, but also need a place to dig and burrow and logs or other suitable material with dry surfaces to bask on. This can be quite hard to accommodate due to their need for high humidity and high basking surface temperatures. Proceeded by the fact that these lizards can grow to be fairly large, up to 4 feet in length, a large enclosure is mandatory to successfully keep them alive.
That being said, some owners claim there is a reward to keeping them. Northern caiman lizards are intelligent as can be seen in the way they approach a snail that is clinging to the rocks. They can solve problems which many other lizards apparently fail to and can generally recognize their owners, given they have been kept for the right amount of time and are in good health.
Captive diet includes turkey meat (often mixed with Mazuri alligator diet), mussels, clam meat, catfood, fish and some fruits.

Count Armand Doria (1824-1896) was a French aristocrat, art collector and patron. He served as the mayor of Orrouy from 1864 to 1896. He acquired a significant collection of impressionist works, including paintings subsequently exhibited in museums in Europe and the United States.
Early life
Count Armand-François-Paul des Friches Doria was born on April 24, 1824 in Paris, France. His father, Stanislas-Philippe-Henri Doria, was a marquis, which title his elder brother, Arthur, inherited. His paternal family was ennobled in 1539, during the ancien régime.
Count Doria grew up in the family castle in Cayeux-en-Santerre and a hôtel particulier on the rue de la Perle in Le Marais, Paris. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, and confessed to Félix Dupanloup.
Career
Count Doria served as the mayor of Orrouy from 1864 to 1896. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he encouraged local inhabitants to enlist in the French army and protected the town from the Prussian invaders. Count Doria was conservative, and he was influenced by the works of Joseph de Maistre, Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald and Antoine Eugène Genoud.
Count Doria was a patron of the arts and art collector. For example, he was a patron to Adolphe-Félix Cals, who stayed in his castle for an extended period of time. Other long-term guests were Gustave-Henri Colin and Victor Vignon. Count Doria also invited Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Édouard Manet.
Count Doria was the owner of The Roman Campagna, with the Claudian Aqueduct, an 1826 painting by Corot which is now in the permanent collection of the National Gallery in London. Another Corot painting, View of Olevano, is at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. He purchased many more paintings by Corot over the years. He was also the owner of La Leçon de tricot by Jean-François Millet. Another Millet painting he owned, View of Farm Buildings across a Field, is now in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Additionally, Count Doria owned La maison du pendu by Paul Cézanne, but he exchanged it with art collector Victor Chocquet for another Cézanne painting, La Neige fondante. He also owned Les Grands boulevards by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Count Doria also mentored Léon-Honoré Labande, who served as the archivist of the Prince's Palace of Monaco from 1906 to 1939.
Personal life
Count Doria married Marie-Berthe de Villiers, the daughter of Prudent-Léopold de Villiers and Elizabeth Poulletier de Suzenet, in 1854. They resided at the Château d'Orrouy, owned by his grandparents, in Orrouy, Oise, Picardy. They had a son, François Doria, and a daughter, Marie-Luce. His wife died four years into their marriage. His daughter died when she was twenty years old.
Death
Count Doria died on May 7, 1896. He was buried in Orrouy.

Teggiano (foaled 3 March 1997) was an Irish-bred, British-trained thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted from July 1999 until July 2000 she won three of her six races. As a two-year-old she was one of the best fillies of her generation in Britain when she won three races including the May Hill Stakes and the Fillies' Mile. After a change of stable she made two appearances in the following year, producing the best of her efforts when finishing second in the Ribblesdale Stakes. She has had some success as a broodmare.
Background
Teggiano is a bay mare bred in Ireland by her owner Abdullah Saeed Belhab. Her sire Mujtahid raced only as a two-year-old in 1990 when he won three of his four races including the July Stakes and the Gimcrack Stakes.
His other progeny included Bear King (Badener Meile), Mutakarrim (Sharp Novices' Hurdle), and Mubhij Cornwallis Stakes. Her dam, Tegwen won one minor race from five starts as a three-year-old in 1994. and was a great-granddaughter of the broodmare Beautiful Spirit, whose other descendants have included Silvano (Arlington A Million) and Sabiango (Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap).
The filly was initially sent into training with Clive Brittain at his Carlburg Stables in Newmarket.
Racing career
1999: two-year-old season
On her racecourse debut, Teggiano was one of nine fillies to contest a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 25 July. Ridden by Philip Robinson, she started at odds of 8/1 and finished fourth, three lengths behind the winner Aunty Rose. Frankie Dettori took over from Robinson when the filly was dropped in distance for a six furlong maiden at Newbury Racecourse three weeks later. Starting the 5/1 third choice in a sixteen-runner field, she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths and three lengths from Femme Fatale and Dancing Mirage. On 9 September, Teggiano was stepped up in class and distance for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. With Dettori again in the saddle she was made the 13/2 third favourite behind the Sweet Solera Stakes winner Princess Ellen and Aunty Rose, with the best fancied of the other nine runners being the Paul Cole-trained Sailing. Teggiano started slowly and raced at the rear of the field before being switched to the outside to make her challenge in the straight. She took the lead a furlong out, quickly went clear of her opponents and won "comfortably" by three lengths from Everlasting Love with Aunty Rose a length and a quarter away in third. Dettori commented "I liked her a lot the first time I rode her and told Clive that she had enough class to go on to the May Hill and then a Group 1 in France or England. She gave me good vibes for next year, though she is still on the weak side. She idled a bit so I gave her a couple of smacks so that she knows what's to come in better races".
Seventeen days later Teggiano was moved up in class again for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse and started the 11/8 favourite in a six-runner field after the withdrawal of the Henry Cecil-trained High Walden. Her opponents were My Hansel, Veil of Avalon, Britannia and Issey Rose, none of whom had won at Group race level. Dettori positioned the filly at the rear of the field as Britannia set the pace ahead of Issey Rose and Veil of Avalon. Teggiano began to make progress in the straight, took in the lead just inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Britannia. My Hansel was three quarters of a length away in third, a short head in front of Issey Rose. After the race Brittain said "her racing heart has won it today and it will take her to the top. Next year we'll have a racing machine".
In October it was announced that the filly would be transferred to the ownership of Goldolphin and would be removed from Clive Brittain's yard to spend the winter in Dubai. Brittain commented "It's sad that she's going, but we wish Godolphin all the very best with her and hope she does well for them".
2000: three-year-old season
Teggiano, now trained by Saeed bin Suroor, began 2000 as the ante-post favourite for both the 1000 Guineas and The Oaks. She had several training setbacks however, including a knee injury on the flight from Dubai to England and missed the early part of the season. She eventually made her reappearance in the Ribblesdale Stakes over one and a half miles at Royal Ascot on 22 June in which she was ridden by the Puerto Rican jockey John R. Velazquez and started 7/2 joint-favourite alongside the Michael Stoute-trained Interlude. After tracking the leaders she moved into second place in the straight but could make no further progress and was beaten one and a quarter length by Miletrian. Four weeks later the filly was sent to Ireland for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh.

Oleksandr Mykolayovych Hladkyi (, born 24 August 1987) is a Ukrainian football forward who plays for Chornomorets Odesa. He has also appeared for the Ukraine national team. His last name is variously transliterated into English as Hladkiy, Gladkiy and Gladkyy.
Club career
Kharkiv
Hladkyi began his career in Metalist Kharkiv's football academy, and soon after, the young player was invited to another professional club from the Kharkiv, FC Kharkiv. Under direction of coach Volodymyr Bessonov, Hladkyi became a regular player for the club and soon established himself as one of the best strikers in the league. His first fame came in the 2006–07 season, when after scoring 13 goals to finish as the Ukrainian league's top scorer.
Shakhtar Donetsk
After this success, Hladkyi attracted the notice of giants Shakhtar Donetsk, and on 8 June 2007, he signed a five-year deal worth €2.5 million with the club. On his Shakhtar debut, a friendly match, he scored the winning goal. He scored two goals in another friendly.
On 7 May 2008, in the Ukrainian Cup final, during which he scored and also received a red card, Hladkyi earned the first trophy in his career when Shakhtar defeated rivals Dynamo Kyiv 2–0.
Hladkyi won the Premier League with Shakhtar that season, but fell one goal short of making Ukrainian Premier League history by being the top goalscorer for two consecutive years. However, with the addition of strikers Yevhen Seleznyov and Marcelo Moreno, and with coach Mircea Lucescu using only one forward in a 4-5-1 formation, Hladkyi had difficulty keeping his spot in the starting line-up or even a place on the bench, leaving his future in doubt . After 10 league games with only 1 win, Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu started Hladkyi, who scored in the 28th minute in a 3–0 win over Chornomorets Odessa. Mircea gave Hladkyi another starting opportunity due to an injury to Luiz Adriano, and he scored the third goal in Shakhtar's 4–2 win over FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih. Hladkyi scored a winner for Shakhtar against Olexandria in the 93rd minute in a Ukrainian Cup quarter final, although he also injured his own side's second-choice goalkeeper Rustam Khudzhamov during a collision in the Shakhtar penalty area. He scored his first two UEFA Champions League goals in a historic 3–2 victory in Spain over F.C. Barcelona, ending the latter's streak of 20 games without defeat. As a result of the win, Shakhtar collected more points in the group stage than ever before (9).
Unable to gain a regular place at Shakhtar Donetsk, he transferred to Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on 17 August 2010.
Shakhtar Donetsk return
In May 2014, Hladkyi departed for FC Shakhtar Donetsk, signing a two-year contract.
Dynamo Kyiv
Upon the expiration of his contract with Shakhtar Donetsk, Hladkyi signed a 3-year contract as a free agent with the Ukrainian champions, Dynamo Kyiv, on 23 May 2016.
Karpaty Lviv
On 2 March 2017 it was officially announced that Hladkyi is being loaned to Karpaty Lviv. It was his second stint in the club over his career. In July of 2017 Dynamo has given Hladkyi a status of free agent and he signed a full-fledged contract with Karpaty. While playing for Karpaty in April of 2017 he was recognized as a player of the month in the Ukrainian Premier League.
Turkish Super League
Before signing his first contract with foreign club in August of 2018 and moving to Turkey, Hladkyi earlier in 2018 spent his time playing for Chornomorets Odesa that struggled to stay in the Ukrainian premiers.
International career
Oleksandr Hladkyi was a regular member of the Ukraine national under-21 football team and scored 6 goals in 12 games. On 22 August 2007, he made his debut for the senior Ukraine national football team in a friendly against Uzbekistan and scored the opening goal, his only goal in 11 matches for Ukraine's senior squad. Since 2007, he has been called up to the main squad by Oleg Blokhin and then Oleksiy Mykhailychenko, but has not appeared for Ukraine since 2015.

The Ökumenischer Kirchentag 2021 (Ecumenical Church Assembly) was the third ecumenical convention of lay Christians of different denominations in Germany. It was held in Frankfurt, Hesse from 13 to 16 May 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event happened mostly digitally, with only a few events actually taking place with live audience in Frankfurt.
History
The first Ökumenischer Kirchentag was held as a national ecumenical event, in the spirit of the Protestant Kirchentag and the Catholic Katholikentag, both a national convention of lay Christians in Germany held every other year, alternating. The first ecumenical Kirchentag was held in Berlin in 2003. The was in Munich in 2010.
Im November 2011, a synod of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau (EKHN) declared to the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag (DEKT) to be willing to host a Kirchentag in Frankfurt in 2021. The city had been the location for the Protestant Kirchentag four times before, in 1956, 1975, 1987 and 2001. The EKHN-affiliated churches reserved money for the purpose in 2012. If the Diocese of Limburg was willing, the EKHN supported an ecumenical event. After and the Bishop of Limburg, Georg Bätzing invited to support an ecumenical event, the decision for Frankfurt as location for the third Ökumenischer Kirchentag was made in November 2016, at the closing ceremony of the 101st Katholikentag in Münster. An official invitation to a third event in Frankfurt was given in 2018 by the two church bodies, who formed a joint planning unit. They expected more than 100.000 participants. An association, "3. Ökumenischer Kirchentag Frankfurt 2021", was founded then, responsible for legal, financial and organisational matters.
The joint presidency (Gemeinsames Präsidium) responsible for the content planning first met in December 2018, formed by 43 persons elected by the churches and other organisations. The Protestant president was , and the Catholic president . An office was formed in Frankfurt in mid-2019, to coordinate the preparations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an announcement was given on 22 September 2020 that the Kirchentag would take place in modified form to conform with the necessary hygiene concept. On 16 December 2020, the presidency decided to shorten the event by one day and to avoid mass gatherings completely, organise the event mostly digitally, with only a few events actually taking place with live audience and participation in Frankfurt. The event was to be framed by an opening service on 13 May (Ascension Day) and a closing service on Sunday, 16 May. Saturday was supposed to present a focused, completely digital program. Saturday evening was planned for smaller services in local churches, "ökumenisch sensibel gestaltete" (with sensitivity for ecumenical aspects).
Theme and program
Limperg and Sternberg announced the motto for the event 26 October 2019: "schaut hin" (look), taken form the Gospel of Mark.
The program was structured around four topics:
Glaube, Spiritualität, Kirche (faith, spirituality, church)
Lebensräume, Lebenswelten, Zusammenleben (life areas, worlds of life, living together)
Schöpfung, Frieden, Weltgemeinschaft (creation, peace, world community)
Wirtschaft, Macht, Verantwortung (business, power, responsibility)
Oratorio Eins
On Friday, 14 May, the world premiere of the ecumenical oratorio Eins (One) was performed as a livestream. It was commissioned for the event, with texts by Eugen Eckert and Helmut Schlegel, and music by Bernhard Kießig and Peter Reulein.

Women in San Marino are European women who live in or are from the Republic of San Marino. Sammarinese women currently share almost all social and political rights with men in San Marino.
Political rights
San Marino introduced women's suffrage following the 1957 constitutional crisis known as Fatti di Rovereta. Sammarinese women received the right to vote in 1960. They received the right to hold political office in 1973.
Citizenship rights
Before the 21st century, citizenship laws discriminated significantly against women. In a 1982 referendum, the women of San Marino did not win the right to retain their Sammarinese citizenship if they married male foreigners (19,000 Sammarinese voters voted to not abolish the 1928 law that striped Sammarinese women of Sammarinese citizenship if they married foreigners); as a result of losing Sammarinese citizenship, the women also lost the right to vote, to work, to own property, to reside in, and to inherit property in the Republic of San Marino. These laws were later changed; in 2000 the parliament passed a new citizenship law abolishing the previous citizenship law, under which a woman who married a foreigner could not transmit citizenship to her husband or children; and in 2004, new laws stipulated that all women who were San Marino citizens transmitted their own citizenship to their children at birth.
Violence against women
In 2008, San Marino passed Law No.97 of 20 June 2008 on Prevention and Repression of Violence Against Women and Gender Violence.

The Journey's End is a 1921 American silent drama film directed by Hugo Ballin and starring Mabel Ballin, George Bancroft and Wyndham Standing.
Film
The film has no subtitles, which was unusual for a silent film. Its marketing made note of the fact that it was the first serious drama to not use subtitles. This distinguished it from The Old Swimmin' Hole which came out earlier in 1921 but had a simpler plot.

The Endicott Estate is a mansion built in the early twentieth century, located at 656 East Street in Dedham, Massachusetts “situated on a 15-acre panorama of lush green lawn that is punctuated by stately elm, spruce and weeping willow trees.” It was built by Henry Bradford Endicott, founder of the Endicott Johnson Corporation, and donated to the Town by his adopted stepdaughter, Katherine. After she died it was briefly owned by the state and intended to be used as the official residence of the governor, but was quickly returned to the Town. Today it is used for a variety of civic events and is rented out for private parties.
Construction
On January 12, 1904, Henry Endicott's home burnt to the ground while he and his family were away. The fire department was not able to get to the estate in time as they were dealing with three other fires simultaneously, including one at the fire house, and deep snow. The fire was discovered around 10 p.m. by a caretaker who lived in the house. It took several hours to extinguish the flames. The house and furnishings were valued at more than $15,000.
It is said that "Henry took the burning of the homestead as a divine command to rebuild, and rebuild he did, although not without incident.” He cleared the ashes away and built a new homestead on the parcel, today known as the Endicott Estate, and bought a new fire truck for the Town.
The three-story house he constructed has nine bathrooms, eight bedrooms, a library, a music room, a ballroom, a mirrored parlor, a butler's kitchen, a linen room, and servants' quarters. When a radiator burst during the construction, "causing a raging river to crash down the main stairway," he tore down one end of the house and burned a pile of beautiful wall paneling, parquet floors, and elegant woodwork, much to the dismay of his neighbors. An additional 70' was then added onto the house. Construction cost $60,000. A gardener's cottage was built across the street at 132 Sanderson St.
When complete, it included "carved moldings that couldn't be reproduced at any cost," large all marble bathrooms, "intricate wall sconces," and a pipe organ. Katherine would never allow a tree, no matter how old, to be cut down.
Donation to Dedham
When he died in 1920 he left the building to his wife, who in turn left it to her daughter Katherine in 1944. In 1955, Katherine wrote a letter to the Board of Selectmen, indicating that she intended to leave the house and grounds, then-valued at $600,000, to the Town when she died. At the time, it was speculated that it may become the site of a new high school, swimming pool, and town hall.
Katherine, who lived with a staff of 12 on the Estate, died in 1967 without any children and willed the land and the estate to the town for "public educational purposes, public recreational purposes, or other exclusively public purposes." At the time the "town didn't know quite what to do with it," leaving them with "a most pleasant problem." The several schools that were in need of construction in 1955 had already been built by this point.
Governor's mansion
Not knowing what else to do, Town Meeting voted to offer it to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to be used as the Massachusetts Governor's Mansion after going to Probate Court to change the terms of the will. The state agreed to pay $160,000, plus $20,000 a year to partially recoup the taxes that would be lost on it. The year before Katherine died, taxes were $50,000.
The effort to purchase the Estate was a bipartisan effort, with Dedham's Republican representative, Harold Rosen, and Boston's Gerald Morissey, a Democrat, filing the legislation to take the Estate. The chairmen of both state parties issued statements supporting the purchase. Governor John Volpe took the title to the 25 room estate, which became his first choice after touring it in May, in a ceremony on December 7, 1967. The public was invited to attend a reception where Volpe's wife, Jennie, chatted with residents. Locals believed the town would become "the second capital" of Massachusetts. The Volpes sold their home in Winchester, Massachusetts in early-1968.
Renovations to the house were needed, which was described as "a mixture of elegance and impracticality" for the beautiful construction but lack of dishwasher, garbage disposal, and electric wiring that could not handle air conditioning. It was said that it was a "sprawling, fascinating house that needs a lot of the most careful kind of renovation." A five-member commission was created to oversee the work, and William G. Perry of Perry, Dean, Hepburn, and Stuart was hired to develop the plans.
Original estimates ran around $100,000, and the commission asked for an initial $300,000 appropriation to "convert it from a home to a spacious place for the state to entertain." The kitchen was to be updated, and the dining room expanded to seat at least 60 people, much more than the original 16. The commission planned to install air conditioning and to furnish and decorate the home with historic pieces from the Museum of Fine Arts and other wealthy citizens. While the home had multiple bathrooms, it only had one shower, a "a cocoon-like metal contraption that sprays water from all directions" with undependable water temperature.
Parking for 100 cars was planned, a helicopter landing pad was also discussed, as was a gym and swimming pool. The caretaker's home was to be converted into a permanent residence for five or six Massachusetts state troopers who would provide security. An additional staff of five to 12 people, possibly inmates from state prisons, to run the house was considered. A fence and additional landscaping was also planned. Plans alone cost $20,000.
Jennie Volpe, who was made an honorary commission member to provide "realistic advice," wanted an upstairs workroom so that her husband would not disturb her while she was in bed, as well as a chapel. It soon became apparent that it would be cheaper to build a brand-new mansion than to remodel the estate to Jennie Volpe's "lavish taste" and "crazy notions," including ripping out the "incomparable mahogany and sycamore wood paneling" and replacing it with pastel plaster. The Massachusetts General Court denied a request for an additional $385,000.
By May 1968, cost estimates ran as high as $1 million, and the Commonwealth gave the Estate back to the Town in 1969. In his inaugural address, new Governor Francis W. Sargent said "Massachusetts, in 1969, cannot afford the luxury of a million dollar Governor's Mansion."
Modern usage
The Endicott Estate is now used to host a multitude of events, both formal and informal. This ranges from “weddings, receptions, and cocktail parties, to business meetings, art shows and more”, such as the Annual BSAAC Antique Car Show, Car Corral & Trading Bee Family Fun Day. The mansion's main floor houses a Grand Ballroom, which is “framed by Ionic columns and duel balustrades, adds a classical touch to holiday parties, art shows, concerts and seminars.” The lower level of the structure is complete with a library, dining room, mirrored parlor, music room, as well as a fully functional kitchen. There are also six rooms on the upper level, which are mostly used for workshops and business meetings.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. What was a nine car garage on the Mt. Vernon Street side of the property today serves as the Endicott branch of the Dedham Public Library. A fire destroyed the barn, which was built in 1932, in the early morning hours of November 16, 2019.
A fundraising group, the Friends of the Endicott Estate, was founded by Virginia Schortmann. Another organization, the Katherine Endicott Foundation, was founded in the 2000s.

Craven Laboratories was an American research company based in Austin, Texas.
History
Craven Laboratories was the first chemical testing lab charged in the United States following establishment of the Food and Drug Administration's Good Laboratory Practices regulations.
Scientific fraud
Investigation
The Environmental Protection Agency announced on March 1, 1991, that it was investigating Craven Laboratories for "allegedly falsifying test data used by chemical firms to win EPA approval of pesticides." The investigation was coordinated by the EPA Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, DOJ Environmental Crimes Division, and the United States Attorney.
Indictments
In 1991, a federal grand jury indicted the laboratory's owner, Don Allen Craven, with felony counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, making false statements, concealment of material facts, and obstructing EPA proceedings. The head of the Quality Assurance Unit was also charged, as were several lab technicians.
Scope
At least 48 chemicals were approved on the basis of Craven's fraudulent research, 28 of which remained on the market in New Zealand as of 1993. In total, the FDA reported that Craven performed safety analysis for 262 companies.
Aftermath
Following conclusion of the EPA's investigation, the Department of Justice announced on February 25, 1994, that the president of Craven Laboratories and fourteen of its former employees were adjudged guilty for the falsification of research data.
Monsanto has stated the Craven Labs investigation was started by the EPA after a pesticide industry task force discovered irregularities, that the studies had been repeated, and that Roundup's EPA certification does not now use any studies from Craven Labs.
Legal cases
Following Craven Laboratory's investigation, 11 multinational corporations filed suit against Craven for losses secondary to its misconduct.

Tinsley & Hull was a based cotton brokerage in Savannah, Georgia, USA, which became insolvent in 1913. The company exported cotton and phosphate rock.
Fleming Davies Tinsley, a native of Milledgeville, Georgia, an executive with the firm, was tried and found not guilty of larceny in the aftermath of the business' failure. He was accused of stealing 275 bales of cotton valued at $22,000 from the Savannah Trust Company.
Another principal figure in the corporation was Daniel B. Hull. He purchased a membership in the New York Cotton Exchange from Alan Bond, a member of the New York Stock Exchange, in May 1909.

The Foucault knife-edge test is an optical test developed 150 years ago to accurately measure the shape of concave curved mirrors. It is commonly used by amateur telescope makers for figuring primary mirrors in reflecting telescopes. It uses a relatively simple, inexpensive apparatus compared to other testing techniques.
Overview
The Foucault knife-edge test was described in 1858 by French physicist Léon Foucault as a way to measure conic shapes of optical mirrors. It measures mirror surface dimensions by reflecting light into a knife edge at or near the mirror's centre of curvature. In doing so, it only needs a tester which in its most basic 19th century form consists of a light bulb, a piece of tinfoil with a pinhole in it, and a razor blade to create the knife edge. The testing device is adjustable along the X-axis (knife cut direction) across the Y-axis (optical axis), and is usually equipped with measurable adjustment to 0.001 inch (25 µm) or better along lines parallel to the optical axis. The test can measure errors in a mirror's curvature to fractions of wavelengths of light (or Angstroms, millionths of an inch, or nanometers).
Foucault test basics
Foucault testing is commonly used by amateur telescope makers for figuring primary mirrors in reflecting telescopes. The mirror to be tested is placed vertically in a stand. The Foucault tester is set up at the distance of the mirror's radius of curvature (radius R is twice the focal length.) with the pinhole to one side of the centre of curvature (a short vertical slit parallel to the knife edge can be used instead of the pinhole). The tester is adjusted so that the returning beam from the pinhole light source is interrupted by the knife edge.
Viewing the mirror from behind the knife-edge shows a pattern on the mirror surface. If the mirror surface is part of a perfect sphere, the mirror appears evenly lighted across the entire surface. If the mirror is spherical but with defects such as bumps or depressions, the defects appear greatly magnified in height. If the surface is paraboloidal, the mirror usually looks like a doughnut or lozenge although the exact appearance depends on the exact position of the knife edge.
It is possible to calculate how closely the mirror surface resembles a perfect parabola by placing a Couder mask, Everest pin stick (after A. W. Everest) or other zone marker over the mirror. A series of measurements with the tester, finding the radii of curvature of the zones along the optical axis of the mirror (Y-axis). These data are then reduced and graphed against an ideal parabolic curve.
Other testing techniques
A number of other tests are used which measure the mirror at the center of curvature. Some telescope makers use a variant of the Foucault test called a Ronchi test that replaces the knife edge with a grating (similar to a very coarse diffraction grating) comprising fine parallel wires, an etching on a glass plate, a photograph negative or computer printed transparency. Ronchi test patterns are matched to those of standard mirrors or generated by computer.
Other variants of the Foucault test include the Gaviola or Caustic test which can measure mirrors of fast f/ratio more accurately than the Foucault test which is limited to about (λ/8) wavelength accuracy on small and medium-sized mirrors. The Caustic test is capable of measuring larger mirrors and achieving a (λ/20) wave peak to valley accuracy by using a testing stage which is adjusted from side to side so as to measure each zone of each side of the mirror from the center of its curvature.
The Dall null test uses a plano-convex lens placed a short distance in front of the pinhole. With the correct positioning of the lens, a parabolic mirror appears flat under testing instead of doughnut-shaped so testing is much easier and zonal measurements are not needed.
There are a number of interferometric tests which have been used including the Michelson-Twyman and the Michelson method, both published in 1918, the Lenouvel method and the Fizeau method. Interferometric testing has been made more affordable in recent years by affordable lasers, digital cameras (such as webcams), and computers, but remains primarily an industrial methodology.

At age fourteen he asked to change role to goalkeeper, and after a year of this position he was spotted by FC Nantes recruiter Vincent Bracigliano. He made his league debut for Nantes on 25 February 2008 in the Ligue 2 match at Sedan.
In August 2009 he joined Ligue 1 side FC Valenciennes on a season-long loan, with an option to buy. Despite being signed as a third, or rotating second-choice, he made 17 league starts for Valenciennes during the season, due to a serious injury to first-choice Nicolas Penneteau. He returned to Nantes after his loan, and was first choice during the 2010–11 Ligue 2 season.
In July 2011 he made a million-euro transfer to AS Nancy in Ligue 1. He made his debut for the club in the fifth match of the 2011–12 Ligue 1 season, on 11 September 2011, in a 0–0 draw against Auxerre. He went on to make
At the end of the 2012–13 season, with Nancy relegated to Ligue 2, he returned to Ligue 1 on a season-long loan with Guingamp. He returned to Nancy and went on to play 139 league games for the club, including 36 in the 2015–16 Ligue 2 championship season, before leaving at the end of the 2018–19 season, when his contract expired.
After six months without a club, he joined US Boulogne in January 2020.
International career
N'Dy Assembé was first called up to the Cameroon national football team in December 2009, as part of the 23-man squad for 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. He retained his position for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and made his international debut in a warm-up friendly against Georgia on 25 May 2010.

Amegilla quadrifasciata, the white-banded digger bee, is a species of bee belonging to the family Apidae subfamily Apinae.
Distribution
These bees have a wide distribution ranging from the Canary Islands in the west to Japan in the east. They are present in most central and southern Europe, in central Asia and in North Africa.
Description
Amegilla quadrifasciata grows up to long, The males are similar to the females. The thorax is orange-brown and densely hairy, while the abdomen alternate black and white transversal stripes. The face has a whitish drawing. The third antennal segment is about as long as the three following segments together. Scopa is white, but black at the front edge. Metatarsus on the hind legs is black haired. They have very large compound eyes and simple eyes between their antennae. Their long proboscises allow them to sip nectar from a variety of flowers and the hairy hind legs facilitate the collection and transport of pollen.
Biology
Adults can be encountered from March to June, mainly feeding on Fabaceae (Alhagi kirghisorum, Medicago sativa), Lamiaceae (Ocimum species, Salvia species),Boraginaceae and Primulaceae species. They are solitary bees and do not form colonies, every female takes care of her own larvae. The females lay their eggs in nests in tunnels usually excavated by themselves in loose soils. In the cells they store pollen and nectar as food for the larvae. The larvae pupate in Autumn and emerge as adult bees in March.

Thomas Montgomery Adair (June 15, 1913 – May 24, 1988) was an American songwriter, composer, and screenwriter.
Biography
Adair was born on 15 June 1913, in Newton, Kansas, where his father owned a clothing store: he was the only child of William Adair and Madge Cochran.
Around 1923 the family moved to Los Angeles, where Tom Adair attended Los Angeles Junior College (now Los Angeles City College). In his early career he worked as a complaints clerk at the local power company, while writing poetry and song lyrics in his spare time.
In 1941, Adair met Matt Dennis in a club and the duo began writing songs together. Adair's song-writing career took him to New York during the 1940s where he penned several Broadway hits, and worked with Tommy Dorsey and Frank Sinatra. He later returned to Los Angeles and worked with writer James B. Allardice on scripts for sit-coms.
In 1949, Adair married Frances Adelle Jeffords; in later life, they worked together on songs and teleplays for Disney.
They had 4 children.
Career
After meeting Matt Dennis in 1940, Adair started working with him, moving to New York when the duo were hired by Tommy Dorsey. Adair and Dennis wrote numerous songs for Dorsey, Bing Crosby, and Dinah Shore and penned Frank Sinatra's hit "Let's Get Away from It All." In 1942, Matt Dennis joined the Army Air Corps. Adair moved on to work with Dick Uhl and hit song "In the Blue of the Evening" with Alfonso d'Artega. About the collaboration among Adair, Dennis, and Sinatra, Vanity Fair magazine said "Sinatra's first recording away from Dorsey took place at RCA's Los Angeles studios on the afternoon of Monday, January 19, 1942. He had chosen the song for his attempt as a soloist, a ballad, naturally, all dripping with romance: it was 'The Night We Called It a Day,' by these new kids Matt Dennis and Tom Adair, who'd written 'Let's Get Away from It All' and 'Violets for Your Furs.' "
From June 1944, Adair worked with composer Gordon Jenkins in writing a complete score every week for the Auto-Lite radio show, which featured singer Dick Haymes.
He wrote many hit songs, including "Let's Get Away From It All", "Everything Happens to Me", "In The Blue of Evening", "Will You Still Be Mine?", "Violets for Your Furs", "The Night We Called It A Day", "The Skyscraper Blues", "A Home-Sweet-Home In The Army", "How Will I Know My Love?", "Sing A Smiling Song", "Paul Bunyan", "There's No You", and "Weep No More".
In 1949, Adair wrote the lyrics for the Broadway production of Along Fifth Avenue. It ran for 180 performances at the Broadhurst Theatre, with the original cast including Carol Bruce, Jackie Gleason, George S. Irving, Hank Ladd, Donald Richards and Nancy Walker.
After the show closed, Adair returned to Los Angeles, working for Disney in the 1950s.
In 1958, Adair first met James B. Allardice while working on "The Ann Sothern Show" (1958); he wrote the music while Allardice was a writer on the show. Adair went on to have a successful partnership working on the sit-com, "Hazel" (1961); however, they also collaborated in the writing on two episodes of "Hazel": "A Replacement For Phoebe" (which aired on 1961-10-02) and "Harold's Good Fortune" (which aired on 1961-11-30). Later the two collaborated on many other shows, including "My Three Sons", "F Troop", "Hogan's Heroes", "I Dream of Jeannie" and "Gomer Pyle". The partnership lasted until Allardice's death in 1966.
A late triumph was the lyrics for an NBC cartoon special, "Babar Comes to America" (1971) with John Scott Trotter.
Death
The Adairs retired to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1984. On 24 May 1988, Tom died at the age of 74.

Thanhoffer Enrico (Munico), was born in Como (Italy) in the year 1965. He is an architect and artist.
Early life
A resume full training after graduating in architecture at the Polytechnic University of Milan earned an MASTER at the POST Oikos University, (funded and recognized by the European Community FSE) and the title of "Expert in Executive Planning".
Career
After an experience at the Public Administrations of over 10 years, he finally opened his studio.
It deals with architectural design. It presents a variety of publications.
The art doesn't consist of representing new things, but in representing with news.
A philosophy that has brought Enrico Thanhoffer to match his great passion for painting with his profession of architect.
Two world that are apparently distant, but that show a common denominator: creativity.
For several years now, Enrico Thanhoffer is also an appreciated painter, awarded with several prizes and winner of some competitions, as well as inventor of an innovative pictorial technique. His paintings, a mix between figurative geometric and an abstract that calls to mind the famous rooms of Hilbert are realized using the computer.
After having "baptized" this new artistic wave as Globismo, that means the skill to let the abstract dialogue with the figurative, Enrico Thanhoffer, known as Munico in the art world (acronym of " unified method to build", as additional witness of his "real" profession), introduced the philosophy that stands at the basis of this new artistic manifesto also inside his architecture.

News and Letters Committees is a small revolutionary-socialist organization in the United States.
History
Founded in 1955 by Raya Dunayevskaya, the Committees trace their origin to a split in the Correspondence Publishing Committee, which had been led by C. L. R. James and Dunayevskaya. The organization publishes a newspaper, News & Letters, edited from 1955 to 1983 by Charles Denby (born Simon Owens), that tries to unite activist struggles to transform the world with what it calls the "philosophy of liberation" of Karl Marx and Marxist Humanism.
Views
News and Letters Committees is committed to the abolition of capitalism, the establishment of what it calls "a new human society," and women's liberation. It supports freedom struggles of workers, African-Americans and other people of color, women, and youth, and it opposes heterosexism against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals. It has opposed both "private" capitalism and the former Stalinist states, which it regarded as state-capitalist, and has opposed the imperialism of both. In recent years, it has opposed what it regards as imperialist wars waged by the U.S. (and its allies) in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Islamic fundamentalism and non-state terrorism. Arguing that a new, human society is the only viable alternative to permanent war and terrorism, it supports the struggles of what it regards as democratic, secular, anti-imperialist organizations of women and workers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Partly as a response to the past decade's movement against global capitalism and its slogan, "Another World is Possible," News and Letters Committees calls for and seeks to help develop what it calls a "philosophically grounded alternative to capitalism," rooted in the theory of post-capitalist human development that Marx sketched in his 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program. The organization has also paid particular attention to the rights of prisoners in the United States and published a short book, Voices from Within the Prison Walls, on the topic in 1998.
Organization
There are News and Letters Committees in a small number of cities in the United States, including Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, New York City, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Unusually for a Marxist organisation, the groups are freely associated, and work together through a decentralized committee.
Publications
The group's major publication is News & Letters.
Members of News and Letters Committees occasionally contribute to other political journals with somewhat related outlooks, such as New Politics, and to theoretical journals. In addition, one of the two Co-National Organizers, Olga Domanski, is listed as an editor of Lexington Books' Raya Dunayevskaya Series in Marxism and Humanism, which includes books by Dunayevskaya and others, including The Power of Negativity, a posthumous collection of Dunayevskaya's writings on the dialectic in G. W. F. Hegel and in Marx.

"Hold on to the Good Things" is a song by American singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin appearing in the film Stuart Little 2 as the second end-credit song. It was written by Holly Knight and Roxanne Seeman for the film and included in the soundtrack album, released by Epic Soundtrax, Sony Music, on July 19, 2002.
Background
Bonnie Greenberg and Christy Gerhardt, music supervisors for Stuart Little 2, sent Roxanne Seeman the script for Stuart Little 2, asking whether she would write a song. Roxanne Seeman wrote the song with Holly Knight.
"Hold on to the Good Things" was written for a montage scene in the movie where the family is in the dining room. During a long period of editing where changes were made to scenes in the movie, the recording of the song was put on hold. The song was chosen out of 100 songs and recorded by Shawn Colvin with Marc Tanner producing, the week the film locked and placed as the second end-credit song, following Celine Dion's "I'm Alive".
Writing and composition
The song is written in the key of B-flat major with a lively, swing tempo. The lyrics are uplifting and reassuring, following the movie's themes of friendship and love.
After Glen Brunman of Sony Music Soundtrax heard "Hold on to the Good Things", the lyrics in the chorus were revised: the words "silvery lining" from the last line of the second verse going into the chorus, was repeated as "silver lining" in the second line of the chorus, replacing "kindness".
During the recording session, Shawn Colvin recorded both lyric versions. The original unedited version was used in the film. An edited version with the lyric revision in the chorus appears on the soundtrack. Ken Karman was the music editor of the film.
Critical reception
Reviewing the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack William Ruhlmann of All Music described the song's "sunny sentiments".

Zou Yuchen (; born July 5, 1996) is a Chinese male professional basketball player who currently plays for Bayi Rockets in the Chinese Basketball Association.
Career
Zou Yuchen was born in Anshan, Liaoning to a basketball family. His parents were players from the Bayi Basketball Team, now known as the Bayi Rockets. While he was a child, Zou was bulkier than many of his peers and had the build of a basketball player. His family immigrated from Anshan to Zhuhai during his childhood, but there was not a professional basketball team in those days. Dai Yixin, the president of Shenzhen Sports School who once recruited Yi Jianlian to the school, introduced Zou to Shenzhen Sports School, but Zou's parents refused the offer. Dai had no choice but to request the famous basketball coach Ma Yuenan to persuade Zou's parents. Finally, Zou's parents agreed that Zou would go to the sports school. Zou formally started his basketball career in September 2008.
Zou started as a member of the Juvenile Group in Liaoning's basketball team. In 2009, he became a member of Bayi Youth Basketball Team. In March 2016, he was chosen to play in China men's national basketball team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Since the early 2000s, there has been a steady increase in violent extremism and terrorism across the African continent. In West Africa, terrorism and violent extremism have had a devastating impact in terms of the loss of life, displacement of people, loss of livelihood and development.
Violent extremism continues to spread throughout West Africa, including in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Between 2016 and 2019, the Sahel saw a record number of deaths, with violence linked to violent extremism organizations doubling every year in West Africa.
West African governments have responded to this threat, both individually and regionally. International support has also been garnered from countries such as the USA and France. However the violent extremism continues to grow- both as a result of factors intrinsic to the region, as well as due forged relationships with international violent extremist groups.
By Country
Burkina Faso
Main Article: Terrorism in Burkina Faso
The year 2015 saw a surge in instability and insecurity in Burkina Faso. Since then, the country has experienced an unprecedented number of coups, as well as a dramatic rise in violent extremist events.
Events related to violent extremism rose from 3 in 2015 to 137 in 2018, with an undiminished upward trend. In the Sahel, armed attacks on civilians are estimated to have displaced nearly 3 million people, 1 million of whom have been displaced since January of 2019.
Mali
Main Article: Mali War
The 2012 Tuareg rebellion in Mali precipitated a general climate of insecurity in the country. Mali frequently experiences violent attacks from radical Islamist groups.
Nigeria
Main Article: Boko Haram Insurgency
Since the Boko Haram insurgency began in 2009, it has resulted in an estimated 2.5 million internally displaced people, over 200,000 Nigerian nationals seeking refuge in other countries.
Niger
Main Article: Jihadist Insurgency in Niger
Beginning in 2015, Niger has faced Islamist insurgencies from parties affiliated with al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic state, as well as Boko Haram.
Government Response
Ivory Coast
In June 2021 the Ivorian government in collaboration with France, inaugurated the International Counter-Terrorism Academy in Jacqueville, Côte d'Ivoire. The aim of the academy is to train soldiers across West Africa in combating the surge of violent extremism expanding from the Sahel.
Intergovernmental
In 2013, ECOWAS passed the counter-terrorism strategy and implementation plan. This however was not followed up by implementation.
In 2019, ECOWAS adopted the 2020-2024 Action Plan, whose priority areas range from pooling of efforts and coordination of counter-terrorism initiatives to promoting inter-community dialogue and preventing violent extremism. There however exist a number of hurdles in the way of implementation.
International Support
France
Main Article: Operation Barkhane
Since early 2013, the French military has had active forces in the Sahel region to combat radical Islamist groups.
This operation is gradually being drawn to a close however- France cites a conflict in counter-terrorism tactics with governments in the Sahel, while politicians and residents of the Sahel demonstrate skepticism as to France's intentions, due to possible colonial associations.
USA
As part of an intervention in Niger, the American military has been deploying special forces and drones to support the Nigerien government in their counter-terrorism operations.
Continued Spread
The extremist forces from the Sahel are progressively expanding into littoral states in West Africa, such as Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, and Ghana. Benin and Côte d'Ivoire have begun to experience such extremist attacks within their borders.
Rear Admiral Milton Sands of the US Special Operations Command Africa, noted the deliberate long-term expansion of radical Islamism from the Sahel into coastal West Africa. He described these groups as marrying into populations, as well as providing government-like services to the communities

The LeapFrog Epic (styled as LeapFrog epic) is an Android-based mini-tablet computer produced and marketed by LeapFrog Enterprises. Released in 2015, the Epic is LeapFrog's first device to run on Android; most of LeapFrog's mobile computing devices for children run on a customized Ångström Linux distribution.
Name
Despite being sold alongside the LeapPad Explorer line of tablets, the device is not marketed as a LeapPad model and is instead referred to in official literature as the LeapFrog Epic, the latter moniker being a backronym for "explore, play, imagine and create", in reference to the Epic's educational nature.
Features
Hardware
The Epic has a TFT-LCD touchscreen, Wi-Fi capability, a 1.3 GHz ARM Cortex-A7 MediaTek MT8127 processor, a 2.0 MP rear-facing camera and a 2.0 MP front-facing camera. As with other devices and toys marketed by the company, the Epic is aimed for children ages 3–9, and like the lower-end LeapPad Explorer line of tablets, edutainment games and applications made specifically for the device automatically adjust to account for the child's grade level. The Epic lacks a cartridge slot, thus making existing cartridge-based software for the LeapPad incompatible; a number of games for the LeapPad series were however ported to the tablet. The Epic also comes standard with a capacitive stylus, replacing the finger in situations where precision is needed, or in apps designed for use with the pen, and a silicone protective case for added shock resistance. The case, which comes in either lime green or pink, can be removed by the user, allowing access to the device's microSD slot.
An updated variant of the Epic called Academy Edition was released in 2017. It is essentially the same hardware as the original Epic, albeit with a redesigned silicone protective bumper and updated firmware with access to the LeapFrog Academy program. Another updated variant called the LeapPad Academy was released in 2019, which, like the Epic Academy Edition before it, came with access to the LeapFrog Academy program and a silicone bumper with a built-in kickstand.
Software
The Epic runs on the Android KitKat operating system, overlaid with LeapFrog's proprietary Kids Launcher UI with support for multiple user profiles and parental controls limiting the time a child can use the device along with content which can be accessed; an unrestricted parent mode is also available along with the stock Android web browser. The initial firmware release only came with support for applications and content purchased from LeapFrog's own App Center, though an update was later made available allowing apps bought or downloaded from the Amazon App Store to be installed.
By default the Epic does not come bundled with Google Play services installed, limiting app selection to the aforementioned App Center and Amazon App Store, along with APK packages sideloaded from outside sources; this can be worked around through rooting the device and copying Google Play components to the system partition, or flashing Google apps through a custom recovery such as TWRP.
While the Epic has not received a major operating system update since release, it can unofficially run Android 7.1.2 Nougat through a port of LineageOS 14.1 made by members of the xda-developers community.
Reception
Accolades
The Epic was released to mostly positive reception, earning awards from parenting and educational organizations for its design and features. The device also won the 2017 Award for Best Tablet from the children's media journal Kidscreen.
Critical reception
Peter Jenkinson of TrustedReviews gave the tablet four out of five stars, praising the form factor and user experience, but bemoaned the downloadable educational games' cost in comparison to apps available on mainstream content platforms. Laptop Mag'''s Henry T. Casey was less enthusiastic, criticizing the LCD screen quality, the device's weight and performance, stating "the waiting and sluggishness may try the patience of young children", but otherwise remarked the included software and battery life. Jim Martin of PC Advisor'' was similarly critical of the Epic, criticizing the hardware and viewed the bundled software as having "limited educational value", instead recommending Amazon's Kids Edition Fire tablet.

Cockermouth Town Hall is a municipal structure in Market Street, Cockermouth, Cumbria, England. The structure, which is the meeting place of Cockermouth Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.
History
The first municipal building in the town was a moot hall in the Market Place which dated back at least to the 17th century. After it became dilapidated, civic leaders decided to demolish it and to commission a new building on the north side of the Market Place in 1829. The new building, which became known as the courthouse, was financed by public subscription and built using materials which had been recovered from the Moot Hall and donated by the local landowner, the Earl of Egremont. Following significant population growth, largely associated with the status of Cockermouth as a market town, the area became an urban district in 1894. The courthouse served as the town hall for the new council as well the local judicial facility.
By the early 1930s, in the context of its increasing responsibilities, the council was seeking more substantial facilities. An opportunity arose to acquire an old Wesleyan chapel in Market Street. The chapel had been designed in the neoclassical style, built with a stucco finish at a cost of £1,800 and been completed in 1841. It was extended in 1893, but following the Methodist Union of 1932, the congregations of the local Methodist chapels in the town decided to consolidate their places of worship at a new chapel in Lorton Road. The council bought the empty chapel in Market Street from the Methodist Church for £362 in 1934 and subsequently converted it into a municipal facility.
The design of the converted structure involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing north along Market Street; the central bay featured a doorway with a fanlight flanked by fluted Doric order columns supporting an entablature. The outer bays on the ground floor and all three bays on the first floor were fenestrated by round headed windows. The bays were flanked by full height pilasters supporting a dentiled cornice with acroteria and, at roof level, there was a central panel inscribed with the words "Town Hall" and the date of conversion.
The town hall continued to serve as the headquarters of the urban district council for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Allerdale District Council was formed in 1974. Instead it became the offices and meeting place of Cockermouth Town Council as well as the home of the local tourist information centre. In October 2016, it also became an approved venue for weddings and civil partnership ceremonies. A large 17th century linen chest was installed in the entrance hall in August 2017.

Almaza Air Force Base Airport is a regional airport in north-eastern Cairo, the capital of Egypt. It was established as a civilian aerodrome, but was partly taken over by the British military, designated RAF Heliopolis and later RAF Almaza. Today it is a military aerodrome of the Egyptian Air Force as well as regional civil airport.
History
The aerodrome was established in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis in February 1910, when Baron Empain organised the first air meeting in Africa. The event was supervised by the Aéro-Club de France, and attracted several leading French aviators, including Hubert Latham, Henri Rougier, Jacques Balsan, Hubert Le Blon, Arthur Duray, and Mme. Raymonde de Laroche. Other entrants included Hans Grade from Germany, Frederick van Riemsdijk from the Netherlands, and Hayden Sands from the USA (although apparently not an official entrant). The only British flier A. Mortimer Singer crashed during a practice flight, breaking his leg, and was forced to withdraw. The aerodrome remained active until the First World War, when the British Army built a new airfield immediately to the south-east. The original airfield site has now been completely built over, and is partially occupied by the Egyptian Military Academy.
During World War I the aerodrome was operated by the British Royal Flying Corps, housing several squadrons as well as a training wing, and then the Royal Air Force, being designated RAF Heliopolis in April 1918. In the inter-war period it remained an active RAF base, housing several squadrons, including No. 208 Squadron RAF which was based there almost continuously from 1927 until 1942.
In the 1920s it was named Almaza Airport by the Egyptian government. It became the first base of the Egyptian Army Air Force (EAAF) when on 2 June 1932 the first five de Havilland Gipsy Moth trainer aircraft arrived from Hatfield Aerodrome, north of London, flown by three Egyptian and two British pilots. The EAAF became independent in 1937 and was renamed the Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF).
In December 1931 the Egyptian Parliament approved the formation of an Anglo-Egyptian company to undertake civil aviation enterprises in Egypt. The company, named Misr Airwork S.A., was empowered to establish and operate flying training schools, local passenger flights, service stations, housing, provisioning, maintenance and repair of civil aircraft, aerial photography and survey, as well as regular and occasional air transport services for carrying passengers, mail and freight. By 1938 the company, based at Almaza, was flying regular scheduled flights between Cairo and Alexandria, and to Assiut, Nicosia, Haifa, and Baghdad, operating a fleet comprising a D.H. Dragon, D.H. Dragonfly, three D.H.86s and five D.H. Rapides. The company became fully Egyptian-owned in 1948, was nationalized in 1949, and was renamed United Arab Airlines in 1961, and then EgyptAir in 1971.
During World War II the military aerodrome was renamed RAF Almaza, becoming EAF Almaza in 1947. Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II lists the EAF, roughly circa 1948, with six squadrons, of which Nos 1 and 3-6 were all at Almaza.
At the end of a training regime from January to mid-March 1942 (involving the handling of Italian and German weapons, sabotage and parachutism), the French SAS company executed a surprise mock attack against the aerodrome of Heliopolis without the knowledge of the garrison and its commander.
In 1956, during the Suez crisis, it was bombed several times by the British. Almaza at that time had 25 MiG-15/17s, four Meteors, 21 Vampires, and ten Il-28s.
On 5 February 1962 it witnessed the reception of Yuri Gagarin by Zakaria Mohieddin.
Almaza AFB Airport
In 2016 Almaza is the home to several Egyptian Air Force units, flying trainer and transport aircraft, helicopters, and VIP transports. Several private charter airlines also operate from there.

Sergei Uasyl-ipa Bagapsh (4 March 1949 – 29 May 2011) was an Abkhaz politician who served as the second President of Abkhazia from 12 February 2005 until his death on 29 May 2011. He previously served as Prime Minister of Abkhazia from 1997 to 1999. He was re-elected in the 2009 presidential election. Bagapsh's term as Prime Minister included the 1998 war with Georgia, while he oversaw both the recognition of Abkhazia by Russia and the Russo-Georgian War during his presidency.
Born in 1949 in Sukhumi, Bagapsh became a businessman following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as well as a representative of Abkhazian interests in Russia. Bagapsh became Prime Minister of Abkhazia in 1997, overseeing a brief, but successful, war with Georgia during a high point of tensions and the displacement of 30,000 Georgian civilians. In 2004, Bagapsh founded the United Abkhazia party in opposition to then-President Vladislav Ardzinba.
The same year, Bagapsh ran for President against Raul Khajimba, Ardzinba's choice, and originally was forecast as losing to Khajimba. A political crisis followed, with the Supreme Court of Abkhazia declaring Bagapsh the winner and protests against the election both by supporters of Bagapsh and Khajimba. The two eventually ran on a national unity ticket, with Bagapsh becoming President and Khajimba becoming Vice President in 2005.
As President, Bagapsh lobbied for the international recognition of Abkhazia, eventually receiving receiving recognition from Russia in 2008 following the successful capture of the Kodori Valley in the Russo-Georgian War by Russian and Abkhazian forces. Following the country's recognition by Russia, widespread investment by Russian businesses and pressure to privatise assets drew both support and criticism. Bagapsh successfully won a second term against Khajimba before dying of heart failure on 29 May 2011, due to complications from a surgery to remove cancerous growths on his lung.
Early life and career
Sergei Bagapsh was born on 4 March 1949 at Sukhumi in the Georgian SSR. Throughout most of his life, he had lived in Abkhazia. In his youth, Bagapsh was a member of the Georgian basketball team. Bagapsh graduated from the Georgian State University of Subtropical Agriculture in Sukhumi. During his studies he worked first, in a wine cooperative and later as a security guard for the state bank. In 1972, he fulfilled his military service, worked as the head of a sovkhoz following which he became instructor with the Abkhazian regional committee of the Komsomol.
In 1978, Bagapsh became responsible for information in the central committee of the Komsomol's Georgian branch and in 1980, first secretary of the Abkhazian Regional Committee. In 1982, Sergei Bagapsh became secretary general of the Communist Party in the Ochamchira district. After the fall of communism, Bagapsh became a businessman and the representative of the Abkhazian government in Moscow. From 1995 until 1997, Bagapsh was First Deputy Prime MInister of Abkhazia. On 9 November 1995, Bagapsh was seriously wounded in an attack.
Prime Minister
Sergei Bagapsh was appointed to the office of Prime Minister of Abkhazia on 29 April 1997.
Georgian-Abkhazian tensions during Bagapsh's term in office reached a height in May 1998, following attacks by Georgian insurgents on peacekeeping forces from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Subsequently, a military conflict erupted between CIS and Georgian insurgent forces. In the subsequent war, sometimes referred to as the "Six-Day War", Abkhazian forces eliminated the insurgents, and 30,000 Georgian civilians fled Abkhazia.
2004 presidential election
From 2000 until 2004, Sergei Bagapsh was the managing director of the Abkhazian state-owned power company Chernomorenergo. During the same period, he began to emerge as a likely opposition candidate in the lead-up to the 2004 presidential election. In early 2004, he became one of three leaders of the newly founded opposition party, United Abkhazia. On 20 July 2004, United Abkhazia joined forces with Amtsakhara, another important opposition party, and the two named him as their joint candidate for the coming October presidential elections, beating out other hopefuls, such as former foreign minister Sergey Shamba.
In the elections, Bagapsh and his main opponent, Raul Khajimba, disputed the results. The Abkhaz Electoral Commission originally declared Khajimba to be the winner, with Bagapsh a distant second, but the Supreme Court later found that Bagapsh had actually won with 50.3% of the vote. The court then reversed its decision when Khajimba's supporters stormed the court building. At one point, Bagapsh and his supporters threatened to hold their own inauguration on 6 December 2004. However, in early December, Bagapsh and Khajimba reached an agreement to run together on a national unity ticket. New elections were held on 12 January 2005, with this ticket easily winning. Under the agreement, Bagapsh ran for president and Khajimba ran for vice-president.
Following Bagapsh's election, Russia placed an imports ban on Abkhazia, leading to several tangerines destined for Russian markets rotting at the border. The presidential election and subsequent political crisis was termed by some, including the BBC, as the "Tangerine Revolution", both as a reference to the Rose Revolution in Georgia the year prior and Abkhazia's tangerines.
Recognition of Abkhazia by Russia
In August 2008, the Russo-Georgian War began following the 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis. Following the war, Abkhazia gained control over the Kodori Valley, as well as recognition by Russia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Following Russia's recognition of Abkhaz independence, Russian businesses began to invest extensively within the country, particularly in real estate, infrastructure, and energy. Pressure began mounting on Bagapsh from Russian sources to hasten economic privatisation in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics, while Abkhazian political opponents accused him of selling off Abkhazian assets.
2009 Presidential election
Bagapsh first addressed the matter of his candidacy in the 12 December 2009 presidential election when, during a press conference in Moscow on 18 April 2009, he announced that he would probably make use of his constitutional right to run for a second term. Bagapsh was nominated on 27 October by United Abkhazia, with Prime Minister Alexander Ankvab of Aitaira as his vice presidential candidate. On 18 November, Bagapsh received the additional support of the Communist Party of Abkhazia.
Death
In May 2011, cancerous growths were discovered on Bagapsh's lung. On 21 May, Bagapsh underwent surgery in a Moscow clinic. Though the growths were successfully removed, Bagapsh died on 29 May due to heart failure that resulted from what was described as "complications" from the surgery. After the surgery, doctors discovered he had cancer. Alexander Ankvab took over as acting president with an election scheduled to be held on 26 August.
Reactions
Abkhaz parliament speaker Nugzar Ashuba told Russian state television that, although the death was completely unexpected, the situation remains calm.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev offered his condolences saying: "Bagapsh was a loyal supporter of friendship and alliance with Russia, and he tirelessly worked to deepen close bilateral ties between our countries."
Legacy
A state commission was installed to perpetuate the memory of Sergei Bagapsh. On 26 January 2012, the City Council of Sukhumi unanimously accepted a proposal by Mayor Alias Labakhua to rename the Square of the Constitution of the USSR after Bagapsh.

Robert John Morris (27 November 1926 – 29 December 2007) was a Welsh cricketer. He played for Cambridge University and Kent County Cricket Club, making a total of 22 appearances in first-class cricket matches between 1949 and 1951.
Morris was born at Swansea in South Wales in 1926, the son of Vernon Morris who played for Glamorgan in the 1920s. He attended Blundell's School where he captained the school side and was selected to play for the public schools at Lord's in both 1944 and 1945. After scoring 571 runs and taking 33 wickets in 1944―when Wisden called him "outstanding― he played for The Rest against Lord's Schools, and "displayed batting and bowling promise" for the Public Schools side against a Lord's XI, a match briefly interrupted by a flying bomb exploding near to the ground.
The previous season he had dismissed seven batsmen in his opening over of a match and taken ten wickets against Clifton College, and in 1945 he was considered "the best" all-rounder in schools cricket by Wisden. He scored 558 runs at an average of 46.50 runs per innings and took 43 wickets with a bowling average of 7.41 runs, easily the best in both categories at Blundell's, and Wisden was again complementary, describing him as "a thoroughly competent cricketer" and that he has "led the side skilfully". After completing his National Service he attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied history, and made his first-class debut for the University side against Sussex in 1949, scoring 96 on debut and winning his Blue as a freshman.
After first playing for Kent's Second XI in 1948, Morris made two appearances for the county's First XI in the 1950 County Championship, although he did not play for Cambridge at all that season, preferring to concentrate on his academic studies. He played for the University in 1951 but was dropped before the University Match after a run of poor form.
Morris played no first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge, although he continued to play for Beckenham Cricket Club and Band of Brothers, an amateur side closely associated with Kent. He worked as a teacher, married and had two children. He died at his home in Harrow in 2007 aged 81.

State Route 120 (SR 120) is an east–west state highway in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. Its western terminus is at the Michigan state line, where an unnumbered county highway (Morenci Road, formerly M-120) continues west-northwest. State Route 120's eastern terminus is in Toledo at State Route 65; the route is, for all practical purposes, a spur of U.S. Route 20, which generally bypasses Toledo to the west and south.
History
In 1940, Route 120's original route was certified. It began at the Michigan state line, connecting with the former M-120 near Metamora. SR-120's current alignment from the state line to Metamora is original to the route. East of Metamora, SR-120 used Sylvania-Metamora Road, Erie Street and Monroe Street to enter Sylvania. The route then turned south on Main Street and Holland-Sylvania Road to leave Sylvania. SR-120 then continued south to U.S. Route 20 (Central Avenue) near Ottawa Hills. SR-120 was co-signed with US-20 from Holland-Sylvania to Reynolds Road, where US-20 turned south. Route 120 continued east from Reynolds Road along Central Avenue. Its alignment along Central Avenue to Cherry Street in Toledo has been unchanged since its inception. At Cherry Street, the route turned south, traveling through Downtown Toledo and over the Maumee River. SR-120 then used Main Street, Starr Avenue and East Broadway to make its way to current State Route 51 (Woodville Road). Route 120 then traveled along Woodville Road from Toledo to its eastern terminus east of Elmore. The section from Sylvania to Toledo replaced State Route 263 and the section from Toledo to east of Elmore replaced State Route 102
In 1946, the route east of Metamora was decertified by the state. The section west of Toledo was renumbered State Route 102, which turned south in Metamora along current State Route 64 to the village of Assumption, then joined US-20 and ran east into Toledo. The section from Sylvania to near Ottawa Hills (Main Street/Holland-Sylvania Road) was designated as State Route 333 (now defunct).
By 1950, the route extended west to the Michigan border, replacing State Route 102.
The coming of the expressway system in Toledo brought changes to State Route 120 as well. In 1955, the route was added to a stretch of the future Detroit-Toledo Expressway in Northwood. The former routing from Northwood to Elmore certified as State Route 51.
SR-120 then went south along the expressway to its new eastern terminus at US-20 near Lemoyne. In 1959, more of the Detroit-Toledo Expressway was completed and SR-120 was added to a longer stretch of the expressway, now designated as Interstate 280. From Cherry Street in Downtown Toledo, the route turned east onto Summit Street (today's State Route 65). At the expressway, SR-120 joined I-280, using it to its terminus near Lemoyne. By 1962, SR-120 was removed from Cherry Street and Summit Street and extended east along Central Avenue to its interchange with I-280.
In 1970, the Route 120 designation was completely removed from I-280. SR-120 was truncated back to the Central Avenue exit (then exit 11) of I-280. The former Summit Street routing of SR-120 was added to US-223 and the old stretch of SR-120 from the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) south to US-20 was re-designated as State Route 420.
The last change to the route occurred in 1989. Route 120 was moved back onto Cherry Street into Downtown Toledo, ending at its present terminus at Summit Street (SR-65). The alignment to Interstate 280 was decertified after the Central Avenue interchange with I-280 removed.
Before 1940
1923–1939 – Routed along the current alignment of State Route 185 from U.S. Route 127 northwest of Versailles to Piqua; this route certified as State Route 185 in 1940.

James Cecil Valdamar Hendy (May 6, 1905 – January 14, 1961) was an ice hockey writer, historian, and statistician born in Barbados, British West Indies. A member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in the "Builder" category, he is credited with developing the statistical methods for tracking professional player and team performance. His methods have been in use since the 1930s.
Writing and statistical work
Hendy spent time in Vancouver, British Columbia before moving to New York City and working a number of odd jobs. He took a position submitting statistics and other information to Western Union for various sporting events at Madison Square Garden. His accuracy, graceful style, and general sports knowledge earned him a reputation as a quality writer with newspapers in the city. This reputation led him to a number of other writing posts for publications such as The New York Telegraph, Saturday Evening Post and McCall's.
In 1933, Hendy began publishing a statistical work entitled The Hockey Guide which he produced yearly until 1951. Due to the increase in demands on his time by his career, he transferred responsibility for his statistics to the National Hockey League (NHL). In the following years, Hendy took numerous jobs in hockey including president of the United States Hockey League, publicist for the NHL New York Rangers, and general manager of the American Hockey League Cleveland Barons.
Reputation and honors
Hendy earned several honors with the Cleveland Barons as they won the AHL Calder Cup three times during his tenure from 1949 to 1961, including being named "Executive of the Year" twice by The Hockey News. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1968 and is listed as a major contributor to modern web sites such as the Internet Hockey Database.
He was buried at Lakewood Park Cemetery in Rocky River, Ohio.

Aptostichus angelinajolieae, the Angelina Jolie trapdoor spider, is a species of Euctenizidae, nocturnal arthropods who seize their prey after leaping out of their burrows and inject it with venom. It was described by the Auburn University professor Jason Bond in 2008, who named it after the American actress Angelina Jolie in recognition of her work on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. It was one of only seven described species of Aptostichus until 2012, when it was joined by Bono's Joshua Tree trapdoor spider and 32 other species.
Identification and distribution
It is difficult to identify an individual as being an A. angelinajolieae specimen due to the species' morphological similarity to A. atomarius and A. stanfordianus. A set of unique mitochondrial DNA nucleotide substitutions sets the species apart and allows a diagnosis. A. angelinajolieae inhabits the north of Monterey County, California, restricted to the Santa Lucia Range west of the Salinas Valley, which probably serves as a dispersal barrier. Its ecoregion consists of chaparral forest and shrub. It is not found in the coastal dunes, which are the habitat of the geographically proximate but lighter colored A. stephencolberti. Female specimens are normally seen on road cuts and humid, shaded steep banks. The species creates shallow burrows with a thin silk-soil trapdoor and white silken lined retreat.
Taxonomy
Due to the Salinas Valley barrier, there is no genetic exchangeability between Aptostichus angelinajolieae and other Aptostichus species. This and the species' exclusivity as a lineage in DNA studies makes it a cohesion species. A. angelinajolieae belongs to the Atomarius Sibling Species Complex along with the closely related species A. atomarius, A. dantrippi, A. miwok, A. stanfordianus and A. stephencolberti.
Conservation status
In addition to being widespread and abundant in its range, the Angelina Jolie trapdoor spider flourishes in moderately developed residential areas. Therefore, in terms of its conservation status, it is not considered to be a threatened species.

The Chinese penduline tit (Remiz consobrinus) is a bird in the family Remizidae. The species was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1870.
It is found in China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and Russia. There are 10 species in the family Remizidae. They are similar to true tits, but make characteristic penduline nests. They inhabit open fields and wetlands. They have sharp bill tips and the sexes look alike.
Description
The birds are 11 cm in length. They are small, pale birds of reedbeds with a fine-pointed bill, often in flocks of 10 to 20.
Male: Greyish crown and nape. Black mask from forehead edged white. Chestnut mantle, halfcollar and wing-coverts contrast with dark wings and black tail in flight. Whitish underparts are marked with buff.
Female: Mask brown. Upperparts browner lacking chestnut.
Habitat and behavior
The chinese penduline tit is found in Asia, especially in reedbeds and marshes in northern China. It inhabits, in nesting and non-nesting, in areas of agricultural pastures, wetlands with marshes or brackish ponds. It is often in flocks of 10 to 20.
It winters in the south of China.
Voice: Very thin drawn out 'tseeoo', 'sseeoo'.
The chinese penduline tit is insectivorous. It feeds on insects, larvae, spiders, caterpillars and sometimes, especially in winter, on small seeds.
The bird is an acrobatic climber, it can remain suspended by one leg and take its food with the other.
Reproduction
The male chooses the tree which will carry the nest from 3 to 15 m height. The nest of the chinese penduline tit is a marvel of architecture. It has the aspect of a pear-shaped purse. The nest is extended by a tubular appendix and offers a lateral entrance.
The female, having arranged the interior of the nest, generally lays between 5 to 10 eggs which she incubates alone during 12 to 15 days. When the young have fledged, the nest is deformed and partly disintegrated. They return there to sleep during 15 to 20 days, then leave the place.
Conservation status
The population is increasing, it is considered by the IUCN as "least concern".

In mathematics, the -dimensional integer lattice (or cubic lattice), denoted , is the lattice in the Euclidean space whose lattice points are -tuples of integers. The two-dimensional integer lattice is also called the square lattice, or grid lattice. is the simplest example of a root lattice. The integer lattice is an odd unimodular lattice.
Automorphism group
The automorphism group (or group of congruences) of the integer lattice consists of all permutations and sign changes of the coordinates, and is of order 2n n!. As a matrix group it is given by the set of all n×n signed permutation matrices. This group is isomorphic to the semidirect product
where the symmetric group Sn acts on (Z2)n by permutation (this is a classic example of a wreath product).
For the square lattice, this is the group of the square, or the dihedral group of order 8; for the three-dimensional cubic lattice, we get the group of the cube, or octahedral group, of order 48.
Diophantine geometry
In the study of Diophantine geometry, the square lattice of points with integer coordinates is often referred to as the Diophantine plane. In mathematical terms, the Diophantine plane is the Cartesian product of the ring of all integers . The study of Diophantine figures focuses on the selection of nodes in the Diophantine plane such that all pairwise distances are integer.
Coarse geometry
In coarse geometry, the integer lattice is coarsely equivalent to Euclidean space.

The UCSD Guardian is a student-operated newspaper at the University of California, San Diego. Originally named the Triton Times, it is published once a week during the regular academic year, usually Mondays. Although The Guardian is officially a university department, it is funded solely by advertising. Unlike many college newspapers, The Guardian has no faculty advisor and is not formally tied to any academic program.
Staff structure
The Guardian's editorial staff consists of UCSD undergraduates. The Editor-in-Chief is elected in the late spring by a vote of the current year's staff; the Editor in Chief-elect then selects new senior editors, who make up the paper's Executive Board, which is ratified by the outgoing editors.
In contrast, the paper's business side is operated by several longtime university employees. A Business Oversight Board, which includes the paper's general manager, Editor-in-Chief, and managing editors, is responsible for setting long-term policies for the business and overseeing their implementation.
University relationship
Though The Guardian is technically a self-supporting enterprise under the university's Student Affairs department, it operates with complete independence and autonomy from the university. Under the paper's constitution, the Executive Board operates as the sole publisher of the paper. The newspaper's student editors have formally resolved to cease its production and operations in the case of any university interference.
Recent history
In recent years, the paper has undergone a series of crises and resulting restructurings. Between 2001 and 2004, The Guardian saw its annual revenue plunge, from above $400,000 to less than $320,000. The resulting budget deficits nearly wiped out the paper's financial reserves and resulted in page reductions for its editorial operations.
As part of an effort to stop the bleeding, the paper's general manager implemented a strict 50-50 division between editorial content and advertising. The Executive Board of the paper responded to the crisis by carrying out a reorganization of the business department and a reduction in the compensation of its student staff.
Editorial success
Throughout the years, The Guardian has won many local, regional, statewide, and national awards. In 2006, The Guardian won nearly a dozen and a half awards from the California College Media Association, in categories ranging from design and illustration to writing and photography. Shortly after, the paper was also named an honorable mention in the competition to be named Newspaper of the Year by the Associated Collegiate Press.
In 2020, The Guardian won several awards from the San Diego Society of Professional Journalists, including second place for Best College Newspaper, first place for Best Arts & Entertainment Story in a College Publication, and third place for Best Opinion in a College Publication. The Guardian also won several awards from the San Diego Press Club, including first place for Best Column in a College Publication, second place for Best Investigative Reporting in a College Publication, and an honorable mention for Best Student Newspaper.
While UCSD does not have a journalism program, many former Guardian writers and editors have launched journalism careers. Guardian alumni have worked or currently work for major newspapers (including The Wall Street Journal, the Orange County Register, Kansas City Star, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The San Diego Union-Tribune, the Riverside Press-Enterprise, The Torrance Daily Breeze, The Christian Science Monitor, Investor's Business Daily, LA Weekly, SF Weekly and the Los Angeles Times), magazines (including Newsweek, Vanity Fair, Flaunt and Macworld), and television news stations (KGTV-San Diego). In 2006, an alumnus was nominated for the Academy Award in the Documentary Short category.
Change in frequency
During fall quarter 1990, The Guardian published three issues a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Due to a lack of advertising revenue and the increased production and distribution costs of a third issue of the newspaper, the paper reverted to a twice-weekly schedule during winter quarter 1991. The Guardian was published twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays, until winter quarter 2017, when the switch to a weekly schedule was made.
At the beginning of spring quarter 2020, The Guardian temporarily ceased its print publication and made the transition to release all content on its website and in a weekly newsletter. This change was made due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Guardian returned to print at the beginning of the Fall quarter in 2021-22.

The Disreguardian
In the early 1980s The Guardian published several April Fool's Day issues, titled The Disreguardian. The practice stopped at some point, but was revived on April 1, 1990, a decision that resulted in Editor-in-Chief Seth Slater's resignation in protest. The April Fool's issues continue to this day.

Aberuchill Castle is located west of Comrie in Perthshire, Scotland. It comprises an early 17th-century tower house, which was extended and remodelled in the 19th century. The house, excluding the later west wing, is protected as a category A listed building, while the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.
History
In 1596 the lands of Aberuchill were granted to the Campbell family of Lawers. The earliest part of the tower house is dated 1602. In 1642 Aberuchill was acquired by Sir James Drummond, and was retained by his descendants until 1858. The gothic east wing was added to the tower house by the Drummonds, and the interiors remodelled, in the early 19th century.
The house was purchased by Sir David Dundas of Dunira in 1858, who sold it on to English cotton merchant George Dewhurst of Lymm, Cheshire, in 1864. Between 1869 and 1874 the west wing and further additions were made, possibly to the designs of David Bryce.
Aberuchill was 'burned down' in a suffragette attack on 4 February 1914, and the castle's servants were fortunate to escape.
Aberuchill Castle was inherited by William Mostyn-Owen on the death of his father in 1947, and he was living there in "23 rooms or so" of one wing with his wife, the Italian writer Gaia Servadio, in 1968, but eventually sold it.
The estate was sold by the Dewhursts in the 1980s, and remains in private ownership. In 2005 it was reported that Russian steel tycoon Vladimir Lisin had purchased the castle and its estate for £6.8 million.

Idrissa Gana Gueye (born 26 September 1989) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for club Everton and the Senegal national team.
Starting his career at Diambars in his native Senegal, Gueye joined French club Lille's reserve side in 2008. He would go on to play for the side's first team from 2010 to 2015, winning a Ligue 1 and Coupe de France double in 2011, before moving to England with Aston Villa. A year later, he signed for fellow Premier League club Everton. In 2019, Gueye returned to France by signing for the reigning Ligue 1 champions, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). He reached the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final with the club, but did not play in the match in which PSG lost.
Gueye made his debut for Senegal in 2011. He was part of the Senegalese squad at the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he played one match. He played for Senegal at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and four Africa Cups of Nations tournaments. After a defeat in the 2019 final, he helped his country win the following competition's final in 2022.
Club career
Early career
Born in Dakar, Gueye spent his early career in Senegal at Diambars, a football academy set up by Patrick Vieira and Bernard Lama. He joined French club Lille in August 2008. He broke through into the first team in the 2010–11 season, playing 11 games as the team won Ligue 1, and started in the 2011 Coupe de France Final win over Paris Saint-Germain. He became a regular starter in the league and the UEFA Champions League over the following four seasons. His first goal came on 17 February 2011 in a 2–2 home draw with PSV Eindhoven in the UEFA Europa League last 32 first leg, while his first league goal came on 5 October 2013 in a 3–0 win over Ajaccio at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. He was sent off on 21 April 2012 in a 2–0 win at Dijon.
Aston Villa
On 10 July 2015, Gueye joined English Premier League club Aston Villa for a £9 million transfer fee. On 8 August, he made his debut in a 1–0 away victory over AFC Bournemouth. On 19 January 2016, Gueye scored his first and only goal for Villa in a 2–0 over Wycombe Wanderers in the third round replay of the FA Cup. In total, Gueye made 35 league appearances for Villa as the club was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.
Everton
On 2 August 2016 and with Aston Villa relegated from the Premier League, Everton triggered a release clause in Gueye's contract, reported to be £7.1 million, and signed him to a four-year contract. He made the highest number of successful tackles and interceptions per match across Europe's top five leagues over the 2016 calendar year. Gueye scored his first league goal for Everton in a 2–0 victory over Sunderland at Goodison Park on 25 February 2017. He became the first player in Europe's top five leagues to win 100 tackles in the 2016–17 season.
Gueye scored his first goal for Everton in European competition on 17 August 2017 in the UEFA Europa League play-off round first leg against Hajduk Split. He was sent off on 22 October in a 5–2 home loss to Arsenal. In February 2018, he extended his contract with Everton until 2022.
In January 2019, Everton rejected an offer from French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for Gueye. However, the speculation regarding PSG did not negatively impact his performances as Gueye was awarded the club's joint Player's Player of the Year for the 2018–19 season along with Lucas Digne.
Paris Saint-Germain
On 30 July 2019, Gueye signed for Ligue 1 club PSG for a fee of £30 million. He made his debut on 25 August in a 4–0 victory over Toulouse. On 18 September, he produced a "brilliant" display in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League. His first goal for PSG came in a 4–0 win against Angers on 5 October. In his first season in Paris, Gueye won a domestic treble and finished runner-up in the Champions League, sitting on the bench for the loss to Bayern Munich in the final. In his second season, the club won the Coupe de France and made the semi-finals of the Champions League, losing to Manchester City.
After having been suspended for two Champions League matches due to a red card in the first leg of the semi-final against Manchester City in April 2021, Gueye made his return to European football in a 2–0 win over the same opponent on 28 September 2021. He scored the opening goal of the match, his first goal in the Champions League, and was given the Player of the Match award.
Return to Everton
Gueye began talks to return to Everton in early August 2022. He signed a two-year contract with the club on 1 September 2022 for a reported fee of £2 million.
International career
Gueye made his international debut for Senegal on 11 November 2011 as a half-time substitute for Deme N'Diaye in a 4–1 friendly win away to neighbours Guinea. He was part of the team at the 2012 Olympics, but was injured just before the interval in the opening game against hosts Great Britain. He was selected for the Africa Cup of Nations in 2015, and 2017.
On 9 June 2017, Gueye scored his first international goal to conclude a 3–0 win over Equatorial Guinea in 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification. He was named in Senegal's 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. At the 2019 African finals in Egypt, he scored the only goal of the quarter-final win over Benin for the finalists. Senegal won the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, with Gueye scoring in a 3–1 semi-final win over Burkina Faso.
Style of play
An energetic midfielder, known for his ball-winning skills, as well as his ability to press opponents and intercept passes, Gueye completed the most tackles during the 2016–17 Premier League season.
Personal life
Gueye is married to Pauline, with whom he has two sons. He is a practising Muslim and has made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. In May 2022, he held a charity dinner to raise €2 million in funds for African children affected by cancer and HIV/AIDS.
Controversy
In the 37th matchday of the 2021–22 Ligue 1 season, Gueye travelled with the PSG squad for the away match against Montpellier. However, he was not included in the team sheet for what manager Mauricio Pochettino revealed to be "personal reasons", and not an injury. This brought the media spotlight on Gueye; RMC Sport reported that he had refused to play in the match due to PSG's shirts featuring the rainbow flag in support of the LGBT movement, an initiative taken by Ligue 1 for the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. He had also notably missed the same fixture in the previous season, with the reasoning behind his non-participation then being that he was suffering from gastroenteritis.
For his controversial absence against Montpellier, Gueye received backlash and calls for sanctions from Rouge Direct, an organization against homophobia, and Île-de-France regional president Valérie Pécresse, among others. The French Football Federation (FFF) asked him to confirm the reason for his absence, in order to dispel rumours.
Senegalese president Macky Sall expressed his support for Gueye, justifying the position by stating that Gueye's "religious beliefs must be respected". Gueye's Senegal teammates Cheikhou Kouyaté, Ismaïla Sarr, and Nampalys Mendy, who all play in England, also praised him for his actions. The hashtag #WeAreAllIdrissa, in support of Gueye, started trending over social media.

Kankaanpää () is a town and municipality of Finland. Kankaanpää was founded in 1865, became a township in 1967 and finally a town in 1972. It is located in the crossroads of Hämeenkangas and Pohjankangas ridges. It belongs to the region of Satakunta. Kankaanpää has a population of about inhabitants, which make it the third largest municipality in the Satakunta region in terms of population, after the city of Pori and the town of Rauma. Pori is located southwest of Kankaanpää.
The coat of arms of Kankaanpää has its theme from the early days of the municipality's settlement, the origin of which is depicted with a golden pine tree in the middle of forest areas. The coat of arms was designed by Carolus Lindberg and was confirmed on October 12, 1951.
Honkajoki municipality was merged with Kankaanpää on January 1, 2021.
History
First signs of humanity in the area are from the stone age and during the 16th century people started to settle in Kankaanpää area. Oldest houses that area found from the documents of Sweden-Finland are from the 1560 decade. There were three houses in Kankaanpää then: Honko, Oukari and Päivike.
The oldest passage in the province was from Hämeenkyrö through the ridges to Kauhajoki. In the 17th century it was the most important road between southern Finland and Ostrobothnia. The king of Sweden visited Kankaanpää twice. Gustavus Adolphus travelled from Ilmajoki to Hämeenlinna through Kankaanpää in 1614 and Adolf Fredrik had a rest in Kuninkaanlähde spring to water his horses and to eat in 1752. The spring was named after this event.
The church of Kankaanpää has been built in 1839. Architect of the church was C. L. Engel.
Climate
Based on the village of Niinisalo about 5.7 km northeast of the site the climate is a continental subarctic frontier (Köppen: Dfc) considering that the warmest fourth month is around 9 °C, which puts Kankaanpää in a humid continental climate (Dfb) being closer to Helsinki than Oulu, it also means that summer is more consistent and warm but winters are still cold. The municipality is considered one of the rainiest of Finland with 571 mm only during a growing season in 1995. Growing season starts in early May and lasts until October 10.

Holcomb Glacier () is a glacier which drains northward to the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, southeast of Groves Island. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photographs, 1959–65, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Leroy G. Holcomb, an ionospheric physicist who worked at Byrd Station in 1971.

Nicolas Maranda (born 15 November 1967 in Auckland, New Zealand) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, composer, musician and record producer based in Montreal. His compositional style is eclectic, blending acoustic, electric and electronic elements into distinct soundscapes. His compositions have appeared on record, in television series and feature films. His productions have covered many styles of music, from house music to tango and from rock to Arabic. His performances on record include various guitars, basses, keyboards, and percussion instruments, as well as more exotic instruments such as oud and didgeridoo. He has played hundreds of shows in Canada, the United States, Europe, The Middle East, Australia, Haïti, and exotic locations such as the North Pole and the jungles of East Timor.
Early years
Nicolas Maranda is the second son of anthropologists Pierre Maranda and Elli Köngäs-Maranda. His first year was spent within the Rere tribe of Lau Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, of which he is still considered a member. His family then spent a year in Paris and settled in Vancouver, BC, where he started playing the piano at age four. The family eventually moved to Quebec City, where he took up the guitar. Mostly self-taught, he eventually added other instruments to his repertoire.
These years were marked by numerous trips across the globe that would prove to be influential in his vision.
1980s–1990s
In Quebec City he founded the band BoYcuT which gained a local following. When Nicolas was 16, the band moved to Montreal. Nicolas concurrently took up studies in record production and sound engineering. The band made some noise, placing among the finalists at the "Empire des Futures Stars" band competition and gaining some radio airplay. They went on to tour in Canada and Europe.
Nicolas eventually started writing more and more on his own and left the band, which disbanded. After a stint in London, he returned to Quebec City to work with ex-DJ Daniel Coulombe in the studio. Together they produced various projects, including a remix of the song "Des Fleurs pour Salinger" by French band Indochine, which became an international hit. The pair then co-produced Nicolas' first album (in French), Deux, released in 1991, which saw him move back to Montreal. It was the first release of independent label les Disques Tacca. The record included several songs that charted in Quebec and France, including "Fleur du mal", "Blanche comme la nuit" and "Douce". It was on several critics' lists of the best album of the year, including Claude Rajotte. Maranda and the album were nominated for awards at the 1992 ADISQ Gala. The video for "Fleur du mal" won "Best Independent Video" at the 1992 MusiquePlus Video Gala. His other videos also made a considerable impact and were similarly nominated for awards. He performed on stage and television in Canada and France. However conflicts within the label put things at a standstill as to how to go ahead with the second album.
In parallel Maranda co-wrote with his then-partner, singer-songwriter Pascale Coulombe. They recorded an album that was originally planned to come out under her name, but since it was a collaboration they released it under the name "Coma" (a play of words on their last names).
The album was influential and the videos also stood out, with "Carmen" winning Best French Video at the 1997 MuchMusic Video Awards. Their other videos also garnered nominations. Maranda and Coulombe eventually worked on concepts of videos by other artists including Daniel Bélanger.
In 1998 the pair spent some time in Los Angeles, where they co-wrote the song "Lost Between Las Vegas and Mars" with Guy Thomas. The song was featured in the award-winning documentary Beyond The Mat. They returned to Canada to play a series of concerts for Canadian troops that led them to the North Pole.
Other similar tours followed in Egypt, Israel, Australia and East Timor. At the turn of the millennium they convened to each head on to separate projects.
2000s
Nicolas subsequently produced a string of albums, by Richard Petit, Lynda Thalie, Andrée Watters and Intakto. He also contributed songwriting and arranging to most of them. Andrée Watters (twice) and Intakto won "Best Record" in their respective categories at the ADISQ Gala. He also wrote music for video games, notably songs for The Jungle Book Groove Party by Ubisoft/ Disney, which led him back to work in Los Angeles. In the early 2000s he also worked on a series of remixes with House group the Couch Potatoes for Petit, Thalie, Coulombe, Dubmatique and Mitsou. As a member of the live band he played at different Cirque du Soleil premières in Canada and abroad. During this period he studied acting with Warren Robertson.
From 2002 to 2007 he started writing extensively for TV series. He was awarded a Gémeaux in 2007 for his work on the seminal series Minuit, le soir. He also scored Au nom de la loi and Le Petit monde de Laura Cadieux. He received Gémeaux nominations for each of his scores. He also conceived and directed the video for the song "La Valse des hypocrites" by Mathieu Gaudet (which he had produced).
In late 2007 he released the music from Minuit, Le Soir online and on a limited-edition double CD. CD 2 is remix album, including remixes by Carl Bastien, Beno, Thomas Carbou, Daniel Coulombe, Robert De La Gauthier, Jonathan Eekkoo Doyon, Flow, Samuel Laflamme and Samuel Girardin, Monsieur Seb, Pasquipaz and Raycord.
2010s
In addition to collaborating with House Music collective Monitor, who released an album on Mile-End records, Maranda scored acclaimed TV drama 19–2. He received two additional Gémeaux awards for his work. The soundtrack album was released on Audiogram records.
Maranda is currently writing and recording an English-language album. Work began in Montreal and was continued in Honduras and South Africa before resuming in Montreal. In South Africa he recorded a seventeen-voice Xhosa choir, the St-Raphael Catholic Church Choir, for his song "We Are Free". In Montreal he recorded tracks with childhood idol Tony Levin and Youssou N'dour's tama (talking Drum) player Assane Thiam.
Nicolas has been guest speaker in various schools and organizations. He is a multiple grant holder from le Conseil des arts et letters du Québec. He has also served as jury president for the Gémeaux awards and juror for Musicaction.
