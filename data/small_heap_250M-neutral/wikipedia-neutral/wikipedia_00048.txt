The Sultan Iskandar Reservoir (Malay: Takungan Air Sultan Iskandar or Empangan Sultan Iskandar) is an artificial lake in Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia. The reservoir is about 5 km long and 2.5 km broad and strongly branches out. It is fed by several small rivers, which flow in long branches, and drained over the Layang River in the Johor River. It was named after the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Iskandar.

The Vincent Comet was designed and built at the Vincent works in Great North Road, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. It was one of four 499 cc single models. As well as the sports Comet, Vincent produced a TT racing model, the Comet Special (a TT model with lights) and the standard Vincent Meteor which shared many of the same cycle parts.
An unusual feature of the valve design for these motors was the double valve guides, and the attachment of the forked rocker arm to a shoulder between the guides, to eliminate side forces on the valve stem and ensure maximum valve life under racing conditions.
The prototype series A was refined and developed into a production model B but after World War II it was the development of the series C that represents the ultimate Vincent 500 cc single. A series D was actually designed and one was built at the factory. Others had to be subsequently made up from spare parts as Vincent production ceased in 1955.
Specifications
The 499 cc single-cylinder, high-camshaft OHV, air-cooled Vincent engine had a light alloy barrel and cylinder head with a cast-iron liner, and a 'backbone' type combined frame and oil tank. The engine acting as a stressed member of the frame, and most other components in common with the post-war twin-cylinder models. Unlike the twins, it had a Burman BAP four-speed gearbox held by a vertical piece of cast aluminium, which mated with the backbone frame that it shared with the twin models.
At the time and to this day some members of the motorcycling fraternity quipped that it was really only 'half of' the desirable Rapide twin-cylinder model, although in fact the specification had more in common with the higher performance Black Shadow twin-cylinder model, sharing compression ratio (7.3:1) and the larger carburettor. Unlike the Black Shadow however, it did not have polished internals nor was it selectively assembled. All Comet models had Vincent's "Girdraulic" forks and sprung cantilever rear suspension with hydraulic damping at a time when most manufacturers continued to produce rigid frames.

Lake Wilkie is a small, scenic lake near Tautuku Bay in the Catlins, south of Dunedin, New Zealand. It formed after the last ice age and has gradually shrunk to its current size of 1.7 hectares (4.2 acres). Bog lakes like Lake Wilkie are a rare ecosystem in this part of the country.
Formation
Lake Wilkie was formed after the most recent ice age about 13,000 years ago. Trapped towards the coast by a small cliff, water accumulated in a depression between ancient sand dunes. Originally, the lake was much larger and is slowly being filled in and reclaimed by the vegetation around it. Today, the lake is very shallow and its water colored brownish by organic acids released by the peaty soils.
Fauna and flora
The lake is home to only microscopic plankton and small invertebrates such as mites, molluscs, water boatman and worms. No fish have been found in the lake; although native galaxias are a possibility. The introduced whistling tree frog is common around the lake's edges. A cafe along the road west from Lake Wilkie shares the same name of "The Whistling Frog Cafe & Bar".
Birds common in the forest around the lake include kererū, tui, silvereye, fantail, bellbird, brown creeper and grey warbler. Fernbirds and ducks from the nearby Tautuku Estuary regularly visit Lake Wilkie.
The lake is only a short walk from a small car park on the Southern Scenic Route road, about south of Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre. A walking track starts through mature podocarp forest, including rata and leads past a viewpoint over the lake and down to the lake. At the lake margin, a short loop track with a boardwalk section takes in the boggy wetland on the lake's edge. Along the track are several signs explaining the succession of different plants as land is slowly reclaimed. The full transition from marsh dominated by sphagnum moss and sedges to mature podocarp forest occurs in only 65 m (210 ft). This shows how waterside plants can slowly reclaim the land, and in turn be replaced by larger and larger vegetation types, culminating in the forest now covering the ancient dunes around the lake.

Television in the United Kingdom by year
Earl J. Valiquette (June 16, 1921 – June 18, 1975) was a Canadian football player who played for the Hamilton Wildcats, Edmonton Eskimos and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Born in Ontario, Canada, Valiquette took up football at North Tonawanda High School in New York and played semi-professionally prior to their service with the United States Navy during World War II. Upon their return from the conflict, they played for the Hamilton Wildcats for three seasons, before making a move to the Edmonton Eskimos in 1950 that was contested by their former team. They returned to Hamilton after one year and played with the newly merged Tiger-Cats for the final two seasons of their playing days. By profession, they had a career with the Carborundum Company in the United States, and was its plant manager in Logan, Ohio at the time of their death in June 1975. A local football scholarship was later established in their name.
Early life
Valiquette was born in Orillia, Ontario as one of five children of Henry Valiquette and Alice LaCombe. Their football career began at North Tonawanda High School in North Tonawanda, New York where, as a tackle, they received all-conference honors. Upon graduation, they played semi-professional football in the Niagara Falls area for several years before joining the United States Navy and serving in World War II in the South Pacific.
Professional football
Valiquette returned to North America in 1946 and entered the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU), joining the Hamilton Wildcats in 1947. Playing as a tackle and a guard, they appeared in ten regular season games in their first year with the Wildcats, winning nine and losing one, for a record of 9–1–0. This helped them reach the ORFU finals, where Hamilton lost 3–15 to the Ottawa Trojans. The following year, the Wildcats joined the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU), but won only one of their twelve games, drawing one and losing the other ten. Nonetheless, Valiquette was nominated for the Jeff Russel Memorial Trophy, which was given annually to the best player in the IRFU, although the eventual winner that year was Eric Chipper of the Ottawa Rough Riders.
The Wildcats performed even worse the following season, losing all twelve of their games. The team then merged with the Hamilton Tigers to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, at which point Valiquette and their teammate Jackie Stewart signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Interprovincial Football Union. The Tiger-Cats, however, felt that Valiquette and Stewart had signed contracts with Hamilton before Edmonton, thus believing that Hamilton had the rights to both players and threatening legal action to force them remain with the Tiger-Cats. The Canadian Rugby Union eventually ruled that Edmonton had the rights to Valiquette and Stewart and, while Stewart decided to remain with the Tiger-Cats, Valiquette went to Edmonton. The Eskimos went 7–7–0 in the regular season, finishing in third place, and then went on to defeat the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the semi-finals, before losing the divisional finals to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.
Valiquette was traded back to Hamilton the next season by Edmonton in exchange for George Festeryga. In 1951 the Tiger-Cats finished at the top of their division in regular season play, with a record of 7–5–0, defeating the Toronto Argonauts in the semi-finals, but ultimately losing the divisional finals to the Ottawa Rough Riders. In 1952, Valiquette's last season in professional football, the Tiger-Cats again finished first in regular play, with a record of 9–2–1, but lost the final to the Argonauts. During their playing career, Valiquette stood 5 feet, 11 inches (180 centimeters) and weighed 205 pounds (93 kilograms).
Later life
Valiquette had joined the Carborundum Company in Niagara Falls, New York in 1941 and advanced through the company over the next three decades. Their earlier positions gave them the flexibility of working professionally at the same time that they were developing their football career. They eventually moved to Logan, Ohio and reached the post of that city's plant manager in May 1969. They were active in their local community as a member of the Kiwanis, and served on the board of directors of the Logan Trade Club prior to their death. They also remained athletically active in golf.
Valiquette was still employed as the Logan plant's manager at the time of their death on June 18, 1975, in Columbus, Ohio, at the age of 54, after being in poor health for a number of months. Earlier in the year they had accepted their company's "Outstanding Chapter Award" among 16 management clubs for their plant's "considerable achievements in civic activities, programming, attendance and membership activity." Valiquette was survived by their wife, Alda, one son, James, three daughters, Kathleen, Jo Ann, and Judith, and their mother. Their funeral was held on June 23 and they were buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Kenmore, New York. A few months after their death, their employer announced the establishment of the $250 Earl J. Valiquette Memorial Scholarship, which was to be given annually in support of the financial needs of a Logan High School football senior. The prize was first awarded in May 1976. Valiquette was also a member of the Hamilton Hall of Fame.

German submarine U-121 was a long-lived Type IIB U-boat built during World War II for service in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. U-121 spent the entire war as a training vessel and was scuttled at the end of the conflict.
U-121 was one of two Type II U-boats built at Flender Werke in Lübeck. Like their sister boat (also built in Lübeck), they were originally constructed for export to China. The advent of World War II and the increased training needs of the U-Boot-Waffe led the German high command to assign U-120 and U-121 to the training command instead.
Built for China
The Chinese Nationalist Government used 10,000,000 Marks to order two Type IIB U-boats in 1937. They also dispatched 80 men to Germany for training in submarine operations. The Japanese Government complained over this transaction, so the Chinese took their money back and the pair of Type IIB submarines joined the Kriegsmarine after the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. They were U-120 and U-121.
Design
German Type IIB submarines were enlarged versions of the original Type IIs. U-121 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. Officially, the standard tonnage was , however. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MWM RS 127 S four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines of for cruising, two Siemens-Schuckert PG VV 322/36 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. They had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, they could travel at . U-121 was fitted with three torpedo tubes at the bow, five torpedoes or up to twelve Type A torpedo mines, and a anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of twentyfive.

Years of the 17th century in literature
The Exhibition of Recent Specimens of Photography was an 1852 exhibition organised by the Society of Arts. It was the first exhibition in the world dedicated solely to photography. Earlier exhibitions had been done as part of a larger general exhibition, e.g. at the 1851 Great Exhibition of London. It was held at the House of the Society of Arts in London from 22 December 1852 until 29 January 1853 and featured the work of 76 photographers, for many of whom this was their first public exhibition. It led directly to the creation of the Photographic Society.
Details
The exhibition was proposed by Joseph Cundall and agreed upon by the Society of Arts on 17 November 1852. Organised mainly by Cundall and Philip Henry Delamotte, it opened on 22 December 1852 at the House of the Society of Arts in London. Roger Fenton gave at the night of the opening a lecture titled "On the Present Position and Future of the Art of Photography", which was also included in the catalogue. Some 400 photographs were initially on display. Originally intended to only stay open for a week, it was extended until 29 January 1853 due to the greater than expected success, including visits from well-known painters like Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This also lead to the addition of 400 further photographs and a reprint of the catalogue. In total, 76 photographers had their work shown at the exhibition, many of them British but with a large representation of Continental, mainly French artists as well.
The exhibition wanted to focus on the artistic aspect of photography, not the commercial side, and excluded daguerreotypes. Technology was still fast developing at the time, and the exhibition came at the moment that the older calotype process, with paper negatives, was being replaced by the new collodion process, first described in 1850 and 1851 and already getting very popular. Some 460 exhibited photographs were made with the calotype process, against some 300 for the other processes, mainly the collodion process and albumen prints.
The exhibition lead directly to the creation of the Photographic Society on 20 January 1853. One of its first endeavours was a follow-up exhibition of 83 works that would travel around the United Kingdom, starting in September 1853 and lasting until April 1854. Further similar touring exhibitions were organised in 1854 and 1855.

The universal integrated circuit card (UICC) is the smart card (integrated circuit card) used in mobile terminals in GSM and UMTS networks. The UICC ensures the integrity and security of all kinds of personal data, and it typically holds a few hundred kilobytes. The official definition for UICC is found in ETSI TR 102 216, where it is defined as a "smart card that conforms to the specifications written and maintained by the ETSI Smart Card Platform project". In addition, the definition has a note that states that "UICC is neither an abbreviation nor an acronym". NIST SP 800-101 Rev. 1 and NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary state that, "A UICC may be referred to as a SIM, USIM, RUIM or CSIM, and is used interchangeably with those terms", though this is an over-simplification. The primary component of a UICC is a SIM card.
Design
A UICC consists of a CPU, ROM, RAM, EEPROM and I/O circuits. Early versions consisted of the whole full-size (85 × 54 mm, ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1) smart card. Soon the race for smaller telephones called for a smaller version of the card. The card was cropped down to 25 × 15 mm (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-000), as illustrated.
2G versus 3G
In 2G networks, the SIM card and SIM application were bound together, so that "SIM card" could mean the physical card, or any physical card with the SIM application.
In a GSM network, the UICC contains a SIM application and in a UMTS network, it contains a USIM application. A UICC may contain several applications, making it possible for the same smart card to give access to both GSM and UMTS networks, and also provide storage of a phone book and other applications. It is also possible to access a GSM network using a USIM application and it is possible to access UMTS networks using a SIM application with mobile terminals prepared for this. With the UMT release 5 a new application, the IP multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIM) is required for services in the IMS. The telephone book is a separate application and not part of either subscriber identity module.
In a cdmaOne/CDMA2000 ("CDMA") network, the UICC contains a CSIM application, in addition to 3GPP USIM and SIM applications. A card with all 3 features is called a removable user identity card, or R-UIM. Thus, the R-UIM card can be inserted into CDMA, GSM, or UMTS handsets, and will work in all three cases.
In 3G networks, it is a mistake to speak of a USIM, CSIM, or SIM card, as all three are applications running on a UICC card.
Usage
Since the card slot is standardized, a subscriber can easily move their wireless account and phone number from one handset to another. This will also transfer their phone book and text messages. Similarly, usually a subscriber can change carriers by inserting a new carrier's UICC card into their existing handset. However, it is not always possible because some carriers (e.g., in U.S.) SIM-lock the phones that they sell, preventing rival carriers' cards from being used.
The use and content of the card can be protected by use of PIN codes. One code, PIN1, can be defined to control normal use of the phone. Another code, PIN2, can be set, to allow the use of special functions (like limiting outbound telephone calls to a list of numbers). PUK1 and PUK2 is used to reset PIN1 and PIN2 respectively.
The integration of the ETSI framework and the Application management framework of GlobalPlatform is standardized in the UICC configuration.

Philepitta is a genus of bird in the family Philepittidae. Established by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1838, the genus contains the following species:
The genus name Philepitta is a combination of the French name philédon, for the friarbirds of the family Meliphagidae and pitta, for the birds of the genus "pitta".
Philepitta is now the type-genus of a new bird family, the Philepittidae, into which the Asites of Madagascar have been placed.

Kagganapalli Radha Devi is an Indian activist who successfully protested against a Hindu temple which would only employ male barbers. The Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala, which gathers over a ton of hair every day, agreed to also employ female barbers to carry out the ritual tonsuring. Devi received the Nari Shakti Puraskar in recognition of their work.
Life
Radha Devi was the President of the Association of Andhra Pradesh Women Barbers. They were also the President of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams Women Barbers and these barbers were concerned that they were prevented in cutting hair at a Hindu temple because they were women. Radha Devi decided to champion their case.
Many devotees have their head tonsured daily as an offering to God at the Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh. The amount of hair collected every day weighs over a ton. The hair is collected and stored in large warehouses and it is sold internationally creating a substantial profit for the temple. The hair is high quality and commands prices as high as $166/kg as it is used to make wigs outside of India.
The hair cutting tradition comes from a story that is told in which Venkateswara's head was hurt by a cowherd and their scalp had a bald patch. This was noticed by Neela Devi, a Gandharva princess who cut a portion of their hair and they transplanted it to their head. Venkateswara then announced that on the place where it happened, their followers should cut their hair and give it as an offering.
In 2004 there was a reaction from Orthodox Jews when they were told that they could not wear wigs made from this ritually gathered hair. Many wigs were destroyed but the price of the hair remained stable. Traditionally the barbers employed to do the tonsuring were male and members of the Nayee caste. This caused some discrimination and requests from women that they would prefer a female barber. A protest led by Radha Devi overturned the objections and they were recognised with the Nari Shakti Puraskar, presented by Ram Nath Kovind, the President of India. The awards were made at the President's palace, Rashtrapati Bhavan, in New Delhi on International Women's Day 2019. They met the minister Maneka Gandhi and afterwards they met the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Milton Sigmund Palacio (born February 7, 1978) is a Belizean American professional basketball coach and former player. They serve as an assistant coach of the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
Early life
Palacio, a Belizean citizen, was born and raised in Los Angeles, California by Belizean parents.
College career
Palacio attended Junípero Serra High School in Gardena, California. They played college basketball at Midland College and Colorado State University, going undrafted in 1999. In their three years with the Rams, Palacio averaged 12.1 points, 4.8 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game.
Professional career
In a seven-year NBA career, from 1999 to 2006, Palacio played for the Vancouver Grizzlies, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Toronto Raptors and Utah Jazz, with a career scoring average of 4.8 points per game.
Their most notable achievement was scoring a buzzer beater for the Celtics in their shocking victory over the New Jersey Nets on December 28, 2000. With the Nets leading 111–109 and inbounding the ball with less than 2 seconds remaining, Palacio stole a pass from Lucious Harris and threw up an off-balance shot with one hand from 30 feet away. Improbably, the shot was made, giving the Celtics a 112–111 victory. Basketball writers dubbed Palacio with the nickname "Miracle Milt", as a recognition of this incredible incident.
Despite a solid season with the Jazz, Palacio was a free agent at the start of the 2006–07 preseason. They eventually caught on with the Seattle SuperSonics, but was waived before the regular season start, unable to unseat Mike Wilks as the third-string point guard behind Luke Ridnour and Earl Watson.
In the 2007–08 season, Palacio began an overseas adventure, signing for ex-European champions Partizan in Serbia. While struggling mightily at times to begin the year, they learned the European game quickly, playing some great basketball in the second half of the season and being named Euroleague's MVP for the month of March 2008, helping Partizan reach the last 8 of the competition for the first time in 10 years. In this season Palacio won triple crown with Partizan, winning the Basketball League of Serbia, Serbian Cup and ABA League.
During the 2008 summer transfer window, Palacio moved to the Russian team Khimki. After a year there, in September 2009, they rejoined Partizan, but was released from their contract few weeks later, after they had not joined the team on time. On January 5, 2010, Palacio signed a contract with the Greek League team Kavala. In 16 games for Kavala, Palacio averaged 10.3 points, 2.6 assists and 2.6 rebounds per game, which has helped the club avoid relegation.
On May 4, 2010, Palacio moved to Spain and signed with Caja Laboral by the end of the 2009–10 season. They helped the Basque team to win the national title for the third time in the club history, beating Barcelona 3–0 in the final series. They then returned to Kavala in August 2010, signing a one-year contract. They averaged 15.7 points, 3.8 assists and 1.3 steals during the regular season, and thus led the team to the playoffs. After the team was eliminated by PAOK, Palacio again moved to Caja Laboral until the end of the 2010–11 season.
In August 2011, Palacio signed a one-year deal with Blu:sens Monbús, where they averaged 6.4 points and 2.4 assists in the 2011–12 season. During the summer of 2012, Palacio played for Piratas de Quebradillas in Puerto Rico. They started the 2012–13 season with Bnei HaSharon in Israel, but finished with Lietuvos rytas in Lithuania.
Coaching career
In 2013, Palacio joined Don Verlin's staff at the University of Idaho as director of player development.
On September 20, 2019, Palacio was rehired as an assistant coach by the Long Island Nets, the NBA Development League affiliate of the Brooklyn Nets after a successful 2018-2019 season.
On August 2, 2021, Palacio was hired as an assistant coach by the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). On October 7, 2021, Palacio was placed on administrative leave when they were indicted with a group of former NBA players who had allegedly committed insurance fraud.
National team career
In their first international tournament, Palacio led Belize to a gold medal at the 1998 CARICOM Basketball Championship, which the country hosted.
Palacio was also a member of the team that won a silver medal at the 2009 FIBA COCABA Championship, held in Cancún, Mexico, losing in the finals of the hosts 106–103.

Elina Duni (born 10 March 1981, Tirana, Albania) is a Swiss-Albanian jazz singer and composer. They left Albania at the age of ten to live and study in Geneva, Switzerland. They went on to study singing, composition and teaching at the University of the Arts Bern, but from 2004 onwards Albanian folk music became a prime influence. At this moment, in 2004, they formed a quartet under their own name with the Swiss jazz pianist Colin Vallon, bassist Patrice Moret and drummer Norbert Pfammatter. In a review, John Fordham concluded that "This quartet definitely sounds like rising star material for ECM." After two albums – Baresha (2008) and Lume Lume (2010) – on Meta Records, the quartet went on to record for ECM in 2012, with Matanë Malit (Beyond the Mountain) and in 2015, Dallëndyshe (Swallow). In 2014, they released their first album as a singer-songwriter in Kosovo and Albania, entitled Muza e Zezë (The Black Muse). In 2017, they were nominated to receive the annual Swiss Music Prize and in October of the same year they started a new project - a duo with the jazz guitarist Rob Luft. The album Partir, a solo programme in which they accompany themselves on piano, acoustic guitar and percussion was recorded in 2017 and released by ECM the following year. They sing in nine different languages on that solo studio album.
Being musically a duo and also privately a couple, Duni now lives with Rob Luft in London, after many years in Zurich before. The 2020 album Lost Ships comprehends six Duni/Luft originals and six interpretations. Sidemen are Matthieu Michel on flugelhorn and multi-instrumentalist Fred Thomas on piano and percussion.

Governor Newell was a sternwheel-driven steamboat that operated from 1883 to 1902 in the Pacific Northwest.
Gov. Newell was owned by Capt. Charles Oliver Hill (1853–1944), whose wife, Minnie Hill was the first woman west of the Mississippi river to hold a steamboat captain's license.
Gov. Newell was named after William A. Newell, governor of the Washington Territory from 1880 to 1884.
Construction
Gov. Newell was built at Portland, Oregon for the Shoalwater Transportation Company, making its trial trip on August 26, 1883 under the command of Capt.James P. Whitcomb (1824-1901).
Gov. Newell was fitted out by the Shoalwater Bay Transportation Company. Louis Alfred Loomis, later the founder of the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, was president of the company in April 1883.
Capt. William H. Clough was also a member of Shoalwater Bay Transportation Co. Perry Scott, brother of famous steamboat captain Uriah Bonser Scott, assisted in the fitting out of Gov. Newell.
Dimensions
Gov. Newell was long exclusive of the extension of the main deck, called the "fantail" on which the sternwheel was mounted. The boat had a beam of , exclusive of the protective timbers running outside of the top of the sides of the hull called guards. Gov. Newell had a depth of hold of .
The overall size of the vessel was 203.87 gross tons (a unit of volume, not weight) and 134.41 registered tons.
The official merchant vessel registry number was 85806.
Engineering
Steam for the engines of Gov. Newell was generated by a wood-fired boiler. When engaged in towing work, Gov. Newell could be handled with the captain, a mate, the engineer, and two firefighters. Power was generated by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, cylinder bore and stroke of .
Early career
Gov. Newell was sent down to Astoria, Oregon, where on September 7, 1883, the steamer made a trial trip from Astoria to Knappa, Oregon, starting at about 11:00 a.m. On board were Capt. John Henry Dix ("J.H.D") Gray, lumber mill owner John Corse Trullinger, and other local dignitaries. According to a report in the Daily Astorian, the Gov. Newell "goes to Gray's harbor on the first favorable opportunity, where a profitable trade awaits her."
Gov. Newell did not serve long on Willapa Bay, then known as Shoalwater Bay. The Shoalwater Bay Transportation Company decided to transfer Gov. Newell to Grays Harbor.
In May 1885, Gov. Newell had a contract to carry the mail on a route from Aberdeen, W.T. up the Chehalis River. Capt. James P. Whitcomb (1824-1901) was master of Gov. Newell on the mail run between Montesano, Washington and Westport, Washington, as was their son, Capt. George A. Whitcomb (1854-1939). Westport was then known as Peterson's Point. William H. Clough was the boat's engineer at the time. Gov. Newell proved to be not profitable on Grays Harbor.
In 1885 Gov Newell was returned to the Columbia River, where it was operated for a short time by Capt. Charles Haskell.
In July 1886, there was talk of lining Gov. Newell upriver through the Cascades Rapids to operate the boat in opposition to the boats of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, which was apparently taking away too much business from Gov. Newell and an associated vessel, Lurline, at the mouth of the Columbia river.
John C. Trullinger bought Gov. Newell in 1887. Capt. Perry A. Trullinger, son of John C Trullinger, ran the boat briefly on the route from Astoria to Westport, Oregon.
By August 1887, Gov. Newell was carrying Sunday excursions out of Astoria, Oregon.
In late November 1887, Gov. Newell was hired to tow the burned hulk of the elite steamer Telephone back to Portland from Astoria, where Telephone had been nearly destroyed by fire.

In January 1887, Gov. Newell was owned by John Corse Trullinger (1828-1901). Trullinger had hired John Cox to act as captain of Gov. Newell. In a bitter argument that month after Newell had sustained some damage towing a ship downriver to Astoria, Trullinger accused Cox of trying to sink Gov. Newell on behalf of the powerful Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. Trullinger withheld Cox's wages, but Trullinger's accusation was found in subsequent litigation to be baseless.
Sale to Charles and Minnie Hill
In May 1888 Gov. Newell was for sale. The steamer was purchased for $7,500 by a husband and wife team of steamboat captains, Charles O. and Minnie Hill.
The Hills had raised the money themselves from successful trading operations on the Columbia river, starting from small steamers and working up.
Minnie Hill was the first woman west of the Mississippi river to hold a steamboat captain's license, which they obtained on November 30, 1887.
On Gov. Newell, Charles ran the engineering department while Minnie steered the boat from the pilot house. In addition to navigating the boat, Minnie Hill ran a general merchandise store on the upper deck, where they were reportedly an "excellent hand at making a shrewd bargain."
In October 1889 Gov. Newell was in operation on the lower Columbia river, bringing barges down to Astoria.
Later operations
James D. Miller, a well-known steamboat captain, served on Gov. Newell during 1891-92.
On September 24, 1893, when a fire broke out the Pacific Coast grain elevator in Portland, Oregon, and two ships loading grain were moored at the elevator's dock were threatened with destruction, Gov. Newell and the sternwheeler Wm. G. Hoag pushed them out away from the docks, saving the ships.
In September 1895, the Hills, on Gov. Newell, were buying fish in the Columbia River, near the mouth of the Cowlitz River.
In early July 1897, when the Vancouver ferry was out of service for several days, its place was taken by Gov. Newell. Gov. Newell could carry passengers, but there were complaints by drovers because the steamer could not accommodate teams.
Alienation of affections lawsuit
In early 1896, Frederick Clifford Mossman and their wife, Jennie May, were living on the Gov. Newell. Jennie May Mossman was reported in newspaper reports of the time to have been the sister of Capt. Minnie Hill.
Some months later, Frederick Mossman brought suit against Charles O. Hill, alleging that Hill had alienated the affections of Mossman's wife. Specifically, Mossman sought $25,000 from Hill, claiming that "his wife was induced to be unfaithful to their marriage vow, through the arts, flattery and persuasion of the defendant" on account of which Mossman claimed to have "suffered great mental distress and that their happy home and the honor and good name of their family have been forever ruined."
In defense, Charles O. Hill admitted that they had had improper relations with Jennie May Mossman, but it was they who tempted them rather than the other way around, and that the whole affair was an attempt by the Mossmans to get Hill to pay them a large amount of money. The case went to trial in July 1896. Capt. Minnie Hill was in San Francisco, California at the time of the trial.
Disposition
According to a non-contemporaneous source, Gov. Newell was abandoned in 1900. According to a contemporaneous newspaper account, in 1902 Charles O. Hill, owner of Gov. Newell, had a new sternwheeler built at Johnson's shipyard in Portland. Engines for the new steamer were to come from Gov. Newell.
The new boat, which included the cabin structure and some of the machinery of Gov. Newell, was named Paloma.
Captain Hill moored old hull of Gov. Newell at the foot of East Madison Street, where it eventually sank. Sediment washed down in floods covered the old hulk, and by 1911 it had become a significant obstacle to harbor dredging operations.

Moutohora Island (previously known as Whale Island) () is a small uninhabited island located off the Bay of Plenty coast of New Zealand's North Island, about north of the town of Whakatane. The island is a remnant of a complex volcano which has eroded, leaving two peaks. This is still an area of volcanic activity and there are hot springs on the island in Sulphur Valley, McEwans Bay, and Sulphur Bay.
Name
The Māori name, , is a contracted form of , meaning "Whale Island" or "Captured Whale". The spelling "Moutohorā " (with a macron) is sometimes also used in English, although the official name of the island omits it. The spelling "Motuhora" is also used. ( is the Māori name for the southern right whale.)
History
Numerous archaeological sites of both Māori and European origin have been recorded, including an extensive pa (fortified earthworks) site on Pa Hill and a number of house terraces and garden sites, middens (food refuse dumps), stone tool manufacture areas and stone walls. After permanent Maori occupation ceased in the early nineteenth century, Ngāti Awa and Tūhoe continued to visit the island for seafood and muttonbirds and to collect stones for hāngi (underground ovens).
The first European occupation came in the 1830s with an unsuccessful attempt to establish a shore-based whaling station. The venture failed without a single whale being captured. Forty years later came attempts to make money from sulphur. It was extracted and sold to a refinery in Auckland over a number of years but was of poor quality, and the venture was abandoned in 1895. The next phase of industrial activity came in 1915, when quarrying provided rock for the construction of the Whakatane harbour wall. A total of of rock was removed over five years.
Local government
The island is not included in the boundaries of a territorial authority council (district council) and the Minister of Local Government is its territorial authority, with support from the Department of Internal Affairs.
Ecology
In 1965 Moutohora was declared as a wildlife refuge, named as Moutohora Wildlife Management Reserve, and the island was bought by the Crown in 1984. Once the goats which had been introduced to the island were eradicated, a planting programme began and 12,000 plants covering 45 species are now established. Today Moutohora is covered with a mosaic of pōhutukawa, māhoe, kānuka, bracken and grassland.
There are 190 native and 110 introduced plant species. The island is now completely free of the goats, rats, cats and rabbits which previously devastated native plants and animals. The most significant feature of Moutohora's current fauna is the breeding colony of grey-faced petrels. Sooty shearwaters, little blue penguins, the threatened New Zealand dotterel and variable oystercatchers also breed on the island. Threatened species which are occasional visitors are the Caspian tern, the North Island kaka and New Zealand falcon. Other species present include common forest birds, captive-bred red crowned parakeets, three lizard species and fur seals. Surrounding areas hosts rich marine ecosystem including cetaceans, oceanic birds, sharks. Most common of cetaceans are smaller species such as common and bottlenose dolphins, pilot whales, and killer whales while larger migratory baleen whales (southern rights and rorquals) and toothed whales including beaked whales also appear from time to time.
In March 1999 local Ngati Awa and the New Zealand Department of Conservation joined forces to see the fulfilment of a dream. Forty North Island saddleback (tieke) were transferred from Cuvier Island (Repanga), off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, to Moutohora.
This relocation followed the traditional flight made centuries ago when the Mataatua waka (canoe) was accompanied by two tieke from Repanga to Whakatane. This flight followed the drowning of the twin sons of Muriwai, sister of Toroa, the captain of the waka. The two tieke settled briefly on Moutohora before returning to Cuvier Island.
Access
Public access to Moutohora is restricted to Department of Conservation concession holders and approved scientific parties. During periods of high fire danger all access may be declined. The current concession holders are the local Maori tribe of Ngati Awa and three Whakatane based tourist operators - Prosail /Whale Island Kayaking, Diveworks Charters Whale Island Tours and Ngāti Awa Tourism.
In popular culture
In the fictional Harry Potter universe, Moutohora is the home of a professional Quidditch team, the Moutohora Macaws. The team players wear robes of red, yellow and blue.
The racing video game Redout hosts one of the racing complexes at Moutohora called the Volcano.

Cynthia Gooding (August 12, 1924 – February 10, 1988) was an American folk singer who recorded traditional songs from various countries for Elektra Records in the 1950s and 1960s. Judy Collins wrote that they had been "inspired" by them
Life and career
They were born in Rochester, Minnesota, and grew up in Lake Forest, Illinois. In their late teens they lived in Mexico City, where they acquired a love of folk music and the blues, learned Spanish, and developed their talents as a singer and guitar player. On returning to the US in the mid-1940s, they moved to New York City, and—encouraged by Josh White—began singing folk songs in Greenwich Village clubs, particularly with regular appearances at the Soho club and, later, Gerdes Folk City. Described as tall and elegant, they developed a following in New York, and their repertoire expanded to include Turkish as well as traditional English songs, and Spanish, Mexican and Italian folk songs. They married Turkish-born Hasan Özbekhan in 1949; they divorced in the late 1950s.
After meeting Jac Holzman, who had recently set up Elektra Records, they recorded four 10-inch LPs for the label in 1953 and 1954. The cover sleeves were designed by Maurice Sendak, and the albums helped establish Elektra as a source of folk and world music and allowed Holzman to expand into new business premises. Holzman later said:"I met Cynthia Gooding and their husband at one of those folk parties in Greenwich Village, which I sometimes describe as one of those places where there were a lot of wing chairs, candles, bullfight posters, and cheap wine. People would pass the guitar around, and it got passed to them I was pretty impressed... They were one of the earliest artists I recorded. I remember being leery of someone not indigenous to those cultures singing those songs. I certainly knew the Moorish-Spanish connection, but I was unsure about their accent. I went to a couple of people and they said 'she's pure Castilian,' so that was okay with me. They did everything well. It was fun recording with her."
On Friday, January 27, 1956, Gooding rented Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall for $100, and presumably performed songs from their Elektra releases in the space. They wrote in the original liner notes that they obtained the songs from various sources, including street musicians; one of the Mexican songs was "La Bamba," recorded several years before Ritchie Valens' hit version. In 1957, material from two of the 10-inch LPs was combined into a single 12-inch album, Cynthia Gooding Sings Spanish, Mexican and Turkish Folk Songs. They also released two more LPs that year, Cynthia Gooding Sings of Faithful Lovers..., and A Young Man and A Maid: Love Songs of Many Lands, which included several duets with Theodore Bikel. They also released Languages of Love on the Riverside label in 1958, and the misleadingly titled The Best of Cynthia Gooding on the Prestige International label the following year.
In about 1960, they began hosting "Folksinger's Choice", a regular radio program on WBAI in New York. They made many recordings around Greenwich Village and elsewhere, as research and material for their shows, and in early 1962 conducted the first radio interview with Bob Dylan, before their first album was released. Gooding toured nationally, with their two daughters, and traveled to Spain where they collected recordings of flamenco music and befriended musicians including leading
flamenco singer Juan Talega and guitarist Diego del Gastor.
After returning to the US in 1964, they lived in Princeton, New Jersey. They recorded an album of nursery rhymes with Don Drake, and in the late 1960s traveled around the US as part of a National Endowment for the Humanities program. They continued to make occasional performances during the 1970s.
They died of cancer in Kingston, New Jersey, in 1988, at the age of 63.

The Casa del Labrador is a neoclassical palace in Aranjuez, Spain. The name means "house of the farm labourer", and was borrowed from an earlier building on the site, although the new building was intended for royal use. It was designed to complement the Royal Palace, providing a place for the royal family to spend the day without some of the customary restrictions of court life.
Architecture
The initial design was by the royal architect, Juan de Villanueva for King Charles IV.
A cartouche on the facade gives the date as 1803.
The work was completed by Isidro González Velázquez.
Decorations
The French designer Jean-Démosthène Dugourc, who entered Charles IV's service after the French Revolution broke out, made an important contribution to the interior decorations.
The marble floors incorporate some Roman mosaics found in Merida.
There are murals by Zacarías González Velázquez.
Access and conservation
The Casa del Labrador is set in a park called the Jardín del Príncipe bordering the River Tagus.
Access to the gardens surrounding the Casa del Labrador is free, but there is a charge to visit the house itself which is in the care of the heritage agency Patrimonio Nacional. The Jardín del Príncipe is also the home of the Faluas Reales Museum, a modern building containing pleasure barges from the royal collection.
In 1993 the building was listed on the Spanish heritage register as a Bien de Interés Cultural under the name "Casita del Labrador".
Also the gardens in which it is set are protected as a Jardín Histórico.
Since 2001 Aranjuez has been conserved as part of a World Heritage Site, the Aranjuez Cultural Landscape.

Clan Carnegie is a Lowland Scottish clan.
History
Origins of the clan
Walter de Maule made a grant of the lands and barony of Carnegie, in the parish of Carmyllie, Angus to John de Balinhard in 1358. However, there is no certain record of the origins of the Balinhards, except that their lands were near Arbroath, Angus. Alexander Nisbet suggested that the Balinhards were related to the Ramsays, although there is no direct evidence to support this.
15th and 16th century clan conflicts
In about 1401 Duthac de Carnegie acquired part of the lands of Kinnaird, in Forfarshire (Angus). They subsequently owned them from Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany in a charter dated 21 February 1409 confirming the lands. Duthac de Carnegie was killed at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411. They left an infant son, Walter Carnegie of Kinnaird who fought for James II of Scotland at the Battle of Brechin in May 1452 along with the Earl of Huntly. Their enemies were rebels commanded by the Earl of Crawford (chief of Clan Lindsay) who were defeated. However Crawford, in revenge, burned the village of Kinnaird.
John Carnegie of Kinnaird fought at the Battle of Flodden where they were killed in 1513. Their son was Sir Robert Carnegie who extended Kinnaird and was appointed one of the judges of the College of Justice in 1547. They were also sent to England in 1548 to negotiate the ransom of the Earl of Huntly who had been captured at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. Sir Robert Carnegie is said to have been the first of the family to claim that their ancestors were cup bearers to the king of Scots and the family arms bear an antique cup as reference to this royal office.
Sir Robert's son was John Carnegie who was a faithful and loyal adherent to Mary, Queen of Scots and unlike many they never abandoned their loyalty to the queen. They died in 1595 and the estates passed to their younger brother, Sir David Carnegie.
17th century and Civil War
David Carnegie was created Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird in April 1616 and was later advanced to the rank of Earl of Southesk in June 1633. Sir John Carnegie, brother of David, was elevated to the peerage in 1639 as Lord Lour and was created Earl of Ethie in 1647.
James Carnegie, 2nd Earl of Southesk attended the exiled king Charles II of England in Holland in 1650. They were also one of the Commissioners chosen to sit in the Parliament of England for Scotland during The Protectorate. They were nearly killed however, in a duel with the Master of Gray in London in 1660. The younger son of the third Earl did not have such a fortunate duelling career and was killed in 1681 in Paris by William, son of Elizabeth Maitland, Duchess of Lauderdale.
18th century and Jacobite risings
The Clan Carnegie were Jacobites. The fourth Earl took no part in opposing the Glorious Revolution of 1688 but afterwards shunned the royal court. Their son, the fifth Earl, followed the Old Pretender during the Jacobite rising of 1715 and as a result was attained by an Act of Parliament and their estates were forfeited to the Crown. The fifth Earl died in 1730 and all of their children had died young, as was the high rate of infant mortality at the time. They were succeeded by John Carnegie of Pittarrow who was descended from a younger son of the first Earl. This line of Carnegies had been created Baronets of Nova Scotia in 1663.
Modern history
The sixth Baronet was a distinguished soldier and in 1855 they were able to secure an Act of Parliament that reversed the attainder and restored the titles of Earl of Southesk as well as Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird and Leuchars. The ninth Earl chose the title of Baron of Balinhaird in reference to their family's origins and early ancestry.

May Ayni is a river of the Nile basin. Rising in the mountains of Dogu'a Tembien in northern Ethiopia, it flows southwestward to empty finally in Giba and Tekezé River.
Characteristics
It is a confined ephemeral river, locally meandering in its narrow alluvial plain, with an average slope gradient of 51 metres per kilometre. With its tributaries, the river has cut a deep gorge.
Flash floods and flood buffering
Runoff mostly happens in the form of high runoff discharge events that occur in a very short period (called flash floods). These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding baseflow.
The magnitude of floods in this river has however been decreased due to interventions in the catchment. On steep slopes, exclosures have been established; the dense vegetation largely contributes to enhanced infiltration, less flooding and better baseflow. Physical conservation structures such as stone bunds and check dams also intercept runoff.
Boulders and pebbles in the river bed
Boulders and pebbles encountered in the river bed can originate from any location higher up in the catchment. In the uppermost stretches of the river, only rock fragments of the upper lithological units will be present in the river bed, whereas more downstream one may find a more comprehensive mix of all lithologies crossed by the river. From upstream to downstream, the following lithological units occur in the catchment.
Amba Aradam Formation
Mekelle Dolerite
Antalo Limestone
Quaternary freshwater tufa

Verjaget, zerstreuet, zerrüttet, ihr Sterne (Dispel them, disperse them, you heavens), BWV 249b, is a lost cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was a birthday cantata composed for Joachim Friederich von Flemming, governor of Leipzig, and was first performed in Leipzig on 25 August 1726. The cantata text was written by Picander.
Count Flemming is also associated with a later Bach cantata O angenehme Melodei, BWV 210a.
Possible relationship with the Easter Oratorio
The number assigned to Verjaget, zerstreuet, zerrüttet, ihr Sterne in the BWV catalogue indicates that some twentieth-century scholars thought the work was related to the Easter Oratorio BWV 249, which was first performed in 1725 at Easter.
The case for this linkage is based on Bach's habit of recycling music for "one-off" occasions in a process called parody. The Easter Oratorio is an example of parody, being based on a lost work, Entfliehet, verschwindet, entweichet, ihr Sorgen, BWV 249a, premiered in February 1725. BWV 249a, like BWV 249b, was a birthday cantata with a text by Picander.
It has been possible to reconstruct the music of BWV 249a, matching the score of the Easter Oratorio to Picander's secular text. However, in the case of Verjaget, zerstreuet, zerrüttet, ihr Sterne there is no known reconstruction.

Lactarius quietus (commonly known as the oak milkcap, oakbug milkcap or southern milkcap) is a mushroom of the genus Lactarius. It is easily identified by its oily scent and the concentric bands on its cap. It is brown, and is probably named after its matt, "quiet" surface and colouration. It is found exclusively under oak trees in Europe, where it grows solitarily or in scattered groups in autumn months. In North America, the variety L. quietus var. incanus is fairly common in the same habitat. The mushroom's edibility is disputed.
Taxonomy and naming
Lactarius quietus was first described and named by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries, who named it Agaricus quietus in the first volume of their Systema Mycologicum, published in 1821. In their later Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici, published in 1838, Fries transferred the species to Lactarius. Subsequent attempts to reclassify the species were unsuccessful; in 1871, Paul Kummer described the species as a member of Galorrheus, and in 1891 Otto Kuntze classified it as Lactifluus, but today Fries's placement of the species in Lactarius is accepted. The specific epithet quietus means "quiet" or "calm", and is possibly used to refer to the unintrusive colours of the cap.
The variety Lactarius quietus var. unicolor was described by Fries in the second volume of their Monographia Hymenomycetum Sueciae, published in 1863. The variety Lactarius quietus var. incanus was described by Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their 1979 North American species of Lactarius. The name incanus translates as :hoary", referring to the whited bloom which can sometimes be seen on the mushrooms.
Lactarius quietus is known by the common names oak milkcap, oakbug milkcap and the southern milkcap. Lactarius quietus var. incanus is commonly known as the burnt sugar lactarius.
Description
Lactarius quietus typically has a convex cap of across, which later flattens or develops a small depression in the centre. In colour, the cap is a dull reddish brown with a tint of cinnamon, sometimes with darker concentric bands or spots. This zoning is one of the most distinctive features of the species. The cap is dry and matt, and not sticky when moist. It features a thick layer of firm, whitish-buff flesh. The stem measures from in height, and is typically thick. It is cylindrical in shape, but is sometimes furrowed lengthways, and it lacks a ring. It is concolorous with the cap, or a little darker, and is sometimes hollow. The brownish-white gills are slightly decurrent, and change colour with age to a pale reddish brown with mauve hints. The milk is white or cream in colour. The mushroom has a distinctive, strong oily smell, which has also been likened to bedbugs and wet laundry. The spores are oval, with plentiful warts joined by numerous ridges, forming a well-developed network. The spores typically measure 7.5 to 9 by 6.5 to 7.5 µm, and leave a cream print.
var. incanus
Lactarius quietus var. incanus is typically slightly larger than the nominate variety, and younger specimens feature a whitish bloom, after which the variant is named. It has a sweet smell reminiscent of maple syrup, and can be commonly found under oak trees. It can be confused with L. aquifluus and L. mutabilis, but both of these species are found in coniferous woodland.
Edibility
Lactarius quietus has been variously described as edible and inedible. The milk has a mild or slightly bitter taste. L. quietus var. incanus also has conflicting reports concerning its edibility, and so is not recommended.
Habitat, ecology and areas of spreading
Lactarius quietus is found growing exclusively at the base of oak trees, solitarily or in scattered groups, in soil. It can be found very commonly throughout autumn months. It is ectomycorrhizal, feeding symbiotically exclusively with oak, though studies have suggested it is also able to feed saprotrophically, growing from organic soil matter. L. quietus can be found only in Europe; in the United Kingdom, it is one of the one hundred most commonly encountered mushroom species. L. quietus var. incanus is found commonly in eastern North America.

The Brown Palace Hotel, now The Brown Palace Hotel and Spa, Autograph Collection, is a historic hotel in Denver, Colorado, United States. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the second-longest operating hotel in Denver. It is one of the first atrium-style hotels ever built. It is now operated by HEI Hotels and Resorts, and joined Marriott's Autograph Collection Hotels in 2012. The hotel is located at 321 17th Street between 17th Street, Broadway and Tremont Place in downtown Denver behind the Republic Plaza. The main entrance door is on Tremont Place.
History
The hotel was built in 1892 of sandstone and red granite, one year later than the Oxford Hotel. It was named for its original owner, Henry C. Brown, who had homesteaded the Capitol Hill area, and was designed with its distinctive triangular shape by architect Frank Edbrooke, who also designed the Oxford Hotel. The interior and the exterior of the building are considered to be the "finest extant example" of Edbrooke's work.
Built with an iron and steel frame covered with cement and sandstone by the Whitehouse & Wirgler Stone Company, the building was "one of America's first fireproof structures, according to a May 21, 1892 cover story in Scientific American." Upon its completion it was Denver's tallest building.
In the early 1930s Colorado muralist Allen Tupper True began discussing the possibility of creating two murals for the hotel with then owner Denver financier Charles Boettcher and after some delay the two works, Stage Coach and Airplane Travel were unveiled in the hotel's lobby in 1937.
In 1935, as a celebration of the Repeal of Prohibition in the United States, Denver architect Alan Fisher designed "Ship Tavern"; one of four restaurants inside The Brown Palace.
Annex
The 22-story, 231-room tower directly across Tremont Place was built as a new wing of the hotel in 1959, known as the Brown Palace West. For many years it operated as a budget wing of the hotel, until the Brown Palace's owners branded the guest rooms in the annex as a Comfort Inn in 1988, and then as a Holiday Inn Express in December 2014. The lower levels of the tower are shared with the Brown Palace, including the Grand Ballroom and executive offices. The tower is connected to the main building by a skybridge over Tremont Place and a service tunnel running under the street.
Past guests
Past guests include the "Unsinkable" Molly Brown (she stayed at the hotel only a week after the Titanic disaster), infamous Denver crime boss Jefferson "Soapy" Smith, Dr. Sun Yat Sen (just before becoming the president of the new Republic of China), Queen Marie of Romania, John Wayne, and The Beatles. Presidential guests include William Taft, Warren Harding, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton.
Murders of 1911
The hotel was the site of the high-profile 1911 murders in which Frank Henwood shot and killed Sylvester Louis "Tony" von Phul, and accidentally killed an innocent bystander, George Copeland, in the hotel's "Marble Bar." Henwood and von Phul were rivals for (or shared) the affections of Denver socialite Isabel Springer, the wife of wealthy Denver business person and political candidate John W. Springer. The murders culminated in a series of very public trials.
Popular culture
The hotel features in the 2017 Jane Fonda and Robert Redford film Our Souls at Night. The Brown Palace is featured on many of Denver's cultural tours.

Poldark is a British historical drama television series based on the novels of the same title by Winston Graham and starring Aidan Turner in the lead role. The book series is 12 novels long but the TV series only portrays the first seven. The series was written and adapted by Debbie Horsfield for the BBC, and directed by several directors throughout its run. Set between 1781 and 1801, the plot follows the title character on their return to Cornwall after the American War of Independence in 1783.
The series first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2015 in eight episodes, and in seven episodes on PBS in the United States, which supported the production, on 21 June 2015 as part of its Masterpiece anthology. The first series was based on the first two Poldark novels by Graham. It is the second screen adaptation of Graham's novels, following a television series broadcast by BBC One between 1975 and 1977.
On 8 April 2015, the BBC announced that a second series had been commissioned which premiered on 4 September 2016, and contained content from the third and fourth Poldark novels. The BBC announced on 6 July 2016, before series two had begun, that a third series had been commissioned based on the fifth and half of the sixth novels. The fourth series began airing on 10 June 2018, based on the sixth (second half) and seventh novels. Filming for the fifth and final series started in September 2018 and it was broadcast in July 2019. The final series ends the story in the year 1801, that is nine years before the time-setting of the eighth novel The Stranger from the Sea. The storyline for the fifth series was meant to give insight into Ross's story between the seventh and eighth novel, The Angry Tide and The Stranger from the Sea.
Plot overview
In 1783 Captain Ross Vennor Poldark returns from the American War of Independence to their home of Nampara in Cornwall after three years in the army.

Production
The series was one of the final commissions by former BBC One controller Danny Cohen. Filming began in Cornwall and Bristol in April 2014. The production company is Mammoth Screen. Independent Television (ITV) bought the production company and worked on the second series. The production base for each series was The Bottle Yard Studios in Bristol, England, where purpose-built sets for Poldark's home 'Nampara' and The Red Lion pub have been located since series 1. For series 4, 18 sets were built across 3 studios at The Bottle Yard Studios, including five composite houses (Poldark in Cornwall and London, the Warleggans in Cornwall and London and the Whitworth Vicarage) and a period-correct scale replica of the House of Commons. Production offices, construction, prop workshops and extensive costume department were also based at the Studios.
Filming locations include the north Cornwall coast at St Agnes Head, which represents the 'Nampara Valley', and the Botallack Mine near St Just in Penwith, which is featured as 'Wheal Leisure', the mine that Ross Poldark attempts to resurrect. The beach of Church Cove, Gunwalloe on the Lizard Peninsula was used as a location for a shipwreck scene. Town scenes were filmed at Corsham in Wiltshire. and in Frome, Somerset. The underground scenes were filmed at Poldark Mine in Cornwall. Some interior scenes were shot at Prior Park College in Bath, Somerset. Charlestown near St Austell stood in for the city of Truro. Other film locations include Porthgwarra on the St Aubyn Estates, Porthcothan beach near Newquay, Bodmin Moor, St Breward, the coast between Botallack and Levant, cliffs in the Padstow area, Porthcothan near Newquay, Holywell Bay, Porthcurno, Kynance Cove, Predannack Wollas on The Lizard and Park Head near Porthcothan, all in Cornwall. In Tetbury, Gloucestershire the house portrayed as Trenwith, is managed by the Historic Houses Association (HHA) and the house was used for other series including Wolf Hall, Lark Rise to Candleford, and Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Filming of Series 4 was reported in Wells, Somerset. Series 5, aired in 2019, added several new cast members. Screenwriter Debbie Horsfield wrote Series 5.
The theme music for the series was composed by Anne Dudley.
Broadcasts and reception

In the United States, the series began to be broadcast in June 2015 on PBS, shown as part of the series Masterpiece.
Poldark commenced screening on ABC TV in Australia on 12 April 2015, and in New Zealand on 22 April 2015 on Prime. The series has also been airing since 2015 on the UK-based Persian language satellite television network Manoto 1 which beams into different areas in Europe and the Middle East for Persian speakers. It was shown on SVT in Sweden, the first series in autumn 2015, and the second series in spring 2017. On YLE in Finland, the first and second series aired from October 2016 to February 2017. The series was shown on NRK in Norway, starting in September 2015. In early 2018 Poldark Series 1 was also broadcast on Dutch public television NPO KRO-NCRV. In the autumn and early summer of 2019, Series 2 aired on Saturday evenings.
Critical reception
On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an approval rating of 91% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Like an epic romance novel come to life, Poldark offers a sumptuous visual feast, from gorgeous scenery to a charming, handsome lead." On Metacritic, season one has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Reviewing season 1, Mike Hale of The New York Times called the series "Sweeping, stirring, rousing...good stuff" and their colleague Sarah Seltzer also wrote: "the series delivers immediately on the panoramic scenery and romance that this genre demands: plunging cliffs, green fields, galloping horses and burning glances aplenty".
Brian Lowry of Variety wrote: "Turner brings the necessary swoon-worthy qualities to the emotionally wounded lead...but the cast is uniformly good." Lowry also praised the "gorgeous photography" and the "haunting, wonderfully romantic score." Keith Uhlich of The Hollywood Reporter made positive comparisons to the kind of romance novels sold in airports and said "This is trash done ecstatically well."
On Rotten Tomatoes, seasons 3, and 5 hold respective ratings of 100%, and 86%, with season five's consensus reading: "Poldarks final season gives fans exactly what they want: emotionally involving period drama fueled by exceptional chemistry with just the right amount of ridiculousness."
Reviewing season 5, Emine Saner of The Guardian called it "gloriously entertaining" and although they were critical of the series for "its jumpy approach to time and ludicrous storylines" and called it an "unwieldy anachronistic beast of a story", they praised the performances of Turner and Tomlinson and the resonance they gave to the story. Therefore, Emnie called it "the perfect farewell."
Rosamund Barteau, Winston Graham's daughter, said that in relating to the show, "[O]ur father would have been very, very pleased. They really loved the Poldark novels and even though they wrote all their life they were particularly attached to Poldark....I think what the BBC has done is amazing. The new adaptation is beautiful and very true to my father's words. Debbie Horsfield has done an excellent job, so I am absolutely happy with the treatment they've given it."

Matthias Grossglauser (born 1969 in Niederbipp, Switzerland) is a Swiss communication engineer.  They are a professor of computer science at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and co-director of the Information and Network Dynamics Laboratory (INDY) at EPFL's School of Computer and Communication Sciences School of Basic Sciences.
Career
Grossglauser studied communication systems and electrical engineering at EPFL and at Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively, and graduated from both with Master's degrees in 1994. They received a PhD with the highest honors in computer science from the Pierre and Marie Curie University (UPMC) in Paris in 1998. Their PhD thesis on "Control of Network Resources over Multiple Time-Scales" (in the French original: Contrôle des ressources de réseaux sur des échelles temporelles multiples) was supervised by Jean-Chrysostome Bolot. They then joined AT&T's Networking and Distributed Systems Laboratory (Shannon Labs) at Florham Park, New Jersey as a principal research scientist. In 2003, they moved as an assistant professor to EPFL's School of Computer and Communication Sciences. In 2007, they joined the Nokia Research Center (NRC) in Helsinki first as director of the Internet Laboratory, before becoming head of Data Insight program and member of the CEO Technology Council in 2009. In 2011, they became associate professor at EPFL's School of Computer and Communication Sciences where they were promoted to a full professor position in 2021.
Research
Grossglauser's research focuses on machine learning and data analytics, and on their applications in network science, computational social sciences, and recommender systems. Their fields of interest encompass among others graph mining, mobility mining, epidemics, discrete-choice models, active learning, and network traffic measurement.
Graph Mining: Graph-structured datasets encompass online social networks (OSNs; e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter) and biological networks (e.g., proteins-protein interaction (PPI) and gene regulatory networks) that can be investigated by data analytics techniques to extract knowledge and make predictions. They employ stochastic models for large graphs and analyses them through the application of algorithms to gain a fundamental understanding about the properties of the components.
Mobility Mining: Grossglauser investigates the application of machine learning to harvest the rich structure of mobility date generated by millions of users on the move through their smartphones.  They are interested in applications such as location-based advertisement, navigation and transportation, and augmented reality.
Epidemics: Epidemic models enables the study of dynamics and long-term asymptotics of epidemic processes, such as infectious diseases or the dissemination of ideas in social networks. It also explores measure such as vaccination to slow the process, or deliberate infections to optimize the spread of an opinion. In this field Grossglauser is interested in estimation problems on epidemics under monitoring budget constraints.
Discrete-choice models: They examine new implementation and stochastic models for choices, comparisons, and rankings in online contexts, as well as their issues of large-scale inference and active learning.
Active Learning: They investigate and implements earning methods that balance the competing goal of gaining more knowledge by exploring new data on the fly. Goal is an ad hoc optimisation of the learning process based on the current state of knowledge.
Network traffic measurement: Grossglauser jointly with Nick Duffield is the developer of the trajectory sampling (TS) method. It aims at making traffic measurement for network operators more efficient and less error-prone, while being compatible with existing IP protocols and packet formats. Its development led to the formation of the PSAMP working group at the IETF that standardized TS, and has since become an official IETF standard.
Distinctions
Grossglauser is a fellow of the IEEE (2021), a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), commissioner of the Swiss Federal Communications Commission (ComCom; the independent regulatory authority of the Swiss telecommunications market), and a board member of the Swiss Informatics Research Association (SIRA).
 They are the recipient of the 2014 Best Paper Award at ACM Conference of Online Social Networks for their paper on “Mining Democracy”, the 2012 Winning Algorithm Award at the "Nokia Mobile Data Challenge: Next Place Prediction," the 2006 ACM SIGCOMM/CoNEXT Rising Star Award, the 2001 Best Paper Award at the IEEE INFOCOM for their paper on “Mobility Increases the Capacity of Ad-hoc Wireless Networks”, and the 1998 Cor Baayen Award from the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM).

SV Stahl Thale is a German football club from Thale, Saxony-Anhalt. In 2013 the club had 1,012 members.
History
From the Kreisklasse to the Oberliga and East German cup winners
SV Stahl Thale, then known as BSG EHW Thale, started playing in the Kreisklasse Quedlinburg in 1946, won the Bezirksklasse West in the 1948–49 season and achieved promotion to the DDR-Oberliga in 1950 after a 3–1 final win against BSG Hydrierwerk Zeitz and reaching third place in the promotion play-off round. They were also successful in the FDGB-Pokal, the East German cup, that year, beating BSG Finow 14–1, ZSG Schuhmetro Weißenfels 2–1 and BSG Märkische Volksstimme Babelsberg 3–2 to reach the final on 3 September 1950 at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in East Berlin, where they beat fourth-placed Oberliga team BSG KWU Erfurt 4–0 in front of a crowd of 15,000 to clinch their first and only East German cup title.
Thale started into their first Oberliga season in 1950–51 with the same successful team. At the end of the season, the club came in seventh with 17 wins from 34 matches and were the best promoted team of the season. Striker Werner Oberländer was the third-best goal scorer of the season with 31 goals. After a weaker 1951–52 season, where the club placed 13th out of 19 teams, they reached their best Oberliga result, placing fifth in the 1952–53 season. In the 1953–54 season, however, with only four wins and the worst goal difference of all teams with 28:59, Thale placed last and was relegated to the DDR-Liga.
Football between the second and third tiers
In the 1954–55 season, Thale was unlucky in that the DDR-Liga was reduced from three divisions to one. Since their seventh place was not sufficient for qualification for the new format, they faced the second relegation in a row. The team spent the next seven years in the third-tier II. DDR-Liga until its abandonment in 1963, resulting in a move to the less prestigious Bezirksliga Halle. It took another twelve years at the third level of East German football until Thale won the Bezirksliga in 1976 and thereby qualified for the DDR-Liga. Although the league only had very little sporting value after being expanded to five divisions, Thale finished ninth out of twelve teams in 1977 and were relegated back to the Bezirksliga as second to last in 1978. There, the team could regenerate, won the Bezirksliga again and spent the next five years in the DDR-Liga. They spent three more seasons in the Bezirksliga from 1984 to 1987. By then, the DDR-Liga had been reduced to two divisions again and the Bezirksliga champions had to participate in promotion play-off rounds. While Thale failed to win this play-off in 1985, they were promoted back to the DDR-Liga a year later and managed to stay there until the end of East German football, even finishing the 1987–88 season as runners-up of the southern division.

Since 1990
The club was re-founded after the German reunification in 1990 and was integrated in the southern division of the newly created fourth-tier NOFV-Liga Nordost, finishing the inaugural 1990–91 season in third place. In 1992, the football team wanted to separate themselves from the rest of the club and founded Sportvereinigung Thale 04 to commemorate the club of the same name founded in 1904. However, the newly created team had too little sporting substance and was therefore relegated to the fifth-tier Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt at the end of the 1992–93 season. After relegation to the sixth-tier Landesliga in the 1999–2000 season, the new club was disbanded and the team returned to SV Stahl Thale in 2001. After spending the 2002–03 season in the seventh-tier Kreisliga Quedlinburg, they were promoted back to the Landesliga in 2005. At the end of the 2010–11 season, the club was relegated to the eighth-tier Landesklasse Sachsen-Anhalt. In 2013, they returned to the Landesliga for five seasons before dropping to the Landesklasse again.

A hickey, hickie or love bite in British English, is a bruise or bruise-like mark caused by kissing or sucking skin, usually on the neck, arm, or earlobe. While biting may be part of giving a hickey, sucking is sufficient to burst small superficial blood vessels under the skin.
Etymology
The origin of the word is from its earlier meaning of "pimple, skin lesion" (c. 1915); perhaps a sense extension and spelling variation from the earlier word meaning "small gadget, device; any unspecified object" which has an unknown origin (1909).
Treatment
Hickeys typically last from 5 to 12 days and may be treated in the same way as other bruises. Ways to reduce the appearance of hickeys include icing recent hickeys to reduce swelling, rubbing them with a chilled spoon to remove the bruise, and applying a warm compress to older hickeys to dilate vessels and promote blood flow. They can be covered with a concealer or powder corresponding to the sufferer's skin tone, or a fake tan. Alternatively, articles of clothing such as scarves, snoods, turtle necks, or sleeves may be used to conceal hickeys.

Melaleuca dichroma is a shrub in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is unusual for its genus in that its flowers are yellow or creamy-white but age to a pinkish-red.
Description
Melaleuca dichroma is a shrub which can grow to a height of . The leaves are arranged alternately, linear to narrow oval in shape, long, wide and lack a stalk.
The flowers are arranged in heads near the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes in the upper leaf axils. There are one to four groups of three flowers in each head, the heads-up to in diameter. The flowers appear in spring and are initially pale yellow to creamy-white but fade to pinkish-red. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers age. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 6 to 13 stamens in each bundle. Flowering occurs from August to November and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in clusters.
Taxonomy and naming
Melaleuca urceolaris subsp. virgata was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis. In 1999 it was raised to species status as Melaleuca virgata by Lyndley Craven and Brendan Lepschi but the name was not valid. The name was changed in 2001 to Melaleuca dichroma by Craven and Lepschi in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (dichroma) is from the Greek di- meaning "two" or "double" and chroma, "colour", referring to the two colour phases of the flowers as they age.
This species is closely related to Melaleuca urceolaris, differing mainly in the arrangement of the flowers.
Distribution and habitat
Melaleuca dichroma occurs in the Arrino, Hill River and Moora districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy, gravelly and loamy soils.
Ecology
Melaleuca gnidioides is a distantly related species whose flowers also change colour as they age. It may signal to pollinators that a reward is no longer available.
Conservation status
Melaleuca dichroma is listed as "not threatened" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.
Use in horticulture
This species is not well known in cultivation, but the similar Melaleuca urceolaris has been grown successfully for its showy flowers and interesting foliage, suggesting that Melaleuca dichroma may also have horticultural merit, especially for its two-tone flowers.

19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Mitchell County was established.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.4%) is water.

Saint Ildefonsus is a 1609 painting by El Greco. It and their Saint Peter were both painted for the Church of San Vicente, Toledo. It has also previously been misidentified as Pope Eugene I or saint Blaise. It is now in the Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial.
Ildefonsus is shown in a chasuble, pallium and mitre, holding a bishop's staff and an open book. The full robes emphasise the model's anatomy, showing Michelangelo's influence on El Greco.

Book of Bad Decisions is the twelfth studio album by American rock band Clutch, released on September 7, 2018, through the band's own label Weathermaker Music. It was released on CD, regular black vinyl, limited coke bottle clear vinyl and on picture disc, and was produced by Vance Powell.
Reception
MetalSucks praised the album, calling it a "slightly disjointed record that sounds like the simmering undercurrent of disbelief, anxiety, and rage that lies just below the surface of the world today." Rolling Stone was also positive in their review, stating "Book of Bad Decisions is another solid latter-day Clutch record, bathed in the grit and liberal fuzz tone that have made their live shows legendary." Exclaim! gave the album a 9/10, stating that "this really needs to be said more, but Clutch are one of the best rock acts of the modern era".

Periorbital dark circles are dark blemishes around the eyes. There are many causes of this symptom, including heredity and bruising.
Causes
Allergies, asthma, and eczema
Any condition that causes the eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles due to rubbing or scratching the skin around them. Hay fever sufferers in particular will notice under-eye "smudges" during the height of the allergy season. Also, dark circles from allergies are caused by superficial venous congestion in the capillaries under the eyes.
Medications
Any medications that cause blood vessels to dilate can cause circles under the eyes to darken. The skin under the eyes is very delicate, any increased blood flow shows through the skin.
Anemia
The lack of nutrients in the diet, or the lack of a balanced diet, can contribute to the discoloration of the area under the eyes. It is believed that iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause dark circles as well. Iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia and this condition is a sign that not enough oxygen is getting to the body tissues.
The skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation (due to lack of iron), allowing the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible.
Fatigue
A lack of sleep and mental fatigue can cause paleness of the skin, allowing the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear bluer or darker.
Age
Dark circles are likely to become more noticeable and permanent with age. This is because as people get older, their skin loses collagen, becoming thinner and more translucent. Circles may also gradually begin to appear darker in one eye than the other as a result of some habitual facial expressions, such as an uneven smile.
Sun exposure
Prompts your body to produce more melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color.
Periorbital hyperpigmentation
Periorbital hyperpigmentation is the official name for when there is more melanin produced around the eyes than is usual, giving them a darker color.
Treatment
At one time, hydroquinone solution was often mixed in an oil-free moisturizer that acted like a skin bleach. However the use of hydroquinone for skin whitening has been banned in European countries due to health concerns. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its approval of hydroquinone for over the counter preparations warning that it may cause cancer or have many other detrimental effects.
The use of hydroquinone skin-whitening products can be toxic, harmful or lethal for humans.
Modern treatments include topical creams that are marketed for the condition. Various ingredients have been researched, developed and included in these creams. For example, recently, chemical compounds called alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) have been added as a beneficial ingredient to creams for dark circles. Specialist treatments including laser and intense pulsed light skin surgery can also be used. A compounding cream of Pfaffia paniculata, Ptychopetalum olacoides and Lilium candidum has also been reported as an effective treatment. Low-level laser therapy, autologous fat transplantation and hyaluronic acid fillers are also alternative treatment options.
In addition, many skin care ingredients can help in the form of eye creams. Caffeine is a potent vasoconstrictor that has been proven to improve the look of dark circles by constricting, or tightening, the dilated vessels under eyes. Vitamin C can help brighten hyperpigmentation as well as thicken the dermal layer of skin which conceals dark circles.

Rerik (, formerly Alt-Gaarz) is a town in the Rostock district, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. It is situated on the Baltic Sea coast, 19 km west of Bad Doberan, and 27 km northeast of Wismar. In 1938, Rerik was named after the old Slavic-Scandinavian settlement Reric, that was believed to have been situated near present Rerik.
It is the setting for Alfred Andersch's debut novel, Sansibar oder der letzte Grund (1957).
Rerik West
Rerik West, on a peninsula separated from the town itself by a small isthmus, was a barracks town for Soviet forces during the time of the German Democratic Republic. Following German reunification, it was abandoned in 1992 and declared a restricted area due to contamination by unexploded munitions. It is now a ghost town, and has become a haven for wildlife.

In computer data, a substitute character (␚) is a control character that is used to pad transmitted data in order to send it in blocks of fixed size, or to stand in place of a character that is recognized to be invalid, erroneous or unrepresentable on a given device. It is also used as an escape sequence in some programming languages.
In the ASCII character set, this character is encoded by the number 26 ( hex). Standard keyboards transmit this code when the and keys are pressed simultaneously (, often documented by convention as ). Unicode inherits this character from ASCII, but recommends that the replacement character (�, U+FFFD) be used instead to represent un-decodable inputs, when the output encoding is compatible with it.
Uses
End of file
Historically, under PDP-6 monitor, RT-11, VMS, and TOPS-10, and in early PC CP/M 1 and 2 operating systems (and derivatives like MP/M) it was necessary to explicitly mark the end of a file (EOF) because the native filesystem could not record the exact file size by itself; files were allocated in extents (records) of a fixed size, typically leaving some allocated but unused space at the end of each file. This extra space was filled with 16 (hex) characters under CP/M. The extended CP/M filesystems used by CP/M 3 and higher (and derivatives like Concurrent CP/M, Concurrent DOS, and DOS Plus) did support byte-granular files, so this was no longer a requirement, but it remained as a convention (especially for text files) in order to ensure backward compatibility.
In CP/M, 86-DOS, MS-DOS, PC DOS, DR-DOS, and their various derivatives, the SUB character was also used to indicate the end of a character stream, and thereby used to terminate user input in an interactive command line window (and as such, often used to finish console input redirection, e.g. as instigated by the command COPY CON: TYPEDTXT.TXT).
While no longer technically required to indicate the end of a file, as of 2017 many text editors and program languages still support this convention, or can be configured to insert this character at the end of a file when editing, or at least properly cope with them in text files. In such cases, it is often termed a "soft" EOF, as it does not necessarily represent the physical end of the file, but is more a marker indicating that "there is no useful data beyond this point". In reality, more data may exist beyond this character up to the actual end of the data in the file system, thus it can be used to hide file content when the file is entered at the console or opened in editors. Many file format standards (e.g. PNG or GIF) include the SUB character in their headers to perform precisely this function. Some modern text file formats (e.g. CSV-1203) still recommend a trailing EOF character to be appended as the last character in the file. However, typing does not embed an EOF character into a file in either DOS or Windows, nor do the APIs of those systems use the character to denote the actual end of a file.
Some programming languages (e.g. Visual Basic) will not read past a "soft" EOF when using the built-in text file reading primitives (INPUT, LINE INPUT etc.), and alternate methods must be adopted, e.g. opening the file in binary mode or using the File System Object to progress beyond it.
Character 26 was used to mark "End of file" even though ASCII calls this character Substitute, and has other characters to indicate "End of file". Number 28 which is called "File Separator" has also been used for similar purposes.
Other uses
In Unix-like operating systems, this character is typically used in shells as a way for the user to suspend the currently executing interactive process. The suspended process can then be resumed in foreground (interactive) mode, or be made to resume execution in background mode, or be terminated. When entered by a user at their computer terminal, the currently running foreground process is sent a "terminal stop" (SIGTSTP) signal, which generally causes the process to suspend its execution. The user can later continue the process execution by using the "foreground" command (fg) or the "background" command (bg).
The Unicode Security Considerations report recommends this character as a safe replacement for unmappable characters during character set conversion.
In many GUIs and applications, ( on macOS) can be used to undo the last action. In many applications, earlier actions than the last one can also be undone by pressing multiple times. was one of a handful of keyboard sequences chosen by the program designers at Xerox PARC to control text editing.

Agba N'Ojie of Uromi, originally called Agba or Agba N'Ojie (Esan God of War), was the King of the Esan people from 1483 AD until 1507 AD.
They were an important Onojie within the history of the Esan people. They were instrumental in the independence of Esanland from the old Benin Empire. They stopped tributes from Enijies in Esanland from being paid to the Oba of Benin, and stopped any appeal cases being taken from Esanland to the Oba's Palace of Benin for retrial during the time of Ozolua n'Ibarmoi
(or Ozolua the Conqueror).
History
Agba N'Ojie inherited the Uromi throne after the death of their father Onojie Ijesan, the first Onojie of Uromi. They wanted to free their kin from the control of the old Benin Empire. The general population of Esan kingdoms initially relocated from Benin City during the rule of Oba Ewuare. These small settlements extended through interior development and recorded movements from Benin around five centuries ago. Such movements into the zone may have occurred before this date. They were driven by ousted sovereigns, bosses, culprits and others who had abandoned Benin City for the uninhabited woodland before 1460 Ewuares reign as the Oba of Benin. This was done either through the self-centeredness and outrages of a portion of the Obas, or following the cataclysmic common wars over progression.
The recorded relocation out of Benin City occurred amid Oba Ewuare's reign in the fifteenth century when the Oba lost their two children and made some unforgiving laws restricting the subjects from cooking, washing, or having sex for extended periods of time, the Oba needed to use discretion to bring them under Benin's dominion. They welcomed Esan pioneers or their agents to Benin for a détente. They were prepared to perceive and respect their guests with the title of Onojie, which means king. There is no record of any individuals who received the invitation and disregarded it.
They have vanished from history. For the future, Esan laid on the individuals who went to Benin and took the title of Onojie. Agba's father was one of the pioneers initiated by Oba Ewuare in 1463 as the first Onojie of Uromi. At the time when Agba assumed control over the position as the Onojie after the passing of their father, Onojie Ijesan found the way Oba Ewuare used discretion and manipulations to bring the Esan people under the Bini control, choosing to end the Bini control over the Esan people. When Oba Ozolua/Ozolua N'Ibaromi (Ozolua the Conqueror) extended a hand of friendship to Agba Nojie of Uromi, King Agba of Uromi, bluntly and gallantly refused the friendship with the Oba,
saying it was not an honest friendship and a gesture whose essence was dead on arrival. Indeed, that was a blow to the ego of Oba Ozolua, and war was declared between the two generals, Oba Ozolua of Benin and Onojie Agba Nojie of Uromi, eventually becoming the Bini Esan War.
Bini Esan War
During the 16th century, the Uzea War, which is also known as the Bini Esan War, occurred between the Uromi kingdom and the Kingdom of Benin. The War lasted for many years due to a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba N'ojie of Uromi. The people of Esan defined them as a God of War and is worshipped today under a tall kapok tree. A peace treaty was signed between the Esans and the Binis, which the Esans call Ukoven. This was done and sealed by planting the Ohimi tree and pledging the Ohimi oath, "Esan I Gbedo...", which is known today as "Esan Igbe Edo" meaning Esans will no longer attack Binis. Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and on three occasions when some Obas of Benin were denied their throne, they ran to Esanland and were led by Esan warriors back to Benin to reclaim their throne as Oba. An example of this is Oba Osemwende (1816–1848).
Death
Agba N'Ojie of Uromi's exact date of death was never confirmed because they vanished into Ahojie bush in Uromi and was never seen again.
Worship
Alu-Agba Deity is a god of war and is worshipped under a tall kapok tree every Uromi first market day by the Esan people. They believe Agba N'Ojie has the power to protect them during the war and hard times.

Thornwell opened in Clinton, South Carolina on October 1, 1875, to ten children orphaned by the American Civil War. It was founded by Reverend William Plumer Jacobs and named for noted theologian James Henley Thornwell. Dr. Jacobs went on to found Presbyterian College and their son Thornwell Jacobs revitalized Oglethorpe University.
Thornwell's first donation was from a ten-year-old boy, Willie Anderson, who gave Dr. Jacobs fifty cents to "build your orphanage." Dr. Jacobs built the orphanage with the help of their church and presided over the orphanage until their death in 1917.
Thornwell is supported by the Presbyterian Church (USA) Synod of the South Atlantic, congregations within the Synod and without, and private donations.
Most of the buildings are made of granite or with granite facings and the campus is notably attractive. Many of the buildings are part of the Thornwell-Presbyterian College Historic District which comprises the historic cores of Presbyterian College and the Thornwell Home and School for Children, together with the adjacent residential streets. The Thornwell campus is unified by consistency of materials (granite stone) and by scale. The Thornwell-Presbyterian College Historic District was listed in the National Register March 5, 1982.
Thornwell has some interesting attributes:
It is one of the earliest American child-care facilities that used "cottages" rather than dormitories to house children.
Cyrus McCormick, the inventor of the reaper, supported Thornwell and there was once a "McCormick Cottage" on the campus.
Thornwell is located in downtown Clinton, on South Broad Street and across the street from Presbyterian College.

Edward William Marvin (7 July 1878 – 24 March 1918) was an English-born South African first-class cricketer and South African Army soldier.
Marvin was born at Leicester in July 1878. They later emigrated to South Africa, where they played two first-class cricket matches for Gauteng in the 1908–09 Currie Cup against Border and Western Province. They scored 47 runs in these matches, with the highest score of 29. Marvin served in the First World War as a private in the South African Infantry, which formed part of the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. On 21 March 1918, the Germans launched a new offensive, Operation Michael, during which Marvin was killed in action at Maricourt Wood on 24 March.

Pogoni () is a municipality in the Ioannina regional unit, Epirus, Greece. The seat of the municipality is the village Kalpaki. The municipality has an area of 701.059 km2. Its population was 8,960 at the 2011 census.
History
Pogoni was populated by the end of the Neolithic Age. Historically, the region was inhabited by the ancient Greek tribe of the Molossians. Along with the rest of Epirus, the area was annexed by the Kingdom of Greece in 1913 after the First Balkan War. Pogoni was also home to the 268th Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras I.
Municipality
The municipality Pogoni was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 6 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
Ano Kalamas
Ano Pogoni
Delvinaki
Kalpaki
Lavdani
Pogoniani
Province
The province of Pogoni () was one of the provinces of the Ioannina Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Pogoni, except the municipal units Ano Kalamas and Kalpaki. Its seat was the village Delvinaki. It was abolished in 2006.

Chemical, biological (CB) — and sometimes radiological — warfare agents were assigned what is termed a military symbol by the U.S. military until the American chemical and biological weapons programs were terminated (in 1990 and 1969, respectively). Military symbols applied to the CB agent fill, and not to the entire weapon. A chemical or biological weapon designation would be, for example, "Aero-14/B", which could be filled with GB, VX, TGB, or with a biological modification kit – OU, NU, UL, etc. A CB weapon is an integrated device of (1) agent, (2) dissemination means, and (3) delivery system.
Military symbols can sometimes reflect the name of where a chemical agent is manufactured. For example, chloropicrin has the symbol PS, which was derived from the British town in which it was manufactured during the First World War: Port Sunlight.

Saturnalia is the only studio album by The Gutter Twins, a collaboration between Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan. The album, which was started as far back as 2003, was released on March 4, 2008. Prior to the album's release, the duo began posting songs on their official MySpace page. Joseph Arthur sings backing vocals on "Idle Hands." The song was also the first single, released April 14, 2008.
Music
Recording
On Christmas Day 2003, Dulli and Lanegan started recording songs which would become Saturnalia. Lanegan said "It started pretty innocently." In July 2007, Pitchfork Media announced that the band had signed to Seattle label Sub Pop; soon thereafter, the March 4, 2008 release date was set.
Saturnalia Tour
The Gutter Twins announced a UK tour in May 2008, where they played 6 live concerts around Britain. The band played Oxford Academy (August 11), Nottingham Rescue Rooms (12), London Shepherd's Bush Empire (13), Brighton, Komedia (26), Sheffield, Leadmill (27) and Liverpool, Academy 2 (30).

George Earth (born July 3, 1966) is an American musician, guitarist, songwriter, composer, music producer, comic book artist, and talk show host from Echo Park, California.  They are perhaps best known as the lead guitarist for both World Entertainment War and Switchblade Symphony, later touring and recording with Angel Corpus Christi, Stolen Babies, and other bands before forming Los Angeles-based Small Halo in 2008. They publish a semi-regular comic book series and hosts a regular talk show, The Talk Show, in which they also lead The Talk Show Band.
Biography
George Earth was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1966. They lived in Athens, Greece briefly as a child between 1969 and 1970 before moving back to New Jersey with their parents. They lived briefly in California in 1976 and then moved back to Red Bank, New Jersey, where at age 13, they started playing guitar. They left Red Bank in 1980 and moved to Santa Cruz, California, where they attended high school and formed their first band with their two best friends, Gabe Butterfield and Keith Graves, who attended two other local high schools. Butterfield played drums and is the son of blues legend Paul Butterfield. Graves had played bass guitar until Earth joined them, whereupon Butterfield and Earth forced them to play guitar with them instead. Graves now performs with Prairie Prince and Quicksilver Messenger Service.
Earth's first serious recording was around 1982, on a record with Cyrille Verdeaux, on which they played guitar.
George found work in 1983 as a roadie for the Santa Cruz band Tao Chemical and its percussion offshoot, Tao Rhythmical, where they got to know the drummer for both bands, Rick Walker, who would connect them with some other key musicians in the region.
About 1985, Earth and vocalist and lyricist Xtremity X worked across the street from one another, met, and formed Heaven On. They played guitar to their lyrics, which they sang, and they soon gathered a pair of other young artists, the rhythm team of drummer Anthony Guess, who was a percussion student of Rick Walker's, and bassist Kevin Nuckolls, with whom Guess had played in several bands before. Keyboardist Kennedy Cosker, of The Quiet Ones, joined them at the last minute to compete in a contest, and together, the five-member band won the 1986 Battle of the Bands at the Louden Nelson Center for Performing Arts in Santa Cruz. Heaven On disbanded soon after that performance, though Earth, Guess, and Nuckolls would form a separate improvisation project that year, Circus Boy, performing one show in that grouping, at Diane's Place in Santa Cruz, before Earth and Guess began to jam with bassist Daniel Vee Lewis, Lewis' wife, Pipa Piñon, and keyboardist David Hannibal.
In 1986, Earth and Anthony Guess together conceived of the unnamed band that would later become World Entertainment War. Earth played lead guitar and co-wrote songs with drummer Guess. They invited both Daniel Vee Lewis and David Hannibal to play bass and keyboards, respectively, for the new group, which still remained nameless. Rick Walker suggested they contact another local musician friend of his, Rob Brezsny, also of Tao Chemical, who was developing a new and broad idea that they called "World Entertainment War". After seeing Brezsny perform a spoken word show to a pre-recorded music tape, they did a jam show together a few weeks later. Brezsny was invited to join the band as lead vocalist and co-writer and together they then adopted the name and the concept, World Entertainment War. Singer Darby Gould was recruited six months later to join the band as co-lead vocalist. Keyboardist Hannibal left the band shortly and was replaced briefly by Sam Loya, who was then replaced by Amy Excolere. They performed regularly and recorded two albums; a self-titled debut and a follow-up called Give Too Much, consisting of the same recordings with two added tracks recorded at the same time, both released in 1991 by MCA Records. Earth continued doing live performances with World Entertainment War in a variety of venues until the group disbanded in 1993.
That same year, Earth joined singer, songwriter, and accordionist Angel Corpus Christi as their international touring guitarist. In 1993 they formed a guitar and cello band called The Endorphines with Martha Burns of Amber Asylum playing the cello. That band auditioned drummers, including Eric Gebow, whom Earth would later form an improv duo with and who would later bring Earth into Switchblade Symphony.
In 1995, Earth joined Switchblade Symphony, with composer Susan Wallace and vocalist Tina Root, replacing Robin Jacobs on lead guitar. They released several recordings on Cleopatra Records, including Bread and Jam for Frances in 1997 and The Three Calamities in 1999, and they toured internationally for over four years in support of both albums, before disbanding in 1999; with Root going on to form the band Tre Lux. Earth and Root performed the final shows of Switchblade Symphony in 2000.
From 2001 to 2003, George Earth played guitar in Captain Bringdown, with bassist Paula O'Rourke and drummer John Weiss, and appears on their 2002 self-titled album, recorded at Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. Weiss was later replaced by Thievery Corporation drummer El John Nelson, who later played on Earth's 2004 solo CD, Love Songs.
During that period they also did session work with several groups. They played guitar for Angel Corpus Christi; appearing on their 2003 CD recordings, Divine Healer and Louie Louie (a tribute to Lou Reed). They recorded with Shards, a guitar and drum duo they formed with drummer Mark Pino of Birdsaw. They did some session work with their former World Entertainment War bandmate, Rob Brezsny, and also with Caroline Blind's project, Sunshine Blind, playing guitar on their 2003 release, I Carry You.
George Earth stayed busy during 2003 to 2006, writing, recording and producing their own solo albums as Candymachine, aka Candymachine88, including Water, released on iTunes, and one song on each of the two albums they produced for Cleopatra Records; "Mr. Self Destruct" on Covered in Nails: A Tribute To Nine-Inch Nails and "Ava Adore", with Tina Root, on A Gothic–Industrial Tribute to The Smashing Pumpkins. The album they produced for Tributized Records in 2006, Piggy: A Tribute to Nine-Inch Nails, also featured they and Root performing as Candymachine88 on one song, "Mr. Self Destruct".
They played theremin for Red Elvises, recording with Oleg Bernov, Igor Yuzov, and others, on their 2004 studio release, Lunatics and Poets and they also joined Victim's Family guitarist Ralph Spight on their side project, The Freak Accident, playing theremin as well, on their 2004 album, Freak Accident. Also in 2004, Pretend Records released Earth's debut solo album, Love Songs.
In 2007, Earth was brought in to work with Heather Schmid by their producer/co-writer Rich Balmer on their CD, Goddess Awaits. Balmer had also worked with Tina Root, who co-wrote some material on another Schmid album, and Root had suggested to Earth that they work with Balmer. Later in 2007, George went on an international tour as the guitarist for Stolen Babies, replacing guitarist Davin Givhan, who had recently left the band. In 2008, Earth and Tina Root (aka Tina Minero, since 2002) rejoined again to form another music performance project, Small Halo, recording a self-titled 5-song EP that they released in 2009.
Since then Earth has pursued several other activities. They have been scoring music for independent films and television for several years and their recent work has included scoring music for major film trailers.
They continue their professional work and lives on a small farm in Echo Park, California.
Trivia
Earth has also initiated several "joke bands". One early instance of these, dreamed up with their best (non-musician) friend Steve Brown, was the band Barking Crew, releasing the comedy single "Bark Me Betty", as a joke about their slang for fellatio, "barking", as in, "Did they bark your pole?" A later joke band was Fucking Jerks from San Jose, with a song recorded by the same name, created by Earth and another friend.

Lev Efimovich Kerbel (; – 14 August 2003) was a sculptor of Soviet realist works. Kerbel's creations included statues of Marx, Lenin, Yuri Gagarin, which were sent by Soviet Government as gifts to socialist and the Third World countries across the world.
Kerbel was born to a Jewish family in the village of Semyonovka in Chernigov Governorate, Russian Republic (currently Semenivka, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine), on the day that the Winter Palace in Petrograd was stormed by the Bolsheviks. Lev's family moved to the Russian Smolensk region, where they began sculpting as a child. They continued to sculpt and in 1934 they won an award from the Komsomol (Young Communist League) for a plaque of Lenin.
During World War II, Kerbel helped build the defenses for the Battle of Moscow, then served in the Northern Fleet, gaining renown as a military artist.
After the war, Kerbel's career took off with a wide range of commissions. In 1958 they sculpted a statue in Shanghai that depicted a huge Soviet and an equally large Chinese worker hand in hand. When Soviet-Chinese relations foundered a few years later, the statue was torn down by a mob.
In the 1950s to 1970s Kerbel sculpted many portraits of Soviet and foreign intellectuals: writer Boris Lavrenyov and violinist David Oistrakh, Canadian clergyman James Gareth Endicott, Giacomo Manzù (sculptor) and Pietro Orgento (orchestral conductor) from Italy and many others. Another example of Kerbel's sculptures is the Lenin Monument in the Parque Lenin area of Havana, Cuba. In 1976 the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union presented the Government of Sri Lanka the monument of Solomon Bandaranaike, the late Prime minister of the country, carved by Lev Kerbel.
While some people dismiss Kerbel's works as a form of flat Communist propaganda, Kerbel themselves said that they were always more interested in art than politics. Many people now view their few remaining statues with nostalgia, particularly in Chemnitz, where their bust of Karl Marx is referred to as 'the head'. Among the monuments on the graves of the Soviet soldiers carefully preserved in Germany are Kerbel sculptures in Berlin and on Seelow Heights.
In the 1990s following the collapse of the socialist bloc many of their works of art were destroyed. However their enormous Karl Marx monument in Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt, has been preserved as a cultural monument. One of Kerbel's last works was the memorial to the crew of the Kursk submarine, inaugurated in Moscow on August 12, 2002.

The noisy pitta (Pitta versicolor) is a species of bird in the family Pittidae. The noisy pitta is found in eastern Australia and southern New Guinea. It eats earthworms, insects and snails. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
Taxonomy
Some authorities believe that the noisy pitta is conspecific with elegant pitta (Pitta elegans) of Indonesia, and/or with the rainbow pitta (Pitta iris) from the Northern Territory but it is usually regarded as forming a superspecies with these two species and with the black-faced pitta (Pitta anerythra) of the Solomon Islands. Not all authorities agree that all these species are related; Erritzoe and Erritzoe (1998) dispute the inclusion of the rainbow pitta in this superspecies.
There are two subspecies with a demarcation line around Cairns. Pitta versicolor simillima occurs in northern Queensland and the islands of the Torres Strait. The members of this subspecies migrate to the southern part of Papua New Guinea. The nominate race P. v. versicolor is found in the rest of Queensland and southward to the Hunter River in New South Wales. On 27 October 2017 a bird was observed in Strickland State Forest at Sommersby on the Central Coast. A third subspecies, P. v. intermedia, has sometimes been recognised, based on size differences, but this is now thought to represent a clinal difference based on latitude and is no longer accepted.
William John Swainson described the noisy pitta in 1825 based on a specimen collected in New South Wales. The specific name, versicolor is Latin for multicoloured. John Gould described the subspecies Pitta versicolor simillima in 1868. The subspecific name is Latin for similar.
The noisy pitta is also known as the buff-breasted pitta, the lesser pitta, and the blue-winged pitta (Pitta moluccensis is another species known as the blue-winged pitta, which sometimes leads to confusion in applying their common names). It was also known colloquially as the anvil-bird (after its feeding behaviour), the bobtail and the painted thrush.
Description
The noisy pitta is long. Males weigh and females . It is a colourful bird. It has a black head and nape of neck with a chestnut crown. The wings are green with a turquoise front edge and the back is also green. The throat, breast and belly are lemon yellow. The tail is black and the under-tail coverts are orange-red.
Juvenile birds resembled adults but are duller, with olive green on the wings and the buffy breast washed with grey, as is the throat and chin. The chestnut feathers of the crown are tipped with black and the lesser wing coverts lack any blue.
Distribution and habitat
The noisy pitta is found in forest habitats along the east coast of Australia. Its breeding range extends from the Torres Strait Islands and the northern tip of Cape York Peninsula southwards to the New South Wales/Victoria border. It occurs mainly in rainforest but is also sometimes found in drier woodland and scrub. Outside of Australia they may be found in southern New Guinea, where they are probably underreported and winter migrants. It has also been suggested that they breed in southern New Guinea.
Behaviour
The noisy pitta is a shy bird and its distinctive call is heard more often than the bird is seen. Because of this it has been suggested that the species is often overlooked when not calling.
Calls
Noisy pittas call most frequently in the morning with a secondary peak in calling around midday. Calling declines in the afternoon before spiking again at dusk. They also call at night. Seasonally, they call most frequently in the breeding season, with almost no calling between March and August.
The call is usually repeated twice and consists of a sequence of three ascending notes, sometimes rendered as "walk-to-work".
Diet and feeding
The noisy pitta is a bird of the forest floor where it rummages through the leaf litter for the insects, woodlice, snails and other invertebrates on which it feeds. It bobs its head up and down and flicks its tail from side to side while it forages. Its diet includes some fruit and it cracks open the shells of molluscs such as the giant panda snail (Hedleyella falconeri) on an anvil, a stone or other hard surface habitually used for this purpose. Small lizards are also caught and bashed against hard surfaces before swallowing.
Breeding
Like other pittas this species nests in a concealed location on the ground. The breeding season peaks in late spring and early summer, although the timing varies by location. In the southern part of its range (northern New South Wales and southern Queensland) eggs are laid between July and February with a peak in November, whereas around Cape York the season is more tightly from November to February with a peak in January. In the Torres Strait Islands the breeding season is January to April. These differences may be as the result of differences in rainfall across the range of this species, as the season is usually two months before the peak of rainfall. Typically the earlier breeding records of southern birds fall in years with higher than average rainfall. Timing the breeding in this way ensures that the maximum amount of food is available for fledglings when they become independent, and may also help ground nesting birds avoid losing clutches to flooding.
The nest is domed and measures . The nest is usually placed on the ground at the bottom of a large rock, stump of roots, but has also been reported being placed in a tree up to off the ground. The nest is made from branches and twigs, roots, plant fibres, mosses, strips of bark and feathers. The inside is lined with grass and other fine plant material, and new lining material is often brought into the nest during changeovers during incubation. Nests sometimes have a ramp built to the entrance made of sticks, and animal dung is sometimes placed in the entranceway and inside the nest. Both parents make the nest, although it has been reported that in captivity only the males do so.
Clutch sizes can is typically between two and five eggs and this varies by latitude; with pairs in Cape York laying average clutch is around 3 eggs, whilst 4 eggs is more common in the southern part of their range. The eggs measure on average, with eggs being larger further south. Later eggs in a clutch are smaller than eggs laid at the start. The eggs are white or blue-white and have purple-brown spots and underlying blotches of grey-blue.
Both parents incubate the eggs. In captivity the incubation period has been recorded as lasting 14 days. In the wild the incubation period lasts 17 days from the laying of the last egg. Both parents feed the chicks, although as the chicks get closer to fledging the male provided the most food. In captivity the young have been reported as being independent of their parents after 32 days.
Status
The noisy pitta has a wide range and is believed to be fairly common in suitable habitats in Queensland. It is listed as being of "Least Concern" by BirdLife International in the Red List of Threatened Species. It may be diminishing slightly in number because of habitat destruction but probably not at a rate high enough to justify raising its status to "Near Threatened".

Oughtibridge ( ) is a residential village in the north of Sheffield within the bounds of Bradfield civil parish. The village stands north-west of the city centre in the valley of the River Don. The population of the village has increased significantly in recent years due to much private housing development and stood at 3,542 in 2006 over an area of . The population of Oughtibridge increased to 3,584 in 2011.
History
Origins
The origins of Oughtibridge date back to the first part of the 12th century when a ford existed in the area over the Don. The ford was managed by a man named Oughtred who resided in a nearby cottage. When a bridge was built on the spot in approximately 1150 it became known as Oughtred's Bridge or by their nickname of Oughty's Bridge and the small settlement around the bridge adapted the same name. The hamlet of Oughtibridge grew up as a focal point for local farming communities and the first documented mention of Oughtibridge occurred in 1161 when one of the signatories of an agreement on the grazing rights of Ecclesfield Priory was “Ralph, the son of Oughtred”. The name Ughtinabrigg, meaning Oughtred's Bridge in Middle English, was used in the document. The priory's grazing rights included Beeley Wood, a remnant of which still exists to the east of the village. Oughtibridge Hall was built on the high ground to the east of the hamlet in the 16th century; it still stands today and is a Grade-II-listed building.
Onesacre
The little hamlet of Onesacre, approximately half a mile west of Oughtibridge, was mentioned in the Domesday Book of August 1086. However, its history goes back to Anglo-Saxon times when it was part of the estate of the Saxon lord Godric. The Onesacre estate, then known as Anesacre, was owned by the Le Rous family after the Norman Conquest until around 1380 when it passed to the Stead family who were large land-owners in the Sheffield and Hallamshire area. The present buildings date from the middle of the 17th century and Onesacre Hall is Grade II* listed.
Industrial development
Oughtibridge remained a small isolated rural hamlet over the centuries and even by 1747 it was made up of only five families. However, the population started to rise in the latter part of the 18th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution and a further expansion in farming. Oughtibridge's position within the Don valley made it a prime location as the water power of the river could be used to drive the machinery of the early and mid-19th century.
In 1841 the population had risen to 1,005 with Oughtibridge forge being the main industry in the village. The forge still stands today on Forge Lane and is a Grade-II-listed building; it has been renovated in recent years and turned into several apartments within a new housing development. There was a corn mill, paper mill, tannery and a small brewery among the other industries at this time. During the second half of the 19th century Oughtibridge reached its height as an industrial centre with the opening of Oughty Bridge railway station in 1845 on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. By 1891 the population had grown to 1,784.
The Oughtibridge Silica Firebrick Company which had ganister mines in the nearby Beeley Wood and Wharncliffe Woods, utilised the railway for transportation, building a factory by the railway line near the station; the works were taken over by the Steetley company in 1947. The Steetley refractory works on Station Lane closed in the 1980s with half the site being redeveloped for housing while the remaining half was taken over by Intermet Refractory Products Ltd.
Oughtibridge mill and site
The Dixon family bought the paper mill to the northwest of the village in 1871 and it became a flourishing business, being one of the first to use wood pulp to produce paper instead of rags. The mill specialised in tissues, making the Dixcel brand for many years. Wood pulp for Dixon's paper mill was imported from the Toppila pulp mill (Toppila Oy) in Oulu, Finland from 1931–1985. The Dixons signed an agreement with the railway company to provide a siding for the works to transport raw materials and the finished product. The factory had several owners after the Dixons sold the mill in the 1970s, namely British Tissues, Jamont UK, The Fort James Corporation and from 2000 it became part of the Georgia-Pacific group. The paper mill was closed in 2007 leaving only converting lines operational with the two tissue machines being mothballed. All production ceasing in 2015.
On 30 August 2016 a resolution to grant outline planning for up to 320 homes was secured for the Oughtibridge mill site. This includes the demolition of existing industrial buildings and the construction of a residential development. A new vehicular bridge and a pedestrian / cycle bridge will be built across the River Don to give access to the site. The plans include associated landscaping and infrastructure works.
Present day
The modern-day development of Oughtibridge has seen it become a commuter village with many of the residents working in nearby Sheffield and much of the local industry having given way to private housing development. There are approximately 1,355 housing units in Oughtibridge, 79% of which are owner occupied; there is a significantly lower percentage of rented properties compared to the rest of Sheffield.
The A6102 road, one of the main transport exits from the northwest of Sheffield towards Stocksbridge and eventually Manchester, goes through Oughtibridge splitting into a one way system in its passage through the village. There are good public transport links to Sheffield by bus including a link to the Sheffield Supertram network at Middlewood. There are four public houses within Oughtibridge (The Pheasant, The Cock Inn, The Travellers, and The Hare and Hounds). There used to be five: The White Hart is now a bridal shop. Oughtibridge primary school is situated on Naylor Road; secondary school pupils have to travel to Bradfield School in the nearby village of Worrall.
The Parish Church of the Ascension on Church Street was built in 1842. It has a two manual organ by Nelson - unusually the great organ has tracker action but the swell pneumatic. It underwent cleaning and partial reconstruction in 2012. The great has a fine if not loud open diapason. Originally part of the Wadsley parish, Oughtibridge is now a separate parish although the vicar of Wadsley still appoints the vicar at Oughtibridge. Coronation Park is situated in the centre of the village by the river and includes a children's playground and tennis courts as well as some fine specimens of trees. Sheffield Canoe Club use the river by the park as their outdoor base. Just across the road from the park is the hall of the Oughtibridge Brass Band who were formed around 1890. The War Memorial sports ground is situated next to the River Don slightly downstream, providing facilities for the village football and cricket teams. The ground was donated by the Silica Firebrick Company in 1921.

is a series of action role-playing games created by Hidetaka Miyazaki of FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The series began with the release of Dark Souls in 2011 and has seen two sequels, Dark Souls II (2014) and Dark Souls III (2016). Other FromSoftware games, including Demon's Souls, King's Field, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, share several related concepts and are commonly grouped together as Soulslikes.
Dark Souls has received critical acclaim, with the first game often cited as one of the greatest in video games. The series has been both praised and criticized for its high level of difficulty. By 2021, the series had shipped nearly 30 million copies.
Setting
The games take place within a dark, medieval fantasy setting, where the player's character fights against knights, dragons, phantoms, demons, and other monstrous or supernatural entities. The accretion, loss, and recovery of souls is central to the narrative and gameplay of Dark Souls games. These games are linked through their setting and an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire, and are linked through common themes and elements, including interactions with phantoms and battles with demons. At the end of each game, characters may reignite the "first flame" or allow it to fade, recurring a choice others have made before.
Gameplay
The Dark Souls games are played in a third-person perspective, and focus on exploring interconnected environments while fighting enemies with weapons and magic. Players battle bosses to progress through the story, while interacting with non-playable characters. The protagonist of each Dark Souls game can have a varying gender, appearance, name, and starting class via character creation. Players can choose between classes, including knights, barbarians, thieves, and mages. Each class has its own starting equipment and abilities that can be tailored to the player's experience and choices as they progress. The player gains souls from gameplay battles which act as both experience points to level up and as currency to buy items. Souls gained are usually proportional to the difficulty of fighting certain enemies; the more difficult an enemy, the more souls the player will gain.
One of the core mechanics of the series is that it uses death to teach players how to react in hostile environments, encouraging repetition, learning from past mistakes, and prior experience as a means of overcoming its difficulty. Upon losing all of their health points and dying, players lose their Souls and are teleported back to a bonfire where they last rested, which serves as a checkpoint. One chance is given for the player to recover their lost Souls in the form of a bloodstain, which is placed at or around where they last died. If the player dies again before reaching their bloodstain, the Souls are permanently gone. As most enemies are respawned following player death, or if the player should rest at a bonfire, the player has the opportunity to regain more Souls by repeated combat encounters. The bonfire is a type of campfire in the action role-playing game Dark Souls and its sequels that functions as a checkpoint for the player character's progress, as well as reviving most enemies that the player previously killed. Later in the game, and in Dark Souls II and III, they function as warp points. Another core aspect of the series is its dependency on endurance in battle. Performing attacks, blocking, or dodging consume stamina, which otherwise quickly restores if the player stands still or just walks around. Certain moves cannot be executed if the player lacks a certain amount of stamina, making them vulnerable to attack. Players must balance their rate of attacks against defensive moves and brief periods of rest to survive more difficult encounters.
Online interaction in the Dark Souls is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout levels, players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that when activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially helping the player avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the ground that can either help other players by providing hints and warnings or harm them by leaving false hints. Players can also engage in both player versus player combat and cooperative gameplay using invasion or summoning mechanics.
Games
Dark Souls
Dark Souls is the first game in the series; it is considered a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls (2009). FromSoftware wanted to develop a sequel to Demon's Souls, but Sony's ownership of the intellectual property prevented them from doing so on other platforms. It was released in 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In 2012, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition was released for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, featuring the base game and the Artorias of the Abyss downloadable content. The game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran. Players assume the role of a cursed human character who sets out to discover the fate of undead humans like themselves. The plot of Dark Souls is primarily told through environmental details, in-game item flavor text, and dialogue with non-playable characters (NPCs). Players must piece together clues in order to understand the story, rather than being told the story through more traditional means, such as through cutscenes. Dark Souls and its predecessor Demon's Souls garnered recognition due to the series' high level of difficulty. A version featuring some graphical and gameplay enhancements, Dark Souls: Remastered, was released in May 2018.
Dark Souls II
Unlike the previous two games, director Hidetaka Miyazaki did not reprise their role as they were busy directing Bloodborne, although they were still involved in supervision. It was released in 2014 for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In 2015, an updated version featuring The Lost Crowns downloadable content was released for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, under the title Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin - with the latter two platforms receiving retail releases. The game takes place in the kingdom of Drangleic, where the player must find a cure for the undead curse. Although set in the same universe as the previous game, there is no direct story connection to Dark Souls.
Dark Souls III
Dark Souls III was released in 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The gameplay is paced faster than previous Souls installments, which was attributed in part to the gameplay of Bloodborne. The game takes place in the kingdom of Lothric, where the player must end the cycle of linking the Flame. In 2017, the complete version containing the base game and both expansions (Ashes of Ariendel and The Ringed City) was released, under the title Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades Edition. Dark Souls III was both critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It sold over 10 million copies by 2020, making it the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history at the time (until it was overtaken by Elden Ring). In 2015, Miyazaki said that Dark Souls III would likely be the last of the series, with FromSoftware choosing to move onto new games of unrelated IPs in the future.
Other media
A comic book by Titan Comics based on the series debuted alongside the release of Dark Souls III in 2016. A Kickstarter campaign for a licensed board game by Steamforged Games, Dark Souls – The Board Game, was also announced around the same time. The campaign was funded within the first three minutes of its launch and was released in April 2017.
In February 2017, music from the series composed by Motoi Sakuraba was performed by a live orchestra at the Salle Pleyel concert hall in Paris. In September of that year, a limited edition vinyl box set containing the soundtracks of all three games was released in Europe. In Japan, a box set containing the enhanced versions of all three games for the PlayStation 4, the soundtracks for each, bookends, artwork prints, and dictionaries detailing every in-game item was released on May 24, 2018.
Related games
Demon's Souls
Released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Demon's Souls is considered the spiritual predecessor to the Dark Souls series. It has also been described as a spiritual successor to the King's Field series of games, while at the same time being described as a separate entity "guided by differing core game design concepts." It also drew inspiration from video games such as Ico, The Legend of Zelda, and FromSoftware's Otogi: Myth of Demons, as well as manga such as Berserk, Saint Seiya and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
Unlike its successors, Demon's Souls uses a central hub system known as the "Nexus" where players can level up, repair equipment, or buy certain items, before venturing into one of the five connected worlds. The "World Tendency" feature is also exclusive to Demon's Souls, where the difficulty of exploring a world is dependent on how many bosses have been killed, and how the player dies. The gameplay involves a character-creation system and emphasizes gathering loot through combat with enemies in a non-linear series of varied locations. It had an online multiplayer system integrated into single-player, in which players could leave messages and warnings for other players' worlds, as well as join other players to assist and/or kill them. The multiplayer servers were shut down in early 2018 due to inactivity.
King's Field
The King's Field series, also developed by FromSoftware, is considered a spiritual predecessor to the series. It debuted in 1994 with King's Field for the PlayStation and had three sequels.
Other
In February 2016, Bandai Namco Entertainment partnered with American retailer GameStop to release Slashy Souls, a free-to-play mobile endless runner, to promote Dark Souls III. The game was presented in a pixel art style, and shares the series' level of difficulty. The game was met with highly negative critical reception, with reviewers such as Chris Carter of Destructoid and Jim Sterling both giving the game a 1/10.
Reception
The Dark Souls series has been met with critical acclaim. The first Dark Souls has been cited to be among the greatest video games of all time, Dark Souls II also received critical acclaim upon release. Before release, Dark Souls III was one of the most anticipated games of 2016, and also received critical acclaim upon release.
The "bloodstain" gameplay mechanic has been given praise by critics. David Craddock of Shacknews called them one of the core tenets of the series. They stated that the harshest punishment one can receive in a Souls game is "not dying once, but twice." GamesRadar+ called bloodstains, in combination with Demon Souls's message system, "a graceful, elegant way of letting players guide each other without the need for words", and said that "rarely has the price of failure been balanced on such a precarious knife edge" as being forced to retrieve one's bloodstain. The series inspired a social media app for iOS and Android called Soapstone, which uses a similar online messaging system used in the series adapted for the real world, using GPS to determine a user's location and bringing up a list of cryptic messages posted by other users in the area.
The bonfire concept was similarly praised. Matthew Elliott of GamesRadar+ called bonfires a powerful symbol of relief, and "a meaty cocktail of progress, exhaustion and joy", and that, while other games evoke emotions with their save points, no other game does so as effectively. Vice called the Bonfire a "mark of genius" that "reinvented the save point" and allowed the player to reflect on their progress.
Sales
The Dark Souls series had shipped 29.34 million copies outside of Japan . Dark Souls III broke sales records upon release, selling over three million copies worldwide by May 2016 and was Bandai Namco's fastest-selling game until being surpassed by Elden Ring in 2022.
Legacy
The Soulslike genre was inspired by common features of the series, resulting in many games using similar mechanics. Other FromSoftware games directed by Miyazaki, such as Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring, share many of the same concepts of Souls and are often associated with the series and grouped under the "Soulsborne" label.
The series has also been cited as an influence on several PlayStation Network features, including asynchronous messaging, social networking, and video sharing, as well as for the television show Stranger Things.

Peter Thomas Ward (July 26, 1937 – March 16, 2022) was a Canadian-born professional baseball player who appeared in 973 games over nine seasons in Major League Baseball as a third baseman, outfielder and first baseman for the Baltimore Orioles (), Chicago White Sox (–) and New York Yankees ().
Ward was the runner-up for the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award (to pitcher and teammate Gary Peters) in 1963, but was named that season's AL Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News. They finished in the Top 10 in the AL's Most Valuable Player poll in both 1963 (ninth) and (sixth).
Early life
Ward batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and (13 stone, 3 pounds). Born in Montréal, they were the son of former National Hockey League forward Jimmy Ward, who played 11 seasons for the Montreal Maroons and Montreal Canadiens, and who later became a longtime coach in professional and amateur hockey in Portland, Oregon. Pete Ward attended Portland's Jefferson High School and played college baseball at Lewis & Clark College.
Playing career
Ward signed with the Orioles in 1958 as a shortstop, but soon moved to the outfield; although they would be known in the major leagues as a third baseman, the big-league Orioles possessed future Baseball Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson, only a month older than Ward, at the position. Ward batted over .300 at three levels of minor league baseball and won the batting title in the Class B Three-I League in 1960 with a .345 mark. After they were selected to the International League All-Star team in 1962 as an outfielder, Ward received a September trial with Baltimore; they hit .143 with two doubles in 21 at bats.
On January 14, 1963, they were included in one of the off-season's biggest transactions when the Orioles traded him, future Hall of Fame pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm, shortstop Ron Hansen and outfielder Dave Nicholson to the White Sox for shortstop and future Hall of Famer Luis Aparicio and veteran outfielder Al Smith. The White Sox installed Ward as their regular third-baseman, and they responded with a stellar rookie campaign: 177 hits (second in the league), 34 doubles (again second in the AL), 22 home runs, and a .295 batting average (fifth in the league). Chicago won 94 games and finished second to the Yankees. In 1964, Ward avoided the "sophomore jinx" by hitting .282 with 23 home runs and a career-best 94 runs batted in, as the White Sox battled the Yankees and Orioles to the wire before finishing second by a single game.
Ward's production fell off in , when they hit only .247 in 138 games and, troubled by a back injury, they would fail to reach the .250 mark for the rest of their Chicago tenure. They appeared in only 84 games in , and although they were able to play regularly as the White Sox' left fielder in and third baseman in , only their power numbers (18 and 15 home runs) remained robust. They were traded to the Yankees in December 1969 for pitcher Mickey Scott and played a single season for the Yankees as a pinch hitter and back-up first baseman to Danny Cater, a former White Sox teammate. For their nine-year MLB career, Ward amassed 776 hits, including 136 doubles, 17 triples and 98 home runs; they batted .254 with 427 career runs batted in.
They related that during their tenure with the Sox, their team engaged in sign stealing that involved a scout on a chair next to the flagpole at center field with binoculars that would signal a pitch based on if they sat on the chair, stood up, or leaned on a pole, although Ward stated that it would sometimes mess up a hitter's swing.
Manager and coach
Ward remained with the Yankees as a minor-league manager (1972–1977), then coached for one season () for Bobby Cox with the Atlanta Braves, before returning to the minors, where they eventually managed their hometown Portland Beavers. They were inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, and the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.
Personal life
Ward died on March 16, 2022, at the age of 84.

The Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue (BIRD) is an organisation based in Bangalore, India that promotes dialog between people of different faiths, attempting to defuse tensions between religious communities such as Hindus, Christians and Muslims.
Organisation
BIRD was established in 2001.
The founder, trustee, chairperson and coordinator is P.N. Benjamin.
Another founding member was Fr. Mathew Chandrankunnel, a professor of Philosophy of Science and Registrar and Director of the Centre for the Study of world Religions at the Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram, Bangalore.
BIRD is supported entirely through donations from well-wishers.
These are not income tax exempt.
Public statements
The BIRD coordinator P.M. Benjamin is often quoted as an opponent of activism among Christians.
After an attack on a Mysore church in February 2002 a team from BIRD and from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh visited to ascertain what had happened.
The BIRD team was led by P.N. Benjamin, who called for calm among Christians, saying "the need of the hour is to unitedly follow Christ's prayer amidst their agony on the cross — forgive them for they know not what they do ... Christians must learn to talk to their enemies for overcoming their sense of alienation and insecurity and halt the march of misunderstanding between communities".
P. N. Benjamin was cited in the 2003 report A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF) by Ramesh Nagaraj Rao, Narayanan Komerath and others. According to this report, Benjamin had said that Catholic and Protestant organisations had received far more money from abroad than Hindu and Muslim organisations combined, "especially the fundamentalist, and born-again Christian organisations that spread hatred against Hinduism ... Hindu-baiters are making a mountain out of a molehill while they themselves thrive under the shade of foreign funds".
They were also quoted as saying "the biased Indian English media has always suppressed facts and encouraged the enemies of the country who received millions of foreign funds to tarnish the nation's image everywhere by giving wide publicity to the so-called Global Council of Indian Christians and other vested interests.
In September 2005 the website "christianaggression.org" published an article titled "When Intolerance Begets the Loss of Reason" that apparently had been published in the Vijay Times on 9 September 2005, written by P. N. Benjamin. John Dayal, president of the India Catholic Union and a member of the National Integration Council, had accused Hindu political organisations of atrocities such as raping nuns and murdering priests. The author said that Dayal "opens their mouth and wields their pen only to spew venom on the Hindu community". They said that most attacks on Christians were due to aggressive evangelising.
In February 2012 P.N. Benjamin dismissed claims that the 2008 attacks on Christians in southern Karnataka numbered over a thousand.
They said "It is just an exaggeration. I feel there have been a handful of attacks, which were instigated by some fringe Christian groups".
They said these groups received funding from American Pentacostal churches.
A group of Indian Christians issued a letter on 1 January 2007 to various world leaders entitled A Campaign Declaration: Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue (BIRD).
In it they asserted that the 1977 ruling by India's Supreme Court that a citizen had the right to "profess, practice and propagate" ones religion does not include the right to convert another.
The group called for a change to Article 18 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to prohibit conversion through material incentives, coercion, threats or intimidation.
However, the BIRD members affirmed the Great Commission that "unequivocally calls us to witness to Christ in a pluralistic setting".
Stanley Samartha memorial lectures
The BIRD runs inter-faith seminars and discussion sessions, and arranges annual lectures in memory of the theologian Stanley Jedidiah Samartha.
Dr. Samartha once called themselves a Hindu by culture, Christian by faith, Indian by citizenship and ecumenical by choice.
Speakers at these lectures have included:
François Gautier (2001) The need for inter-religious dialogue
C.T. Kurien, economist and Director Emeritus of Madras Institute of Development Studies (2003) Communal harmony – A societal perspective
M.V. Nadkarni, former Vice Chancellor of Gulbarga University (2004) Religion in 21st century – A perspective of hope

M. J. Akbar, journalist and author and editor of India Today (2008) The Power of Religion vs. the Religion of Power
Arun Shourie, journalist and author (2009) Rethinking Religions
On 7 October 2010 Sir Mark Tully, former chief of BBC India, spoke on How certain should we be? The problem of religious pluralism to an audience of over 350.
Sir Mark, who had spent over thirty years in India, spoke of their experiences and of the fact that India had historically been home to all the world's major religions.
They said that had taught them that there are many ways to God.
The American Hindu author David Frawley delivered the tenth Dr Stanley Samartha Memorial lecture in March 2012, speaking on "Pluralism and Universalism in Hinduism".

John Allen Chau (December 18, 1991 – November 17, 2018) was an American Evangelical Christian missionary who was killed by the Sentinelese, a self-isolated uncontacted people, after illegally traveling to North Sentinel Island, India in an attempt to convert the tribe to Christianity.
Early life
John Allen Chau was born on December 18, 1991, in Scottsboro, Alabama, the third and youngest child of Lynda Adams-Chau, an organizer for Chi Alpha, and Patrick Chau, a Chinese-American psychiatrist who left China during the Cultural Revolution. Throughout their childhood, Chau loved camping, hiking and travelling, and excelled at various club, charity, and other extracurricular activities. They admired numerous explorers and missionaries including David Livingstone and Bruce Olson.
They attended Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma, where they managed the university soccer team, and graduated cum laude in 2014 with a B.S. in Exercise Science.
Prior to 2018, Chau participated in missionary trips to Mexico, South Africa and Iraqi Kurdistan. They first traveled to the Andaman Islands in 2015 and 2016 as part of their missionary trips, but did not visit North Sentinel Island at that time.
Contact with Sentinelese and death
In 2017, Chau participated in boot camp missionary training by the Kansas City-based evangelical organization All Nations. According to a report by The New York Times, the training included navigating a mock native village populated by missionary staff members who pretended to be hostile natives, wielding fake spears. During that year they reportedly expressed their interest in converting the Sentinelese.
In October 2018, Chau traveled to and established their residence at Port Blair, capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they prepared an initial contact kit including picture cards for communication, gifts for Sentinelese people, medical equipment, and other necessities. In August 2018, the Indian Home Ministry had removed 29 inhabited islands in Andaman and Nicobar from the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) regime, in an attempt to promote tourism. However, visiting North Sentinel Island without government permission remained illegal under the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956.
In November, Chau embarked on an expedition to North Sentinel Island, which they considered to be "Satan's last stronghold on Earth", with the aim of contacting and living among the Sentinelese. In preparation for the trip, they were vaccinated and quarantined, and also undertook medical and linguistic training. Chau then paid two fishermen (US$335.47) to take them close to the island. The fishermen were later arrested.
Chau expressed a clear desire to convert the tribe and was aware of the legal and mortal risks they were taking by their efforts, writing in their diary, "Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?", "The eternal lives of this tribe is at hand", and "I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed...Don't retrieve my body."
On November 15, Chau attempted their first visit in a fishing boat, which took them about from shore. The fishermen warned Chau not to go farther, but they canoed toward shore with a waterproof Bible. As they approached, they attempted to communicate with the islanders and to offer gifts, but they retreated after facing hostile responses. On another visit, Chau recorded that the islanders reacted to them with a mixture of amusement, bewilderment and hostility. They attempted to sing worship songs to them, and spoke to them in Xhosa (a language spoken in Southern Africa), after which they often fell silent. Other attempts to communicate ended with them bursting into laughter. Chau stated they communicated with "lots of high pitched sounds" and gestures. Eventually, according to Chau's last letter, when they tried to hand over fish and gifts, a boy shot a metal-headed arrow that pierced the Bible they were holding in front of their chest, after which they retreated again.
On their final visit, on November 17, Chau instructed the fishermen to leave without him. The fishermen later saw the islanders dragging Chau's body, and the next day they saw their body on the shore.
Aftermath
Upon learning about Chau's death, the fishermen returned to Port Blair and gave Chau's diary to their friend, also a Christian preacher, residing in the capital city. They informed Chau's family in the U.S., who contacted the American consulate in Chennai for assistance. The Andaman government was notified on November 19. On November 21, the Director General of Police issued a statement on the restrictions on public access to the North Sentinel Island.
Despite efforts by Indian authorities, which involved a tense encounter with the tribe, Chau's body was not recovered. Indian officials made several attempts to recover the body but eventually abandoned those efforts. An anthropologist involved in the case told The Guardian that the risk of a dangerous clash between investigators and the islanders was too great to justify any further attempts. A murder case was opened following their death.
Chau was criticized by Survival International among others for visiting the island despite the possibility of introducing pathogens to the native Sentinelese, to whom it could have been deadly since it was likely that the natives had not been previously exposed to diseases from outside the island. All Nations, the evangelical organization that trained Chau, were criticized on social media for describing Chau as a martyr while expressing condolences for Chau's death. Chau's father also blamed their son's death on the missionary community for inculcating an extreme Christian vision within Chau.
In response to Chau's death, M. Sasikumar of the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies questioned the legal charge of murder and what they perceived as a romanticized version of the incident in the media. They wrote that the incident should instead serve as a warning that the "eyes-only" policy with regard to the Sentinelese needs to be more strictly enforced, and include the local fishermen in order to prevent a repetition.
Michael Schönhuth, Professor for Cultural Anthropology at the University of Trier, Germany, found the media response to Chau's killing of cultural interest. They wrote that the narratives that emerged were part of a larger discussion regarding the proper relationship between the modern world and the remaining isolated indigenous peoples. Schönhuth wrote that the online presence of the Evangelical missionaries whose numbers had grown over the preceding twenty years, and in which Chau was an active participant, presented a narrative in which they were bringing civilization to a primitive people, and that the likelihood of missionaries being killed was not a deterrent, but an affirmation of the need for the "uncontacted people" to be rescued from a savage existence. Schönhuth faulted the media for playing into this narrative, ignoring the history of exploitation of the people in the region, which presented an alternative narrative in which the killing of Chau was self-defense. Schönhuth suggested that the media hype must be reinterpreted to allow for such alternatives to be understood.

Frits Henningsen (1889–1965) was a Danish furniture designer and cabinetmaker who achieved high standards of quality with exclusively handmade pieces.
Henningsen was both the proprietor of a furniture-making workshop with a team of cabinetmakers in central Copenhagen and the designer of their own products. An active member of the Cabinetmakers Guild from 1927, they were admired by their peers for the high quality of their craftsmanship. Many of their pieces were crafted in exotic woods such as palisander and mahogany. All their furniture is handmade in line with traditional, labour-intensive methods from the 19th century. Their pieces are noted for their elegance, above all for the soft curves in the arms of their chairs and sofas, demonstrating their traditional approach aiming to combine style and comfort.
In 1942, Henningsen distanced themselves from the younger designers of the day who increasingly used straight lines in their work, believing furniture design needed to maintain curvature which contributed to a homely look.

Mitra dynasty of Kosambi was centered on the city of Kosambi at the Vatsa region. Its capital Kosambi was among the most important trade centers in the ancient India. The dynasty also likely controlled territory in nearby regions such as Magadha.
Many of its rulers bear the suffix "-mitra" in their names. However, it is disputed how many kings the dynasty was composed of. Dhanabhuti, who is known for Bharhut inscriptions, may have been related to the Mitra dynasty. A number of different, and possibly, related Mitra dynasties existed in the northern India, and it is possible that they all can trace their lineage back into the royal house of the Shunga Empire.
Common symbols in the coinage of the Mitra dynasty include the tree-in-railing and the Ujjain symbol. Bull is a common animal to appear on the coinage.
The Mitra dynasty was ended when Samudragupta of the Gupta Empire annexed Kosambi in the middle of the 4th century CE.
Possible origins
The Vatsa region and its capital Kosambi was among the most important trade centres in ancient India. After the Mauryas and Shungas lost control of the area, Kosambi established itself as a solid independent civic centre. A large number of coins from Kosambi is known. The initial coinage was based on locally modified variants of the Mauryan-Shunga style cast copper coins, and a few of the coins were inscribed with the city's name. Later coinage evolved to portray a more independent iconography, and they began to be inscribed with the names of rulers. This is an indication that the city's local government transitioned into a monarchy. The bull was a common symbol when the coinage minted by the city evolved to have a more robust local character.
It is likely that the Mitra dynasty started its independent rule in Vatsa after the Maurya Empire, or the collapse of the Shunga Empire, allowed various petty states to emerge in the Northern India.
There were possibly five different contemporary dynasties identifiable with the suffix "-mitra". These various Mitra dynasties may have shared a link with the Shunga dynasty, as many of its rulers' names also ended with "-mitra". It is possible that the Shungas may have used a similar method of governing provinces as the preceding Maurya Empire had done. Princes with royal blood would have been sent to govern the provinces, and after the central power had weakened they would have established their own dynasties. Some numismatic evidence for the possible connection between Mitras and the Shunga dynasty descending from Pushyamitra has been found.
There were, possibly linked, Mitra dynasties ruling in Panchala, Mathura, Ayodhya and also possibly at Magadha.
Expansion
During the time period stretching from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE, the Mitras of Kosambi appear to have extended their hegemony over Magadha (including Pataliputra), and possibly Kannauj as well. Inscriptions and coins of the Mitra dynasty are known from various parts of Bihar.
Brhaspatimitra has been called Magadharaja, a king of Magadha, in Kharavela's Hathigumpha inscription (that is related to Hathigumpha inscription). If the Brhaspatimitra mentioned in the inscription is the same king as the Brhaspatimitra of Mitra dynasty, then that would mean that the dynasty held a considerable influence in the region surrounding Kosambi. It is worth to note that there is numismatic evidence to support this theory, as Magadha is not known to not have produced any typical regional coinage unlike the contemporary Kosambi, Mathura or Panchala.
Conquest by the Gupta Empire
Samudragupta (r. c. 335–375 CE) of the Gupta Empire appears to have ended the Mitra dynasty of Kosambi during their conquests in the middle of the 4th century CE. While the pillar was originally erected by Ashoka, Samudragupta later added their own inscription on the same pillar. Harisena, a poet and a high-ranking military commander in Samudragupta's army, was the author of the inscriptions.
According to the theory proposed by 19th-century archaeologists, and supported by Indian scholars such as Upinder Singh, the Allahabad pillar came from somewhere else, probably Kosambi. The Edicts of Ashoka suggest that the pillar was first erected at Kosambi, some 50 kilometers west of its current location. It was moved to Allahabad much later when the region came under Muslim rule. The presence of another broken pillar at Kosambi near the ruins of the Ghoshitarama monastery has led some to believe that the Allahabad pillar might have been one of a pair, not unlike the ones discovered at Rampurva.
List of kings
Disputed kings
The exact number of kings in the dynasty has been disputed to be between seven and twenty-five different kings.
Another opinion is that some of the Mitras of Kannauj actually belonged to the house of Kosambi, and that there were actually no long-lived separate Mitra dynasty at Magadha. K. D. Bajpai holds that the first Mitra ruler of Kosambi was Sungavarma (Sugavamasa). Sungavarma's name includes the epithet Sunga, and that makes it possible to link them with the ruling dynasty of the Shunga Empire. Furthermore, Bajpai argues that Angaraja, Dhanabhuti and Visvadeva were also part of the Mitras of Kosambi. Their names appear in the Bharhut inscriptions. They would be probable descendants of king Sungavarma. The kings of Kosambi lent their patronage for the stupa of Bharhut, which would have been within the territory they controlled.
A genealogy constructed from the Bharhut inscriptions would link the above-mentioned kings to the Mitra dynasty so that Visvadeva would be father of Agaraju. Dhanabhuti would be Agaraju's son.
Coins of Mitra dynasty
Most rulers of the Mitra dynasty of Kosambi, except Radhamitra, have the symbol known as the tree-in-railing in their coins. Another common symbol is the Ujjain symbol. Bull is a common animal to appear on the coinage of Kosambi of the era.
Some of the coins of Radhamitra are known for their unusual hexagonal shape. They were manufactured by casting, but they were made to closely resemble punch-marked coins. The civic coinage of Vatsa is known for their wide innovation in shapes of coins.
The symbols in one of Radhamitra's series of coins make a clear connection with other rulers of Kosambi such as Asvaghosa, Brhaspatimitra, Agnimitra, Sarpamitra, Prajapatimitra, Jyesthamitra and Prausthamitra. The coins cast by these rulers portray similar symbols in obverse and reverse sides of their coins. However, the exact chronology of these coins has not been extensively and conclusively studied yet. The civic coinage has been thought to precede the nominative coinage of the kings.

The Institute of Consulting (IC) is the professional body for consultants and business advisers in the United Kingdom. It replaced the former Institute of Business Consulting (IBC) in January 2011, which was itself formed as the merger of two predecessor bodies, the Institute of Management Consultants (IMC) and the Institute of Business Advisors (IBA). The Institute of Consulting is an organisation within the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).
The IC offers several grades of membership, qualifications, training and awards as well as a range of tools and resource to support members. The institute also operates an accreditation process for its members.
History
During a conference held in Paris during the 1950s, the Big Four consultancy companies at that time agreed to form the Management Consultancies Association. This was developed further into a professional institute and the Institute of Management Consultants came into being in 1962. Having changed its name during the 1990s to the Institute of Management Consultancy to enable corporate membership, the organisation began discussions about merging with the CMI in 2005. This led to the IMC becoming an organisation within the CMI later that year, but the two institutes remained as separate entities.
At the time of the merger with CMI, the IMC were themselves approached by the Institute of Business Advisors (IBA) about combining membership. After lengthy discussions, the IMC and IBA merged in 2007 to become the Institute of Business Consulting, an amalgamation of their two previous names.
Both the IBC and CMI suffered as a result of the recession caused by the financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, the organisations established closer working links and relationships and, following feedback from members and the changing scope of their work, removed the word 'business' from the name, becoming the Institute of Consulting.
Membership
There are 4 grades of membership within the IC:
Affiliate – For anyone starting out in the consultancy field with little or no experience, or for anyone who just has an interest in consultancy and wishes to keep up to date with the profession. There is a sub-grade for those studying, Studying Affiliate, for individuals who are enrolled on an IC qualification course or are undertaking study outside of the IC, offering the Affiliate membership grade at a discount rate.
Associate (AIC) – For individuals who have a small amount of experience in the consultancy or advisory fields. This grade offers resources for Continuous Personal Development free to members. Associates are entitled to use the postnominals AIC after their name to indicate their membership.
Member (MIC) – The most popular grade, for individuals who have at least three years experience as a consultant or business adviser. Members are entitled to use postnominals MIC after their name to indicate their accreditation and membership.
Fellow (FIC) – The highest grade of membership available, requiring at least 10 years experience, of which three must be at a strategic level. Fellow membership of the IC provides additional benefits including the possibility of becoming a mentor. Fellows are entitled to use the postnominals FIC after their name to indicate their status within the institute.
Qualifications and training
The Institute of Consulting has several qualifications available for members, and offers courses to members and non-members. It offers several certifications and diplomas:

The Panocha Quartet () is a Czech string quartet.
History
The Panocha Quartet was formed at the Prague Conservatory in 1968 from a trio consisting of Jiří Panocha (violin), Jaroslav Hlůže (viola), and Jaroslav Kulhan (cello). At the suggestion of their teacher, Josef Micka, they recruited violinist Pavel Zejfart to make up a quartet. In 1971 Hlůže was replaced on the viola by Miroslav Sehnoutka.
In 1975 the ensemble won the Prague International String Quartet Competition and in 1976 they received the Bordeaux Gold Medal. They made their US début in 1975 and their German and Irish débuts the following year. In 1980 they toured Japan with the Smetana Quartet, whose members had been among their teachers. Since then they have enjoyed an international reputation.
The quartet's repertory, founded on the Czech masters and the Viennese classics, includes the complete cycles by Dvořák and Martinů (both of which they have recorded) and a large number of quartets by Haydn, as well as many 20th-century works. They have collaborated on record and in concert with the pianists Rudolf Firkušný, Jan Panenka and András Schiff.
Quartet members
Jaroslav Kulhan (born 1950) studied cello at the Prague Academy of Music with Josef Chuchro. Jiří Panocha (born 1950) studied violin at the Prague Conservatory with Josef Micka, and at the Prague Academy of Music with Jiří Novák. Panocha plays a 1743 violin by Carlo Antonio Testore of Milan. Miroslav Sehnoutka (born 1952) studied viola at the Prague Academy of Music with Milan Škampa. Pavel Zejfart (born 1952) studied violin at the Prague Conservatory with Josef Micka and at the Prague Academy of Music with Nora Grumlíková.

Dinoponera snellingi (named after Roy Snelling) is a queenless species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae. The species is known only from type locality in Campo Grande, Brazil.
Description
Workers are unknown.
Male specimens of this species are distinct in several respects. The combination of a bicolored body and head possessing bulging compound eyes and ocelli is unique to this species. More definitive is the shape of the aedeagus which possesses a large ventral lobe and finger-like serrated flange. The short broad digitus volsellaris with finely toothed basal lobe is distinctive, as well as the paramere shape.

The 2022 Brownlow Medal was the 95th year the award is presented to the player adjudged the best and fairest player during the Australian Football League (AFL) home-and-away season. It was won by Carlton midfielder Patrick Cripps. The 2022 Brownlow Medal count was originally scheduled for Monday 19 September, its traditional date on the Monday before the grand final. It was rescheduled to Sunday 18 September at a week's notice, to avoid a clash with the funeral of Elizabeth II. The event returned to its conventional format and venue—a gala dinner at the Crown Palladium in Melbourne—after having been held virtually for the previous two seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cripps' win was not without controversy. Cripps was initially suspended by the Match Review Panel and AFL Tribunal in Round 21, for rough conduct in an front-on contest against ' Callum Ah Chee, which ruled them ineligible and would have seen them miss the final rounds, in which they polled the winning votes; Carlton had appealed the suspension to the AFL Appeals Board and was successful in overturning it.
Carlton became the first team since Richmond in 2012 to win the Coleman and Brownlow and not play finals. West Coast, which finished 17th with a 2-20 record, polled only 15 votes across all of its players combined, the lowest ever tally for any club under the 3–2–1 voting system in a season of any length.
Leading vote-getters
Voting procedure
The three field umpires (those umpires who control the flow of the game, as opposed to goal or boundary umpires) confer after each match and award three votes, two votes, and one vote to the players they regard as the best, second-best and third-best in the match, respectively. The votes are kept secret until the awards night, and they are read and tallied on the evening.

Detlef Seif (born 15 August 1962 in Euskirchen) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who has been a Member of the German Bundestag since 2009.
Early life and career
On a scholarship of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Seif studied law at the University of Bonn from 1983 until 1989. During their studies, they worked for the International Society for Human Rights. Since 1993, they have been practicing as a lawyer.
Political career
Seif joined the CDU in 1982 and held positions in local politics in Weilerswist from 1999 to 2009.
Since 2009, Seif has been CDU party chairperson in the district of Euskirchen.
Seif has been a member of the German Bundestag since the 2009 federal elections. Since then, they have been a member of the Committee on European Affairs. In 2014 they became Deputy Spokesman for the committee. Seif's thematic areas of expertise in the committee are basic rights; EU citizenship; coordination between the judicature and police; border protection and counterterrorism; and asylum- and migration policy. Additionally, they are the CDU/CSU parliamentary group's rapporteur for Great Britain and Malta.
Between 2009 and 2017, Seif was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, where they served as their parliamentary group's rapporteur on legal professionals, data privacy and labor law.
In 2018, they joined the Committee on Internal Affairs.
The same year, Seif became a member of the first Investigative Committee of the 19th legislative period, which is investigating the failure of German security authorities to prevent Anis Amri's attack on a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016.
In addition to their committee assignments, Seif is a member of the German-American Parliamentary Friendship Group and the German-British Parliamentary Friendship Group.
Political positions
European Affairs
On 17 July 2015, Seif voted against their party's line and rejected the Merkel government's proposal to negotiate a third bailout for Greece.
As the EU deputy spokesperson for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group and rapporteur for affairs in Great Britain, Seif is outspoken on the topic of Brexit. Before the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Seif stated that if Prime Minister Cameron wanted Britain to stay in the EU, they would have to convince their fellow Britons of the advantages of EU membership. Seif compared Cameron to a “butterfly,” and declared that “Britain does not need a butterfly but a lion.”
Regarding Brexit negotiations, Seif has taken a rigid stance and views the Brexit as a “catastrophe” that “damages economic development and the development of the EU.”
Upon Prime Minister Theresa May's activation of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon beginning formal Brexit proceedings and their remark that a failure to reach an agreement on Brexit would weaken UK-EU cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism, Seif was one of many German members of parliament who did not take kindly to May's statement, deeming it “an extraordinarily primitive attempt at blackmailing us.”
Seif blamed a leak to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung of an unflattering description of the first meeting between UK and EU negotiation teams in May 2017 on a “babbling idiot,” seeing both sides at fault for “the fact that the atmosphere is becoming poisoned.”
Seif believes the Brexit will do significant damage to both Great Britain and the EU and is quoted as saying “a win-win settlement is excluded and it's appropriate to speak about a lose-lose result.”
Domestic Affairs
Within their party, Seif belongs to the conservative wing.
During the Böhmermann affair in 2016, Seif read the Böhmermann's "smear poem" in the German Bundestag to demonstrate that it is an insult of the Turkish president, which caused the outrage of other MPs.
In June 2017, Seif voted against Germany's introduction of same-sex marriage. Following the party's result in the 2017 elections, they held that voters had abandoned the CDU because, under Angela Merkel, it had moved too far to the left.
Following Germany's September 2017 federal elections, Seif identified points of contention between the CDU, CSU, and SPD, telling Reuters that pensions, Europe and asylum and migration policy were all “areas where there are explosives built into the coalition agreement."
In April 2018, Seif was the first member of the German Bundestag to delete their Facebook account as a result of the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal. They wrote an open letter to Facebook's Managing Director in Central Europe in which they stated they could not recommend Facebook to anyone, so long as Facebook continued to handle user data in a sloppy fashion.
Ahead of the Christian Democrats' leadership election, Seif publicly opposed in 2020 Friedrich Merz's candidacy to succeed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as the party's chair.
Personal life
Seif is Protestant, married and has one daughter.

Vladi Panato (born 28 October 1972) is an Italian male canoeist who won 15 medals at senior level at the Wildwater Canoeing World Championships.
The myth has won 11 world cups making it the canoeist with the highest record of victories, six in a row from 1994 to 1999, then from 2001 to 2003, 2005 and in 2007 the eleventh and last one.
Biography
Their two daughters Cecilia and Alice are also canoeists. From 2017 they are also the technical director of the Italy national wildwater canoeing team, having taken over the role of another Italian canoeing legend, Robert Pontarollo.
In 2004 Vladi Panato ended the World Cup season with 192 points as the winner, but with equal partial successes (2) they were ranked second for the lowest number of second places (2 against 3). Panato had forfeited the sixth and final race in protest, although only one point would have been enough to win their ninth world cup. The winner was Tomislav Hohnjec.

The air mass coefficient defines the direct optical path length through the Earth's atmosphere, expressed as a ratio relative to the path length vertically upwards, i.e. at the zenith. The air mass coefficient can be used to help characterize the solar spectrum after solar radiation has traveled through the atmosphere.
The air mass coefficient is commonly used to characterize the performance of solar cells under standardized conditions, and is often referred to using the syntax "AM" followed by a number. "AM1.5" is almost universal when characterizing terrestrial power-generating panels.
Description
Solar radiation closely matches a black body radiator at about 5,800 K.
As it passes through the atmosphere, sunlight is attenuated by scattering and absorption; the more atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the attenuation.
As the sunlight travels through the atmosphere, chemicals interact with the sunlight and absorb certain wavelengths changing the amount of short-wavelength light reaching the Earth's surface.
A more active component of this process is water vapor, which results in a wide variety of absorption bands at many wavelengths, while molecular nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide add to this process. By the time it reaches the Earth's surface, the spectrum is strongly confined between the far infrared and near ultraviolet.
Atmospheric scattering plays a role in removing higher frequencies from direct sunlight and scattering it about the sky.
This is why the sky appears blue and the sun yellow — more of the higher-frequency blue light arrives at the observer via indirect scattered paths; and less blue light follows the direct path, giving the sun a yellow tinge.
The greater the distance in the atmosphere through which the sunlight travels, the greater this effect, which is why the sun looks orange or red at dawn and sunset when the sunlight is travelling very obliquely through the atmosphere — progressively more of the blues and greens are removed from the direct rays, giving an orange or red appearance to the sun; and the sky appears pink — because the blues and greens are scattered over such long paths that they are highly attenuated before arriving at the observer, resulting in characteristic pink skies at dawn and sunset.
Definition
For a path length through the atmosphere, and solar radiation incident at angle relative to the normal to the Earth's surface, the air mass coefficient is:
where is the path length at zenith (i.e., normal to the Earth's surface) at sea level.
The air mass number is thus dependent on the Sun's elevation path through the sky and therefore varies with time of day and with the passing seasons of the year, and with the latitude of the observer.
Calculation
A first-order approximation for air mass is given by
where is the zenith angle in degrees.
The above approximation overlooks the atmosphere's finite height, and predicts an infinite air mass at the horizon. However, it is reasonably accurate for values of up to around 75°. A number of refinements have been proposed to more accurately model the path thickness towards the horizon, such as that proposed by Kasten and Young (1989):
A more comprehensive list of such models is provided in the main article Airmass, for various atmospheric models and experimental data sets.
At sea level the air mass towards the horizon ( = 90°) is approximately 38.
Modelling the atmosphere as a simple spherical shell provides a reasonable approximation:
where the radius of the Earth = 6371 km, the effective height of the atmosphere ≈ 9 km, and their ratio ≈ 708.
These models are compared in the table below:
These simple models assume that for these purposes the atmosphere can be considered to be effectively concentrated into around the bottom 9 km, i.e. essentially all the atmospheric effects are due to the atmospheric mass in the lower half of the Troposphere. This is a useful and simple model when considering the atmospheric effects on solar intensity.
Cases
AM0
The spectrum outside the atmosphere, approximated by the 5,800 K black body, is referred to as "AM0", meaning "zero atmospheres". Solar cells used for space power applications, like those on communications satellites, are generally characterized using AM0.
AM1
The spectrum after travelling through the atmosphere to sea level with the sun directly overhead is referred to, by definition, as "AM1". This means "one atmosphere".
AM1 (=0°) to AM1.1 (=25°) is a useful range for estimating performance of solar cells in equatorial and tropical regions.
AM1.5
Solar panels do not generally operate under exactly one atmosphere's thickness: if the sun is at an angle to the Earth's surface the effective thickness will be greater. Many of the world's major population centres, and hence solar installations and industry, across Europe, China, Japan, the United States of America and elsewhere (including northern India, southern Africa and Australia) lie in temperate latitudes. An AM number representing the spectrum at mid-latitudes is therefore much more common.
"AM1.5", 1.5 atmosphere thickness, corresponds to a solar zenith angle of =48.2°. While the summertime AM number for mid-latitudes during the middle parts of the day is less than 1.5, higher figures apply in the morning and evening and at other times of the year. Therefore, AM1.5 is useful to represent the overall yearly average for mid-latitudes. The specific value of 1.5 has been selected in the 1970s for standardization purposes, based on an analysis of solar irradiance data in the conterminous United States. Since then, the solar industry has been using AM1.5 for all standardized testing or rating of terrestrial solar cells or modules, including those used in concentrating systems. The latest AM1.5 standards pertaining to photovoltaic applications are the ASTM G-173 and IEC 60904, all derived from simulations obtained with the SMARTS code.
The illuminance for Daylight (this version) under AM1.5 is given as 109,870 lux (corresponding with the AM1.5 spectrum to 1000.4 W/m2).
AM2~3
AM2 (=60°) to AM3 (=70°) is a useful range for estimating the overall average performance of solar cells installed at high latitudes such as in northern Europe.
Similarly AM2 to AM3 is useful to estimate wintertime performance in temperate latitudes, e.g. airmass coefficient is greater than 2 at all hours of the day in winter at latitudes as low as 37°.
AM38
AM38 is generally regarded as being the airmass in the horizontal direction (=90°, i.e. sunset) at sea level.
However, in practice there is a high degree of variability in the solar intensity received at angles close to the horizon as described in the next section Solar intensity.
At higher altitudes
The relative air mass is only a function of the sun's zenith angle, and therefore does not change with local elevation. Conversely, the absolute air mass, equal to the relative air mass multiplied by the local atmospheric pressure and divided by the standard (sea-level) pressure, decreases with elevation above sea level. For solar panels installed at high altitudes, e.g. in an Altiplano region, it is possible to use a lower absolute AM numbers than for the corresponding latitude at sea level: AM numbers less than 1 towards the equator, and correspondingly lower numbers than listed above for other latitudes. However, this approach is approximate and not recommended. It is best to simulate the actual spectrum based on the relative air mass (e.g., 1.5) and the actual atmospheric conditions for the specific elevation of the site under scrutiny.
Solar intensity
Solar intensity at the collector reduces with increasing airmass coefficient, but due to the complex and variable atmospheric factors involved, not in a simple or linear fashion.
For example, almost all high energy radiation is removed in the upper atmosphere (between AM0 and AM1) and so AM2 is not twice as bad as AM1.
Furthermore, there is great variability in many of the factors contributing to atmospheric attenuation,
such as water vapor, aerosols, photochemical smog and the effects of temperature inversions.
Depending on level of pollution in the air, overall attenuation can change by up to ±70% towards the horizon, greatly affecting performance particularly towards the horizon where effects of the lower layers of atmosphere are amplified manyfold.
One empirical approximation model for solar intensity versus airmass is given by:
where solar intensity external to the Earth's atmosphere = 1.353 kW/m2, and the factor of 1.1 is derived assuming that the diffuse component is 10% of the direct component.
This formula fits comfortably within the mid-range of the expected pollution-based variability:
This illustrates that significant power is available at only a few degrees above the horizon. For example, when the sun is more than about 60° above the horizon ( <30°) the solar intensity is about 1000 W/m2 (from equation as shown in the above table), whereas when the sun is only 15° above the horizon ( =75°) the solar intensity is still about 600 W/m2 or 60% of its maximum level; and at only 5° above the horizon still 27% of the maximum.
At higher altitudes
One approximate model for intensity increase with altitude and accurate to a few kilometres above sea level is given by:
where is the solar collector's height above sea level in km and is the airmass (from ) as if the collector was installed at sea level.
Alternatively, given the significant practical variabilities involved, the homogeneous spherical model could be applied to estimate AM, using:
where the normalized heights of the atmosphere and of the collector are respectively ≈ 708 (as above) and .
And then the above table or the appropriate equation ( or or for average, polluted or clean air respectively) can be used to estimate intensity from AM in the normal way.
These approximations at and are suitable for use only to altitudes of a few kilometres above sea level, implying as they do reduction to AM0 performance levels at only around 6 and 9 km respectively.
By contrast much of the attenuation of the high energy components occurs in the ozone layer - at higher altitudes around 30 km.
Hence these approximations are suitable only for estimating the performance of ground-based collectors.
Solar cell efficiency
Silicon solar cells are not very sensitive to the portions of the spectrum lost in the atmosphere. The resulting spectrum at the Earth's surface more closely matches the bandgap of silicon so silicon solar cells are more efficient at AM1 than AM0. This apparently counter-intuitive result arises simply because silicon cells can't make much use of the high energy radiation which the atmosphere filters out.
As illustrated below, even though the efficiency is lower at AM0 the total output power (Pout) for a typical solar cell is still highest at AM0.
Conversely, the shape of the spectrum does not significantly change with further increases in atmospheric thickness, and hence cell efficiency does not greatly change for AM numbers above 1.
This illustrates the more general point that given that solar energy is "free", and where available space is not a limitation, other factors such as total Pout and Pout are often more important considerations than efficiency (Pout/Pin).

Christian Gottlieb Geyser (20 August 1742, in Görlitz – 24 March 1803, in Leipzig) was a German painter and copper engraver.
Life and work
Their father, , was a Lutheran theologian, as was their elder brother, . They began their law studies in 1761, at the University of Leipzig, but also took art lessons from Adam Friedrich Oeser. In 1764, when Oeser became the first Director of the newly founded Academy of Fine Arts, they hired Geyser as an assistant engraving teacher.
After 1770, they worked as an independent book illustrator. That same year, they were elected a member of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. The following year, they became a full member of the Leipzig Academy. In 1773, they became a member of the . They married Oeser's daughter, Wilhelmine, in 1787.
During their life, they were best known for their illustrations; some for first editions of works by Goethe and Wieland. These enabled them to purchase a country estate in Eutritzsch (now a part of Leipzig). where their family lived after 1792. Their son, Gottlieb Wilhelm Geyser (1789–1865), who also became a graphic artist, later established a studio there. The building currently serves as a "Socio-Cultural Center", called the GeyserHaus.
They died of a stroke, while out taking a walk. Their collection of engravings was auctioned off in 1804.

The Vatican City State is a neutral nation, which has not engaged in any war since its formation in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty. It has no formal military compact or agreement with neighbouring Italy, although responsibility for defending the Vatican City from an international aggressor is likely to lie primarily with the Italian Armed Forces. When presenting the Lateran Treaty to the Italian parliament in 1929, Benito Mussolini declared: "It is evident that we [the Italian state] will be the necessary guarantors of this neutrality and inviolability [of Vatican City], since, in the remote hypothesis someone wanted to hurt her, they would first have to violate our territory."
Although the Vatican City State has never been at war, its forces were exposed to military aggression when it was bombed during World War II, and whilst defending Vatican property in Rome during the same conflict.
Although the former Papal States were defended by a relatively large Papal Army (including the Corsican Guard, active from 1603 to 1662) and a Papal Navy, a majority of these forces were disbanded when the Papal States ceased to exist in 1870. Immediately prior to the disbandment, the Esercito Pontificio (Papal Army) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments, a battalion of Irish volunteers, artillery and dragoons, plus the international Catholic volunteer corps the Papal Zouaves, formed in 1861 to oppose Italian unification. Following defeat and abolition of the States by the Kingdom of Italy, four small Papal units (the Pontifical Swiss Guard, the Noble Guard, the Palatine Guard, and the Papal Gendarmerie Corps) were retained, but restricted their activity to the Vatican in Rome.
Upon the 1929 formation of the Vatican City State, a unique form of sovereignty was defined. Under this agreement sovereignty is vested in the much more ancient Holy See, which is an ecclesiastical jurisdiction; but that sovereignty is exercised over the actual nation state of the Vatican City, an area of 110 acres defined in a map appended to the treaty, together with certain other properties formally located within the Italian state, but granted extraterritoriality.
The Vatican City State has never had independent armed forces, but it has always had a de facto military provided by the armed forces of the Holy See: the Pontifical Swiss Guard, the Noble Guard, the Palatine Guard, and the Papal Gendarmerie Corps. In practical terms, these armed forces have operated chiefly within the Vatican City State and the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo, and not in the many other extraterritorial properties of the Holy See, except during the time of World War Two when troops of the Palatine Guard were deployed to all Papal properties in and around Rome.
As part of a major reform in 1970 by Pope Paul VI, two of the units were disbanded, one was retained, and one was restructured into a civilian police service.
Palatine Guard
The Palatine Guard () was formed in 1850 by Pope Pius IX, through amalgamation of two older units of the Papal Army. The corps was formed as an infantry unit. It saw active service during the token resistance to the occupation of Rome by Italian government troops in 1870, and it survived into the period of the Vatican City State, as a de facto Vatican military unit (including a ceremonial military band) from 1929 to 1970.
In September 1943, when German troops occupied Rome in response to Italy's conclusion of an armistice with the Allies, the Palatine Guard was charged with protecting Vatican City, various Vatican properties in Rome, and the pope's summer villa at Castel Gandolfo. The guardsmen patrolled the walls, gardens, and courtyards of Vatican City, and stood guard at the entrances to papal buildings around Rome. On more than one occasion this service resulted in violent confrontations with Italian fascist police units working with the German authorities to arrest political refugees who were hiding in buildings protected by the Vatican. In September 1939 the Palatine Guard numbered 500 men; by the liberation of Rome in June 1944 the corps had grown to 2,000 men.
Later the Corps returned to its smaller size, and to chiefly ceremonial duties. It was abolished on 14 September 1970 by Pope Paul VI.
Noble Guard
The Noble Guard () was formed in 1801 by Pope Pius VII. The regiment was formed as a heavy cavalry unit. It was part of the Pope's personal guard, providing a mounted escort for the Pope when they travelled in their carriage; it saw no active military engagements. The Guard performed special missions within the Papal States until their abolition, and then continued to function at the Vatican with a limited mounted escort role. It survived (no longer with horses) into the period of the Vatican City State, as a de facto Vatican military unit from 1929 to 1970.
During World War Two members of the unit mounted guard outside the papal apartments by night and day, and guardsmen armed with pistols provided close protection to Pope Pius XII when they took their daily walks in the Vatican Gardens.
During its period as a Vatican City State military unit, the Noble Guard never numbered above 70 men, and apart from the wartime period it performed chiefly ceremonial duties. As its membership was drawn exclusively from families of noble origin (from nobility across Europe) it came to be seen as elitist, and it was abolished on 14 September 1970 by Pope Paul VI.
Pontifical Swiss Guard
The Pontifical Swiss Guard () was formed in 1506 by Pope Julius II. The unit was formed as the personal bodyguard of the Pope. At various points in its history the Swiss Guard has seen active service, but following the 1870 abolition of the Papal States it returned to its chief role as a bodyguard, with a limited ceremonial role, and survived into the period of the Vatican City State, as a de facto Vatican military unit from 1929.
The Swiss Guard continues to fulfil the bodyguard function, and provides security at the Apostolic Palace and the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo. In cooperation with the Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City it also controls access to the entrances to the city-state. Since the attempted assassination of the Pope in 1981 the Swiss Guard has undertaken more rigorous training, and a far more active security role, alongside its traditional ceremonial duties.
Since the early twentieth century the Guard has returned to its original practice of recruiting only Swiss nationals. As of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. All recruits complete basic military training with the Swiss Army before transferring to the Vatican, and must be Catholics and at least 174 cm (5 ft 8.5 in) in height. Members are armed with small arms for practical purposes, and for ceremonial functions the ranks carry the traditional Halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), the Corporals and Vice-corporals either Patisans polearms or Flammenschwert two-handed swords, while officers do not carry weapons, but command batons only.
Although the Pontifical Swiss Guard's first duty is the service of the Pope, during periods of "sede vacante" (when the office of pope is vacant), the Swiss Guard instead guards the College of Cardinals, as they meet to elect a new Bishop of Rome.
Papal Gendarmerie Corps
The Papal Gendarmerie Corps () was formed in 1816 by Pope Pius VII, originally under the name of Papal Carabinieri Corps. The unit was formed as a military police unit. In 1849 Pope Pius IX renamed it as the Papal Velites Regiment, and subsequently as the Papal Gendarmerie Corps. It saw active military engagements in the battles which culminated in the seizure and abolition of the Papal States. It survived (greatly reduced in size) into the period of the Vatican City State, as a de facto Vatican military unit from 1929 to 1970, providing internal security.
The elaborate ceremonial uniform (of 19th-century origin) included bearskin headdresses with red plumes, black coatees with white-fringed epaulettes, white doeskin breeches, and knee-high riding boots. The day-to-day service dress uniform included bicorne hats and blue trousers.
In 1970 the corps was transformed into a civilian police unit named the Central Security Office. In 1991 it was renamed the Security Corps of Vatican City State; finally, in 2002 its policing role was redefined, and it was given its current name of Gendarmerie Corps of Vatican City State, a title which links it back to its original military foundation.
The military unit's elaborate ceremonial uniforms continued in use until 1970. These have been simplified, and its structures are all now those of a civilian police service, with modern uniforms and equipment. However, the civilian corps does retain some ceremonial functions, including the provision of the Vatican City State's ceremonial marching band.

Clayton Mark and Company was a manufacturer of steel pipe and water well supplies located in Evanston, Illinois.
History
Clayton Mark founded Clayton Mark and Company in 1900 in Evanston to manufacture wrought steel pipe and water well supplies. Clayton Mark, along with their four sons Clarence Mark, Clayton Mark, Cyrus Mark, and Griffith Mark held various positions in the firm and made it a driver of Evanston's economy. It was the single largest employer in the city, with overall sales exceeding $10,000,000 a year. Clayton Mark products were sold throughout the United States and many countries worldwide. For example, Mark's forged steel unions (high pressure fittings) were used in oil wells from Texas to Arabia. The steel tubing manufactured at Clayton Mark and Company was used in the making of furniture, automobiles, and bicycles whose market was worldwide. Mark conduit was used in house construction for the conduction of electrical wiring. The firm's water well systems, supplies, and devices were used for pumping water out of the ground in rural districts around the globe.
Clayton Mark also co-founded with their father Cyrus the Mark Manufacturing Company in Northwest Indiana. In addition, they founded Marktown, a planned worker community to house its employees in East Chicago, Indiana. "

Al-Zini Barakat was the Egyptian novel written in 1974 novel, by the Egyptian writer Gamal al-Ghitani. The novel discusses the question of oppression persisting through time and place, in all Arab countries and it tries to merge past and present through the main character - Al-Zini Barakat. The novel was adapted into a TV series in 1995 directed by Yahya Al-Alami.
Subject of The Novel
Gamal al-Ghitani presents their novel - Al-Zini Barakat - as a record of Egypt's history through the two characters: Al-Zini Barakat and Zakariya Bin Radi. They present these two characters as characters who were actually present during the Mamluk era in Egypt. They use this novel to critique Egypt's modern history, especially during the 1960s.
Al-Ghitani saw parallels between the last bit of the 1960s, increased mass arrests and increased surveillance, and the period of Al-Zini Barakat, which was during the fall of the Mamluk era, and the rise of the Ottoman Empire in Egypt during 1517. The author also saw parallels between the Six-Day war (Naksa of 1967) and the Battle of Marj Dabiq of 1516, which resulted in a victory for the Ottomans. Especially since the period of the duo (Barakat and Zakariya) was filled with conflicts between leaders, leading them to lose against the Ottomans.
Literary Criticism
The Egyptian thinker Ibrahim Awad critiques the representation of Islam in this novel. They say that the mistakes are vile, and that even schoolboys have better knowledge of Islam.
Gamal al-Ghitani on Their Novel
Al-Ghitani states that "Al-Zini Barakat" resulted from their awareness of the police repression during the 1960s. They added that the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser was an attempt at social justice and achieving simple dreams. They also said that this attempt was killed off through democracy. They mentioned that this repression is not yet over, and that it is important to leave a testimony, especially since they belong to the generation of the 1960s, so that these mistakes do not get repeated.

Clonostylis is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. The sole species is Clonostylis forbesii is a flowering tree found in Sumatra. It has small glabrous leaves with an elliptic shape, arranged spirally.
Taxonomy
It was previously thought that Clonostylis S.Moore was a synonym of Spathiostemon Blume, but now Clonostylis is provisionally treated as a monotypic genus.
Since only one specimen has been found, according to the Nationaal Herbarium Nederland, and it did not exhibit fruit or staminate flowers, a more definite classification is not yet possible. (The species is unisexual, and the specimen in question had only pistillate flowers.)

Marcos García Barreno (born 21 March 1987), known as Marquitos, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for CD Ibiza Islas Pitiusas as a midfielder.
Club career
Born in Sant Antoni de Portmany, Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Marquitos was a product of Villarreal CF's youth system, and they made their first-team debut on 24 September 2006 in a 3–2 home win against Real Zaragoza. During the season they were an important attacking weapon for the fifth-placed side in La Liga and, in two starts, scored goals in home victories over Real Madrid (1–0) and FC Barcelona (2–0), playing 90 minutes on both occasions.
However, Marquitos would be loaned for 2007–08 to Recreativo de Huelva also in the top division, where they only appeared in half of the campaign's matches, with a goal against Real Murcia (4–2 home win). They returned to Villarreal only to be immediately loaned again, to Segunda División's Real Sociedad; they featured heavily during this spell, but the Basque team failed to achieve a top-flight return.
In late July 2009, Villarreal released Marquitos, whom immediately signed a four-year contract with top-tier Real Valladolid as well as former teammate César Arzo. On 17 October they netted again against Real Madrid, albeit in a 4–2 away defeat, but appeared sparingly throughout the season as the Castile and León side was eventually relegated.
Marquitos returned to Villarreal in the summer of 2010, on loan, but was assigned to the reserve squad in division two. They continued competing at that level the following years, with Xerez CD, SD Ponferradina and CE Sabadell FC.
In 2015 off-season, aged 28, Marquitos moved abroad for the first time, joining Polish club Miedź Legnica. The following January, they moved to the country's Ekstraklasa with GKS Górnik Łęczna.
In September 2016, Marquitos moved to the First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) with PFC Beroe Stara Zagora. They were released in December, and returned to Miedź.

Edward Charles Stewart Robert Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 8th Marquess of Londonderry, (18 November 1902 – 17 October 1955), styled Lord Stewart until 1915 and Viscount Castlereagh between 1915 and 1946, was a British peer and politician.
Early life
Born on 18 November 1902, into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family with its roots in Ulster and County Durham, they were the second child and only son of The 7th Marquess of Londonderry and their wife, The Honourable Edith Helen Chaplin.
They were educated at Eton College. In 1911, they were a page at the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary. They were painted holding their grandfather's coronet by Philip de László. The portrait now hangs at Mount Stewart, County Down.
They were known formally by their courtesy title, Viscount Castlereagh, before they inherited the Marquessate, and as Robin by close friends and family throughout their life.
Career
They worked as honorary attaché to the British Embassy in Rome and as a director of Londonderry Collieries, the family's coal mining company. A keen football fan, they were first a director and then chairperson of Arsenal Football Club from 1939 to 1946.
Lord Londonderry was an accomplished public speaker and, prior to succeeding their father as Marquess in 1949, was the Unionist Member of Parliament for Down in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1931 to 1945.
Marriage and family
They were married on 31 October 1931 at St Martin-in-the-Fields to Romaine Combe (d. 19 December 1951), the daughter of Major Boyce Combe, of Farnham, Surrey, and had issue:
Lady Jane Antonia Frances Vane-Tempest-Stewart (born 11 August 1932); they married, firstly, Max Rayne,Baron Rayne, on 2 June 1965, had issue, widowed in 2003. They married, secondly, Robert Lacey in 2012, no issue. Lady Jane was one of Queen Elizabeth II's maids of honour at their coronation.
Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart (born 13 June 1934)
Alexander Charles Robert Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 9th Marquess of Londonderry (7 September 1937 – 20 June 2012)
Lord Londonderry was a celebrated host and practical joker, reportedly once decorating the Christmas tree at Wynyard with condoms to startle a visiting cleric. They were an attentive husband and devoted father, entertaining their family with stories and tales. Also regarded as slightly eccentric, on one occasion Lord Londonderry had taken to their bed drunk, when Ruth Graham, the wife of the American evangelist Billy Graham, came to call. Although informed that Their Lordship was "indisposed", Mrs Graham insisted upon admission to their bedroom, having "come all the way on Billy's account". They were duly announced. Lord Londonderry threw aside the bed-sheets and shouted, "Get in."
They had an awkward and distant relationship with their parents, especially their father. The two men took opposite sides during industrial disputes involving the family coal mines, most notably during the General Strike in 1926. When they married Romaine, a brewer's daughter, their family viewed the union with disdain. It was a happy marriage by all accounts, but tragedy struck when Lady Londonderry died from cancer in 1951 and their husband plunged into depression and alcoholism.
"Daddy changed, literally overnight, into a complete drunk," Lady Annabel Goldsmith, their daughter, recalled. "It was awful. They would collapse while making speeches to the cricket club, that kind of thing. They were on the bottle night and day."
Lord Londonderry died from liver failure on 17 October 1955, at age 52. They were buried alongside their wife at Wynyard Park and both were later re-interred in the Londonderry family vault at St Mary's Church, Longnewton, County Durham.

Guitarchitecture is a term developed by Chuck Hammer in 1977, describing an approach to soundtrack composition, employing discrete textured guitar layers.
The core idea behind Guitarchitecture: "to expand the guitar's sonic vocabulary", is contextual and process based:
The Roland GR 500 Guitar/synthesizer allowed partial - "infinite sustain" through the use of a built-in magnetic field sustainer.
This "sustainer" radically altered the temporal properties of guitar string response, extending its basic physical sonic capabilities.
As the instrument could now sustain single notes and chords almost "infinitely", the music that could now be conceived and rendered with a guitar were widely reconsidered.
The ideas and concepts surrounding Guitarchitecture were gaining strength while Chuck Hammer toured live with a GR 500 Guitar Synth with Lou Reed 1978–1980. During this time, Hammer began recording a series of experimental Guitar Synth multi tracks for RCA, Epic, and Atlantic Records. These early Guitarchitecture soundtracks were eventually sent to David Bowie in an effort to raise their profile.
This eventually led to the recording of seminal guitar synth tracks for David Bowie's album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), released in September 1980 by RCA Records, which included four layered guitar synth tracks on "Ashes to Ashes".

Onogbokor is an Isoko-speaking town in the Ndokwa East Local Government Area (LGA), Delta State, Nigeria. Until the creation of Delta State in 1991, it was formerly with the Ndoshimili LGA with headquarters located in Kwale, in the defunct Bendel state. It shares common boundaries with Iyede-Ame in the south, Igeh to the east, Umuolu and Itebiege to the north and Akara-etiti on the west. The town has three quarters: Ushie, Ogbe-ekpako and Ove. Inhabitants of the town dominantly speak the Isoko dialect with few migrant Ụkwụànì speakers. They intermarry Ụkwụànìs, Ijaws and other tribes. As a clan, it has four communities: Ewo-Okpe community, Okporo community, Ewo-eboy community and Obere community (named after a lake that has its tributary from the Niger River). There are migrants from neighbouring nearby communities and pockets of Ijaw fishermen and Hausa petty traders in the clan.
Oral history has it that Onogbokor's founder Edo migrated from Okpe-Isoko and first settled near a lake called Onogbokor some 15 kilometers from the town's current location. After losing their first son to drowning, they relocated to the present location and named it after the lake. The lake is a major source of fish and other aquatic resources for the town's people.
The town can be accessed from Ofagbe or Ibrede by an asphalt road. There is a ferry on the Ase Creek in Ewho-Okarafor by which vehicles can cross, during the dry season, and speedboat and local engine boats through Umuolu from the River Niger during high tide. It can also be accessed through an untarred earth road from Aboh, the Ndokwa-East Local Government Headquarters. The livelihood activities of people are fishing and farming, petty trading and lately timber logging.

The Wonders of Aladdin (Italian: Le meraviglie di Aladino) is a 1961 Italian-French-American comedy fantasy film directed by Henry Levin (with second unit direction by Mario Bava—uncredited in U.S. prints but credited as sole director in Italy) and produced by Joseph E. Levine for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film stars Donald O'Connor as the title character.

Marco Tulli as Fakir
Production
O'Connor signed to make the film in October 1960. O'Connor said "The story of Aladdin has been done by everyone but this is its first time around as a comedy." The Wonders of Aladdin were produced in tandem with two Steve Reeves vehicles, Morgan, the Pirate and The Thief of Baghdad, with producer Joseph E. Levine, set designer Flavio Mogherini, cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli and special effects artist Mario Bava working on all three films; Levine packaged and sold their worldwide distribution rights to MGM.
Shooting
The film was shot in location in Tunisia with studio work in Rome. Filming started December 1960. The Tunisian government were keen to attract filmmakers to the region and provided much assistance, including the loan of their army as soldiers.
According to camera operator Marcello Gatti, Henry Levin directed "80%" of The Wonders of Aladdin, while Bava's on-set contributions consisted of second unit direction and supervising the film's special effects. Because Bava was also in charge of the film's post-production process in Italy, such as its dubbing, Italian and French prints use the credit "A film by Henry Levin, directed by Mario Bava". English language prints only credit Levin with direction. Tim Lucas notes in their 2020 audio commentary for the Kino Lorber DVD and Blu-Ray that the use of a mosque as a shooting location caused a violent revolt that led to the killing of five people, followed by the killing of a security guard at the American embassy that had cleared the location for the shoot. Lucas notes that Bava themselves had numerous spears pointed at their head during the attack, which they considered the most frightening moment in their life.
While filming in Tunisia in December, Donald O'Connor suffered a blood hemorrhage on this throat and had to be rushed to hospital.
Vittorio De Sica played a small role. It only took a week but the actor said it was "very tiring because of the tricks."
In January, three Americans on the film - O'Connor, Levin and writer Henry Motofsky - accidentally crossed the Tunisian border into Algeria 20 miles south of Tozeur while scouting locations in the Sahara Desert and were arrested. They were held for three hours then returned to the film unit.
Filming finished in March 1961.
"From now on I'll do nothing but drawing room comedies," said O'Connor, "and the only location I'm going on is in my backyard".
Reception
Critical reception
AllMovie, while not particularly favorable toward the film, called it "a fun movie".

Arian Keon Clark (born April 16, 1975) is an American former basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
Playing career
After a collegiate career at two different junior colleges and UNLV, Clark was selected 13th overall by the Orlando Magic in the 1998 NBA draft but was traded to the Denver Nuggets. They began their professional career with Denver where they enjoyed a stable first three years in the NBA, improving steadily. Clark would go on to play for the Toronto Raptors, Sacramento Kings, and Utah Jazz. With the Jazz, they only played two games before being traded to the Phoenix Suns for whom they never played a game.
They hold Toronto Raptors franchise record for most blocks in one game with 12, set on 23 March 2001 in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.
In 2002, Clark posted averages of 11.3 points and 1.51 blocks per game, while also finishing ninth in the NBA in total personal fouls.
They hold career averages of 8.2 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.62 blocks per game.
Personal life
Clark has been plagued by personal problems since leaving the NBA. In 2006, they were due to stand trial in Illinois on marijuana and weapons charges, but never showed up for trial. U.S. Marshals found them boarding a bus in Houston, Texas and brought them back to Danville for trial. They were sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but the sentence was thrown out because they did not have a lawyer at the time of sentencing. At a hearing, Clark admitted that they were a recovering alcoholic who had been drinking for most of the time since high school. They added that they "never played a game sober" during their NBA career, and usually drank during halftime. By their estimate, they drank half a pint to a pint of gin daily during their professional career.
On December 5, 2013 Clark was sentenced to eight years in prison for weapons charges but only served four. They were released from prison in July 2017, and currently lives in their hometown of Danville, Illinois.

John Fell (22 August 1735, Cockermouth – 6 September 1797, Homerton Academy) was an English congregationalist minister and classical tutor.
Life
Fell was born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 22 August 1735. Their father, Daniel Fell, was a schoolmaster, clerk to the dissenting congregation, and occasional village preacher. Fell was apprenticed to a tailor, and after serving their time obtained a situation in London. Their bent was towards the dissenting ministry, and by the help of the King's Head Society they were placed in 1757 at the Mile End academy under John Conder, D.D. The classical tutor was John Walker, D.D., an excellent scholar, who took a great fancy to Fell, and gave them private instructions. On leaving the academy they were for a short time assistant in a school at Norwich. In 1762 they were invited to take charge of an independent congregation at Beccles, Suffolk. They preached there for several years, but declined the pastorate, the church not being organised to their satisfaction.
In May 1770 they succeeded David Parry as minister of the congregational church at Thaxted, Essex, where they were ordained on 24 October. This was their happiest settlement; their congregation grew, they lived on intimate terms with successive rectors of the parish, and with Rayner Hickford, the Saxon scholar; and they had time for literary and theological pursuits and for private tuition. One of their young tutees during this period was Richard Sharp with whom they formed a lifelong friendship, Sharp writing the Introduction to Fell's 'Grammar' (1784) which is listed below. Fell's writings in reply to Hugh Farmer are able, but too acrimonious. In 1787, on the retirement of Benjamin Davies, D.D., they accepted the post of classical tutor in their alma mater, and removed (September 1769) to Homerton Academy. It soon became apparent that Fell could not get on well with their students. Their apologist speaks of a spirit of insubordination in the academy prior to their appointment. Matters went from bad to worse till at the annual examination in June 1795 charges and counter-charges were brought forward. After much deliberation the governing body, in March 1796, insisted on Fell's retirement, either at midsummer or Christmas. Their friends drew up a protest, which the majority declined to record. Fell left the academy at the end of January 1797, and was succeeded by John Berry.
Doubtless Fell had faults of temper; they offended some by a rigid orthodoxy, others they estranged by their republican sympathies. Through the exertions of a London merchant Fell was provided with an annuity of £100. A committee of eight laypeople raised some £200 as remuneration for a course of twelve lectures on the evidences. Fell had delivered four of these to crowded audiences in the Scots Church, London Wall, when their health gave way. They died unmarried on 6 Sept. 1797 at Homerton, and was buried at Bunhill Fields on 15 Sept., a funeral oration being delivered by Joseph Brooksbank. The funeral sermon was preached at the Old Jewry on Sunday evening, 24 September, by Henry Hunter, D.D., of the Scots Church.

The Codex Vigilanus or Codex Albeldensis (Spanish: Códice Vigilano or Albeldense) is an illuminated compilation of various historical documents accounting for a period extending from antiquity to the 10th century in Hispania. Among the many texts brought together by the compilers are the canons of the Visigothic Councils of Toledo, the Liber Iudiciorum, the decrees of some early popes and other patristic writings, historical narratives (such as the Crónica Albeldense and the Life of Mohammed), various other pieces of civil and canon law, and a calendar. It is now in the library of El Escorial monastery, with the shelfmark D.I.2.
The compilers were three monks of the Riojan monastery of San Martín de Albelda: Vigila, after whom it was named and who was the illustrator; Serracino, their friend; and García, their disciple. The first compilation was finished in 881, but was updated up to 976. The original manuscript is preserved in the library of El Escorial (as Escorialensis d I 2). At the time of its compilation, Albelda was the cultural and intellectual centre of the Kingdom of Pamplona. The manuscripts celebrate with illustrations not only the ancient Gothic kings who had reformed the law — Chindasuinth, Reccesuinth, and Ergica — but also its contemporary dedicatees, the rulers of Navarre: Sancho II of Pamplona and their queen, Urraca, and their brother Ramiro Garcés, King of Viguera.
The Codex contains, among other pieces of useful information, the first mention and representation of Arabic numerals (save zero) in the West. They were introduced by the Arabs into Spain around 900.
The illuminations are stylistically unique, combining Visigothic, Mozarabic, and Carolingian elements. To interlace patterns and the drapery show Carolingian, as well Italo-Byzantine, influence. The use of animals as decoration and for supporting columns also parallels contemporary Frankish usage. More Carolingian and less Byzantine influence is evident in the Codex Aemilianensis, a copy of the Vigilanus made at San Millán de la Cogolla in 992 by a different illustrator.

Belfort Castle is a ruined castle in the municipality of Brienz/Brinzauls of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
The castle was built in two parts, an upper and a lower castle, on a rocky ridge east of Brienz/Brinzauls. The first castle on the site probably dates to around 1200. In 1222 the castle was first mentioned as the home of the Lords of Vaz. Some parts of the castle have been dated by dendrochronology to 1228-31. The original upper castle consisted of a gatehouse and three-story main towers on the north wall. In 1240 the castle was expanded. A small residence was added to the west wall, the main tower gained an additional story and the large south residence was added. The lower castle was added as well at this time, but was mostly used for protection not as a residence.
During the late 13th century Walter Vatz von Vaz allied themselves with the Habsburgs against the Bishop of Chur and other local nobles. In 1287 a representative of the Bishop's, Walter Caramamma, was killed at Belfort. In 1332 another representative of the Bishop, Ulrich von Marmels, was executed at the castle, probably after being captured in a battle near Filisur. When the last of the male line, Donat von Vaz, died in 1337 Count Friedrich V von Toggenburg inherited the castle. Under the Toggenburgs the area was administered and the castle was probably occupied by a vogt.
When Frederick VII von Toggenburg died in 1436, the Belfort lands declared themselves free and joined the League of the Ten Jurisdictions. Several claimants fought legal battles to try to get their claims to Belfort recognized. In 1439, it was granted to Wilhelm von Montfort-Tettnang and Heinrich von Sax-Misox who together appointed a bailiff to occupy the castle and administer the lands. In 1466 the Montfort-Tettnang family sold their interest in the area to Sigmund of Austria. However, the residents of the area refused to acknowledge Austrian authority and in 1471 they were forced to sell their interest to the Matsch family. Six years later, in 1477, the Austrian Duke bought Belfort from the Matschs, triggering another round of protests and rebellion. In 1475 it is recorded that the castle was garrisoned with the bailiff and two mercenaries. In 1490, in an attempt to fortify the castle, the walls were raised.
In 1499, during the Swabian War the castle was stormed and burned.
Castle site
The upper castle is a rough pentagon built around a central courtyard with a round cistern. The old gate and gatehouse were built on the north side of the complex, with a large main tower grafted on the western side of the gatehouse. The main tower has walls that were up to thick. The northern gate was eventually closed and a new gate added on the eastern side. A large residence building formed the entire south end of the castle. The castle cistern went deep into the rock. Portions of the outer walls, a main tower, a five-story tall residential wing and a gate house are still standing. The lower castle stretched south along the ridge. It consisted of lower walls running along the east and west edges of the ridge and larger wall on the southern edge. A steep stairway carved into the rock connected the two fortifications. The northern, upper ruins were repaired and reinforced in 1935-36. The entire site was cleaned and repaired in 2002.

Michael "Mike" D. Schrunk served as district attorney of Multnomah County, Oregon, United States from 1981 until 2012.  They are believed to be the longest-serving district attorney in Oregon.
After eight Portland narcotics officers were implicated for misconduct in 1981, Schrunk, sought pardons from the governor for 58 people convicted.
In 1985 a Portland police officer killed Lloyd Stevenson, a Black man, using a chokehold. It was ruled a homicide while under Schrunk's investigation, but a grand jury convened by Schrunk declined to indict either of the officers involved, citing the wording used in the homicide ruling as insufficiently definitive. Simultaneous with Stevenson's funeral, two officers sold T-shirts to fellow officers that read "Smoke Em, Don't Choke Em." The two officers were fired, but reinstated by a union arbitrator.
After three men beat and killed Ethiopian national Mulugeta Seraw in Southeast Portland in 1988, Schrunk's office prosecuted them. Schrunk described them as members of East Side White Pride, which they stated was the largest skinhead group in the state.
In 1989 Schrunk called on the county to devote more funds to drug use and gangs.
Programs they championed have been replicated across the country. They played a part in launching the nation's second drug court; twenty years later, there were 2500 such courts in the United States.
In 2002 Willamette Week searched the trash of Schrunk, then-mayor Vera Katz, and then-chief of police Mark Kroeker, for a story in response to a police decision endorsing the search of citizens' trash during investigations. Of the three targets, only Schrunk responded with poise and good humor. A 2019 Oregon Supreme Court ruling which referenced the story established that privacy rights do in fact extend to an individual's trash. In 2003 a star witness of Schrunk's ended up imprisoned himself, in a bizarre and complex case regarded as a blemish on Schrunk's record.
By 2009, Schrunk was regarded as the most influential politician in the county. That power was exemplified by their open refusal to try cases against a specific judge they believed was too sympathetic to suspects. In 2010, due to budget constraints, they made a controversial decision to treat a number of illegal acts as crimes.
Schrunk never sought higher office. Upon their retirement in 2012, Schrunk endorsed Rod Underhill, who was elected to the office unopposed in 2012 and 2016.
Early life
Mike Schrunk was born into a politically active family in Portland in 1942. Schrunk's father, Terry Schrunk, was elected Sheriff of Multnomah County in 1949. Subsequently they were elected mayor of Portland four times, from 1957 to 1972.
Mike Schrunk attended Roosevelt High School, where they were a star athlete, ultimately being inducted into the Portland Interscholastic League Hall of Fame for football, basketball, and baseball. After high school they continued to play basketball and football at Portland State College. Schrunk was named as an Oregon Collegiate Conference all-league football player in 1963. They were the starting quarterback on the Portland State's conference champion team that year.
While at Portland State they also excelled at basketball. Today at Portland State University there is a scholarship given in their name called “The Mike Schrunk Scholar-Athlete of the Year.
After graduating from Portland State College in 1964, Schrunk attended the University of Oregon Law School. They graduated in 1967. They excelled in school and was on the school's law review.
Following law school, Schrunk was commissioned in the United States Marine Corps and served in Vietnam at the height of the war. They were discharged as a captain in 1970.
Early legal career
Following their time in the Marine Corps, Schrunk became a deputy district attorney in the MCDA's office from 1970 to 1977. They were assigned largely to felony prosecutions and eventually responsible for administering all the homicide cases in the office. Among their most significant cases was their 1975 conviction of Colin Hockings for the widely publicized bludgeoning murder of a married couple and two children.
In 1977, Schrunk went into private practice representing clients in civil litigation and criminal defense. In 1980, while still in private practice, they were appointed as a special prosecutor by Oregon Attorney General's Office to investigate and prosecute corruption charges against Gary Gortmaker, the District Attorney of Marion County, Oregon. Schrunk obtained indictments and convictions against Gortmaker.
Multnomah County District Attorney (MCDA)
In 1980, Schrunk was elected to the office of Multnomah County District Attorney. They became the district attorney in January 1981.
The SID Scandal
Upon assuming office, Schrunk inherited a significant police scandal involving a Portland Police Bureau drug unit (Special Investigations Department, or SID). In May,1980 it was discovered that
members of the SID unit may have been planting drugs, falsifying affidavits, perjuring themselves in court and stealing undercover money. Compounding the scandal was an incident of a police officer who had been shot to death during the service of search warrant on a biker gang residence when the police were attempting to plant drugs in the location.
Immediately upon assuming office Schrunk formed an independent task force to address the scandal, which was under their exclusive control. It was made up of two veteran homicide detectives, and two senior deputy district attorneys. Ultimately five officers were dismissed from the Police Bureau, one was convicted and served a prison term. In addition, 59 convictions were overturned, 35 pending cases dismissed upon motions of the District Attorney's Office and a Manslaughter I conviction was set aside.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) awarded Schrunk the Civil Liberties Award for their actions in the SID scandal.
Innovations in Justice System Administration
Throughout their long tenure in office, Schrunk was a leading national advocate for specialized programs, which more effectively addressed criminal conduct. Among the programs pioneered by the District Attorney's office under Schrunk were:
Drug Courts
In 1991, Multnomah County was the second jurisdiction in the nation to institute a drug treatment court, designed to induce drug users to obtain treatment rather than to merely convict them of drug
possession. Offenders who completed treatment had their cases dismissed and any record expunged. The program was considered a national model which has since been duplicated across the nation.
Neighborhood prosecution
In 1990, Schrunk established the Neighborhood District Attorney Program. The program placed experienced deputy district attorneys in small offices in communities experiencing high levels of “maintenance and order” crimes, misdemeanors such as prostitution, car break-ins, theft, and street level drug dealing. The successes of the program in dealing with quality-of-life crimes
became a national model for community prosecution.
Domestic violence
The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office was one of the first offices in the nation to establish a unit dedicated solely to the prosecution of domestic violence offenses. Beginning in 1989, the unit handled all domestic violence crimes in the county, and served as the central organizational unit for domestic violence coordination among law enforcement agencies in the county. They pioneered a specialty court for domestic violence.
Victim's rights
Like most states, Oregon moved to expand the rights of crime victims in the 1980s and 1990s. The Multnomah County Distric Attorney's Office was a leader in this effort. Schrunk and their office worked with the legislature, and victims' rights groups to establish significant statutory and constitutional rights for crime victims. In 1986, their office drafted a victims' rights initiative, which was passed by voters by an overwhelming majority (75%).
The Multidisciplinary Child Abuse Team (MDT)
In November 1989, Schrunk convened a policy group composed of Children's Services Division, Portland Police Bureau, Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, Juvenile Court,
Gresham Police Department, CARES NW, local hospitals, area schools, and the Multnomah County Health Division to develop interim protocols for how the county dealt with child abuse under the supervision of their Chief Deputy in charge of their Family Justice Division. Based on the protocols established by the policy group, in March 1990, the Multidisciplinary Child Abuse Team (MDT) began operation to ensure that child victims coming into the criminal justice system would be protected at every step in the system. In addition, both the police and the prosecutors developed the expertise to process these cases much better.
Community Courts
In 1986 Schrunk visited the recently opened Midtown Manhattan Community Court. The concept was to place misdemeanor courts within certain communities and then find community solutions as part of the sentence. Schrunk saw the potential in replicating the project in Portland. Their efforts resulted in the establishment of the North/Northeast Community Court
in March 1998, the second oldest community court in the country. Two other courts followed, the South/Southeast Community Court in Feb. 2000 and the Downtown/Westside Community Court in April 2001. In 2003, a fourth was opened in Gresham, Oregon, which is in the eastern part of the county.
Significant cases
Mulugeta Seraw
On November 13, 1988 Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian immigrant, was beaten to death in a Portland park by three white nationalist skinhead members of the White Aryan Resistance (WAR), a California white supremacist organization. The three offenders were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences. As a result of the convictions, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center won a $12.5 million verdict against the White Aryan Resistance and its leader Tom Metzger, resulting in a forfeiture of significant assets of the organization.
Tonya Harding
In January 1994, U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding and their then-husband Jeff Gilooly were involved in an attack on Harding's U.S. skating teammate Nancy Kerrigan, designed to keep Kerrigan from competing against Harding in the February 1994 Winter Olympics. Harding later accepted a plea bargain in which they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution. As a result of their involvement in the aftermath of the assault on Kerrigan, the United States Figure Skating Association banned them for life.
“Happy Face” Killer
Keith Hunter Jesperson is a Canadian American serial killer who killed at least eight women while working as a truck driver. One of their victims was Taunja Bennett, whose body was found in early 1990 in a remote part of Multnomah County. Schrunk's office prosecuted and convicted Laverne Pavlinac and John Sosnovske, two individuals who were later determined to have had no connection to the case, based on a false confession by Pavlinac. Jesperson later confessed to the killings and plead guilty to the murder. Schrunk's office moved successfully to have Pavlinac's and Sosnovske's convictions overturned, despite initial opposition by the court. The case received significant national press, leading to a film and several documentaries.

Saigon is a 1948 American film noir crime film directed by Leslie Fenton starring Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. In their fourth and final film together. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures and was one of the last films Veronica Lake made under their contract with the studio. Ladd and Lake made four films together; This Gun for Hire and The Glass Key, both in 1942, The Blue Dahlia in 1946 and Saigon. While the earlier films all proved to be big box office successes, Saigon did not do as well financially. Ladd continued to remain one of Paramount's top male stars, while Lake's career was in decline. By the end of 1948 their contract with Paramount had expired and the studio chose not to renew it.
For Ladd, Saigon was one of a series of adventure films set in foreign locales, starting with Two Years Before the Mast (1946) and Calcutta (1947).

Production
In May 1943, Harry Hervey sold an original story to MGM about the Japanese Invasion of Indo-China called Saigon. This film was never made. In October 1945 it was announced Paramount would make a film called Saigon about the relationship between a British officer and American woman during the Japanese occupation of Indo-China. Wells Root was to write and produce. Eventually the studio abandoned this project, in early 1946.
Later, the studio decided to use the title for a new story, set in post-WWII Indo-China and starring Alan Ladd, who had previously appeared in exotic adventure tales such as China and (the then still unreleased) Calcutta. In September 1946 it was announced Ladd would star, PJ Wolfson would produce and James Henagan and John Leman were writing the script. Leslie Fenton was assigned to direct in October. It was meant to start that month but shooting was pushed back when Wild Harvest (1947), starring Ladd, took an extra 10 days to film. This meant that Fenton was replaced as director on The Big Clock by John Farrow.
Douglas Dick was cast in November. Luther Adler joined the same month.
Filming took place in late 1946 and early 1947. For the movie, Veronica Lake reverted to their famous "peek-a-boo bob" hairstyle, which they had abandoned during the war at the request of the government because female factory workers kept getting their hair caught while imitating it.
Reception
Critical
Film critic Philip K. Scheuer in their review of Saigon for the Los Angeles Times, called the film "long on atmosphere and short on logic." In a similar vein, Bosley Crowther simply dismissed the film as "sorry" and "a fine lot of super-silly moonshine, more to be laughed at than esteemed."
Diabolique magazine says "it's the least effective" of the Lake-Ladd teamings arguing" It starts off excellently but tails away in its second half. The storyline feels cobbled together from elements of previous Paramount hits, particularly ones starring Ladd."
Box office
Although commonly regarded in retrospect as a flop, due to comparison with Ladd's more successful motion pictures, the film was reasonably popular. Variety listed Saigon as the fourth most popular film at the box office in March 1948 and the 7th most popular film in April.
The film was also popular at the British box office.

John D. Bonvillian (1948-2018) was a psychologist and associate professor - emeritus in the Department of Psychology and the Interdepartmental Program in Linguistics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.  They are the principal developer of Simplified Signs, a manual sign communication system designed to be easy to form, easy to understand and easy to remember.  They are also known for their research contributions to the study of sign language, child development, psycholinguistics, and language acquisition.
Education, early work, and career
Bonvillian received a B.A. in Psychology from Johns Hopkins University in 1970. While an undergraduate there, they were introduced to the field of child development by Mary D. S. Ainsworth and to psycholinguistics by James E. Deese. They then attended Stanford University on a National Science Foundation doctoral fellowship, earning their Ph.D. in 1974. As a graduate student, they worked primarily with Keith E. Nelson as they conducted studies on child language acquisition in typically developing children and children with disabilities. Some of this work was later reprinted in other publications. They also wrote several articles examining the impact of maternal language input and other behaviors on a child's subsequent development. During their time at Stanford, John met William C. Stokoe, a pioneering figure in sign language research. Subsequently, the two were to work together editing the journal, Sign Language Studies.
In 1974, Bonvillian accepted an appointment as an assistant professor at Vassar College. In 1978, they were invited to join the faculty at the University of Virginia, where they were reunited as a colleague with their former professors, Ainsworth and Deese, who had previously accepted appointments at Virginia. They taught at UVA until their retirement in May 2015. They died on May 8, 2018, at the age of 69.
Research
Sign language acquisition and development
In 1979, Bonvillian commenced the first of two longitudinal studies of sign language acquisition in young children with deaf parents. These studies (conducted primarily with Michael D. Orlansky and Raymond J. Folven) were to provide valuable information on the course of American Sign Language (ASL) acquisition. Their research found that the patterns with which children developed proficiency in ASL was highly similar to the patterns with which children acquired spoken language skills. While the pattern of acquisition was similar across language modalities, many of the sign-learning children attained different language milestones in ASL earlier than their hearing counterparts attained these same milestones in spoken English (see the discussion of Baby sign language). These studies also provided information on how young children learn to form ASL signs. More specifically, these data enabled Bonvillian (with Theodore Siedlecki) to develop an account of sign language phonological acquisition.
Bonvillian also conducted investigations into the use of manual signs to facilitate communication in minimally verbal or non-speaking children and adults, such as persons with aphasia or an intellectual disability. In particular, they conducted a number of studies of sign language acquisition in children with autism. In the 1990s, Bonvillian (with Brenda Seal) examined sign formation difficulties in children with autism. This study made it clear that for manual signs to be used easily by children with autism, then the signs should consist of a single movement and be composed of a limited number of basic or unmarked handshapes. Over their career, Bonvillian contributed multiple articles and chapters on sign language, sign language acquisition, and sign language development to various encyclopedias, textbooks, and other forums focused on language development, child development, and/or various aspects of deafness. They also wrote multiple reviews of books that were focused on these research areas as well as on language development in special populations.
Word recall studies
In addition to word recall in deaf and hearing students being the topic of their dissertation, Bonvillian continued to perform a series of investigations into strategies or factors that improve (or inhibit) deaf persons' and hearing persons' recall of ASL signs and/or English words that had been presented to them. In one study, deaf students who performed the sign language equivalent of each English word in a list remembered more words than those deaf students using other recall strategies; English words rated higher in imagery value also were recalled more often than words with low-imagery values. In a sign recall study involving hearing persons previously unfamiliar with American Sign Language, different recall methods were encouraged in each of three experimental conditions; the condition in which the etymology or origin of a sign was provided along with its English translation equivalent resulted in better long-term sign retention.
Project Koko
Bonvillian wrote a review of The Education of Koko by Francine Patterson and Eugene Linden in 1982. Bonvillian and Patterson had known each other at Stanford University and had worked together with Koko the gorilla. They also had written an article on mother and peer attachment in rhesus monkeys in 1975. They later published several articles in the 1990s on the sign language acquisition of gorillas in comparison with that of the young signing children of Deaf parents, noting both the similarities and differences between the sign language development of the two groups. Bonvillian and Patterson also penned a short article on approaches to ape language research. Bonvillian was a supporting member of the Gorilla Foundation.
Hand preference studies
Another recurring topic in Bonvillian's research was the issue of hand preference in deaf persons, signing children of Deaf parents (whether the children were deaf or hearing), and persons with autism. Since sign languages are based on the visual-manual modality of communication (rather than the auditory-vocal modality of spoken languages), Bonvillian wondered whether individuals exposed to signing from birth (because they had one or two signing Deaf parents) showed different handedness patterns than hearing individuals not exposed to signing from birth. They were also interested in whether such persons' hand preference varied depending on whether their manual activity was for signing or was non-sign in nature (i.e., object actions, general communicative gestures, or other manual actions). The studies of the signing children of Deaf parents showed that they had a stronger hand preference (typically for the right hand) for their manual signing activity than they showed for non-sign communicative gestures and object actions. In contrast, sign-learning students with autism did not display as strong of a hand preference in their signing activity. An earlier study of handedness patterns in deaf high-school and college students also showed a higher incidence of left-handedness, and that left-handed students tended to have been exposed to signing at a later age than those deaf students who preferred using their right hand.
Use of manual signs and gestures in early contact situations
Bonvillian, who had always maintained a strong interest in and personal passion for history, investigated the use of manual signs and gestures by hearing persons in various historical contexts. In particular, they focused on the use of manual signs and gestures during early contact situations between Europeans and the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. They approached this latter task in a systematic manner by examining the first-hand written accounts and journals of voyagers who travelled to the “New World” in search of riches (see, for example, their peer-reviewed article on Bernal Díaz del Castillo and Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, as well as the second chapter of their book Simplified Signs, Volume 1). They also researched and published work on the voyages of Martin Frobisher to Baffin Island and the Englishman's resulting interactions with the Inuit. Of special interest to Bonvillian was the pre-existing use of various manual sign-communication systems in and among the various Indigenous nations of North America before the arrival of Europeans (in particular, the use of Plains Indian Sign Language as a lingua franca between Indigenous nations whose spoken languages were mutually incomprehensible). Bonvillian also was curious about the origins of language in humans and the possibility that gesture preceded speech as a communication system.
Simplified Sign System
In 1998, Bonvillian began work on developing a simplified, manual sign-communication system. The initial focus of this project was to develop a sign-communication system for non-speaking or minimally verbal individuals, such as children with autism, Down syndrome, or cerebral palsy. At the time of their death, Bonvillian's research team had developed a Simplified Sign System lexicon consisting of approximately 1850 easily formed, highly iconic signs or gestures. This increase in the size of sign vocabulary was undertaken to meet the needs of students and teachers who wanted to use Simplified Signs to facilitate the acquisition of foreign language vocabulary items. Research suggests that by performing highly iconic Simplified Signs with to-be-learned foreign language vocabulary items, students are able to internalize items into their memories more quickly and effectively. The first 1000 signs of the Simplified Sign System were published on July 30, 2020, by Open Book Publishers in Cambridge, U.K.

Men's 60 kg competition in judo at the 2000 Summer Olympics was held on 16 September at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre.
This event was the lightest of the men's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 60 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.

The 360-day calendar is a method of measuring durations used in financial markets, in computer models, in ancient literature, and in prophetic literary genres.
It is based on merging the three major calendar systems into one complex clock, with the 360-day year derived from the average year of the lunar and the solar: (365.2425 (solar) + 354.3829 (lunar))/2 = 719.6254/2 = 359.8127 days, rounding to 360.
A 360-day year consists of 12 months of 30 days each, so to derive such a calendar from the standard Gregorian calendar, certain days are skipped.
For example, the 27th of June (Gregorian calendar) would be the 4th of July in the USA.
Ancient Calendars
Ancient calendars around the world initially used a 360 day calendar.
Rome
Romans initially used a calendar which had 360 days, with varying length of months.
India
The Rig Veda describes a calendar with twelve months and 360 days.
Mesoamerica
In the Mayan Long Count Calendar, the equivalent of the year, the tun, was 360 days.
Egypt
Ancient Egyptians also used a 360 day calendar.
One myth tells of how the extra 5 days were added.
Financial use
A duration is calculated as an integral number of days between startdate and enddate B. The difference in years, months and days are usually calculated separately:
There are several methods commonly available which differ in the way that they handle the cases where the months are not 30 days long, i.e. how they adjust dates:
European method (30E/360)
If either date A or B falls on the 31st of the month, that date will be changed to the 30th.
Where date B falls on the last day of February, the actual date B will be used.
All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days, but another source says that February has its actual number of days.
US/NASD method (30US/360)
If both date A and B fall on the last day of February, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
If date A falls on the 31st of a month or last day of February, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
If date A falls on the 30th of a month after applying (2) above and date B falls on the 31st of a month, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days.
ISDA method
If date A falls on the 31st of a month, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
If date A falls on the 30th of the month after applying the rule above, and date B falls on the 31st of the month, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
All months are considered to last 30 days except February which has its actual length. Any full year, however, always counts for 360 days.
BMA/PSA method
If date A falls on the 31st of a month or last day of February, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
If date A falls on the 30th of the month after applying the rule above, and date B falls on the 31st of the month, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days.
Alternative European method (30E+/360)
If date A falls on the 31st of a month, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
If date B falls on the 31st of a month, then date B will be changed to the 1st of the following month.
Where date B falls on the last day of February, the actual date B will be used.
All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days.

You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South is a 2014 American documentary film produced by Hilary Saltzman, Kitty Potapow, and Jude Hagin and directed by John Cork. The film works to uncover the hidden truths of the Ruby McCollum case of 1952. McCollum, the richest African American woman in Suwannee County, Florida, shot White physician and politician Clifford Leroy Adams four times with their revolver.
Hagin discovered this story when meeting with the late Dr. James Haskins, award-winning author and English professor at The University of Florida. Haskins provided Hagin with a copy of the William Bradford Huie book Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail, saying "this story needs to be told." Upon reading Huie's book, Hagin disagreed with the assertion that McCollum had been in a consensual, sexual relationship with Adams and that the Adams shooting was over a money dispute. "I could not get that into my head," they said. "I could not wrap my head around the notion that an African-American woman in 1952 would willingly have a relationship with a town's sainted physician."
Hagin's pursuit of the truth led to an exploration of "paramour rights", the assumption that White men had the right to use Black women for sex, in the Jim Crow South. While there had been previous books and documentaries on Ruby McCollum, You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South was the first known project to get witness accounts, including interviews with McCollum's friends and family and the last surviving juror from the trial. "I wanted to get family members on both sides to tell their side of the story," Hagin said.
The film premiered at the 2014 LA Femme International Film Festival on October 17, 2014, and was released for VOD on February 1, 2015, in time for Black History Month.
Summary
On the morning of August 3, 1952, Ruby McCollum left their children in their car and walked into the "colored entrance" of Dr. Clifford Leroy Adams' office and shot them four times into their body. The White doctor and state Senator-elect died on the scene while McCollum returned home to warm milk for their baby.
Prosecutors claimed that McCollum shot Adams in a dispute over a $116 medical bill, despite the fact that they had $1,800 in their purse and was the wealthiest Black woman in town. The judge ordered the jury to disregard McCollum's testimony that Adams repeatedly raped them and that the shooting was in self-defense. In fact, Adams fathered a daughter by McCollum, but the jury was not allowed to even look at them when they were presented as evidence of the rape. McCollum was found guilty and sentenced to death. Years later, they won an insanity plea and was released from prison in 1974.
Reception
The film received mostly positive response from critics. Mike Spain of Irish Film Critic gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, "There is plenty to the story to keep the interest of the audience. One of the film's strengths is a lot of the story is told by people who were in Live Oak at the time or had a stake in the outcome. A juror, town's people, and Ruby's relatives. It adds to the authenticity of the documentary." In their review for Emertainment Monthly, Emily Solomon graded the film with an A- and wrote, "What is so intriguing about the way this film is put together is how the mystery unravels. The murder is established early on in the film, with new twists and turns revealed throughout that shows McCollum's motivation to commit in the first place."

Rastko Močnik (born 27 August 1944) is a Slovenian sociologist, psychoanalyst, literary theorist, translator and political activist. Together with Slavoj Žižek and Mladen Dolar, they are considered one of the co-founders of the Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis.
Early life and education
They were born as Josip Rastko Močnik in a middle-class family in Ljubljana. They studied sociology and history of literature at the University of Ljubljana, graduating in 1968 under the supervision of Dušan Pirjevec. During their student years, they were active in several avant-garde literary movements. In 1964, they became the last co-editor (together with the poet Tomaž Šalamun) of the alternative journal Perspektive, before it was closed down by the Yugoslav government. Between 1968 and 1970 they worked as a journalist at the journal Delo. They later studied at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales in Paris, where they obtained a PhD in philosophy under the supervision of Algirdas Julien Greimas.
Work life and politics
After returning to Ljubljana, they became the editor of the alternative journal Problemi. During this period, they started a close collaboration with Marxist philosophers Slavoj Žižek and Mladen Dolar. Since 1984, Močnik is professor of sociology at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana.
Močnik was among the first Slovene theorists who introduced structuralism and the theories of Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser in Slovenian academia. They have written on several subjects including theory of ideology, theoretical psychoanalysis, semiotics, linguistics and epistemology of humanities and social sciences. They have also translated works of Jacques Lacan, Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss into Slovene.
Močnik has also been active in several civil and political movements in Slovenia. In the early 1980s, they were one of the most outspoken opponents of a high school education reform, carried out by the League of Communists of Slovenia, in which the classical grammar schools (the so-called gymnasium) were abolished as a supposed remainder of old bourgeois elitism. In 1982, they also wrote a petition against such reform, together with editor Braco Rotar, social theorist Neda Pagon and jurist Matevž Krivic. The petition was signed by over 600 intellectuals, and was one of the first wide and openly critical civil society initiatives in Socialist Slovenia. Between 1988 and 1990, they served on the board of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, the main civil society organization in Slovenia during the process of democratization. In the early 1990s, they opposed the dissolution of Yugoslavia, was critical of the DEMOS coalition and Slovenian independence.
In 1990, Močnik was elected president of a small extra-parliamentary party, called Social Democratic Union (Socialdemokratska unija, SDU), which was linked to Ante Marković's Union of Reform Forces. The party failed to win any significant popular support, and remained outside of the Slovenian Parliament. After its dissolution in the early 1990s, Močnik left party politics, but continued to participate in the public debate. They were one of the few Slovenian public intellectuals who opposed the unilateral declaration of Slovenian independence. In the late 1990s, they opposed the Slovenian entry in NATO. They have also been highly critical of the Bologna process.
Močnik also writes weekly columns in the Slovene leftist journal Mladina and is a member of the advisory board of the regional left-wing magazine Novi Plamen.
In 2017, Močnik has signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins.
Controversies
Močnik's ambiguous positions in the years 1989–1991, when they were critical of Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia, was criticized by many at the time, and has remained one of the frequent political reproaches against him, including from the conservative Prime Minister Janez Janša.
In 2008, their article "Slovene historians on the Destruction of Yugoslav Federation" published in a special issue of the review Borec under the name Oddogodenje zgodovine – primer Jugoslavije' ("The Uneventment of History - The Case of Yugoslavia") together with contributions by the "new generation" of Slovenian historians and young foreign researchers such as Ozren Pupovac, Alberto Toscano and Geoffroy Geraud-Legros, became highly polemical as they criticized some trends on historical revisionism in contemporary Slovenian historiography. In the article, Močnik accused three of the most prominent contemporary Slovene historians, Peter Vodopivec, Jože Pirjevec and Božo Repe, all of whom are considered to be close to left wing or left liberal positions, of nationalist bias.

Israel's National Student and Youth Council (, Mo'etzet HaTalmidim VeHaNo'ar HaArtzit) is an elected body representing the Israeli students and youth in Israel from the 7th grade to the 12 grade in front of the Israeli decision makers of the Ministry of Education (Israel) and in other government offices. The Council, which was established in 1993, operates under the Society and Youth Administration of the Ministry of Education. The Council is an umbrella organization for all the Israeli regional youth councils, and student councils.
The council's representatives are elected democratically and annually from the district youth councils (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Center, Haifa, Arab sector, South, and North). The council comprises youth from the different sectors: religious, secular, Jewish, Arab, Druze and a Bedouin representative.
The National Youth Council representatives mediate between Government decision makers and the Youth representatives. the council representatives, as the official representatives of the Israeli youth, regularly take part in meetings dealing with a wide range of issues which all relate to Israeli students and youth. Those meetings take place with the Minister of Education, in the committees of the Ministry of Education, in various Knesset conferences, and in addition they participate in various meetings of Knesset Committees (especially in The Knesset Committee on Education, Culture and Sport, The Knesset Committee on Child Rights, The Knesset Committee on Drug Abuse, as well as the Transportation Subcommittee in The Knesset Committee for Economy). The representatives mostly participate in committees dealing with youth-related issues such as: children's rights, violence, delinquency and youngsters at risk - cut off from mainstream youth.
Israel's National Student and Youth Council is the first youth council in the world that made student rights legislation.
Structure
The National Council consists of representatives elected from 6 regional Youth Councils (North, Haifa, Center, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Southern districts) and one nationwide "settlement administration district." Those councils in turn are chosen from the Youth Councils of the towns, cities, and local area councils (Administrative areas enclosing, kibbutz's and moshavim) in that district. Any such municipal area council is itself elected from the Student Councils of the schools in the area, as well as representatives from local youth movements or any other youth organizations. Student Councils, of course, are elected from within the student body of the school. This method ensures both fair representation at every level for students from every locale and background, and easy and swift communication and co-operation between the various councils. The entire system of councils is estimated to contain some 20-30,000 representatives around the country.
Every council, from the school through to the national, adheres strictly to democratic procedure. A secretariat, including, but not limited to, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Spokesperson, Secretary General, and Auditor as well as the representatives to the next level council, are elected for each council by its members.
Each and every council must function according to its own bylaws which have been drafted in a fair and open process and approved by the council plenum. In order to have representation at the following level of council, each council's bylaws must comply with the "supreme bylaws(תקנון על)" as drafted and approved by the National Conference of Student and Youth Councils.(הועידה הארצית של מועצות התלמידים) The conference is the highest authority within the council hierarchy - an annual congress of some 700 representatives from every council in the country, which approves an annual policy resolution which guides the activity of the councils.
Each council has a representative role and a constituency. The National Council represents all the students in any and all institutions of relevance, such as the Knesset, various government ministries and bodies, first and foremost the Ministry of Education (A sub-section of which provides the council with logistical support.), the media, etc. A district council works in a similar way on a regional level. A local council does the same, representing the youth and the students in the city or municipality. A school council does so in a school, acting as the student voice to the teachers and management, on any and all issues, from deciding to which hour a school party will continue, to choosing whether to institute a school uniform, to negotiating the details of a student strike.
Such rigidly democratic institutions are necessary, living up to the legality given to the existence of councils in the "Law of Student Rights", due to the nature of Council activities, which can be split roughly into two spheres: representative and activist.
In 2006 graduates of the Israel's national student and youth council founded an association named Bematana. The association's mission is to promote young leaders who are elected as representatives in student and youth councils in Israel. in 2012 the council held the International Youth Leadership Conference under the slogan "Take The Lead!"
Local councils
Local councils do much the same at a municipal level, organizing events for all the students in the city, like used school-book fairs, parties, sports tournaments, town clean-ups, meetings with students from different background, such as secular and religious, or Jewish and Arab, etc. Local councils are often very different from city to city, each one displaying its own unique character, and different areas of activity according to whatever the needs and wants of the population may be.
District Councils
District Councils and the National Council work on a regional/national level, working independently or with the ministry of education, local and school councils or various other organizations, such as charities and nonprofit funds, or companies and the media, in both independent projects carried out by the National/District council, and in providing tools and contacts and activities which Local and School councils can make use of in their work.
Legislation
The following Israeli laws were enacted in the Knesset after originally proposed by the Israel's National Student and Youth Council:
Local Authorities (Head of Youth Unit. Council of Students and Youth), 2011
promotes and regulates the field of informal education in Israel. According to the law: each local authority will work to promote informal education field, the - by promoting educational activities and cultural frameworks. Required to establish a Local student and Youth council.

The law is the spirit of human dignity and the principles of the United Nations Rights of the Child Agreement. Among the categories of law: the right to education, the prohibition of discrimination, and handling the permanent exclusion of a student from an educational institution, Right to student representation by the district students' and council in the district hearing committees, the right to take the matriculation examination, the establishment and activities of the student council at school and the duty of confidentiality (student privacy).

Lowering the age of issuing driver's licenses to 17.

The Council's achievements
Due to the National Council's involvement in the Knesset committees and in the Israeli public discourse, in 2000 it managed to bring forward the enactment of an Israeli Pupils' Rights Law (חוק זכויות התלמיד) for the approval of the Knesset, which prohibit discrimination of students for sectarian reasons in admission to or expulsion from an educational institution, in establishment of separate educational curricula or holding of separate classes in the same educational institution, and rights and obligations of pupils. This law has been enforced by the Supreme Court of Israel, prompting protests from Orthodox families who objected to sending their children to integrated schools. In addition, the Israeli Pupils' Rights Law required that every educational institution in Israel would establish a student council.
In 2002, the National student and youth council chairperson Koby Tsoref was invited to light one of the Yom Ha'atzma'ut (Israel's Independence Day) twelve torches traditionally kindled in the annual national Yom Ha'atzma'ut ceremony, marking the organization's contribution to the Israeli youth and the organization's part in promoting their rights.
Among other things, the National Council initiated an amendment to the Municipalities Ordinance Act which lowered the age of the electors in the elections of the local authorities from 18 to 17. The National Council has been involved in promoting a number of changes in certain laws regarding reception of driver's licenses and which regard young drivers, as well as the reduction of the period in which young drivers must drive while being accompanied by an experienced driver, and the signing of a collaboration covenant with the Local Government Center and with the Israel. In addition, in 2011 the Council managed to prevent the cancellation of student rights law.
Chairmen of the Council
Each year a new chairperson is elected for the National Council. Chairmen are elected democratically by the 45 National Council representatives.
These are the chairpeople of the National Council since its founding:

Afro-Costa Ricans are Costa Ricans of African ancestry.
Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattoes, Blacks, Amerindians and Asians (primarily Chinese/East Asian). About 8% of the population is of African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and African) who are called Afro–Costa Ricans. A large portion of this group descends from the late 19th, and early 20th century waves of Afro-Caribbean migrant workers (mostly from Jamaica). They represent the largest group of Jamaicans living outside of Jamaica's Anglophone dominated diaspora. However, not all Black Costa Ricans are descended from these groups, as some are directly descended from colonial-era enslaved Africans imported to Costa Rica by the Spanish. This latter group, however, is more likely to be mulatto, or tri-racial.
History
The first recorded arrival of people of African descent in Costa Rica came with the Spanish conquistadors. Slave trade was common in all the countries conquered by Spain, and in Costa Rica the first Black people seem to have come from specific sources in Africa- Equatorial and Western regions. The people from these areas were thought of as ideal slaves because they had a reputation for being more robust, affable and hard-working than other Africans.
The enslaved people were from what is now the Gambia (Mandingas), Guinea (specifically Wolofe), Ghanaian (Ashanti), Benin (specifically Ije / Ararás) and Sudan (Puras). Many of the enslaved people were also Minas (i.e. slaves from parts of the region extending from the Ivory Coast to the Slave Coast), Popo (be imported tribes as Ana and Baribas), Yorubas and Congas (perhaps from Kongasso, Ivory Coast). Slaves also came from other places, such as neighboring Panama.
However, the following century witnessed a gradual lessening of the differences between Black people and their white owners. As whites took Black women as their concubines, they freed the children that were born from this union. The same thing started to happen with the "zambos", born of Amerindians and Black people. During the time of slavery, the slaves worked on cattle ranches of Guanacaste and the Central Valley plantations and cacao plantations in Matina, whose situation was more difficult. Over time, many whites freed their slaves and slavery was abolished in 1823, along with the other Central American countries.
The largest Costa Rican Black community is from the Caribbean, which today constitutes the majority of the Costa Rican Black population. Costa Rica has the largest Jamaican diaspora after Cuba and Panama and its development as a nation is witness to this contribution.
Since 1850, fishermen of Afro-Caribbean origin began to settle in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, especially from Panama and the West Indies. They stayed in temporary camps during fishing seasons, from March to September, to plant coconuts, cassava, and yams, which were then harvested the following season. Since 1828, some of these fishermen began to settle in Costa Rica permanently with their families.
Towards the second half of the 19th century, coffee became the main export of Costa Rica. The crops were transported from the Pacific Coast, by an inaccessible jungle terrain of the Atlantic Coast. To be taken to Europe, they had to turn back to South America, which increased the cost and removed competitiveness . To remedy this situation, in 1871 a railway and a port on the Atlantic Coast were constructed. Because of the scarcity of local labor, workers were imported from Italy, China, and the Caribbean and Central America. This coincided with an employment crisis in Jamaica that caused an exodus to neighboring countries. So on December 20, 1872, the Lizzie, the first boat from Jamaica, arrived at the port of Limón with 123 workers to work on the railroad. From this moment, the number of Jamaican workers in Limon increased rapidly and the next year already saw over 1,000 Jamaican workers in the port.
Many Jamaicans intended to return home, but most remained in the province of Limón on the Caribbean Coast. In 1890 the railways suffered a financial crisis, forcing many workers to sustain themselves by working in agriculture. This in turn saw the laborers establishing relationships and cultural exchanges with native populations of these areas. Later, the Jamaican workers began working for the banana industry, whose production grew to its peak in 1907.
Usually these workers lived on the plantations and had little knowledge of Costa Rica beyond their immediate environment. The contact was minimal because the Costa Rican banana plantations were in foreign hands. They did not speak Spanish and retained Jamaican customs. They had their own schools with teachers brought from Jamaica. Until 1949 Costa Rica had segregation laws where Black people lived exclusively in the Caribbean Province of Puerto Limón. By 2011 Afro–Costa Ricans were spread in all 7 Costa Rican provinces: 32% of them in San José, 16% in Alajuela, 15% in Limón, 10% in Heredia and 8% in Cartago and Guanacaste. Today, Afro–Costa Rican people are part of different disciplines and fields in Costa Rica.
Demographics
Eight percent of the population is Afro–Costa Rican (black or mulatto), compared to 2.4 percent who are Amerindian and 83 percent who are of European heritage (including castizo and mestizo). In the province of Guanacaste, a significant portion of the population is Afro-mestizo, descended from a mix of local Amerindians, Africans and Spaniards. Until 1949 most Afro–Costa Ricans lived in Limón and were denied Costa Rican citizenship and thus the right to vote.

Forrest Place is a pedestrianised square located within the CBD of Perth, Western Australia. The street was created in 1923, and has a history of being a focal point for significant political meetings and demonstrations.
Description
Forrest Place connects Perth Railway Station on Wellington Street with the Murray Street Mall, outside the Carillon City shopping centre. It is long, and is paved and landscaped as a pedestrian mall, with seating, public artwork, and trees. The eastern side of the street is lined by shops from the Forrest Chase shopping complex, while the historic General Post Office and Commonwealth Bank buildings are located to the west.
Forrest Place is used in many ways throughout the year, including cultural displays, children's activities and parades, and contains the City of Perth visitors centre.
Nearby transport facilities include Perth railway station and Perth Busport, and Perth Central Area Transit (CAT) buses run along Wellington Street,
History
Named after Sir John Forrest, the first Premier of Western Australia, Forrest Place was for most of its history a roadway between the Perth railway station and Murray Street.
It was originally a plot of land issued to Patrick Farmer in 1840. Prior to Forrest Place's construction, an arcade between Wellington and Murray Streets existed on the site known as Central Arcade. It was considered an "unhealthy" establishment, which led to its demolition. The construction of Forrest Place deemed to have "changed the face of Perth".
Streetscape
Prior to the building of the Forrest Chase complex (containing Myer and numerous other retail stores), the central building on the eastern side of Forrest Place was the Padbury Buildings (built in 1925 and demolished in 1986–1987). While the buildings on the east side have changed a number of times in the street's 82-year history, the General Post Office (completed in 1923) and the Commonwealth Bank building (completed 1933), both designed by John Smith Murdoch in the Interwar Beaux-Arts style and faced with Donnybrook stone, have endured significant change around them.
Parades, meetings and rallying place
In the 1940s returned soldiers marched through Forrest Place.
It was a meeting place and focal point for political meetings in the 1950s through to the 1980s; considerable use was made of the steps of the Post Office being above the roadway level.
An attempt to defuse the political nature of the space and ban meetings in Forrest Place was carried out by Charles Court, on 18 November 1975, when their government used Section 54B of the Western Australia Police Act to ban meetings. Considerable numbers of demonstrations resulted from this ban, which was later repealed by the Public Meetings and Processions Act of 1984.
In 2013, the history of protests held at Forest Place, and the responses by authorities, was the subject of a presentation by Murdoch University Adjunct Associate Professor Lenore Layman. These events are considered by Layman to be part of an "alternative history of Perth" that isn't so sedated.
In 2017, in a chapter in the book Radical Perth, Militant Fremantle Layman develops an argument that Forrest Place was a location of conflict over the usage of the space as a place for freedom of speech, association and peaceful assembly.
With the 2021 AFL Grand Final being held at Perth Stadium because of a COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne, in lieu of the traditional AFL Grand Final parade a "people's parade" was held at Forrest Place allowing fans to celebrate the game (but without the clubs in attendance) on 24 September 2021, the day before the final. The premiership cup presentation also took place at Forrest Place the day after the final following the Melbourne Football Club's victory over the Western Bulldogs, with the winning team in attendance.
Pedestrian mall
Forrest Place became a large paved area with the closing of the roadway in the late 1986. It still links Wellington Street and Perth railway station with the Murray Street Mall, with the placement of the "Grow Your Own" public artwork limiting vehicular access to the north.

The royal titulary or royal protocol is the standard naming convention taken by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. It symbolises worldly power and holy might and also acts as a sort of mission statement for the reign of a monarch (sometimes it even changed during the reign).
The full titulary, consisting of five names, did not come into standard usage until the Middle Kingdom but remained in use as late as the Roman Empire.
Origins
In order that the pharaoh, who held divine office, could be linked to the people and the gods, special epithets were created for them at their accession to the throne. These titles also served to demonstrate one's qualities and link them to the terrestrial realm. The five names were developed over the centuries beginning with the Horus name. This name identified the figure as a representative of the god Horus. The Nebty name was the second part of the royal titular of Upper and Lower Egypt. This name placed the king under the protection of two female deities, Nekhbet and Wadjet and began sometime towards the end of the First Dynasty as a reference to "The one who belongs to Upper and Lower Egypt", along with mention of the Two Ladies. Beginning sometime in the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, the Gold Falcon name (sometimes called the Horus of Gold) was created. The last two names of the king, the prenomen and the nomen, were generally depicted within the circular, roped cartouche of the king (eventually the cartouche would contain all royal names, including the queen and the royal children) and were known as the Throne name and the Son of Re name.
Horus name
𓅃𓊁
The Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name, originating in prehistoric Egypt. Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title.
The Horus name was usually written in a serekh, a representation of a palace façade. The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside this representation of a palace. Typically an image of the falcon god Horus was perched on top of or beside it.
At least one Egyptian ruler, the Second Dynasty pharaoh Seth-Peribsen, used an image of the god Set instead of Horus, perhaps signifying an internal religious division within the country. They were succeeded by Khasekhemwy, who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above their name. Thereafter, the image of Horus always appeared alongside the name of the pharaoh.
By the time of the New Kingdom, the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh.
Nebty ("two ladies") name
G16
The Nebty name (lit. "two ladies") was associated with the so-called "heraldic" goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt:
Nekhbet, patron deity of Upper Egypt, represented by a vulture, and
Wadjet, patron deity of Lower Egypt, represented by a cobra.
The name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet, though it only became a fully independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty.
This particular name was not typically framed by a cartouche or serekh, but always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets, the dual noun "nebty".
Horus of Gold
G8
Also known as the Golden Horus name, this form of the pharaoh's name typically featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold.
The meaning of this particular title has been disputed. One belief is that it represents the triumph of Horus over their uncle Set, as the symbol for gold can be taken to mean that Horus was "superior to their foes". Gold also was strongly associated in the ancient Egyptian mind with eternity, so this may have been intended to convey the pharaoh's eternal Horus name.
Similar to the Nebty name, this particular name typically was not framed by a cartouche or serekh.
Throne name (prenomen)
M23:t-L2:t
The pharaoh's throne name, the first of the two names written inside a cartouche, usually accompanied the title nsw-bity (nsw(t)-bjt(j)), traditionally interpreted as "[He] of sedge [and] bee" and often translated for convenience as "King of Upper and of Lower Egypt". (The sedge and the bee symbolised Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively, although recent research has thrown this interpretation into doubt.)
The epithet nb tꜣwy, "Lord of the Two Lands", referring to the valley and delta regions of Egypt, often occurs as well.
Personal name (nomen)
G39-N5:.-
This was the name given at birth. The name itself was preceded by the title "Son of Ra", written with the hieroglyph of a duck (za), a homonym for the word meaning "son" (za), adjacent to an image of the sun, a hieroglyph for the chief solar deity Ra. It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. For women who became pharaoh, the preceding title was interpreted as "daughter" also.
Modern historians typically refer to the ancient kings of Egypt by this name, adding ordinals (e.g. "II", "III") to distinguish between different individuals bearing the same name.
Examples of the full titulary
Senusret I
In the Middle Kingdom, the full titulary was sometimes written in a single cartouche, as in this example from Senusret I, from Beni Hasan.
Hatshepsut
The full titulary of Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut, providing a guide to pronunciation and its equivalent meaning and showing the differences since this pharaoh is a woman, is as follows,
Horus name: Wesretkau, "Mighty of Kas"
Nebty name: Wadjrenput, "She of the Two Ladies, Flourishing of years"
Golden Horus: Netjeretkhau, "Divine of appearance" (Netjeret is the feminine form of netery meaning 'godly' or 'divine', and khau, 'appearances')
Praenomen: Maatkare, "Truth [Ma'at] is the Ka of Re"
Nomen: Khnumt-Amun Hatshepsut, "Joined with Amun, Foremost of Noble Ladies"
Thutmose III
The full titulary of Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Thutmose III, providing a guide to pronunciation and its equivalent meaning, is as follows
Horus name: Kanakht Khaemwaset, "Horus Mighty Bull, Arising in Thebes"
Nebty name: Wahnesytmireempet, "He of the Two Ladies, Enduring in kingship like Re in heaven"
Golden Horus: Sekhempahtydjeserkhaw, "Horus of Gold Powerful of strength, Sacred of appearance"
Praenomen: Menkheperre, "He of the Sedge and the Bee, Enduring of form is Re"
Nomen: Thutmose Neferkheperu, "Son of Ra, Thutmose, beautiful of forms"

The men's individual archery event at the 1976 Summer Olympics was part of the archery programme. The event consisted of a double FITA round. For each round, the archer shot 36 arrows at each of four distances—90, 50, 70, and 30 metres. The highest score for each arrow was 10 points, giving a possible maximum of 2880 points. 23 nations sent 37 archers to the men's competition.
The American men placed first and second in the first round, as Darrell Pace missed the Olympic record set by fellow American John Williams in 1972 by only 4 points. In the second round, Pace improved their score by 43 points, smashing both the single and double FITA round records as they won gold. Richard McKinney fell to fourth place in the final rankings, however, as Hiroshi Michinaga of Japan and Giancarlo Ferrari of Italy surged forward to grab the silver and bronze medals, respectively.
Records
The following new Olympic records were set during this competition.

The 1998 Oahu Bowl was a college football postseason bowl game between the Air Force Falcons and the Washington Huskies. Part of the 1998–99 bowl season, the inaugural Oahu Bowl matched the fifth-place team from the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) against the champions of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC).
Background
The #16 Falcons finished first in the WAC and had only lost one game, to TCU. They were 10th on points scored, with 36.0 points per game and 7th on points allowed with 14.2 points per game, in their sixth bowl appearance in the 1990s.
Washington went from 2–0 and #9 ranked to being unranked and 6–5, though they at least won the Apple Cup. The Huskies were 52nd in points scored, with 25.2 per game and 76th in points allowed, with 28.6 per game, in their seventh bowl appearance in the decade.
Air Force was favored by four points.
Game summary
Jemal Singleton scored in both the first and second quarters to give Air Force a 14–0 lead, but Washington responded with a Braxton Cleman touchdown run less than two minutes later. Scott McKay added onto the lead with a touchdown run to make it 20-7 after their two-point conversion attempt failed. Cleman scored their second touchdown of the day to make it 20–13, with Huard's conversion pass attempt falling short to keep the score the same at halftime.
Jackson Whiting increased the Falcons' lead to 23–13 with a 42-yard field goal, then Spanky Gilliam extended it to 30–13 with their touchdown run. Matt Farmer caught a 79-yard touchdown pass from Blane Morgan with :07 remaining in the third quarter. Their conversion attempt to make it a 25-point lead failed, however, and the score remained at 36–13. Husky backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo ran in for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to narrow the lead, but the two-point conversion failed, leaving the score at 36–19. McKay caught a 30-yard touchdown from Morgan as the Falcons scored their final points of the day. Manuel Austin caught a pass from Tuiasasopo with 4:09 remaining, but another failed conversion attempt left the final score 43–25. Starter Brock Huard was ineffective for the Huskies, going 23 of 32 with three interceptions and 267 yards before being replaced by Tuiasasopo. Morgan went 12 of 16 for 267 yards and two touchdowns. Farmer caught four passes for 109 yards.
Aftermath
Neither team returned to the Oahu Bowl, which disbanded two years later. Washington (6–6) ended their first non-winning season in 22 years. Five days later, sixth-year head coach Jim Lambright was relieved of their duties by athletic director Barbara Hedges. Their successor was Rick Neuheisel, the head coach at Colorado in the Big 12 Conference.
Air Force (12–1) moved up in the final rankings, thirteenth in the AP Poll, and tenth in the Coaches Poll.

Butts and bounds, shortened form for "abuttals and boundaries" of a property, are the boundary lines delineated between plots of land, usually those which define the end of an estate, as used in legal deeds, titles, etc. These are usually descriptive features in the property, such as trees, outcroppings of stone, or riverine brooks, etc., and are signified in the legal deed for purposes of identification.
Historical uses
The practice of signifying butts and bounds in the sale of real estate and in legal deeds and contracts is an ancient practice, having attestation in the Hebrew Bible. In the episode of Abraham who purchased the field of Ephron in , and where it describes the cave and the trees in the outermost bounds of the property, the Sages of Israel learnt thereby that they that sells their field must write in the deed its landmarks and boundaries.
According to rabbinic tradition, Joshua, when dividing the Land of Canaan among the twelve tribes of Israel, planted Sea squill () to mark off the butts and bounds of tribal inheritance. The practice was still prevalent along the coast of the Syrian-Egyptian desert as late as the 20th-century.
In Jewish laws of agronomy, the prohibition of marking off butts and bounds beginning on the first day of the lunar month Tishri during the Seventh-year (until the end of that year) is expressly stated in the compendium of Jewish oral law known as the Mishnah (Shevi'it 2:2):
Until the New Year they may mark the butts and bounds of property (),The word is the denominal verb of the Aramaic noun [= yabla], a plant, or what is rendered in the Syriac script as ܝܒܠܐ, and is defined in Jessie Payne Margoliouth's Syriac Dictionary. See: strip off leaves, cover up [exposed] roots or fumigate plants.
Legal deeds of conveyance
The civil laws with respect to standard formularies used in drafting documents and legal deeds differ from country to country. For example, in some societies the custom requires that, where there are no distinct physical features in the said property, it is sufficient to mention the name(s) of the property owner(s) of the adjacent fields. As early as anno 500 CE it was litigated:
If the field is bounded by fields of Reuben on the east and west and by fields of Simeon on the north and south, they must write, 'the field is bounded by fields of Reuben on two sides, and by fields of Simeon on two sides.' [And not simply, 'It lies between the fields of Reuben and Simeon,' which leaves room for ambiguity.]Cf. ; Yosef Karo, Shulhan Arukh (Choshen Mishpat, Hil. Mekach u'mimkar 219:5)
In older legal deeds, the phrase "butted and bounded by..." often precedes the actual description of the ends of the land in question. In modern conveyances of real estate, the legal term is often defined as Parcels clause.
USA
With the development of modern surveying techniques in Europe and the proposals put forward before the US Congress under the Land Ordinance of 1785, a more efficient way was devised in the United States for the layout, sale and disposal of private and public lands, known as the Public Land Survey System. This new system formed the basis for dividing all territory, and where it called-out unto surveyors in their respective places to take an account of all lands, and to divide the same territory into Townships of six miles square, by lines running due north and south, and others crossing these at right angles. The plats of townships respectively were to be marked by subdivisions consisting each of lots of one mile square, or 640 acres, and numbered from 1 to 36. These numbered subdivisions were known as Sections. Sections could also be divided into four equal quarters (fractions of a section), known simply as NW [= north-west], NE [= north-east], SW [= south-west] and SE [= south-east], while each quarter could be subdivided into another four quarters, such that the north-east quarter when divided into four more quarters, would have the designation of either SENE [= south-east of North-east quarter], or SWNE [= south-west of North-east quarter], or NWNE (north-west of North-east quarter], or NENE [= north-east of North-east quarter]. In this manner, all sections were duly divided. Thus, by this means, landholders who either bought land or who were granted land due to their military service, were able to register their holdings in their names, in their respective counties, with the date of purchase or issuance of a military warrant, and the precise location of the property (e.g. lands of Section 14, in Township 11S [= eleven South], of Range 14W [= fourteen West]) ascribed to the person. Township numbers were always followed by a principal meridian directional sign (either N or S [= for north and south]), while the range number was always followed by a baseline directional sign (either E or W [= for east and west]).
Australia
In Australian common law, which shares a common law heritage with the United Kingdom, Canada and the United-States, "A description by abuttals will, as a rule, override measurements expressed in figures if conflict exists between description and measurement". The same rule applies in 2nd-century Judaic law, except where the seller had noted in the transaction that they were selling to the buyer a parcel of land defined by measurement, and which same measurement they (the seller) expressly stated as extending as far as its physical butts and bounds. Had the buyer discovered, when they came to take an account of their field, that the butts and bounds did not extend so far, but were one-sixth () less than the designated measurement avouched by the seller, the sale does not hold-up as good, seeing that the conditions were fraudulent, in which case, the seller is required to reimburse to its buyer the difference paid (diminishing one-sixth of the cost), or else give to them more land. When both measurement and descriptive features are used, anything less than a deviancy of is still in the realm of accuracy.

Carpi was a Roman era city in the Roman province of Africa Proconsolare, and has been tentatively identified with ruins at El Mraïssa Henchir-Mraïssa, (or Marsa) on Cape Bon in Tunisia.
The El Mraïssa ruins are nearby to Ra's Degbi Marsa, Ras el Fortas and Henchir Bir Jedi. El Mraïssa is also close to where the Oued Oum el Hallalif river enters the Mediterranean Sea.
The Roman city was also the seat of an ancient Christian Bishopric under the leadership of the Bishop of Carthage. The diocese survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, and the current bishop is Ramón Bejarano ,.

Storrs is a hamlet within the boundaries of the City of Sheffield in England, it is situated 6.5 km (4 miles) west-northwest of the city centre. Storrs is located between the suburb of Stannington and the village of Dungworth in the civil parish of Bradfield at a height of 210 metres above sea level between the Loxley and Rivelin valleys. Although historically a farming settlement, water-powered milling on the Storrs Brook and small scale cutlery making has also taken place in the hamlet.
History
The name Storrs is a derivation of the Old Norse word “Storth” which means a wooded place and is commonly found in the names of Viking settlements set up in woodland clearings. One of the first written references to the hamlet was in 1288 when the ancient Hallamshire family of Shaw first became established after Ralph del Shagh became a tenant at a local farm, the surname continued at the same farm for the next four centuries. There was another reference in 1323 when Williams, the son of Anne Dungworth was admitted to a small farm at Storrs.
The moors and common land around Storrs was enclosed between 1791 and 1805, the proposal which was put forward by Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk and other landowners in 1787 met with some hostility by “several of the freeholders and inhabitants” as the usage of the land became controlled by the owner. However, none of the challengers to the policy owned enough land to defy the large landowners. In 1881 it was recorded that nine men from Storrs were working at the pot clay drift mine at Load Brook, two km to the west.
Mills on the Storrs Brook
The Storrs Brook flows just to the south of the hamlet and joins the River Loxley at Rowell Bridge. The brook has been used to power two mills over the years. Storrs Mill dates from 1749 when it was a snuff mill, by 1783 it had been converted into a paper mill and it served as such until the middle of the 19th century. After being used as a corn mill for a time it was unoccupied and disused by 1931. Storrs Mill has now been renovated and is a private residence, the two mill dams are still visible within the grounds. Loxley Wire Mill was situated further downstream, near the brooks confluence with the River Loxley. It dates from 1693 and was used as a cutlers wheel, smelt mill, wire mill and corn mill over the years. It was damaged in the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864, today there are no visible signs.
Buildings and amenities
Many of the present day buildings in Storrs have had a change in usage over the years. The cruck barn at Throstle Nest Farm is a grade II listed building which dates from the 17th century, it has four pairs of crucks within it. The barn has been converted into residential use in recent years and has been available to rent as a holiday cottage. The old Sunday school building was built in 1821 and closed in 1884 when a new chapel was built in the hamlet, it is now in residential use.
Storrs Chapel built in 1884 and closed in 1975 is also now a private residence known as Wesley House, the village shop also underwent the same fate when it closed in the 1960s. Chapel cottages and Storrs Green cottages are both long-standing groups of housing, Chapel cottages was built in the latter part of the 1700s, a cutlers shop operated at the rear at one stage. Storrs House Farm has operated a boarding cattery for many years. Storrs Hall was the home for a time of Thomas Wragg, owner of the nearby fire brick factory. Other buildings in the hamlet include Storrs Green Farm, which is still a working farm, Storrs Grange Farm, and Hazelhurst Farm.
Storrs Park is a small recreation area for the community, it is located at the junction of Storrs Lane and Lee Moor Lane. The park consists of a few children's swings and an area of grass on land leased and maintained by Bradfield Parish Council. There is no public transport for the hamlet, although the 762 school bus service passes through to take pupils to Bradfield School at Worrall.

Quintus Pompeius Sosius Priscus was a Roman senator active in the mid-second century AD, who held a number of offices in the emperor's service. Priscus served as ordinary consul for the year 149 as the colleague of Lucius Sergius Salvidienus Scipio Orfitus. Their life is known entirely from inscriptions.
Priscus was the son of Quintus Pompeius Falco, consul of 108, and Sosia Polla. Earlier writers had confused them with their son, Quintus Pompeius Senecio Sosius Priscus, but a fragmentary inscription from Rome allowed experts to separate the evidence pertaining to each. By their lifetime, their branch of the Sosii had been granted Patrician status.
Name
The complete name of Priscus has not come down to us. One inscription does preserve a large enough portion to indicate that they had a number of elements lacking from their father's name, but were passed on to their own son:
Quintus Pompeius [...] Bellicius Sollers Julius Acer Ducenius Proculus Rutilianus Rufinus Silius Valens Valerius Niger Claudius Fuscus Saxa Amyntianus Sosius Priscus
Some elements of their name are shared with other known men, suggesting that each of these men were involved in a testimony adoption, where in return for an inheritance Priscus assumed the adoptor's name. (Other elements may be shared with men about whom no trace has survived to our time.)
Bellicius Sollers -- Lucius Bellicius Sollers was an eques whom the Emperor Trajan promoted to the Senate, and is thought to have been suffect consul during the reign of Trajan. While there is evidence for a daughter, Claudia Marcellina, none has been found for a son. (These two naming elements are also shared with another senator, Publius Cornelius Dexter Augus[tanus Alpin]us Bellicus Sollers Metilius [...]us Rutillianus.)
Julius Acer -- Marcus Sedatius Severianus Julius Acer Metilius Nepos Rufinus Tiberius Rutilianus Censor, suffect consul in 153. It is conceivable that the craftsman carving the inscription confused elements in Priscus' name, and they share more elements with Sedatius Severianus, namely Rufinus Rutillianus. Rather than Sedatius Severianus making Priscus their heir, it is likely an otherwise unknown Julius Acer (Rufinus Rutilianus) made both of these men theirs heir.
Ducenius Proculus -- while there is a Gaius Ducenius Proculus, they were suffect consul in 87; it is doubtful this Proculus lived into Priscus' lifetime. However, it is plausible that the consul had a son with the same name who is otherwise unattested.
Life
The cursus honorum of Priscus can be recovered from two inscriptions: the fragmentary one from Rome mentioned above, and one from Bononia in Aemilia. If we can trust the order of offices on this inscription to reflect the order they were held, their first recorded office was sevir equitum Romanorum of the annual review of the equites at Rome. Next was their membership as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that comprise the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals. They then became a quaestor, which provided the office holder admission to the Senate. This was followed by their admission to the Roman priesthoods of sodales Hadrianales then the College of Pontiffs; the latter may have transpired prior to their accession to the consulate. They were also made a member of the sodales Antoniniani around that time. As a member of the Patrician order, Priscus acceded to the consulate two years after they were praetor.
After their consulate, Priscus became a member of the comites of emperor Marcus Aurelius. During this period, they were also proconsular governor of Asia for the term 163/164; according to Géza Alföldy, their son served as their legatus or assistant. If the restoration of the inscription from Rome can be trusted, Priscus also was decorated with dona militaria, possibly as a staff officer; McDermott suggests that this "was at the time of the northern wars between 167 and 180. I suspect their duties were less warlike than those of their co-eval son-in-law Pontius."
Children
Priscus is known to have had at least two children:
Quintus Pompeius Senecio Sosius Priscus, ordinary consul in 169.
Pompeia Sosia Falconilla, who married Marcus Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus, ordinary consul in 163.

Pterocarpus soyauxii, the African padauk or African coralwood, is a species of Pterocarpus in the family Fabaceae, native to central and tropical west Africa, from Nigeria east to Congo-Kinshasa and south to Angola.
It is a tree growing to 27–34 m tall, with a trunk diameter up to 1 m with flaky reddish-grey bark. The leaves are pinnate, with 11–13 leaflets. The flowers are produced in panicles. The fruit is a thorny pod 6–9 cm long, which does not split open at maturity.
Uses
The leaves are edible, and contain large amounts of vitamin C; they are eaten as a leaf vegetable.
Bark extracts are used in herbal medicine to treat skin parasites and fungal infections.
The wood is valuable; it is very durable, red at first, becoming purplish-brown on exposure to light, with a density of 0.79 g/cm3. It is resistant to termites. It is valued for making drums in Africa due to its tonal resonance. The wood is also favored for its use in stringed instruments (namely acoustic and electric guitars) for its tonal attributes and durability.
Dust from the wood produced during wood processing can cause dermatitis in some people.
Native African names include Kisese (Congo), Mbel (Cameroon), Mukula, N'gula (Zaire), and Tacula (Angola).

The Anne C. and Frank B. Semple House is a historic house in the Stevens Square/Loring Heights neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It is located on the same block as the George R. Newell House and the George W. and Nancy B. Van Dusen House. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
The house was built in the Beaux-Arts architectural style, reflecting a shift in style toward the classicism of the Renaissance and away from Victorian ideals. Its first owner, Frank Semple, was a partner in Janney, Semple, and Co., a wholesale hardware firm. The entry on Franklin Avenue has a balustraded entry porch with Ionic columns, a detailed Palladian window, and a rounded bay. The interior has a reception hall with mahogany paneling, a hardwood floor with marble inlays, and a frescoed ceiling. Interior spaces include a living room and a ballroom.
The mansion is now available as a reception site for weddings and other events.

The Guianan streaked antwren (Myrmotherula surinamensis) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in tropical South America where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, tropical swamps, and heavily degraded former forest. It is a small, black and white streaked bird, the female being distinguished by its rufous-cinnamon head and buff underparts.
Taxonomy
The Guianan streaked antwren was first described in 1788 as Sitta surinamensis by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin, but was later transferred to the genus Myrmotherula. It was at one time considered to be the same species as the Pacific antwren (Myrmotherula pacifica) and the Amazonian streaked antwren (Myrmotherula multostriata) but differences in their plumage and voice indicate that they are separate species.
Description
The Guianan streaked antwren has a maximum length of about . The male is black with the upper parts streaked with white and two white wing bars. The underparts are whitish with a few black streaks. The female has a rufous-cinnamon head, black and white streaked upper parts, an orange-buff throat and pale buff underparts. This antwren's voice is an unmelodious rattle.
Distribution and habitat
The Guianan streaked antwren is native to the northeastern region of South America. Its range includes southern Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana and northern Brazil, to the north of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River. It is found in the middle and understoreys of seasonally flooded forests and permanently flooded areas as well as shrubby undergrowth in secondary forest at altitudes of up to .
Ecology
Most antwrens forage in small mixed-species flocks, but both this species and the Amazonian streaked antwren are usually seen in pairs. It is an active bird, usually found not far from water including in mangrove areas, searching through dense foliage for insects and spiders.
Conservation status
The Guianan streaked antwren has a wide distribution and is fairly common over parts of its range. Although its population has not been quantified, it is thought to be declining, particularly in Brazil where its habitat is being cleared to make way for cattle ranching and the cultivation of soybeans. It may not be adaptable to the breakup of its habitat into smaller areas, and for this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being "vulnerable".

The vice president of Argentina (), officially known as the vice president of the Argentine Nation (), is the second highest political position in Argentina, and first in the line of succession to the president of Argentina.
The office was established with the enactment of the Argentine Constitution of 1853.
The vice president assumes presidential duties in a caretaker in case of absence or temporary incapacity of the head of state, and may succeed to the presidency in case of resignation, permanent incapacity, or death of the president. The longest vice presidential tenure as caretaker in Argentine history took place between 1865 and 1868, while President Bartolomé Mitre was preoccupied with the Paraguayan War. Seven Argentine vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency: Juan Esteban Pedernera (1861); Carlos Pellegrini (1890); José Evaristo Uriburu (1895); José Figueroa Alcorta (1906); Victorino de la Plaza (1914); Ramón Castillo (1942); and Isabel Perón (1974).
The Argentine Constitution does not provide for the replacement of a vice president should their tenure be ended for any reason, and their office was thus made vacant on seventeen occasions since 1861 (see list).
The 1994 amendments gave the vice president the additional title of president of the Senate; this made the role a more legislative than executive one, with the power to vote in the case of a tie in the Senate. It also modified the vice president's term—as well as the president's—from one unrenewable six-year term to two four-year terms renewable upon reelection of the joint ticket.
A list of the vice presidents follows, including de facto vice presidents during military regimes and vacant periods. The current vice president of Argentina is Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who previously served as the president of Argentina from 2007 to 2015.

IFF Mark II was the first operational identification friend or foe system. It was developed by the Royal Air Force just before the start of World War II. After a short run of prototype Mark Is, used experimentally in 1939, the Mark II began widespread deployment at the end of the Battle of Britain in late 1940. It remained in use until 1943, when it began to be replaced by the standardised IFF Mark III, which was used by all Allied aircraft until long after the war ended.
The Mark I was a simple system that amplified the signals of the British Chain Home radar systems, causing the aircraft's "blip" to extend on the radar display, identifying the aircraft as friendly. MarkI had the problem that the gain had to be adjusted in flight to keep it working; in the field, it was correct only half the time. Another problem was that it was sensitive to only one frequency and had to be manually tuned to different radar stations. In 1939, Chain Home was the only radar of interest and operated on a limited set of frequencies but new radars were already entering service and the number of frequencies was beginning to multiply.
Mark II addressed both these problems. An automatic gain control eliminated the need to adjust the gain, making the device much more likely to be working properly when interrogated. To work with many types of radar, a complex system of motorised gears and cams constantly shifted the frequency through three wide bands, scanning each every few seconds. These changes automated the operation of the device and made it truly useful for the first time; previously, operators could not be sure if a blip was an enemy aircraft or a friendly one with a maladjusted IFF. Originally ordered in 1939, installation was delayed during the Battle of Britain and the system became widely used from the end of 1940.
Although the Mark II's selection of frequencies covered the early war period, by 1942 so many radars were in use that a series of sub-versions had been introduced to cover particular combinations of radars. The introduction of new radars based on the cavity magnetron required different frequencies to which the system was not easily adapted. This led to the introduction of the Mark III, which operated on a single frequency that could be used with any radar; it also eliminated the need for the complex gear and cam system. Mark III began entering service in 1943 and quickly replaced the Mark II.
History
Early efforts
Before Chain Home (CH) systems began deployment, Robert Watt had considered the problem of identifying friendly aircraft on a radar display. They filed initial patents on such systems in 1935 and 1936.
In 1938, researchers at the Bawdsey Manor radar research establishment began working with the first of Watt's concepts. This was a simple "reflector" system consisting of a set of dipole antennas that were tuned to resonate at the frequency of the CH radars. When a pulse from the radar hit them, they would resonate for a short period and cause an additional signal to be received by the station. The antennas were connected to a motorised switch that periodically shorted the antenna out and cancelled the broadcast, causing the signal to turn on and off. On the CH display, this caused the "blip" to periodically lengthen and contract. The system proved highly unreliable; it worked only when the aircraft was at certain locations and flying in certain directions.
It was always suspected that this system would be of little use in practice. When that turned out to be the case, the Royal Air Force (RAF) introduced a different system that consisted of a set of tracking stations using HF/DF radio direction finders. The standard aircraft radios were modified to send out a 1kHz tone for 14 seconds every minute, allowing the tracking stations ample time to measure the aircraft's bearing. Several such stations were assigned to each sector of the air defence system and sent their measurements to a plotting station at sector headquarters. There they used triangulation to determine the aircraft's location.
Known as "pip-squeak", the system worked but was very labour-intensive, requiring operators at several stations and at plotting boards in sector HQs. More operators were needed to merge the information from the pip-squeak system with that from the radar systems to provide one view of the airspace. It also meant the pilots were constantly interrupted when talking to their ground controllers. A system that worked directly with the radar was desired.
Mark I
Seeking a system that would be as simple as possible, the Bawdsey researchers began work with a regenerative receiver. The idea behind regeneration is to amplify the radio signal and send it into an LC circuit, or "tank", that resonates at a selected frequency. A small part of the tank's output is sent back into the amplifier's input, causing feedback which greatly amplifies the signal. As long as the input signal is relatively constant, like Morse code signals, a single vacuum tube can provide significant amplification.
One problem with regeneration is that if the feedback is too strong, the signal will grow to the point where it begins to broadcast back out of the antenna and cause interference on other receivers. In the case of the IFF system, this is precisely what was desired. When the radar signal was received, and the gain was properly adjusted, the signal grew until it turned the system from a receiver to a broadcaster. The signal levels were still small, but the receivers in the radar systems were extremely sensitive and the signal from the transceiver was larger than what would normally be received from the reflection of the original radar pulse alone.
This extra signal would cause the aircraft's blip on the radar screen to suddenly grow to be much larger. Since it might be difficult to distinguish the resulting larger signal from IFF from the return of a larger aircraft or formation without IFF, the circuit was connected to a motorised switch that rapidly disconnected and reconnected the receiver, causing the blip to oscillate on the radar display. A switch on the cockpit control panel allowed the pattern to be controlled; one setting sent back 15 microsecond (μs) pulses, the second setting sent 40 μs pulses and the final setting switched between the two with every received pulse.
There were two major disadvantages of the design. One was that the pilot had to carefully set the feedback control; if it was too low the system would not create an output signal and nothing would be received by the radar station, and if it was too high, the circuit would amplify its own electronic noise and give off random signals known as "squitter" across a wide range of frequencies. This caused significant interference over a large area and was a major problem for radar operators. It was too easy to forget to adjust the gain during flight, especially in single-seat fighters, and it was estimated a usable signal was returned only about 50 per cent of the time.
The other problem was that the CH stations operated on a small but distinct set of frequencies, and the system worked on only a single frequency at a time. An aircraft on a typical mission profile might be visible only to a single CH station, or perhaps two or three over their operational area. To address this, the cockpit panel had a card with the frequencies of local CH stations on it, which the pilot had to tune as they moved about. Pilots often forgot to do this, and if they were lost or off-course, they would not know which frequency to tune to, or the nearest station might not be on the card at all.
The Mark I was used only experimentally. Thirty sets were hand-made at AMES and an order for 1,000 was placed with Ferranti in September 1939.
Mark II
Beyond the operational problems with the Mark I, a more serious issue was the growing number of new radar systems being deployed. Even as the MarkI was being tested, the RAF, Royal Navy and British Army were introducing new systems, spanning a wide range of frequencies from the RAF's 200 MHz systems used on night fighters and Chain Home Low to the Army's 75 MHz gun-laying radars and on to the CH at 20 to 30 MHz. Attempting to manually tune among these would be impractical and impossible if the aircraft were visible to more than one radar, which was increasingly the case.
A solution was already under development in early 1939, similar to the MarkI but employing tuned circuits sensitive to many radar sets. It used a "complicated system of cams and cogs and Geneva mechanisms" to switch among the bands by connecting to oscillators covering a band and then used a motorised tuning capacitor to sweep through the frequency range within that band. To ensure the signal was the right strength and did not cause squitter, an automatic gain control was added. These changes eliminated the need for tuning or gain adjustments in flight, greatly improving the chance it would respond correctly to a radar. Only periodic adjustments on the ground were needed to keep it working properly.
An order for 1,000 sets was sent to Ferranti in October 1939 and they had completed the first 100 sets by November. The rapid expansion of the RAF precluded a significant proportion of its force being equipped by the time of the Battle of Britain in mid-1940. In any case, the action took place mostly over southern England, where IFF would not be very useful as the CH stations were positioned along the coast and could see the fighters only if they were out over the English Channel. There was no pressing need to install the systems and pip-squeak continued in use during the battle.
The lack of IFF led to problems including friendly fire; the Battle of Barking Creek in September 1939 would not have occurred if IFF had been installed. It also meant that enemy aircraft could not be identified if they were close to known RAF aircraft. In July 1940, the Germans began to take advantage of this by inserting their bombers into formations of RAF bombers returning from night missions over Europe. To the ground operators these appeared to be more RAF aircraft and once they crossed the coast there was no way to track them. Even if one of the rare MarkI sets was available, the unreliability of their signals made it difficult for controllers to trust it.
As the Battle of Britain ended, Mark II was rapidly installed in RAF aircraft. Its installation on the Supermarine Spitfire required two wire antennas on the tail that slowed the top speed by and added of weight. Pip-squeak was still used for areas over land where CH did not cover, as well as an emergency guidance system. Mark II also found a use on Royal Navy ships, where it was produced as the Type 252 so that ships could identify each other by radar.
A Mark II set was taken to the US as part of the Tizard Mission in November 1940. US researchers were already working on their own IFF system of some complexity. They realised the importance of using a common IFF system and in early 1941 they decided to install Mark II in their own aircraft. Production was taken up by Philco with an order for 18,000 sets as the SCR-535 in July 1942. The system was never entirely reliable.
Mark III
The profusion of radars that led to the Mark II continued and by 1942 there were almost a dozen sub-types of the Mark II covering sets of frequencies. Some, like the IIIN, were tuned to the radars commonly used by the Navy, while others, like the IIIG, to those used by ground radars in the Army and Air Force. No one unit could respond to them all. To add to the problem, the cavity magnetron had matured and a new generation of radars operating in the microwave region was about to enter service, using frequencies on which the IFF receivers could not operate.
In 1940, English engineer Freddie Williams had considered this problem and suggested that all IFF operations move to a single frequency. Instead of responding on the radar's frequency and thus mixing with their signal in the receiver, a separate unit would transmit "interrogation" pulses in synchronicity with the radar's pulses, and the received signals would be amplified independently and then mixed with the radar's signals on the display. This greatly simplified the airborne equipment because it operated on one frequency, eliminating the complex multi-band system. The only disadvantage was that a second transmitter was needed at radar stations.
Production of the IFF Mark III began at Ferranti and was quickly taken up in the US by Hazeltine. It remained the Allies' primary IFF system for the rest of the war; the 176 MHz common frequency was used for many years after.

Smashing the Rackets is a 1938 American drama film directed by Lew Landers, written by Lionel Houser, and starring Chester Morris, Frances Mercer, Rita Johnson, Bruce Cabot and Edward Pawley. It was released on August 19, 1938, by RKO Pictures.
Plot
Jim 'Sock' Conway, former boxer and FBI hero, is maneuvered for political reasons into a do-nothing job in the district attorney's office. They consider quitting but agrees to remain in their job to defend Letty Lane in order to court their much nicer sister Pat.
Meanwhile, a gang led by White Clark and Chin Martin begins a protection racket to force local businesses to install slot machines. Chin hires Letty's boyfriend Steve Lawrence, an attorney, to file an injunction to prevent the attorney from interfering with their plans. Steve begins plotting to take over the gang from Whitey, who they find too brutal. After Whitey orders the brutal beating of Jim's friends Franz and Otto and Otto dies, Jim uses their position to prosecute the hoodlums and is promoted. They then secures an indictment of a major racketeer.
Steve and Chin kill Whitey, and then Steve arranges for Chin to be caught in a police raid. A suspicious Letty tracks Steve to their home in country just as Chin arrives to kill Steve, and they fatally shoot him. Steve's mistress Peggy provides testimony that allows Steve to be indicted. Letty kills themselves in an automobile accident in order to avoid damaging their sister's reputation. Jim and Pat are married, and they found their own law practice.

Montgomery was a town in Morgan County, Tennessee.
The town served as the county seat of Morgan County from 1818 to 1870. It was originally located 13 miles west of Wartburg. In 1832, due to the formation of Fentress County, the town was rebuilt about 1.5 miles west of Wartburg. In 1870, the town property in Montgomery was sold and the county seat was moved to Wartburg.

Willem van Zeist (March 12, 1924 – October 7, 2016) was a Dutch archaeobotanist and palynologist. They were the director of the Biologisch-Archaeologisch Instituut at the University of Groningen.
Education
Van Zeist studied biology at the University of Utrecht, completing their PhD dissertation in 1955 on pollen analysis investigation in the Netherlands, with special reference to archaeology (Acta Botanica Neerlandica 4, 1955). From 1951 to 1989 they were linked to the Biologisch-Archaeologisch Instituut at the University of Groningen. They became lecturer there in 1967 and a professor in 1973.
Research
Europe
Van Zeist conducted research in Europe on the oldest recovered canoe in the world, the Pesse canoe found in the Netherlands. According to C14 dating analysis it was found to be constructed somewhere between 8200 and 7600 BC. This canoe is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen, Netherlands.
Van Zeist studied the vegetational history and peat bogs of southeastern Drenthe and concluded that Neolithic settlements had begun there around 5000 BC. They also concluded that the prehistoric disc wheels found in the Netherlands dated to at least the Neolithic period. Van Zeist also conducted analytical studies of pollen cores and charred seeds and fruits from archaeological excavations at Gasselte, Noordbarge, Odoorn, Peelo and Wijster. In 1983 they became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Near East
In 1975, van Zeist began work on establishing the climatological record for the Near East with pollen analyses from Iran and Turkey. Along with other studies they concluded that there had only been relatively minor fluctuations in the climate of this area since 5500 BC. They conducted paleobotanical studies and dating analyses at various Near Eastern archaeological sites such as Tell Ramad, Tell Ghoraife, El Kowm, Ras Shamra, Cayonu, Ganj Dareh, Mureybet and Tell Aswad. At the latter site near Mount Hermon in Syria, they made a find of the earliest cultivated Emmer Wheat yet found anywhere on Earth to date, along with what they considered to be domesticated peas and lentils along with other grains such as einkorn and barley at later stages.

R-spondin-1 is a secreted protein that in humans is encoded by the Rspo1 gene, found on chromosome 1. In humans, it interacts with WNT4 in the process of female sex development. Loss of function can cause female to male sex reversal. Furthermore, it promotes canonical WNT/β catenin signaling.
Structure
The protein has two cysteine-rich, furin-like domains and one thrombospondin type 1 domain.
Function
Sex Development
Early Gonads
RSPO1 is required for the early development of gonads, regardless of sex. It has been found in mice only eleven days after fertilization. To induce cell proliferation, it acts synergistically with WNT4. They help stabilize β-catenin, which activates downstream targets. If both are deficient in XY mice, there is less expression of SRY and a reduction in the amount of SOX9. Moreover, defects in vascularization are found. These occurrences result in testicular hypoplasia. Male to female sex reversal, however, does not occur because Leydig cells remain normal. They are maintained by steroidogenic cells, now unrepressed.
Ovaries
RSPO1 is necessary in female sex development. It augments the WNT/β catenin pathway to oppose male sex development. In critical gonadal stages, between six and nine weeks after fertilization, the ovaries upregulate it while the testes downregulate it.
Mucositis
Oral mucosa has been identified as a target tissue for RSPO1. When administered to normal mice, it causes nuclear translocation of β-catenin to this region. Modulation of the WNT/β catenin pathway occurs through the relief of Dkk1 inhibition. This occurrence results in increased basal cellularity, thickened mucosa, and elevated epithelial cell proliferation in the tongue. RSPO1 can therefore potentially aid in the treatment of mucositis, which is characterized by inflammation of the oral cavity. This unfortunate condition often accompanies chemotherapy and radiation in cancer patients with head and neck tumors. RSPO1 has also been shown to promote gastrointestinal epithelial cell proliferation in mice.

Dorothea von Biron, Princess of Courland, Duchess of Dino, Duchess of Talleyrand and Duchess of Sagan, known as Dorothée de Courlande or Dorothée de Dino (21 August 1793 – 19 September 1862), was a Baltic German noblewoman, and the ruling Duchess of Sagan between 1845 and 1862. Them mother was Dorothea von Medem, Duchess of Courland, and although their mother's husband, Duke Peter von Biron, acknowledged them as their own, their true father may have been the Polish statesman Count Aleksander Batowski. For a long time, they accompanied the French statesman Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord; they were the separated wife of their nephew, Edmond de Talleyrand-Périgord.
Life
Dorothea was born in Friedrichsfelde Palace near Berlin, the fourth and last daughter of Duchess Dorothea of Courland, who was by then separated from their husband, Duke Peter of Courland. Dorothea's paternity is disputed but generally assigned to Count Aleksander Batowski, a Polish envoy to the Duchy of Courland. Them biological father was a close associate of their uncle Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord during the Napoleonic period. Them three elder half sisters, all legitimate daughters of the Duke of Courland, were: Princess Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan; Princess Pauline, Duchess of Sagan; and Princess Johanna Katharina, Duchess of Acerenza. The Duke of Courland acknowledged them officially, which entitled them to be styled Princess of Courland. They were educated in Germany.
Marriage
Looking for a wealthy heiress for their nephew Edmond, Talleyrand asked Tsar Alexander I of Russia to intervene with Dorothea's mother in favor of Edmond's marrying them The marriage occurred on 21 and 22 April 1809 at Frankfurt amidst the Napoleonic Wars, presided over by Talleyrand's friend, Prince-Bishop Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, and Dorothea thus became comtesse Edmond de Périgord and great-niece of then Count de Talleyrand-Périgord, prince of Bénévent. Educated in Germany, they were plunged into French society, where they represented the enemy. Them three sisters, also very anti-French, did not help their marriage and despite the birth of three children, the marriage became unhappy, with Edmond more concerned with gaming, war and other women than with their wife.
The fall of the First French Empire and the Congress of Vienna, at which Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand was designated to represent France, favoured a close friendship between them and Dorothea. During their time in Vienna, they kept their household in the Palais Kaunitz, and it was at this time that Dorothea began to play a major part in Charles-Maurice's life. They accompanied them to the Congress of Vienna, and it is even alleged that they became their mistress sometime after 1815. On 31 August 1817, Talleyrand was made a duke and peer of France by Louis XVIII of France, and on 2 December they were also granted the duchy of Dino (a 1.5 km by 1.2 km Calabrian island) by the king of Sicily in recognition of their services at Vienna. The duchy of Dino was immediately handed down to their nephew and their wife and so Dorothea also became duchess of Dino. On 24 March 1818 they and their husband separated, though this was only pronounced formally on 6 November 1824.
Them life with Talleyrand
On 3 July 1820 Talleyrand left Paris for Valençay accompanied by Dorothea, then pregnant with their third child, Pauline, whose paternity is sometimes attributed to Talleyrand. Despite having been their companion (he was 39 years their senior) they took several lovers, gaining a reputation as a formidable seductress and bearing three illegitimate daughters (one of whom, born in 1816, was perhaps Božena Němcová, the great Czech writer, fathered by Count Karel Jan Clam Martinic, their lover at the Congress of Vienna; the two others, Julie Zulmé and Antonine Piscatory, were born in 1826 and 1827).
When Talleyrand became French ambassador in London in 1830, they accompanied them and felt more comfortable there than in Paris, which they detested and where the whole Faubourg Saint-Germain made them feel they were a foreigner. This was a theme throughout their life: in Prussia they were seen as too French, in Paris as too German. They became duchess of Talleyrand on 28 April 1838.
Duchess of Sagan
On 6 (or 8) January 1845, the king of Prussia invested Dorothea as duchess of Sagan (with the special privilege of the dukedom being able to descend via the female as well as the male line), with their son Louis-Napoléon, godson of Napoleon and Louis-Napoléon's grandson Boson de Talleyrand-Périgord immediately taking the title of prince of Sagan.
They granted their Château de Rochecotte to their daughter Pauline de Castellane in 1847, having chosen in 1843 to live in state at their castle at Sagan in Silesia (made up of 130 buildings on an estate of 1,200 hectares, bought by their father and then by their sister Pauline de Hohenzollern). They reigned over this immense and rich duchy alone, until they had a carriage accident in June 1861 and died on 19 September 1862 at Sagan.
Despite the wish they had expressed to their uncle Talleyrand in a letter of April 1838 and in their will, that their heart should be placed in their grave at Valençay, they were buried in the Kreuzkirche at Sagan, with their sister Wilhelmine and son Napoléon Louis.

Reception
The young writer Françoise Quoirez (1935–2004), in reading a passage of Marcel Proust evoking a duke of Sagan around 1950, was seduced by its sonority and chose "Sagan" as their "nom de plume".
“(..) With large dark blue eyes, very beautiful, so burning that they appeared black to some people. There was in them something bold, wild, dauntless and burning one which held the gaze". (Casimir Ensconce, "Talleyrand amoureux", edition France-Empire, 1975).
The opinions they inspired are various; those of men, admiring their beauty and intelligence, praise her, but those of women, jealous of their position and wealth, are more venomous. It is strange that they had no close female friends but instead was a solitary figure, despite keeping up a wide correspondence with many personalities of their era. They were a true European, in an era where that word was unknown. Born between two cultures, speaking three languages, in contact with all the political personalities of Europe, they could have been, in another era, thanks to their intelligence, a scholar or politician. But in that era, only men had a career, and so they were unable to realize their numerous talents. As Guizot said of her: "une personne rare et grande". Greville noted in their diary on 20 September 1831 that Talleyrand described them as “the cleverest man or woman they ever knew”.
The duchess of Dino also has a descendant in Touraine, a "calm and human region, of a pure, very poetic beauty", in the person of Béatrice of Andia, one of their great-great-great granddaughters, president of the association of the "Friends of Château d'Azay-le-Rideau", owner of Château de La Chatonnière.

The wheelchair curling competition of the 2022 Winter Paralympics was held from 5 to 12 March 2022 at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre in Beijing, China.
Medalists
Qualification
Qualification for the 2022 Paralympics was based on rankings in the 2019, 2020, and 2021 World Wheelchair Curling Championships. The qualification points are allotted based on the nations' final rankings at the World Championships. The points are distributed as shown in the table below. The eleven countries with the most points were to qualify for the Beijing Games, while the twelfth slot was reserved for the host country, China. Because the Chinese team placed within the top eleven point-scorers, the twelfth slot was given to the twelfth-ranked team, Estonia.
Rankings
Notes
After qualifying, athletes representing the RPC were denied entry into the 2022 Winter Paralympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Scotland, England and Wales all compete separately (Northern Ireland competes as part of a team from the island of Ireland) at the World Wheelchair Curling Championship. Under an agreement between the curling federations of those three home nations, only qualification points earned by Scotland count toward the point total for Great Britain.

The Red Apple Rest was a cafeteria-style restaurant on New York State Route 17, in the Southfields section of Tuxedo, New York. It was a noted way station for people traveling to the hotels of the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York.
Before the New York State Thruway was built, the travel time from New York City to the Catskill Mountains was often four or five hours, especially during weekends. The Red Apple Rest, located almost halfway, became a major roadside stopping place. The restaurant was opened in May 1931 by Reuben Freed.
History
The Red Apple Rest had a great deal of business during the 1940s and 1950s. It was open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, and was patronized by so-called "Borscht Belt" comedians and professional athletes as well as families traveling to campgrounds and resorts. Although the Thruway (which was built beginning 1953) bypassed the restaurant, and vacationing in the Catskill Mountains became less popular after the 1960s, the restaurant remained very busy until the 1970s. In 1965 the Red Apple Rest served one million customers.
In their book on Jewish comedians in America, The Haunted Smile, author Lawrence J. Epstein said that comedians would stop at the Red Apple Rest late at night and "would go over the acts, describe the audience, and gather gossip about the other comedians and about routines ripe for buying or 'borrowing.'"
The Red Apple Motel, which is sited on the hill to the west of the restaurant, was used by performers late into the 1970s. Several Rock and Roll musicians stayed during their bookings in New York City. The location was secluded and the staff was either 'cool about it' or uninformed. Many well known performers roamed through nearby Sterling Forest while waiting to travel to their nighttime venues. One hotel guest that can be named now is George Carlin, who stayed in room 102 during their Saturday Night Live opening week. They required silence during the morning hours to allow for rest, but was very active with the staff during the night. It was common for them to trial material with the night shift desk clerk.
After 53 years under the Freed family management, the Red Apple Rest was sold in 1984 to a Greek business person who ran it for another 21 years. At that point it was mostly catering to locals due to the fact that the Catskills had dwindled away as a destination. It closed in September 2006—purportedly for various reasons.
The restaurant was featured in several movies such as Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry, A Walk on the Moon, Tenderness and Oliver's Story, and the November 28, 2013 installment of Bill Griffith's comic strip Zippy.
Possible redevelopment
On August 25, 2011 the Times Herald-Record ran an article about the town of Tuxedo and a group of British entrepreneurs looking to find a location for a new Ace Eatery. Inspired by a YouTube video, the Red Apple Rest was nominated as a potential place to open a new-eatery meant for bikers. Tuxedo town supervisor Peter Dolan mentioned that about 17,000 bikes go through Tuxedo during the summer. However, the building also needed major renovation work and was up against many other possible locations. If the Red Apple Rest had been chosen, the new restaurant would have opened in 2012.
Stop at the Red Apple book
Founder Reuben Freed's youngest daughter, Elaine Freed Lindenblatt, published Stop at the Red Apple (SUNY Press, 2014), a memoir chronicling the 50-plus-year history of the original Red Apple Rest in its heyday and beyond.

The 108th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (108th LAA Rgt) was an air defence unit of the British Army during World War II. Initially raised as an infantry battalion of the Green Howards in 1940, it transferred to the Royal Artillery in 1942. It served with 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, training for mountain warfare and airlanding operations, but finally went into action at sea level in the Battle of the Scheldt in the autumn of 1944. It fought through the battles in the Rhineland and Germany in 1945 until the end of the war, after which it was disbanded.
9th (Garrison) Battalion, Green Howards
The 9th (Garrison) Battalion, Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own Yorkshire Regiment), was formed on 23 March 1940 at Dover as part of the rapid expansion of the Army with wartime conscripts. By 7 April 1941 the battalion had joined the Shetlands garrison in the Orkney and Shetland Defence Force (OSDEF).
On 31 October 1941 it returned to England and joined 216th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a static coast defence formation serving in the Northumberland County Division. On 14 November it transferred within the division to 202nd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). However, the brigade was broken up during December as its units were converted to other roles.
108th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment
On 1 January 1942, 9th Green Howards transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) to begin retraining in the light anti-aircraft (LAA) role as 108th LAA Regiment, consisting of Regimental HQ (RHQ) and 354, 355 and 356 LAA Batteries equipped with the Bofors 40 mm gun. It immediately joined Anti-Aircraft Command, but left in February before it had been assigned to a brigade.
Training
The regiment joined 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division in Scottish Command on 12 March 1942, and remained with that formation for the rest of its existence. In May 1942 52nd (L) Division began training in mountain warfare in the Grampian Mountains. This training reached high intensity after Major-General Neil Ritchie took command of the division in September, following their return from Eighth Army in the Western Desert. The training culminated in Exercise Goliath II, which lasted for three weeks in October 1943 under harsh conditions. After this training the division was considered by some to be the 'toughest, fittest and hardest in the British Army'.
Although the training was genuine, the division also played a significant role in Allied deception plans, such as Operation Tindall, designed to convince the German high command that a mythical 'Fourth Army' under General Sir Andrew Thorne was gathering in Scotland to invade Occupied Norway. This was developed into Operation Fortitude North to divert German attention away from the genuine Allied plans to invade Normandy (Operation Overlord).
This pretence was kept up for some time after the Normandy invasion began on D Day (6 June 1944). In August 1944 the division was transferred to First Allied Airborne Army and began training in airlanding operations. 157th Brigade Group, including 354 LAA Bty of 108th LAA Rgt, was organised as the seaborne follow-up echelon of the division, and landed in North West Europe on 9 September in readiness for the rest of the division to be used in an airborne operation. A number of such operations were planned and cancelled before Operation Market Garden was given the go-ahead. This was to use three parachute divisions to seize an 'airborne carpet' of bridges ahead of 21st Army Group as far as Arnhem across the Nederrijn. When Market Garden was launched on 17–25 September 1944, 52nd (L) Division was scheduled to be airlifted to Arnhem as soon as 1st Airborne Division had secured landing strips north of the town. However, the failure of Market Garden meant that 52nd (L) Division was never used in this role. Instead, it was sent by sea to reinforce 21st Army Group fighting its way through the Netherlands.
Scheldt
52nd (L) Division sailed to Ostend between 13 and 20 October, when it was rejoined by 157th Bde Group, which had been operating under 3rd Canadian Division. From 23 October until December, 52nd (L) Division was assigned to First Canadian Army, serving first under II Canadian Corps and then I British Corps. The division's first operation would be the Battle of the Scheldt to help open the vital port of Antwerp – ironically, not in mountainous terrain or deployed by air for which it had trained, but fighting below sea level among the flooded polders around the Scheldt Estuary. The division made an amphibious assault across the West Scheldt to South Beveland in the early hours of 26 October in Operation Vitality II. It then helped the Canadians and Commandos to capture the island of Walcheren in Operation Infatuate, by making an amphibious assault on Flushing on 1 November, followed by an amphibious assault on Middelburg on 6 November, after which the German defenders surrendered.
Since the Allies had achieved air superiority, there was little call for AA defence, and AA units became increasingly used to supplement the divisional artillery to support ground operations. LAA units fired tracer to guide night attacks onto their objectives, and the Bofors guns were much in demand for infantry support. They could give useful close-range fire to help infantry working from cover to cover; the rapid fire was good for suppressing enemy heavy weapons, the 40 mm round's sensitive percussion fuze providing an airburst effect among trees. It was also used for 'bunker-busting', though the lack of protection made the gun detachment vulnerable to return fire. LAA units also provided 'refuge strips' for Air Observation Post aircraft spotting for the field guns: a Bofors Troop deployed with Local Warning radar and ground observers could alert the pilot to the presence of enemy aircraft and provide protection for him. (The guns of 76th AA Brigade on the banks of the Scheldt had also taken part in the massive bombardment for Operation Infatuate.)
On 5 December, the division was transferred to XXX Corps of Second British Army. Most LAA units now saw more action in ground firing roles than for AA defence, but from 17 December the Luftwaffe was more active than for many months. This was in support of the Germans' Ardennes Offensive (the Battle of the Bulge). Bad weather then grounded the Luftwaffe until the battle was almost over, but on 1 January 1945 it launched Operation Bodenplatte against Allied airfields. Aircraft appeared all over 21st Army Group's area, suffering heavy casualties: GHQ AA Troops reported that '40 mm LAA had the time of its life'.
Rhineland
In January 1945, 52nd (L) Division participated in Operation Blackcock, the clearing of the Roer Triangle between the rivers Meuse () and Roer beginning on 18 January. The air and artillery support was massive, including the use of the 'Pepperpot', in which divisional guns and mortars of all calibres including the LAA regiments' Bofors were used to saturate the enemy positions in front of the assaulting infantry. Once the defensive crust had been forced, the weather was as much of a hindrance as the German defenders. Supported by 43rd (Wessex) Division coming into line alongside, 52nd (L) Division took its successive objectives codenamed 'Crown', 'Bear', 'Eagle' and 'Fleece' and the Roer bridgehead was eliminated by 26 January. As a result, the 52nd became the first British formation to be based in a German town.
21st Army Group's next offensive was Operation Veritable to clear the Reichswald between the Maas and the Rhine. XXX Corps launched its attack on 8 February, and as the operation developed, 52nd (L) Division came in on the flank on 15 February. While the field and medium artillery concentrated on the enemy's batteries, command posts and communication centres, the divisional LAA regiments took part in the 'Pepperpots' preceding infantry attacks. By this stage of the war divisional LAA regiments had started receiving quadruple 0.5-inch Browning machine guns on Self-Propelled (SP) mountings (the M51 Quadmount) in place of a proportion of their Bofors guns, to improve their capability against 'snap' attacks by the new German jet fighter-bombers. Under this arrangement a troop comprised four SP or towed Bofors and two quadruple SP Brownings. 52nd (L) Division finished clearing the banks along the Maas from Gennep on 18 February after some bitter fighting for Bleijenbeek Castle. The final part of 'Veritable', Operation Blockbuster, completed the clearance up to the banks of the Rhine. 52nd (L) Division took Afferden after heavy fighting, and then pushed on to link up with US forces by 4 March; it took Haus Loo fort, one of the last German outposts west of the Rhine, on 8 March.
Germany
Although 52nd (L) Division was holding the Rhine bank, it was designated as a follow-up formation for the crossing (Operation Plunder) and was not involved in the initial assault, 108th LAA Rgt was one of the LAA units moved up close to the west bank where it was dug-in and carefully concealed in the 48 hours before D-Day. Their role was both to provide AA cover during the night and to take part in the initial 'Pepperpot'. 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, passing through 52nd (L) Division to lead the assault for XII Corps, had over 700 guns of all types on call when the bombardment began at 23.30 on 23 March. This was followed by 'the start of the Divisional "Pepperpot" at 1 A.M. to swell the din in a mad crescendo and to criss-cross the darkness with the vivid red of anti-aircraft and anti-tank and machine-gun tracer'. The infantry set off across the river in amphibious Buffaloes at 02.00 on 24 March, and made rapid progress inland to link up with the airborne troops who landed during the morning (Operation Varsity). The Luftwaffe did virtually nothing during the assaults or during D-Day itself: only after nightfall did Junkers Ju 88s begin scattered divebombing attacks at medium and low level against the British bridging sites, artillery positions and supply routes. Some of these were engaged by searchlights and LAA guns. The number of attacks increased the following night and were maintained on the fourth night, but after that Second Army's exploitation was so deep that the Luftwaffe was forced to switch its attacks away from the Rhine to harassing the leading formations.
52nd (L) Division began crossing on 25 March, its leading units coming under the command of 15th (S) Division as they mopped up the bridgehead and linked up with 6th Airborne Division. Second Army then began a rapid advance across Germany, during which the Luftwaffe attacked bridging sites, artillery positions and road movements. For the divisional LAA guns most of these involved 'snap' actions, against low-flying attackers using cloud cover, and often using jet aircraft. Part of 52nd (L) Division cleaned up pockets of Germans round Ibbenbüren while the rest of the division crossed the Dortmund–Ems Canal.
As Second Army raced forwards, 52nd (L) Division was switched to XXX Corps for the attack on Bremen. Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks, commanding XXX Corps, considered that at this stage of the war, 52nd (L) Division was one of the best in Second Army because it still retained a number of the original personnel (which was a consequence of its late arrival in the theatre). From 20 to 26 April XXX Corps closed in on Bremen against stubborn resistance. The division then had to control rioting and looting in the chaotic city. The numbers of Luftwaffe attack on the advancing British divisions peaked in the last week before the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath on 4 May.
Disbandment
After VE Day the units of 21st Army Group were engaged in occupation duties, disarming German troops and administering the British Zone of Allied-occupied Germany. Demobilisation began later in 1945 and 108th LAA Regiment disbanded on 20 February 1946, though the rest of 52nd (L) Division continued doing duty in British Army of the Rhine for some months to come.

Ludvig Vilhelm August Douglas, Count of Mühlhausen, Gondelsheim, Skenninge and Stjernorp, Lord of Langenstein and Stjernorp castles (24 November 1849 - 20 July 1916), was a conservative Swedish politician and official. They were a direct patrilineal descendant of Field Marshal Robert Douglas.
Ludvig Douglas was born at Zürich, Switzerland. Their parents were Count Carl Israel Douglas (1824-1898), first count of the Douglas family in the nobility of Baden (since 1848) as Count of Mühlhausen, and their wife Countess Louise von Gondelsheim and Langenstein (1825-1900), themselves a daughter of the morganatic marriage of Louis I, Grand Duke of Baden and Katharina Werner. Through their mother, they were a second cousin of Victoria of Baden, wife of King Gustaf V of Sweden.
They received the fideicommiss of Muhlhausen and the castle of Langenstein as their share of the family inheritance and reclaimed in c1875 their ancestral castle of Stjernorp in Sweden, which had been lost to their family after a fire in 1789. They ultimately succeeded their childless elder brother as head of the comital House of Douglas.
Douglas was a protectionist and solidly oriented towards Germany. From 1895 to 1899, they served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden. They resigned because they refused to accept that Norway (then in union with Sweden) would have their flag without the mark of the union, i.e. they opposed the so-called pure flag.
They also held the position of Riksmarskalk (Marshal of the Realm) (1911-1916), Landshövding (governor) of Uppsala County (1893-1895), and Landshövding (governor) of Östergötland County (1901-1912). Douglas worked for the Norrlander farmers' party against the forest products companies, they demanded protective legislation in field of wood market.
Count Ludvig died at Lysekil, and is buried at the Douglas family graveyard in Vreta monastic church, Sweden.
Their wife was Countess Anna Louise Ehrensvärd, daughter of Count Albert Ehrensvärd the Elder, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden (1885-1889), and sister of Count Albert Ehrensvärd the Younger, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden (1911-1914).
The Swedish branch of the Counts Douglas, to which Ludvig belonged, was the main surviving lineage of the family until Ludvig's sons and grandsons created several new branches (which spread over both Sweden and Germany. Lines descended from Ludvig Douglas include:
Counts von Douglas-Langenstein, descendants of Robert, the eldest son of Ludvig. They still hold Langenstein Castle in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Robert's second (and childless) wife was Augusta Victoria of Hohenzollern, dowager queen of Portugal.
Counts Douglas, Barons von Reischach, descendants of a grandson of Robert von Douglas-Langenstein
Counts Douglas-Gerstorp, the branch (settled in Sweden) descending from the youngest son of Robert von Douglas-Langenstein
Counts Douglas-Stjernorp, the branch descending from the Swedish general Archibald Douglas-Stjernorp, second son of Ludvig. This branch resides at Stjärnorp Castle and Rydboholm Castle. Archibald, through their eldest son, Carl Ludvig, is the grandfather of financier Count Gustaf Douglas and their sisters, Princess Elisabeth, Duchess in Bavaria and Rosita Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.
Counts Douglas-Kolfall, the branch descending from Oscar, the youngest son of Ludvig.

Hoshino Impul Co., Ltd., (known as Impul) is a Japanese automotive aftermarket company based in Setagaya-ku, Tokyo. Founded by Nissan's factory driver, Kazuyoshi Hoshino, the company exclusively produces aftermarket parts for Nissans, such as bodykits, engine components as well as wheels.
History
The company was founded in 1980 by the Nissan works driver, Kazuyoshi Hoshino in Maruko-cho, Shizuoka Prefecture. Within months, Impul produced its first product, the IMPUL D-01 wheel, which to promote it, it found its way on Hoshino's Gr. 5 Silvia racing competing in the Formula Silhouette, a Fuji Grand Champion support series, as well as starting a Tokyo-based sales center in Sayama-shi, Saitama-ken. A year later, that was relocated in Kichijōji, Musashino-shi.
In 1983, Hoshino formed Hoshino Racing Limited, a racing team to help promote their products and because of expansion, they relocated their company in Shimorenjaku, Mitaka as well as establishing a depot nearby.

Never for Ever is the third studio album by English art rock singer Kate Bush. Released in September 1980, it was Bush's first No. 1 album and was also the first album by a British female solo artist to top the UK Albums Chart, as well as being the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at No. 1. It has since been certified Gold by the BPI. It features the UK Top 20 singles "Breathing", "Army Dreamers" and "Babooshka", the latter being one of Bush's biggest hits. Bush co-produced the album with Jon Kelly.
Background
Beginning production after their 1979 tour, Never for Ever was Bush's second foray into production (her first was for the Onboard EP the previous year), aided by the engineer of Lionheart (1978), Jon Kelly. Bush was keen to start producing their work and felt that this was the first album they were happy with, since it was more personal.
The first two albums had resulted in a particular sound, which was evident in every track, with lush orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "Army Dreamers". Never for Ever was the first Kate Bush album to feature digital synthesizers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, which was programmed by Richard James Burgess and John L. Walters of synth-pop band Landscape. Like their previous two albums, it was initially composed on piano.
Bush's literary and cinematic influences were again to the fore. "The Infant Kiss", the story of a governess who is frightened by the adult feelings they have for their young male charge (who is possessed by the spirit of a grown man), was inspired by the 1961 film The Innocents, which in turn had been inspired by The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. "The Wedding List" drew from François Truffaut's 1968 film The Bride Wore Black. "Delius (Song of Summer)" was inspired by the 1968 Ken Russell television film Song of Summer, which portrays the last six years of the life of English composer Frederick Delius, when Eric Fenby acted as their amanuensis. Fenby is mentioned in the lyrics ("in B, Fenby"). "Blow Away (for Bill)" commemorates their lighting director Bill Duffield, killed in an accident at Poole Arts Centre during their 1979 tour. The song links their name to those of several music stars who died in the previous decade—Minnie Riperton, Keith Moon, Sandy Denny, Sid Vicious, Marc Bolan—and one earlier icon, Buddy Holly.
Never for Ever is the only studio album by Bush up to Director's Cut (2011) not to have a title track. According to Bush, the title alluded to conflicting emotions, good and bad, which pass, as they stated: "we must tell our hearts that it is 'never for ever', and be happy that it's like that".
The album cover is an illustration (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, who had also designed the cover for the programme for their 1979 tour. Bush was pleased with the results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under their skirt). Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from one's self. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.
Violin and Egypt were also performed live during The Tour of Life in April-May 1979. The Wedding List was also aired at BBC Christmas Special on December 28, 1979.
Release and critical reception
With work on the album completed in May, Never for Ever was released on 7 September 1980. Over the following week, Bush undertook a record signing tour of the UK including London, which resulted in lengthy queues down Oxford Street. During October they also undertook promotional appearances for the album throughout Europe, most prominently in Germany and France. In the US, the album was initially unreleased following the failure of their debut. As Bush gained a cult following over the coming years, however, Never for Ever was belatedly released in 1984 following the entry into the charts of their fourth album The Dreaming.
Never for Ever entered the UK Albums Chart on (week-ending) 20 September 1980 at No. 1. It remained there for one week, staying in the top 75 for a total of 23 weeks. The album became Bush's first record to reach the top position on the UK Albums Chart, also making them the first female British solo artist to achieve that status. Technically, Never for Ever is the first studio album (i.e. not the greatest hits compilation) by any solo female artist to reach number 1 in the UK as only Barbra Streisand and Connie Francis had achieved the feat prior to 1980 but with compilation albums (Diana Ross had also achieved three UK number 1 albums by then but these were also compilations and were credited to Diana Ross & The Supremes, and were therefore not solo albums).
Three singles were released from the album—all of which fared well in the charts. The first, "Breathing", reached No. 16 in the UK, as did the third, "Army Dreamers". The second single, "Babooshka", became one of Bush's biggest hits, peaking at No. 5 in the summer of 1980 in the UK and faring even better in Australia, where it reached No. 2 and was the 20th best-selling single of the year.
The album was favourably received by music critics at the time, save for a curiously critical review in Record Mirror, which appears to criticise the album (and Bush herself), while complimenting a number of tracks. Based largely on this album, Bush was voted "Best female artist of 1980" in polls taken in Melody Maker, Sounds, the Sunday Telegraph, and Capital Radio. Bush themselves has said that it was their favourite album to date. More recently, AllMusic gave the album a favourable review, complimenting the three singles most highly but said that Bush would improve on the formula on later albums. In 2020, Rolling Stone included Never for Ever in their "80 Greatest albums of 1980" list, praising Bush for their songwriting and their imagination.

The Kamalamba Navavarna Kritis by Shri Muthuswami Dikshitar (1776-1836) are some of the most famous pieces of music in the Carnatic system of Indian classical music. They are treasures which embody not only the technical brilliance of the composer but also offer a peep into the advaitic school of Hindu philosophy and elements of Tantric rituals. They are very elaborate compositions which may be well compared with major symphonies in the Western system.
Goddess Kamalamba
Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis is a group of compositions on Goddess Kamalamba enshrined in the Thyagarajeshwarar Temple, at Thiruvarur.  They are enshrined in a separate shrine inside the temple. They hold an esteemed position as  They are seen seated in a different posture altogether.  They are seen in deep meditation, placing Them legs one above the other, in a Yogic state.
Kamalambike - Dhyana Krithi
This song is the invocatory song for the whole set of krithis. This song is composed in Thodi ragam and set to Rupaka thalam.

Memorial Drive is a long road that travels from Stone Mountain to Downtown Atlanta in the U.S. state of Georgia. In 2000, a part of Memorial Drive was named "Cynthia McKinney Parkway," but the naming has come under scrutiny since their primary defeat in 2006.
Memorial Drive began as East Fair Street, one of the first streets in Atlanta. It was named for the 19th century fairgrounds in Grant Park, which appeared on maps as early as the 1860s. East Fair Street led from the downtown commercial area to residential neighborhoods. Suburban growth in Atlanta and DeKalb County in the late 1890s led to the creation and expansion of neighborhoods such as Grant Park and Edgewood. This push for development further east extended Fair Street to the edge of Atlanta City limits at Candler Road, allowing inclusion of the neighborhoods now known as East Lake and Kirkwood. On October 16, 1927, crews broke ground on the "Stone Mountain Memorial Drive." The groundbreaking was quite the affair, led by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association. This portion of the route was the extension from Avondale Estates to Stone Mountain. An announcement came in February 1930, that East Fair Street would officially be renamed to Memorial Drive. This drew the memorial line from Georgia's state capitol to the "eternal temple to the Confederacy."
The Tupac Shakur memorial statue is located on this road.

The Kosmos-3 (GRAU Index: 11K65, also known as Cosmos-3) was a Soviet carrier rocket (Kosmos (rocket family)), derived from the R-14 missile, which was used to orbit satellites between 1966 and 1968. It was quickly replaced by the modernised Kosmos-3M. Six were flown, four as orbital carrier rockets, and two on sub-orbital flights. All launches occurred from Site 41/15 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
The Kosmos-3 made its maiden flight on 16 November 1966, carrying a Strela-2 satellite. Strela-2 satellites were flown on four flights, two of which failed. Two further, sub-orbital launches were conducted with VKZ payloads, both of which were successful.

Telecomsoft was a British video game publisher and a division of British Telecom. The company was founded by Dr. Ederyn Williams in 1984 and operated three separate labels: Firebird, Rainbird, and Silverbird. The first employee was James Leavey, seconded from elsewhere in BT, who, along with Tony Rainbird, became the driving force behind the company in the early days.
History
Telecomsoft was founded in 1984 when computer games were the fastest growing sector within the computer software market at the time.
Despite a turnover of over £6 million in 1987/88, British Telecom sold the three labels to MicroProse in 1989 in a deal reported to be worth around £2,000,000 after a failed management buyout. MicroProse sold the Silverbird label soon after acquisition, but continued to use the Rainbird and Firebird labels for a short period.
Labels
Firebird
British Telecom brought in Tony Rainbird, owner of budget software publisher Micro-Gold, to help set up the first Telecomsoft label, Firebird.
Originally named Firefly Software, the label had to be renamed when it was discovered that the name had already been registered by another company.
The first titles to be published on the Firebird Silver label in November 1984 were The Wild Bunch for the ZX Spectrum, Booty for the Commodore 64 and Bird Strike for the BBC Micro.
Although there were doubts as to whether or not the market could afford to sustain a range of budget titles, the Firebird Silver releases were successful. In February 1985, Booty was the third best selling video game in the UK, behind only Ghostbusters and Daley Thompson's Decathlon.
While Firebird Silver would release budget titles priced at £2.50, Firebird Gold would release more prestigious titles at a higher price. Firebird Gold established itself just as well as its budget counterpart. The label became synonymous with many classic 8-bit titles such as Elite, Revs, and The Sentinel.
In October 1985, the budget range was relaunched as the lower priced Firebird Silver 199 Range and a full price label, Firebird Hot, was created to publish titles such as Costa Capers, the sequel to Technician Ted. A further label called Firebird Super Silver was a short-lived mid-price range which published titles such as Chimera and the Amstrad CPC version of Booty at £3.99.
Firebird's success allowed them to acquire a number of third party developers, see Telecomsoft acquisitions below, and they also established a deal with Ultimate Play the Game, whereby they would convert and publish a number of their successful ZX Spectrum games to the Commodore 64.
As the Rainbird label became the home of Telecomsoft's premium products, the Gold and Hot labels slowly merged into a single full price range which went on to publish Mike Singleton's Dark Sceptre and the home conversions of Bubble Bobble.
A final overhaul of the Firebird brand was conducted in early 1988 as the budget titles became rebranded as Silverbird.
Silverbird
Rather than attempt to juggle a potentially confusing budget label with the same branding as their full price software, Telecomsoft decided to rebrand their Silver 199 budget label as a single Silverbird range. Two price points were established for 8-bit software (£1.99 and £2.99) while a few budget 16-bit titles were priced at £9.99. These various price points were differentiated between by their own particular style of packaging.
Rather than simply republish their existing range of budget software, Silverbird published a range of titles that hadn't previously been released at a budget price point. This included many original new titles as well older full-price titles acquired from other publishers.
Following MicroProse's acquisition of Telecomsoft, the US publisher sold off the Silverbird label to a Tudor enterprise, a British publisher. They published a compilation pack of old Silverbird titles and a small number of original titles before closing down their software publishing operations.
Rainbird
The Rainbird label was established in November 1985 by Tony Rainbird. For legal reasons, the label's original name, Bluebird, had to be changed, although it still retained Tony Rainbird's original idea of releasing all its games in striking blue packaging.
The 16-bit home computer market, largely represented by the Atari ST and Amiga, was just beginning to take off in 1986 and the Rainbird label was an ideal opportunity to capitalise on it. Rather than concentrate on the more simplistic arcade action games that had dominated the 8-bit era, Rainbird aimed to introduce cutting edge simulators, adventure games and utilities to the full-price market.
Rainbird formed partnerships with a number of developers who would produce their next range of games. Magnetic Scrolls and Argonaut Software were amongst the first developers to benefit from a publishing deal with the label. Realtime Games, a successful ZX Spectrum developer who specialised in fast 3D action games, converted Starglider to the ZX Spectrum and developed Carrier Command.
The company republished enhanced versions of adventure games by Level 9 Computing, beginning with their Middle-earth trilogy: Colossal Adventure (itself an enhanced conversion of Adventure by Will Crowther and Don Woods), Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure, these last two featuring the Demon Lord Agaliarept. Rainbird published this sequence as Jewels of Darkness and references to Middle-earth were expunged. Rainbird also published Level 9's Silicon Dreams trilogy: Snowball was followed by Return to Eden and The Worm in Paradise.
MicroProse continued to use the Rainbird label for a number of years, after its acquisition of Telecomsoft.
Acquisitions
Beyond Software
One of Telecomsoft's earliest acquisitions was Beyond Software. Originally set up by the EMAP publishing group in 1983, Beyond published numerous titles on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC, but met with very little success until the release of Mike Singleton's Lords of Midnight in 1984. The Tolkien-esque strategy game, and allowed Beyond to establish a distribution deal with American developers First Star, as well as a publishing deal with developer Denton Designs.
After being acquired by Telecomsoft in late 1985<ref name="birds-beyond">Richard Hewison: Beyond. from: The Bird Sanctuary. Accessed on 2009-12-10</ref> for a six-figure sum, Beyond continued to operate as a unique label, mostly releasing games that had already been in development for some time, as well as a number of conversions of existing titles. Telecomsoft did very little with the Beyond label beyond these releases. A number of other titles, such as Star Trek: The Rebel Universe'', were released on the Firebird label.

Michael Riedel (born December 24, 1966) is an American theatre critic, conservative broadcaster, and columnist.  They are the co-host of "Len Berman and Michael Riedel in the Morning" on 710 WOR in New York City, weekdays 6-10am. Riedel has been a controversial and influential Broadway columnist of the New York Post for over 20 years. Riedel's book Razzle Dazzle: The Battle for Broadway won the 2015 Marfield Prize for arts writing and is widely considered to be the successor to The Season, William Goldman's classic 1967 book about Broadway. Their second book, Singular Sensation: The Triumph of Broadway, was published by Avid Reader Press, a division of Simon & Schuster, on November 10, 2020.
Riedel's skewering of Broadway shows and personalities in their column have made them a controversial and often feared figure on the New York theater scene. They have been called "the terrible infant of the New York press".
Early life and education
Riedel was born on December 24, 1966, and grew up in Geneseo, New York. Their father was the athletic director for SUNY Geneseo and their mother was a grade-school librarian. They have been described as a "smart, sarcastic kid" who joined the Young Republicans at 12 and originally planned to become a lawyer and politician.
They initially enrolled at Johns Hopkins University, but transferred after a year to Columbia University. While at Columbia, they acted in plays and regularly appeared on a radio show devoted to musical theater. The summer after their sophomore year, they interned for Liz McCann while they were producing the Broadway production of Les liaisons dangereuses. In 1989, they graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in History.
Career
After graduating from Columbia, Riedel served as Managing Editor of the now-defunct TheaterWeek magazine, which they attempted to make more literary by hiring highly respected theater figures such as critic Eric Bentley to write articles. They stayed friends with Bentley until the latter's death in 2020.
In 1993, they were hired as a gossip columnist for The Daily News and subsequently launched their now-famous column reporting the latest news and speculation about the Broadway theater scene. In 1998, they moved their column to the New York Post, where they remain today. In September 2015, the Post announced that it was cutting the column from two columns a week to one. Riedel said of the change: "I'm happy about the changes. It's all part of a redesign of the features pages. If there's any 'breaking news,' I'll get it on the website and in the paper the next day." Riedel's Wednesday column was reinstated in the paper in 2016 after advertisers complained of its absence.
David Leveaux controversy
In 2005, Riedel was the subject of considerable press themselves when they were in an altercation with English director David Leveaux at the Manhattan theater hangout Angus McIndoe. Riedel, who later admitted to being "tipsy," insulted Leveaux by claiming that English directors often ruin classic American musicals. While rumors circulated that Leveaux hit Riedel so hard that the columnist had to go to the emergency room, the truth is that Riedel was merely shoved to the floor and was not injured.
Cultural references
Riedel also appeared regularly on the "Imus in the Morning" program, "The Mark Simone Show", "The Mike Gallagher Show" and Fox News', "Red Eye".
Riedel played a version of themselves in several episodes of the NBC musical drama Smash. In view of their notorious reputation as a theater columnist, Riedel was referred to as a "Napoleonic little Nazi" in the premiere episode of the on February 6, 2012. They later made cameo appearances in three episodes:
"Hell on Earth"
"The Fallout"
"The Nominations"
In 2016, Riedel appeared on John Mulaney and Nick Kroll's comedy show Oh, Hello on Broadway.
Riedel was mentioned in the opening song at the 71st Tony Awards performed by host Kevin Spacey.

St. Marys is a ghost town in Miner County, in the U.S. state of South Dakota.
History
St. Mary's was laid out in 1886, and named for the daughter of the original landowner, Louis Gotthelf. A post office called St. Mary's was established in 1883, and closed in 1893. It reopened in 1902, with the name changed to St. Marys (without an apostrophe), and closed permanently in 1909. The name of the town was changed to Argonne, South Dakota in 1919 after the battle of Meuse-Argonne in France in World War I.

The fourth season of the American reality talent show The Voice premiered on March 25, 2013, on NBC and was hosted by Carson Daly, while Christina Milian returned as the social media correspondent. Coaches Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton returned as coaches, both for their fourth season. CeeLo Green and Christina Aguilera appeared as performers instead of coaches. Two new coaches Shakira and Usher served as replacement coaches for Aguilera and Green, leaving Levine & Shelton the only coaches remaining from the inaugural season. The team sizes were trimmed back down to 12 per team (season two's team size), with each coach having two 'steals' in the Battle Rounds.
Danielle Bradbery, a 16-year-old country singer (then-youngest winner of the series) from Cypress won the season, marking Shelton's third win as a coach.
Auditions, coaches, hosts, and team sizes
Auditions were held from January 12 to February 17, 2013, in Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston and New York City.
Carson Daly hosted for their fourth consecutive season, while Christina Milian returned for their third season as social media correspondent. The judges' line-up saw a change for the first time since the inception of the show. Joining coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton were Usher and Shakira. CeeLo Green and Christina Aguilera were substituted in order to focus on their music careers. However, Green and Aguilera would be returning in the following season.
This season's advisers for the Battle Rounds were Hillary Scott (lead singer of Lady Antebellum), Sheryl Crow, Pharrell Williams, and Joel Madden (lead singer of Good Charlotte and coach on The Voice Australia) as advisers of Levine, Shelton, Usher, and Shakira's teams respectively. All advisers except Madden returned to coach on their respective teams during week three of the live shows, so Shakira brought in Green to help coach their team.

Live shows
Prior to the start of the Live shows, a special episode called "The Road to the Live Shows" was aired for one hour on Wednesday, May 1, 2013, recapping some of the best moments of the blind auditions, battle rounds and knockout rounds.
Color key:
Week 1: Live playoffs (May 6, 7 & 8)
The live playoffs aired from Monday, May 6, 2013, through Wednesday, May 8, 2013. Contestants were asked to sing a stripped-down version of a song in order to concentrate on the competition. The Monday performances featured Teams Adam and Usher, while Tuesday's shows featured Teams Blake and Shakira. On Wednesday, the two artists per team will advance by public vote, and a third artist would be saved by the coach. Special guests in the audience included Savannah Guthrie and Al Roker of The Today Show.
Week 2: Top 12 (May 13 & 14)
The Top 12 performed on Monday, May 13, 2013, and received the results on Tuesday, May 14, 2013. Usher brought in their choreographer, Aakomon Jones, to help coach the artists on their team. During the performance episode's second hour, host Carson Daly mentioned on the changes made to the iTunes multiplier bonus (which remained at tenfold if the artist's single peaked at the top 100 during the voting period), where only one download of an artist's eligible song per registered iTunes account during the designated voting window will count as a vote towards that week's results. The change was contemporaneously added to the "Vote Help" section of the show's NBC.com voting page. None of the artists reached the top 10 on iTunes, so no bonuses were awarded this week. They also mentioned that the iTunes bonus is only given to those in the Top 10 at the close of voting (10am EST).
Week 3: Top 10 (May 20 & 21)
The Top 10 performed for two hours on Monday, May 20, 2013, with results broadcast on Tuesday, May 21, 2013. Advisers from the Battles (Sheryl Crow, Pharrell Williams and Hillary Scott from Lady Antebellum) return to coach on their respective teams. CeeLo Green takes the place of Joel Madden due to Madden's prior commitments to The Voice Australia. The results show featured a performance dedicated to the people who lost their lives from an EF5 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma. Special guests in the audience included Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel from Fast & Furious 6.
This week's iTunes bonus multipliers was awarded to Bradbery.
Week 4: Top 8 (May 27 & 28)
The Top 8 performed on Monday, May 27, 2013, and received the results on Tuesday, May 28. A special preview for the upcoming season of America's Got Talent was shown during the broadcast of the results show.
None of the artists reached the top 10 on iTunes, so no bonuses were awarded; Bradbery's performance single however, did peak at the Top 10 only after the voting window ended, thus the bonus was not applied.
Week 5: Quarterfinals (June 3 & 4)
Top 6 performed two songs each on Monday, June 3, 2013, and received the results on Tuesday, June 4, 2013. Each contestant sang two songs, one of their choice, and one of the coach's choice. Only one contestant was eliminated this week instead of the usual two. Taylor Swift attended Michelle Chamuel's rehearsal for "I Knew You Were Trouble". Amber Carrington had forgotten the lyrics to "I Remember You" during their performance, though it was not commented on by any of the coaches.
The iTunes bonus multipliers was awarded for Chamuel.
Week 6: Semifinals (June 10 & 11)
The Top 5 performed two songs each on Monday, June 10, 2013, and received the results on Tuesday, June 11, 2013. One song is chosen by their coach, and the other is chosen by the contestant as a dedication to another (The Swon Brothers dedicated their band members past and present, Allen for their children, Carrington for their best friends, Bradbery for their parents and best friend, and Chamuel for their coach, Usher)
With the eliminations of Allen and Carrington, Levine and Shakira no longer have any remaining artists on their teams, with the latter being the first contestant to reach the Top 10 of iTunes and to be eliminated in the same week, and also the first time a pair of contestants who pitted together in a Battle round eliminated on the same week. It also marked the first time that a new coach has coached an artist competing in the finale on their first attempt, as Usher had Chamuel available on their team.
Week 7: Finale (June 17 & 18)
The Top 3 performed on Monday, June 17, 2013, with the announcement of the winner on Tuesday, June 18, 2013. This week, the contestants performed three times: a "defining moment" from a previous performance, a duet with their coach, and a solo.
Six performances reached top 10 on iTunes as follows Danielle Bradbery (#2 & #9), Michelle Chamuel (#3 & #8) and The Swon Brothers (#4 & #7).

Season four premiered on March 25, 2013, and was watched by 13.64 million viewers with a 4.8 rating in the 18–49 demographic. It was up from the previous season's premiere by 1.36 million viewers (11%).
Controversies
Voting controversy
At the beginning of the results show for The Live Playoffs, Carson Daly announced that "inconsistencies" were found in the voting, so votes cast via text-messaging and online would be excluded from the vote count to ensure fairness. Daly brought Jason George, CEO of Telescope, the company that manages the show's voting system, on stage to stress that the exclusion would not have affected the results either way. Reported issues were that voting had closed on the Facebook app and website at 11.30 pm PST (an hour and a half after the show's West Coast airing) when it should have ended at 10 am EST the next day, which may have been a result of too many users voting at the same time.
Adam Levine comment
Upon seeing that their team members Judith Hill and Sarah Simmons had not been saved, coach Adam Levine said, "I hate this country," right before the top 8 results were announced. This brought some angry responses on their Twitter page. They then sent a series of Tweets with dictionary definitions of the words "joke," "humorless," "lighthearted," and "misunderstand" to state that it was merely a "heat of the moment" reaction. Levine later provided an explanation: "Last night's elimination of Judith and Sarah was confusing and downright emotional for me, and my comments were made based on my personal dissatisfaction with the results."

Jesse Glass (born 1954) is an American expatriate poet, artist and folklorist.
In America
Glass first began to write and publish experimental poetry in c. 1972. Starting in 1976, they edited and published the mimeographed Goethe's Notes Magazine and Goethe's Press from their family home in Westminster, Maryland. Richard Kostelanetz's wide-ranging cultural activities were a major influence during this period, particularly Kostelanetz's Assembling Magazine.
Glass became known for their writing and publishing in the Baltimore/Washington D.C. area, as part of a group that included Mel Raff's Aleph, Richard Peabody's Gargoyle Magazine, Elsberg/ Cairncross' Bogg, and Kevin Urick's White Ewe Press, as well as for their many underground publications in England. At this time Glass also made contact with the performance poet Rod Summers of VEC in the Netherlands and began to participate in mail art and in voice recordings and alternative music.
Glass attended the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in 1978, where they studied with Howard Nemerov. In 1979, Glass attended the Johns Hopkins University Writing Seminars and obtained their M.A. in English. Their teachers there were Richard Howard and Cynthia Macdonald. Fellow students included Michael Martone, Lucie Brock-Broido, and Louise Erdrich. In 1980, Glass moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to attend graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. While in Milwaukee, they edited the Cream City Review, and was constantly in touch with the readings and artistic events at Woodland Pattern Book Center. During this time, Glass began to correspond with Helen Adam, Kathleen Raine, Armand Schwerner, Rosmarie Waldrop, Ronald Johnson, Larry Eigner, Ron Silliman, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Steve McCaffrey, Robert Peters, Bern Porter, Lewis Turco, and others involved in new and experimental literature. Glass graduated with a Ph.D. in English, with an emphasis in American literature, in 1988.
After winning the Deep South Writers Conference award in poetry for two years in a row, Glass was invited by Burton Raffel, poet and translator, for a brief residency at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. They met Skip Fox there, and began the magazine Die Young (1991 – c.1996).
In Japan
In 1992 Glass moved to Japan and began to collect bilingual poetry publications, as well as to correspond with Cid Corman, Jon Silkin, Edith Shiffert, and other writers. Glass also was poetry editor of the Chiba-based poetry magazine the Abiko Rag, and suggested renaming it the Abiko Quarterly. They served as the poetry editor from 1993 – 96. Glass became a member of the poetry group/magazine Sei-En (Blue Flame) founded by their friend the poet Yoichi Kawamura.
Glass went on-line in 1997, and joined the Buffalo Poetics List, Poetry, Etc., and British Poets, where they established themselves as a presence and corresponded with many poets. Beginning in 1998, Glass established Ahadada Books, which has had, with the assistance of the Canadian poet Daniel Sendecki, some success with cooperative and e-publishing.
In 2001, Glass was a featured performer at the international Poli-Poetry Festival in Maastricht, the Netherlands as a guest of the Dutch government.
Present endeavors
Glass' own work includes The Passion of Phineas Gage and Selected Poems (West House Books, 2006), reviewed extensively by David B. Axelrod in the archived magazine Poetrybay; and many chapbooks and artist's books, as well as visual and sound poetry.
On another front, Glass is a folklorist and historian, focusing on Carroll County, Maryland. In 1982, Glass' compilation of folklore Ghosts and Legends of Carroll County, Maryland was published by the Carroll County Library System, and has since gone into six printings. In 1998, Ghosts and Legends was updated. In 2001, this book, along with the Carroll County ghost walk, hosted by the Carroll County Library System, was deemed a "Local Legacy" by the Library of Congress. Moreover, their research into the life and death of Joseph Shaw, a Civil War era editor who was murdered in Westminster, Maryland, has resulted in two books as well as a collaboration with the Lithuanian composer Arturas Bumsteinas on a work of electronic music. Ghosts and Legends has become a standard work of Maryland Folklore, and is officially listed by the Maryland Humanities Council as such. In 2004, Glass, in collaboration with the Historical Society of Carroll County, Maryland and Meikai University, Japan, published The Witness; Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Carroll County, Maryland in a free, on-line edition, available as an e-book through Ahadada Books. This publication is the sole resource for the study of this subject.
Jesse Glass' literary papers, as well as their collections of Marylandia, British and American underground publications, Japanese literature and folklore, and visual and sound works are archived at the University of Maryland Libraries Special Collections, College Park. Glass' work can also be found in the Special Collections of Brown University and New York University at Buffalo, among others. The Ruth and Marvin Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry also holds a number of Glass' visual compositions. The Tate Gallery, London, took two of Glass' illuminated books for their collection in 2006.
Glass has recently begun to collaborate with the British poet Alan Halsey and the German experimental composer and musician Ralph Lichtensteiger.
Jesse Glass is also a "lexicoiner" (one who adds to the lexicon); in 2002, the term Spam Lit first appeared in a University at Buffalo Poetics listserv subject line, followed by this message: "I'm still thinking about the ramifications of literature and art created with the delete button in mind."
Currently Jesse Glass is a professor of American literature at Meikai University ("Bright Sea" University in Japanese) in Chiba, Japan.

Camponotus reburrus (from Latin, reburrus, meaning one with bristling hair, referring to the hairs on the head) is a species of carpenter ants in the subfamily Formicinae. It is known only from northeastern Ecuador. C. reburrus apparently has an obligatory relationship with the ant plants Cecropia membranacea, Cecropia herthae and Cecropia marginalis. The workers are relatively small and hairy, it does not appear to have major workers. It is similar to Camponotus balzani which also lives in Cecropia spp. (but has normal major workers).
Description
The minor worker of C. reburrus is a relatively small (4.4–6.6 mm total length) yellowish brown specimen, with a transversely striped yellow and brown gaster, or at least with yellow lateral splotches. The sides of the head are straight and parallel, and the carina on the clypeus is well marked. The antennal scape has numerous erect hairs along the shaft, the hairs on the tibiae are coarse and suberect. Most surfaces are moderately to strongly shining. The major worker apparently does not exist.
The female of C. reburrus is a small (total length 6–7 mm) hairy specimen, which is shiny dark brown with lighter colored legs. The gaster has lateral yellow splotches. The sides of the head are straight and parallel. The size and abundant erect hairs on the head and scape should separate it from all others in the subgenus Tanaemyrmex.
The male of C. reburrus is a small (total length 4.0–5.5 mm) dark brown to yellowish brown specimen, with abundant hairs on most surfaces. Other than color and hairiness, it does not seem to possess characteristics which would distinguish it from other small males of Camponotus.
Related carpenter ants
Camponotus reburrus is closely related to C. balzani, but does not appear to be closely related to any of the other described species in the subgenus Tanaemyrmex. This relationship with C. balzani was further supported with DNA barcode analyses. The minor workers can be separated in that the side of the head has few erect or suberect hairs (abundant in minors of C. balzani), the gaster is transversely striped with yellow bands (generally concolorous light brown in C. balzani, sometimes with a hint of tan transverse stripes), and the workers are slightly smaller (much overlap in size ranges in the two species). The females of C. reburrus are much smaller (maximum total length approaches 7 mm) than those of C. balzani (total length over 1 cm). The splotches or stripes on the gaster are definitely yellow in females of C. reburrus but are only pale brown (if present) on the gaster of females of C. balzani. The males of C. reburrus are also much smaller (total length approaching 4.7 mm) as compared to the males of C. balzani (total length greater than 5 mm). The males of C. reburrus are generally darker brown than the pale medium brown males of C. balzani. If major workers are found to exist, they will probably be similar to those of C. balzani with the sides of the head narrowed anteriorly, with a well-developed clypeal carina, but differing in having few erect hairs on the sides of the head. The gaster would be expected to have well-developed yellow splotches or bands, which would differ from the major of C. balzani in which the bands on the gaster are only pale brown, if present.
Biology
Three of the winged female-type specimens of C. reburrus were collected in a Malaise trap. Others were collected in Cecropia at the edge of secondary growth rainforest or in gaps inside primary growth rainforest. Among the Cecropia species where this species was found are: C. marginalis, C. herthae, and C. membranacea. The ants were found inside Cecropia internodes and were not aggressive as are Azteca ants. Müllerian bodies and scale insects were found in the internodes where the ant species were living. This species is smaller than C. balzani, but the behavior inside Cecropia nodes is similar: the ants of both species do not attack but run and escape. Camponotus balzani and C. reburrus inhabit Cecropia juvenile and reproductive plants (plants with pistillate or staminate flowers), but most Cecropia species were found more commonly with aggressive colonies of Azteca ants.

Simplicidentata is a group of mammals that includes the rodents (order Rodentia) and their closest extinct relatives. The term has historically been used as an alternative to Rodentia, contrasting the rodents (which have one pair of upper incisors) with their close relatives the lagomorphs (which have two). However, Simplicidentata is now defined as including all members of Glires (the clade formed by lagomorphs and rodents) that share a more recent common ancestor with living rodents than with living lagomorphs. Thus, Simplicidentata is a total group that is more inclusive than Rodentia, a crown group that includes all living rodents, their last common ancestor, and all its descendants. Under this definition, the loss of the second pair of upper incisors is a synapomorphic (shared derived) feature of Simplicidentata. The loss of the second upper premolar (P2) has also been considered as synapomorphic for Simplicidentata, but the primitive simplicidentate Sinomylus does have a P2.
This sense of Simplicidentata was introduced by Chuankui Li and colleagues in 1987, who ranked Simplicidentata as a superorder including Rodentia and the extinct Mixodontia, contrasted with the superorder Duplicidentata (including Lagomorpha and the extinct Mimotonida). In their 1997 book Classification of Mammals, Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell ranked Simplicidentata as a mirorder within the grandorder Anagalida (also including lagomorphs, macroscelideans, and some additional extinct groups). Within Simplicidentata, they recognized the orders Mixodontia (including only the extinct family Eurymylidae from the Paleocene and Eocene of Asia) and Rodentia. McKenna and Bell's decision to use Simplicidentata was criticized by reviewer Frederick S. Szalay, who preferred to simply place the Mixodontia within Rodentia, which would leave Simplicidentata unnecessary. In The Beginning of the Age of Mammals (2006), Kenneth Rose recognized a mirorder Simplicidentata, including Mixodontia, Rodentia, and the genus Sinomylus (not placed in either order), within the superorder Anagalida.

Hinterzarten is a resort village in the Black Forest (German: Schwarzwald), located in the southwest of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Although Hinterzarten is mostly famous for its ski jumping, it has many other tourist attractions.
Geography
Location
Hinterzarten is located , which is just below that of the Feldberg (), the highest mountain in the Black Forest. The municipality descends to the southeastern end of Lake Titisee (), although its lowest point is the Sternenrank at . Hinterzarten is located within the Southern Black Forest Nature Park, and the Zartenbach stream flows through the municipality. Mountain peaks within the municipality include the Windeckkopf (1,209 m).
Climate
Hinterzarten's annual precipitation is 1,406 mm, which is thus in amongst the highest in Germany. The driest month is September; the most precipitation falls in December.
Neighbouring municipalities
Hinterzarten's neighbouring municipalities are Breitnau, Titisee-Neustadt, Lenzkirch, Feldberg and Oberried, all belonging to the county of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald.
Municipal subdivisions
The following subdivisions are part of the municipality of Hinterzarten: Hinterzarten village, the hamlets (Zinken) of Alpersbach, Am Feldberg, Bisten (partly also in Breitnau), Bruderhalde, Erlenbruck, Löffeltal, Oberzarten, Rinken, Rotwasser, Windeck and Winterhalde, as well as the residences of Altenvogtshütte (Auf Stucken), Ramselegut, Dorneck, Fürsatz(hof) and Silberberg. Within the municipality are the abandoned villages of Bankgallihof, Bäuerlehof, Imberihof, Rufenhof, Seehäusle and Waldhof.
History
Hinterzarten was founded in 1148. In the beginning, Hinterzarten was actually called "Hinter der Straß" (behind the street), and Breitnau to the north was "Vor der Straß" (in front of the street). Between 1708 and 1750 the village's name changed to Hinterzarten, partly because of a small river in the area called Zartenbach. By 1755 the first postal road to Hinterzarten was built through the Höllental, and in 1887 a railway stretch for tourists was opened.
In 1923, after the foundation of the Ski Club Hinterzarten, the Kirchwaldschanze ski jump was built (jumping was discontinued in 1974); and in 1924 the Adlerschanze ski-jump was built. The Adlerschanze remains today after being renovated and rebuilt multiple times.
In 1964 Hinterzarten officially became a "climatic healing resort" (German: Heilklimatischer Kurort).
Sports
Besides the 4-hill ski jumping complex, Hinterzarten also has three ski lifts, a tennis center, a cross-country skiing center, a soccer club, and has been a member of the Black Forest Nordic walking club since 2003.
The Black Forest Ultra Bike Marathon (German) starts in Hinterzarten. Hinterzarten hosted the FIS (Fédération Internationale de Ski) Nordic Junior World Ski Championships and the Under-23 Cross-Country World Championships in 2010.

Attractions
Hiking and bicycle trails abound, and in the winter over 100 km of cross-country ski paths are prepared. One of the most popular hiking trails is the one from Hinterzarten to Titisee. A "nature experience" trail (German: Naturerlebnispfad) was opened in 2000. The Adlerschanze ski jump is one of the Ski jumping Grand Prix Tournament hills. The Tournament reaches the Adlerschanze in early August, and lasts one weekend (two days). About 20,000 people attend the contest.
The Black Forest Ski Museum covers the beginning of skiing and the early techniques and equipment used on the nearby Feldberg. There is also a museum of ancient agricultural engineering, with old farm equipment and machines; the museum is located in a 400-year-old farmhouse.

Lee Jin (born March 21, 1980) is a South Korean singer and actor. They made their entertainment debut as a member of the K-pop girl group Fin.K.L, along with Lee Hyori, Ock Joo-hyun, and Sung Yu-ri. After Fin.K.L came to an unofficial end in 2002, Lee became an actor.
Career
Lee Jin joined Fin.K.L after their friend Ock Joo-hyun—the first member to be selected for the group—introduced them to the casting director selecting the group's members. They sang Eco's "Heng Bok Han Na Reul" and was immediately selected to be in the group.
In 2002, the members from the girl group started solo activities. Lee had long expressed their interest in acting, before their debut they were in MBC's Police People. Subsequently, they starred in the popular sitcom Nonstop.
In 2005, Lee joined the variety program X-Man. On the show, Lee signalled that they had grown into a "lady" from their Fin.K.L teenage days via a change in their hairstyle and clothes. In X-Man, they became known for their stiff dance steps, so they had to create new stiff dance steps for the intro dance segment in each episode. They were also known for being the show's ulzzang ("best/pretty face"), having been chosen by many of the male guests to be their partner in the couple game.
In 2010, Lee also appeared in Heroes where 12 artists competed in games to garner the popular title or will fall into the unpopular group. In this program, they showed their nice and warm-hearted personality.

The PDP-8 Disk Monitor is a discontinued operating system released by Digital Equipment Corporation for their PDP-8 line of mini-computers. The minimum hardware requirements consisted of a ASR 33 teletype,
3 cycle data break (an option on the PDP-8/S model), and a mass storage option of a DF32 disk sub-system or a TC01 DECtape unit, with later releases the additional option of using a RF08 disk drive. The distribution media was on paper tape, a common means of data storage for computers of that era. The included user programs consisted mainly of modified versions of the paper tape software library distributed by DEC for their PDP-8 family of small computers, much of this was exported to the TSS-8 and MS/8 operating systems.
A modified version of this monitor was used on "8K or larger PDP 8/E" systems, with one of its claimed benefits being that it made better use of additional DECtape drives than OS/8.

Khem Shahani (1923–2001) was an Indian microbiologist who conducted pioneer research on probiotics (live microorganisms).
Career
Khem Shahani is best known for their discovery of the DDS-1 strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus in 1959, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. One of their many contributions to biology in the years to come, in this landmark discovery, Shahani observed the high level of stability and nutritional viability of the DDS-1 strain. This unique feature meant that the probiotics were able to pass through the stomach acid and implant in the intestine where it could multiply over 200-fold. Shahani would later name the strain DDS-1 for the Department of Dairy Science Number One strain and spend the rest of their career unlocking its potential for improving overall health.
During their lengthy career, Shahani published over 200 articles in peer reviewed scientific journals and was a consultant for international agencies such as the World Health Organization. Among these, 80 publications were about Probiotics and Lactic Cultures.
In 1981, Shahani founded Nebraska Cultures, a probiotics manufacturing and research company. Today, Nebraska Cultures is one of the largest international probiotic supplement manufacturers and suppliers. They served as a consultant for several food and feed supplements and nutrients manufacturing and marketing companies, including Klaire Laboratories, National Enzyme Company, Nutraceutical Corporation, Kovac, TwinLab, Arise & Shine, American Biologics, Cell Tech (now New Earth Life Sciences), Infinity2, Nutratec SAS, and others.
Khem Shahani died on 6 July 2001 while on a speaking tour in Sicily (Italy). In 2005, a professorship was established at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in their name, honouring their work as scientist and professor.
Academic background
Khem Shahani earned the BS (1943, Major: Dairy and Food Technology; and Nutritional Microbiology) and the MS (1947, Major: Dairy Chemistry; Minor: Microbiology) degrees at the University of Bombay, then the PhD (1950, Major: Food and Dairy Science; Minor: Biochemistry) at the University of Wisconsin.
Research and teaching
Khem Shahani taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1950 to 1952 and Ohio State University at Columbus from 1953 to 1957.
In 1957 Shahani accepted a post at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in the department of Dairy Science, later changed to the Department of Food Science and Technology in 1961. They retired from full-time teaching in 1994, but continued some teaching and research until 2000.
Shahani conducted basic research and developmental work as related to the science and technology of dairy foods – bioprocessed and cultured foods; lactic cultures, especially Lactobacillus acidophilus, food safety, food fermentation, human and animal nutrition, food and feed supplements, bioprocessed and cultured foods, significance and role of proteins and enzymes in milk and other foods, whey utilisation, water quality, vitamins, antibiotics and toxins in foods, human milk, infant foods, and biotechnology.
The professorial activity of Shahani consisted in teaching several multidisciplinary courses in Food Science and Technology, Biotechnology, Fermentation technology, for graduate students. They also supervised 16 postdoctoral fellows, 16 PhD candidates, and 22 MS candidates.
Research and management
In their lifetime, Shahani administered and supervised a large number of research projects with several graduate students and postdoctoral fellows actively engaged in biochemical and nutritional research work. They supervised three research projects and worked with several national and international students and postdoctorals from the United States, the Middle East, China, India, Korea, Africa, South America and Romania. They served as a member and Chairman of the Academic Planning Committee of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln pertaining to academic affairs and budget allocations.
Honors and awards

The white-winged becard (Pachyramphus polychopterus) is a species of bird in the family Tityridae. It has traditionally been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggest it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee. The species contains 8 subspecies that vary markedly in plumage and voice, and it has been suggested that they represent more than one species.
It is found in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Chile is the only country of South America where the white-winged becard does not occur. The white-winged becard ranges east of the Andes cordillera, except in Colombia and Ecuador.
The white-winged becard inhabits a range of habitats, typically from lowlands to , but on occasion as high as .

Blood/Candy is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band The Posies, released on September 28, 2010, by Rykodisc. It was the band's first album release in five years, following Every Kind of Light.
The Posies say this is something totally different from what they've tried before. "We subscribe to the 'evolve or perish' philosophy," co-founder Jon Auer says in a statement. "We directed ourselves to new places with this recording and tried not to travel down familiar paths when it could be avoided. Expect the unexpected"
"One of the things I was hoping to do on this record," says Auer, "was gone back to the idea of Ken and me writing most of the songs, versus the last recording we did, where we kind of cobbled things together in the studio with everyone. I just felt like we needed to have that time to prepare and actually sit down and write." As a result, Stringfellow says, "I would say that I feel the songs on this one a bit deeper... there's stuff from way down in there that I think gives it a little more soul."

William Armistead Moale Burden Sr. (July 11, 1877 – February 2, 1909) was an American football guard for the Harvard Crimson football team and stock broker.
Early life
Burden was born on July 11, 1877 in Troy, New York to millionaire iron manufacturer I. Townsend Burden and Evelyn Byrd (Moale) Burden. They attended Groton School where they were a member of the school's football team. In 1895, they succeeded Percy Haughton as team captain.
Harvard
Burden played on the Harvard first-year student football team in 1896. The following season they became the backup center on the varsity team. In 1898 they became a starting guard and in 1899 was the team captain. Following their senior season, Burden was named a second-team All-American by the New York Tribune and Outing and a third-team All-American by Walter Camp. Outside of football, Burden was first marshall and president of their class as well as president of the Hasty Pudding and Groton clubs. Burden graduated from Harvard in 1900.
Career
Immediately after leaving school, Burden, Francis Lee Higginson, John L. Saltonstall, and Augustus Jay took a trip around the world. They eventually returned to New York City, where they worked for James D. Smith & Co. On August 19, 1903, they purchased a seat on the New York Stock Exchange from Henry G. Weil for $60,000.
On October 1, 1907, Burden retired as a floor member of James D. Smith & Co. due to ill health. They were sent abroad to recover, however their health did not improve.
Personal life
On April 12, 1904 they married Florence Vanderbilt Twombly, daughter of Hamilton McKown Twombly and Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly and a granddaughter of William Henry Vanderbilt, at Saint Thomas Church in Manhattan. The couple had two sons, William A. M. Burden Jr. (who became the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium) and Shirley Carter Burden (who became a prominent photographer).
On December 2, 1908, The New York Times reported that their illness had gotten worse and that they had been bedridden for several months. Doctors were unable to diagnose or treat Burden's illness, which was described by The New York Times as a "chronic recurrent fever" that "attacks the patient suddenly...if they recover, the only thing to do is prepare them for the next attack, which is sure to come". They died on February 2, 1909 at their home in Manhattan.
Legacy
In 1971, Burden's widow and sons donated Burden Hall to Harvard Business School in honor of them and their grandson, William A. M. Burden III, who also died young.

John Russell Carnahan (; born July 10, 1958) is an American politician from the state of Missouri. A member of the Democratic Party, they served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 to 2013.
At the time, the district included the southern third of the city of St. Louis (known as South City) and most of the southern St. Louis suburbs including most of Jefferson County and all of Ste. Genevieve County. Some cities located in the district include: Webster Groves, Mehlville, Affton, and Oakville, and the southern suburbs of Arnold, Herculaneum, Pevely, Crystal City, Barnhart, Imperial, and Festus, as well as Ste. Genevieve in the neighboring Ste. Genevieve County.
Dramatic losses in population in St. Louis in the 2010 Census contributed to Missouri losing a Congressional seat effective 2013. In the re-mapping of the state's congressional districts, Carnahan's district was dismantled. The bulk of the district, including Carnahan's home, was drawn into Missouri's 1st congressional district. The move placed Carnahan and William Lacy Clay Jr. in the same district; Carnahan lost the primary to Clay for the seat on August 7, 2012.
Early life, education and career
John Russell Carnahan was born in 1958 in Columbia, Missouri, and raised in Rolla.  They are the son of the late Mel Carnahan, the former Governor of Missouri and posthumous U.S. Senator-elect, and Jean Carnahan (née Carpenter), who was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the seat to which their husband was posthumously elected.
Their grandfather, A. S. J. Carnahan, served in Congress for seven terms, and also as U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone. Russ Carnahan is a recipient of the Eagle Scout Award. Their sister Robin Carnahan was elected to the office of secretary state in 2004 and again in 2008 in which they received the most votes cast for a single candidate in the state's history. Their brother Randy was killed in the same plane crash that took the life of their father. Russ Carnahan received a bachelor's degree and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Missouri. They worked as a private practice attorney prior to entering politics.

Political positions
Crime: In the 2008 Missouri Congressional Political Courage Test, Carnahan supported the use of the death penalty in federal crimes. They also supported strict penalties for internet crime, such as hacking identity theft. However, they also supported programs to provide inmates with job-related skills and job-placement assistance when released. In addition, Carnahan supported programs to provide prison inmates with drug and alcohol addiction treatment. They supported the requirement that crimes based on sexual orientation should be prosecuted as federal hate crimes.
Economy & Jobs: In 2009, Carnahan voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Missouri Republicans criticized Carnahan's vote, noting that passage of the bill resulted in $107 million in federal funding for Lost Creek Wind Farm, an alternative energy facility owned by Russ Carnahan's brother, Tom Carnahan.
Environment & Energy: Carnahan supported the regulation and enforcements of both the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. They supported further development and use of alternative fuels as well as the development of traditional energy resources, such as coal and natural gas. Carnahan also wanted to strengthen emission controls on all gasoline and diesel-powered engines, including cars, trucks, and SUVs. They have supported tax credits to consumers and manufacturers of hybrid vehicles. In addition, they supported international voluntary and mandatory emission targets to limit global warming.
Carnahan has supported the interests of groups trying to protect the environment, such as the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund. Russ Carnahan voted in favor of H.R. 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 also known as the Cap and Trade bill or Waxman/Markey act.
Health: Recently, Carnahan voted against a Health Care and Insurance Law amendment that would prohibit federal funding of abortion services. They support the interests of pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.
Carnahan wants tax credits to be offered to individuals and small businesses to offset the cost of insurance. They also support the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S., and wants to expand prescription drug coverage under Medicare so that more people can be covered. Carnahan would also like child healthcare programs to be expanded so that more children can be covered. Carnahan voted in favor of H.R. 3962: Affordable Health Care for America Act in 2009,
Foreign Policy In January 2010, Carnahan partnered with Republican Congressman Joseph Cao of Louisiana to create the American Engagement Caucus, its stated purpose being the promotion of a multilateral foreign policy in which the United States works closely with other countries to address global problems. As a joint editorial between the two members of congress stated, "We live in an age of interdependence. America's security, economic, environmental, and moral interests are inextricably linked with those of the international community. Simply put, it is in our vital national interest to support international engagement.". They have since introduced multiple other bills related to science diplomacy.
Guns According to the NRA Russ Carnahan was rated with an F rating meaning they agreed with laws or signed in laws that were infringing on gun rights. Robin Carnahan, Russ's sister also has an F rating with the NRA. In 2016 during their run for Lt. Governor, Carnahan said,"I'm a member of the NRA as well as a Democrat. Democrat or Republican, no decision is going to be made to be harmful to the people."
Political campaigns
Carnahan's first campaign for political office was in 1990, when they unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the 8th Congressional District against Republican U.S. Representative Bill Emerson, losing by 14 points, 57% to 43%. Their grandfather had previously represented much of this district's western portion for all but two years from 1947 to 1961.
Prior to challenging Emerson, by their own telling the then-32-year-old Carnahan had already "been active in government and politics for most of my adult life." Carnahan was active in several of their late father's political campaigns, including successful bids for state treasurer (1980) and lieutenant governor (1988), and an unsuccessful race for governor (1984). In January 1980, Carnahan slept for five days on the floor outside the Secretary of State's Office in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, to ensure that their father's name would be first on the ballot for Missouri State Treasurer when filing opened on January 8. Said Carnahan, "A lot of people get football tickets this way. It's going to be a long five days, so I guess we'll get some sleeping bags and a TV in here." And in 1984, when their father ran for state treasurer, Carnahan made stump speeches for them across Missouri. Carnahan also had already worked for Missouri House Speaker Bob F. Griffin, Missouri Secretary of State Jim Kirkpatrick, and Missouri House Majority Leader Tony Ribaudo; had served on the executive committee of the Missouri Democratic Party; and, was the deputy Missouri campaign manager for Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign.
In their race against Emerson, one newspaper remarked "on Carnahan's tactics of deliberate misinformation and distortion of facts" and their "negative and demagogic approach to the 8th District race." The Sikeston Standard-Democrat said, "Democrat Russ Carnahan has brought more mud into a congressional campaign than the days of Bill D. Burlison." According to the Rolla Daily News, "We have already heard enough from Carnahan, whose loose interpretation of Mr. Emerson's record is grossly misleading. Mostly B.S., in other words. Couple that with Carnahan's wild accusations of what Emerson is to be blamed for, and I wouldn't be surprised if Carnahan doesn't soon attribute Missouri's recent fifth-down loss to Colorado to Emerson." Responding to this criticism, Carnahan alleged "that the Sowers family, which publishes the Rolla Daily News, has endorsed Emerson because the member of congress rents district office space from the family." The Southeast Missourian described Carnahan's claim as "amateurish." In the final days of the campaign, "frustrated by ads being run by [Emerson]," Carnahan "lashed back by calling Emerson a 'damn liar.'" Emerson defeated Carnahan, 57% to 43%.
Carnahan considered running against Emerson again in 1994, but ultimately "decided 1994 was not the time." They then moved to St. Louis, where in 2000 they were elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. They narrowly defeated political activist Jeanette Mott Oxford in the Democratic primary election by a scant 64 votes but went on to win the general election by a wide margin. They were reelected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2002.
In 2004, Carnahan ran for the 3rd Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives which was vacated by retiring U.S. Representative and former House Minority Leader and co-founder of the New Democratic Coalition Dick Gephardt. Carnahan narrowly won a crowded primary field of ten Democratic candidates in 2004 with 22.9 percent of the vote, finishing with less than 1,800 votes ahead of their nearest rival, political activist Jeff Smith, who garnered 21.3 percent. In the general election Carnahan faced Republican candidate William J. Federer, an author and Religious Right activist who had previously run against Gephardt on several occasions. The election was somewhat closer than expected. However, St. Louis's strong Democratic tilt (a Republican had not represented this district or its predecessors since 1953) helped Carnahan win with 53 percent of the vote. The district reverted to form in 2006 and Carnahan was reelected with 65 percent of the vote.
2008
2010
Carnahan won re-election over Republican nominee Edward Martin Jr., Constitution Party nominee Nick Ivanovich, and Libertarian nominee Steven Hedrick. Brian Wallner qualified as a write-in candidate.
2012
During their time in Congress, Carnahan represented the southern third of St. Louis City, as well as much of southern St. Louis County and all of Jefferson and Ste. Genevieve counties. However, Missouri was due to lose a district after the 2010 census revealed sluggish population growth in Missouri.
On May 4, 2011, the Missouri Legislature overrode Governor Jay Nixon's veto of the proposed elimination of the 3rd District, by a 109-44 vote in the Missouri House, and 28-6 in the Missouri Senate. The new map merged all of St. Louis, including Carnahan's home, into the 1st District, represented by six-term Democrat Lacy Clay.
Carnahan challenged Clay in the primary for the redrawn 1st on August 7, 2012–the real contest in this heavily Democratic district–and lost by a landslide, 63% to 34%.
Carnahan was mentioned as a possible candidate to fill a vacancy in the 8th District after Rep. Jo Ann Emerson stepped down in 2013.
2016
Carnahan was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. "Many of you have consistently encouraged me to continue serving our state in new ways — especially at a time when so many of our state officials are so very disconnected from the everyday needs and aspirations of Missourians," they wrote. They lost the general election to Republican Mike Parson.

David Kenneth Fasken (23 March 1932 – 24 May 2006) was an English first-class cricketer and business person. Fasken played first-class cricket for several teams between 1953–1962, though they played predominantly for Oxford University. After graduating from the University of Oxford, they became a director for the Earls Court and Olympia exhibition centres, helping them become world leading exhibition venues.
Life, cricket and business career
Fasken was born into a military family at Batu Gajah in British Malaya in March 1932. Their family moved back to England in 1937, where they attended the Dragon School at Oxford, before attending Wellington College. From Wellington they went up to Trinity College, Oxford, where they studied languages. They had debuted for Oxfordshire in minor counties cricket in the 1950 Minor Counties Championship. While studying at Oxford they made their debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Lancashire at Oxford in 1953. They played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1955, making 27 appearances and gaining a blue. Playing as a right-arm medium-fast bowler, they took 58 wickets for the university at an average of 35.94, with best figures of 5 for 108 against the touring Australians in 1953. With the bat they scored 403 runs with a high score of 61. In addition to playing first-class cricket for Oxford University, Fasken also played three matches apiece for the Marylebone Cricket Club from 1956–59, and for the Free Foresters from 1959–62. They also played at first-class level for D. R. Jardine's XI and L. C. Stevens' XI. They played their final minor counties match for Oxfordshire in 1955.
After graduating from Oxford, Fasken decided not to take up a career as a cricketer, stating that "the life" never appealed to him. Instead they took up a career managing exhibition centres, including Earls Court and Olympia, both of which they were Vice-President until their retirement in 1993. During their tenure they helped Olympia to become one of the world's leading exhibition venues. They were also a major factor in the development of Earls Court Two in the late 1980s. When they were 69 they were diagnosed with hydrocephalus, which required several shunts to slow the progression of the condition. They spent four months in hospital with a kidney infection shortly before their death. They returned home for a month, but died on 24 May 2006, following a fall down the stairs at their home. They were survived by their wife Susan of 38 years and their two children Joanna and Hugh and three grand-children.

Ceramic mold casting, also known ambiguously as ceramic molding, is a group of metal casting processes that use ceramics as the mold material. It is a combination of plaster mold casting and investment casting. There are two types of ceramic mold casting: the Shaw process and the Unicast process.
These casting processes are commonly used to make tooling, especially drop forging dies, but also injection molding dies, die casting dies, glass molds, stamping dies, and extrusion dies.
Shaw process
The , also known as the , uses a mixture of refractory aggregate, hydrolyzed ethyl silicate, alcohol, and a gelling agent to create a mold. This slurry mixture is poured into a slightly tapered flask and a reusable pattern (i.e. the item used to create the shape of the mold) is used. The slurry hardens almost immediately to a rubbery state (the consistency of vulcanized rubber). The flask and pattern is then removed. Then a torch is used to ignite the mold, which causes most of the volatiles to burn-off and the formation of ceramic microcrazes (microscopic cracks). These cracks are important, because they allow gases to escape while preventing the metal from flowing through; they also ease thermal expansion and contraction during solidification and shrinkage. After the burn-off, the mold is baked at to remove any remaining volatiles. Prior to pouring metal, the mold is pre-warmed to control shrinkage.
Unicast process
The Unicast process is very similar to the Shaw process, except it does not require the mold to be ignited and then be cured in a furnace. Instead, the mold is partially cured so the pattern can be removed and it is then completely cured by firing it at approximately . If a metal with a low melting point is cast then the firing can be skipped, because the mold has enough strength in the "green state" (un-fired).
Characteristics
The main advantages of ceramic molds are: a reusable pattern (the item used to create the shape of the mold), excellent surface finish, close dimensional tolerances, thin cross-sections, and intricate shapes can be cast. For undercuts and other difficult to cast features, part of the pattern can be made from wax in conjunction with a standard pattern; essentially using investment and ceramic mold casting techniques together. The main disadvantages are: it is only cost effective for small- to medium-sized production runs and the ceramic is not reusable. Ferrous and high-temperature non-ferrous are most commonly cast with these processes; other materials cast include: aluminum, copper, magnesium, titanium, and zinc alloys.
Weight limits are 100 grams to several thousand kilograms (3.5 oz to several tons). Cross-sections as thin as are possible, with no upper limit. Typical tolerances are 0.1 mm for the first 25 mm (0.005 in for the first inch) and 0.003 mm per additional mm (0.003 in per each additional in). A draft of 1° is typically required. The typical surface finish is 2–4 um (75–150 uin) RMS.

Captain John Harvey (9 July 1740 – 30 June 1794) was an officer of the British Royal Navy whose death in the aftermath of the battle of the Glorious First of June where they had commanded terminated a long and highly successful career and made them a celebrity in Britain, a memorial to their memory being raised in Westminster Abbey.
Early career
Born in 1740 at Eastry, Kent, John Harvey was the son of Richard and Elizabeth Harvey née Nichols, local gentry. Entering the Navy in 1754, Harvey began a long family naval tradition, taken up by their brother Henry Harvey a few years later. Their first ship was , a fifty-gun fourth rate in which they stayed for five years into the Seven Years' War. In 1759, promoted to lieutenant with the patronage of Admiral Francis Holburne and distant relation Sir Peircy Brett, Harvey joined the sloop-of-war and frigate , taking shore pay in 1762 at the war's conclusion. The same year they married Judith Wise of Sandwich, Kent and the couple had large family, their sons including several future admirals.
American War of Independence
Between 1766 and 1768, Harvey commanded the sloop off Scotland but following promotion in 1768 they were again forced to take half-pay on shore for the next eight years, until the American War of Independence caused a dramatic increase of the size of the Navy. Briefly commanding the sloop , Harvey was soon promoted once more, making post captain and being given the prime command of , the 60-gun flagship of Admiral Robert Duff at Gibraltar. From 1778 until 1780, Harvey distinguished themselves at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, even commanding there during 1780 in the absence of their senior officer.
In 1780, Panther returned to England and was then attached for a year to Sir Samuel Hood's fleet in the West Indies. Returning to England early in 1782, Harvey was transferred to the new 64-gun ship and in them returned to the Mediterranean, again distinguishing themselves at the relief of Gibraltar and the subsequent Battle of Cape Spartel. At the war's conclusion the following year, Harvey retained their active career due to their excellent records and served in several shore appointments, including regulating captain at Deal and commander of the guardship at Sheerness.
French Revolutionary Wars
With the French Revolution of 1790 making war inevitable, the Navy again expanded and Harvey was subject to special request from Admiral Lord Howe who desired them to command the new and powerful 74-gun ship of the line in the Channel Fleet. The Channel Fleet was not forced to wait long before joining action, Britain going to war in 1793 and a year later becoming embroiled in the battle of the Glorious First of June, an engagement intended to cut off France's grain supply from the young United States. Howe had been chasing the French fleet protecting the convoy for some days, and several short and sharp actions had been fought without conclusion. On 1 June 1794 however, Howe finally gained the wind on the French and overhauled them in a long line of battle.
Glorious First of June
Howe was not planning a regular naval battle of orderly lines and formal engagement but was instead relying on the inexperience of the French revolutionary crews to provide their captains with an opportunity for a large scale victory. Howe ordered their captains to turn towards the French fleet and for each ship in the British line to cut the French line, raking ships either side as they did so before engaging them in close combat and relying on superior British training and firepower to subdue the enemy. These tactics were only partially successful, primarily because the British captains had never been issued such an order before and many refused to enact it as too risky, most simply engaging the French from a distance or making a show of crossing the line before turning in for close engagement too early. Several captains however were aware of the spirit of the order and made efforts to break through the French line. Among these captains was John Harvey.
Brunswick opponent was the 74-gun , a good ship with a disorganised but plentiful crew. Harvey held their nerve and cut the line, but was then undone when Brunswicks anchor became entangled in the French ships rigging. A vicious close range cannon and musket duel ensued, the two ships hidden by smoke as the battle continued elsewhere. Brunswicks master requested permission to cut the anchor free, but Harvey replied "No, as we've got her, we'll keep her." During the engagement which followed, both ships suffered terrible casualties, Brunswick taking 44 dead and 114 wounded. Harvey was themselves hit three times, losing their right hand to a musket ball, being hit on the back by a large wooden splinter and finally having their elbow shattered by a French roundshot.
Seeing their brother's predicament, Henry Harvey, who commanded sailed to their aid and raked Vengeur du Peuple twice, killing dozens of their crew and finally driving the ships apart. Both resembled wrecks, Vengeur du Peuple clearly sinking from the huge holes blasted in their sides. They finally surrendered to and who came up at the close of the battle, but their submission was too late and over 300 of their crew drowned when they suddenly heeled over and sank, the rest being picked up by British boats.
Harvey had refused to quit the deck whilst the action continued but on its conclusion was carried below as the British fleet headed for home, Brunswick reaching Spithead a few days later. Although seven French ships had been sunk or captured, the grain convoy had slipped by and reached France comparatively untouched, leaving the outcome of the campaign unclear. Harvey died of their wounds in Portsmouth on 30 June and was buried in Eastry, a memorial raised to them and Captain John Hutt (who had died of their wounds on the same day), carved by John Bacon is in Westminster Abbey. Two of Harvey's sons, Sir John Harvey and Sir Edward Harvey would later become admirals in their own right.

Ann was launched in America in 1800, possibly under another name. They transferred to the United Kingdom in 1805. Between 1810 and 1813 they became a temporary packet operating out of Falmouth, Cornwall for the Post Office Packet Service. American privateers twice captured them in 1813 in single ship actions.
Career
Ann first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1805.
Packet
The Post Office in 1810 took on Ann as a temporary packet. Them first captain was John Britton, whose appointment date was 6 August 1810.
On 12 January 1811 Ann came into Plymouth. They had been returning from Cadiz when they had had to repel an attack by a French privateer.<ref>"SHIP NEWS". Morning Chronicle (London, England), 15 January 1811; Issue 13006.</ref>Ann, Britton, master, sailed from Falmouth on 9 March and arrived in Bermuda on 16 April. They sailed form Bermuda on 21 April and arrived in New York on 29 April
While Ann was in New York and observed vessels coming from Ireland, Liverpool, and Bristol with passengers, mostly "emigrant mechanics". These men could, 24 hours after arriving, acquire certificates of American citizenship. However, many found it difficult to find work. Many then joined the US Navy. Britton visited they were they identified several who were British, including some who were Cornishmen that had not rejoined their packets in time. Although they believed that they would be glad to desert and come to Ann, they did not take them as they were afraid that the Americans would accuse them of "harbouring their seamen." Two Englishmen did jump from President to swim to Ann; one was believed to have drowned and the other succeeded in reaching them Ann took them aboard and back to England. The seaman testified on their return that they had been a quarter-gunner aboard President for the Little Belt affair. Man further testified that out of Presidents crew of some 500 men, some 300 were English, Scots, or Irish, and that President had fired the first shot in the affair. The man was impressed into , then serving as a guardship at Falmouth.
On 8 June Ann sailed from New York and on the 17th they arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia. They left Halifax on 30 June and arrived back at Falmouth on 21 July.
FateAnn, Captain Peter Hill (acting), sailed from Falmouth on 12 April 1813, bound for the Leeward Islands and Jamaica. The American privateer Yorktown, of 380 tons (bm), 16 guns, and 180 men, captured Ann off the Western Isles on 21 April after an action of two hours. In the engagement Ann had one man killed and three wounded. The Americans kept Captain Hill, the surgeon, and the flight attendant, and put the rest of the crew aboard a "licensed" American vessel, bound for Lisbon. There the packet took them on and brought them back to Falmouth.
On 16 May recaptured Ann near Sandy Hook and sent them to Halifax, Nova Scotia. However, On 23 May 1813 the American privateer Young Teazer again captured Ann. They had a prize crew of a midshipman and some 15 sailors aboard who resisted until they had suffered two men lightly wounded and had their rigging and sails shot up. The action and chase had lasted from 8am to 7pm. Young Teazer sent Ann into Young Teazer''s home port of Portland, Maine.

William Bell (5 September 1931 – 23 July 2002) was a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Canterbury, Auckland and New Zealand from 1949 to 1959.
Bell attended Christchurch Boys' High School. A leg spin and googly bowler and lower-order batsman, Bell had played only five first-class games when they were picked for the New Zealand tour of South Africa in 1953-54 when regular spinner Alex Moir was left out of the touring party. An early return of four wickets against Eastern Province suggested they might do well, but in two Test match appearances, at Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, they took just two wickets, and was never picked again.

Althaea officinalis, the marsh mallow or marshmallow, is a species of flowering plant indigenous to Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, which is used in herbalism and as an ornamental plant. A confection made from the root since ancient Egyptian times evolved into today's marshmallow treat, but most modern marshmallow treats no longer contain any marsh-mallow root.
Description
This herbaceous perennial has stems which die down in the autumn, They typically grow , but can reach and put out only a few lateral branches. The leaves are shortly petioled, roundish, ovate-cordate, long, and about broad, entire or three to five lobed, irregularly toothed at the margin, and thick. They are soft and velvety on both sides, due to a dense covering of stellate hairs. The lilac-pink flowers are shaped like those of the common mallow, but are smaller and of a pale colour, and are either axillary, or in panicles, more often the latter.
The stamens are united into a tube, the anthers, kidney-shaped and one-celled. The flowers are in bloom during August and September, and are followed, as in other species of this order, by the flat, round fruit which are popularly called "cheeses".
The common mallow is frequently called "marsh mallow" in colloquial terms, but the true marsh mallow is distinguished from all the other mallows growing in Great Britain by the numerous divisions of the outer calyx (six to nine cleft), by the hoary down which thickly clothes the stems and foliage, and by the numerous panicles of blush-coloured flowers, paler than the common mallow. The roots are perennial, thick, long and tapering, very tough and pliant, whitish yellow outside, white and fibrous within.
The Latin specific epithet officinalis indicates plants with some culinary or medicinal value.
Phytochemicals
Chemical constituents include altheahexacosanyl lactone (n-hexacos-2-enyl-1,5-olide), 2β-hydroxycalamene (altheacalamene) and altheacoumarin glucoside (5,6-dihydroxycoumarin-5-dodecanoate-6β-D-glucopyranoside), along with the known phytoconstituents lauric acid, β-sitosterol and lanosterol.
Uses
Ornamental
Marshmallows are used in gardening as ornamental plants. Like most herbaceous perennials they require a sunny or partially-shaded position in moist, well-drained soil.
Herbal medicine
The leaves, flowers and the root of A. officinalis (marshmallow) have been used in traditional herbal medicine. This use is reflected in the name of the genus, which comes from the Greek (), meaning "to heal."
Marshmallow is traditionally used as relief for irritation of mucous membranes, including use as a gargle for mouth and throat ulcers and gastric ulcers. In Russia, the root syrup is sold without a prescription by pharmacies, with intent to treat respiratory and digestive ailments.
Culinary
Most of the mallows have been used as food, and are mentioned by early classic writers with this connection. Mallow was an edible vegetable among the Romans; a dish of marsh mallow was one of their delicacies. Prospero Alpini stated in 1592 that a plant of the mallow kind was eaten by the Egyptians. Many of the poorer inhabitants of Syria subsisted for weeks on herbs, of which marshmallow is one of the most common. When boiled first and fried with onions and butter, the roots are said to form a palatable dish, and in times of scarcity consequent upon the failure of the crops, this plant, which grows there in great abundance, is collected heavily as a foodstuff.
The young leaves can be cooked. The flower buds can be pickled. The roots can be peeled, sliced, boiled and sweetened to make candy. Water used to boil any part of the plant can be used as an egg white substitute.
The root extract (halawa extract) is sometimes used as flavoring in the making of a Middle Eastern snack called halva. The later French version of the recipe, called (or for short), included an egg white meringue and was often flavored with rose water. more closely resembles contemporary commercially available marshmallows, which no longer contain Althaea officinalis.

Josef Bucher (born 19 August 1965 in Friesach) is an Austrian politician and former leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) as well as former Member of Parliament for the party. Divorced with two children, Bucher is a hotel owner.
After the death of BZÖ chairperson Jörg Haider, Bucher was elected Klubobmann, chairperson of the party's parliamentary grouping on 22 October 2008.
Initially, Stefan Petzner, Haider's designated successor as party chairperson, was expected to be elected to that post as well. Petzner had to pass the leadership over to former vice-chairperson Herbert Scheiber. Their replacement as party leader was widely interpreted as the result of the rising criticism of Petzner's former media appearances.
Both Petzner and Scheibner were elected two of five vice chairpeople of the party (the other 3 being Stadler the European Parliament future leading candidate of the party, Haider's sister Haubner and former party leader of the BZÖ Westenthaler).
On 26 April 2009 at the party congress in Linz, Bucher was elected as the new leader of the party.
On 30 January 2010 after the secession of the party officials and members from the Carinthian party, Bucher was elected Chairman of the newly formed Carinthian BZÖ.
On 18 April 2012 Josef Bucher stated in further cases of market manipulation and reckless car petrol price increasements by businesspeople in the energy sector prison terms were needed as a stricter penalty against the leading entrepreneurs.
In October 2012 Josef Bucher demanded in parliament for a flat tax with 39% as an income tax quota for all income-earners over €14,793.09 per annum and 10% for all between Geringfügigkeitsgrenze(marginal employment border) and the €14,993.09 threshold per annum)
Josef Bucher stepped down as BZÖ party leader after BZÖ lost all seats in parliament in the 2013 legislative election.

Del Fango Redoubt (), also known as De Vami Redoubt (), was a redoubt in Marsaxlokk, Malta. It was built in 1715–1716 by the Order of Saint John as part of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. An entrenchment was originally located close to the redoubt.
Del Fango Redoubt was part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included three other redoubts, the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, seven batteries and three entrenchments. The nearest fortifications to Del Fango Redoubt were Vendôme Tower to the southwest and Wilġa Battery to the southeast.
Del Fango Redoubt's layout was typical of most other coastal redoubts built in Malta. It consisted of a pentagonal platform with a rectangular blockhouse sealing off the gorge.
Today, both the redoubt and the nearby entrenchment have been demolished, and no remnants can be found.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence Crimean peninsula was reorganized as the Republic of Crimea, after a 1991 referendum with the Crimean government pushing for more independence from Ukraine and closer links with Russia. The referendum ballot carried a following sentence: "Do you support re-establishing the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic as a subject of the Union SSR and a participant of the Union Treaty?" There were also intermittent tensions with Russia over the Soviet Fleet, although a 1997 treaty partitioned the Soviet Black Sea Fleet allowing Russia to continue basing its fleet in Sevastopol with the lease extended in 2010.
Fall of the USSR
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Crimea being a Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic became part of the newly independent Ukraine. In 1990 at first Russia and a month later Ukraine declared State Sovereignty from the Soviet Union with the ongoing discussion for the New Union Treaty. Half a year later a January 1991 referendum in the Crimean Oblast overwhelmingly voted for Crimea to be a participant of the New Union Treaty and to restore autonomy to the region as the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Ukrainian Independence was supported by a referendum later in 1991 in all regions of the Ukrainian SSR, including Crimea (although Crimea's result was considerably less than other districts including those in the Russian speaking east and south of Ukraine).
Republic of Crimea
In 1992 the ASSR was renamed as the Republic of Crimea in the newly independent Ukraine which maintained Crimea's autonomous status, while the Supreme Council of Crimea affirmed the peninsula's "sovereignty" as a part of Ukraine. Based on the resolution of the Verkhovna Rada (the Crimean parliament) on 26 February 1992, the Crimean ASSR was renamed the Republic of Crimea. The Crimean parliament proclaimed self-government on 5 May 1992. and passed the first Crimean constitution together with a declaration of conditional independence on the same day.
There was stiff resistance from Ukraine and a day later, on 6 May, the same parliament inserted a new sentence into this constitution that declared that Crimea was part of Ukraine. A referendum to confirm the decision was not held until 1994 due to the opposition from Kyiv. On 17 December 1992, the office of the Ukrainian presidential representative in Crimea was created, which caused wave of protests a month later.
The Crimean Parliament voted to bring in a President in 1993 which the Kyiv government denounced as unconstitutional. In 1994 Crimea elected the pro-Russian and anti establishment Yuriy Meshkov. They quickly ran into conflicts with the Crimean parliament which was dominated by their opponents. On 8 September, the Crimean parliament degraded the President's powers from the head of state to the head of the executive power only, to which Meshkov responded by disbanding parliament and announcing their control over Crimea four days later.
Throughout this period the city of Sevastopol retained its special status within Ukraine.
Fall of the Republic of Crimea
On 17 March 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament intervened in the political crisis in Crimea, scrapping the Crimean Constitution and removing Meshkov and scrapping the office of President for their actions against the state and promoting integration with Russia. Meshkov was removed from power after Ukrainian special forces had entered their residence, disarmed their bodyguards and put them on a plane to Moscow (Russia). After an interim constitution lasting from 4 April 1996 to 23 December 1998, the constitution that would last until the Russian annexation was put into effect, changing the territory's name from the Republic of Crimea to an Autonomous Republic.
In 1995 after conflicts with the Crimean Parliament Meshkov was deposed by Ukrainian interior ministry troops and replaced by Kyiv-appointed Anatoliy Franchuk, which was done with the intent to rein in Crimean aspirations of autonomy. The Verkhovna Rada, the parliament of Crimea, voted to grant Crimea "extensive home rule" during the dispute. and its status of being subordinate to Kyiv was confirmed eventually by the remaining Crimean authorities. Its name was changed from the Republic of Crimea to the Autonomous Republic. After an interim constitution lasting from 4 April 1996 to 23 December 1998, the current constitution was put into effect.
On 19 May, Crimea agreed to remain as part of Ukraine and annulled their proclamation of self-government. By 30 June, Crimean Communists forced the Kyiv government to expand on the already extensive autonomous status of Crimea. In the same period, Russian president Boris Yeltsin and Ukraine's Leonid Kravchuk agreed to divide the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet between newly formed Russian and Ukrainian Navies.
Black Sea Fleet
This new situation led to tensions between Russia and Ukraine. With the Black Sea Fleet based on the peninsula, worries of armed skirmishes were occasionally raised. In August 1991, Yuriy Meshkov established the Republican Movement of Crimea which was registered on 19 November.
On 15 January 1993, Kravchuk and Yeltsin in the meeting in Moscow appointed Eduard Baltin as the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. At the same time the Union of the Ukrainian Naval Officers protested the Russian intervention into the Ukrainian internal affairs. Soon after that there were more anti-Ukrainian protests led by the Meshkov's party, the Voters for the Crimean Republic, Yedinstvo, and the Union of Communists that demanded to turn Sevastopol under the Russian jurisdiction and followed by the interview given by the Sevastopol's Communist, Vasyl Parkhomenko, who said that the city's Communists request to recognize the Russian as the state language and restoration of the Soviet Union. On 19 March 1993, the Crimean deputy and the member of the National Salvation Front, Alexander Kruglov, threatened the members of the Crimean Ukrainian Congress not allow into the building of the Republican Council. A couple of days after that, Russia established an information center in Sevastopol. In April 1993, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence submitted an appeal to Verkhovna Rada to suspend the Yalta Agreement of 1992 that divided the Black Sea Fleet that was followed by the request from the Ukrainian Republican Party to recognize the Fleet either fully Ukrainian or a fleet of a foreign country in Ukraine. Also over 300 Russian legislators called the planned Congress of Ukrainian Residents a political provocation.
In 1994, the legal status of Crimea as part of Ukraine was backed up by Russia, who pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine in a memorandum signed in 1994, also signed by the US and UK.
Following the ratification of the May 1997 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership on friendship and division of the Black Sea Fleet, international tensions slowly eased off. With the treaty, Moscow recognized Ukraine's borders and territorial integrity, and accepted Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea and Sevastopol. In a separate agreement, Russia was to receive 80 percent of the Black Sea Fleet and use of the military facilities in Sevastopol on a 20-year lease. Both the Ukrainian Naval Forces and Russia's Black Sea Fleet were to be headquartered in Sevastopol. Ukraine extended Russia's lease of the naval facilities under the 2010 Kharkiv Pact in exchange for further discounted natural gas.
However, other controversies between Ukraine and Russia still remain, including the ownership of a lighthouse on Cape Sarych. Because the Russian Navy controlled 77 geographical objects on the south Crimean Shore, the Sevastopol Government Court ordered the vacating of the objects, which the Russian military did not carry out. Since August 3, 2005, the lighthouse has been controlled by the Russian Army. Through the years, there have been various attempts to return Cape Sarych to Ukrainian territory, all of which were unsuccessful.
Chaos in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) during a debate over the extension of the lease on a Russian naval base erupted on 27 April 2010 after Ukraine's parliament ratified the treaty that extends Russia's lease on a military wharf and shore installations in the Crimean port Sevastopol until 2042. The Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Lytvyn had to be shielded by umbrellas as they were pelted with eggs, while smoke bombs exploded and politicians brawled. Along with the Verkhovna Rada the treaty was ratified by the Russian State Duma as well.
Repatriation of the Tartars
On 2 September 1991, the National Movement of Crimean Tatars appealed to the V Extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies in Russia demanding the program how to return the deported Tatar population back to Crimea.
On 14 October 1993, at the same time it established the post of President of Crimea, the Crimean parliament agreed on a quota of Crimean Tatar representation in the Council to 14. The head of the Russian People's Council in Sevastopol, Alexander Kruglov, called it excessive. The chairperson of the Tatar Mejlis, Mustafa Dzhemilev, used words "categorically against" in regards to the proposed election for Crimean president on 16 January. They stated that there cannot be two presidents in a single state. On 6 November, the Crimean Tatar leader, Yuriy Osmanov was murdered. A series of terrorist actions rocked the peninsula in the winter; among them were the arson of the Mejlis apartment, the shooting of a Ukrainian official, several hooligan attacks on Meshkov, the bomb explosion in the house of a local parliamentary, the assassination attempt on a Communist presidential candidate, and others. On 2 January 1994, the Mejlis announced a boycott of the presidential elections, which were later canceled. The boycott itself was later taken on by other Crimean Tatar organizations. On 11 January, the Mejlis announced their representative, Mykola Bahrov, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, as the presidential candidate. On 12 January, some other candidates accused Bahrov of severe methods of agitation. At the same time, Vladimir Zhirinovsky called on the people of Crimea to vote for the Russian Sergei Shuvainikov.
Putin era tension
In 2006, protests broke out on the peninsula after U.S. Marines arrived at the Crimean city of Feodosiya to take part in the Sea Breeze 2006 Ukraine-NATO military exercise. Protesters greeted the marines with barricades and slogans bearing "Occupiers go home!" and a couple of days later, the Crimean parliament declared Crimea a "NATO-free territory." After several days of protest, the U.S. Marines withdrew from the peninsula.
In September 2008, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ohryzko accused Russia of giving out Russian passports to the population in the Crimea and described it as a "real problem" given Russia's declared policy of military intervention abroad to protect Russian citizens.
During a press conference in Moscow on 16 February 2009, the Mayor of Sevastopol Serhiy Kunitsyn claimed (citing recent polls) that the population of Crimea is opposed to the idea of becoming a part of Russia.
Although western newspapers like the Wall Street Journal have speculated about a Russian coup in Sevastopol or another Crimean city in connection with the Russian-Georgian war and the Recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia. Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, acting head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), stated on 17 February 2009, that they are confident that any "Ossetian scenario" is impossible in Crimea. The SBU had started criminal proceedings against the pro-Russian association "People's front Sevastopol-Crimea-Russia" in January 2009.
On the 55th anniversary of the transfer of the Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR (on 19 February 2009) some 300 to 500 people took part in rallies to protest against the transfer.
On 24 August 2009, anti-Ukrainian demonstrations were held in Crimea by ethnic Russian residents. Sergei Tsekov, a senior pro Russian politician, said then that they hoped that Russia would endorse Crimeaan separatism in the same way as it had done in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The last election of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea took place on 31 October 2010 and was won by the Party of Regions. On 15 March 2014, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine officially dissolved the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea, and, on 17 March 2014, one day before the Russian annexation of Crimea, the State Council of Crimea was established in place of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea.
Before 2014, Crimea could be considered a part of the political base of then President Viktor Yanukovych. Thus, in the period just prior to 2014, Crimea was not experiencing intense mobilization against Ukraine or on behalf of absorption into Russia.

United Nations Security Council resolution 508, adopted unanimously on 5 June 1982, after recalling previous resolutions including 425 (1978), 426 (1978) and 501 (1982), demanded an end of foreign hostilities taking place on Lebanese territory between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel. Israel stressed that they were upset that resolution 508 did not mention or suggest that the Palestine Liberation Organization were to blame for the attack on the Israeli ambassador.
The resolution went on to call for a ceasefire by 0600 local time on 6 June 1982, so that 490 (1981) can be respected. It also requested the Secretary-General to undertake all possible efforts to ensure the implementation of and compliance with this resolution and to report to the council as early as possible and not later than forty-eight hours after the adoption of this resolution.

The mangrove snapper or gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) is a species of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean Sea. The species can be found in a wide variety of habitats, including brackish and fresh waters. It is commercially important, as well as being sought as a game fish. It can also be found in the aquarium trade.
Description
Its color is typically greyish red, but it can change color from bright red to copper red. It has a dark stripe running across its eye if observed from the top when it is underwater. This species can reach a length of , though most do not exceed . The greatest recorded weight for this species is .
The mangrove snapper can be confused with the cubera snapper or black snapper, L. cyanopterus. Mangrove snapper are typically much smaller than cubera, but when they are of similar size, the two species can only be distinguished by examining the tooth patch on the inside roof of the mouth. Many specimens caught in Florida, specifically Punta Gorda, are actually misidentified dogtooth or dog snapper, L. jocu. The best way to distinguish between the two species is the dog snapper has a lighter triangle of color with a blue band under the eye and large, and sharp fangs in the front (canines), hence its common name. These fangs can deliver a painful bite, even in a small fish. The mangrove snapper feeds mostly on small fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods and gastropods. It was also observed as systematically waiting under maternal colony of buffy flower bat for falling bats near the entrances of Lucayan cavern, Bahamas.
Habitat
The mangrove snapper is one of the most common species of snapper in warmer regions. It can be found in many areas from canals to grass flats, as well as in open water. Mangrove snapper also prefer structure, such as docks, mangroves, shipwrecks, and debris. Most mangrove snapper in the open water are generally found near bottom structure or reefs. They can be found at depths from though are mostly found at less than .
Sport fishing
Mangrove snapper are common targets for anglers, and are highly prized for their light and flaky flesh. They can be found year around and are often found in the mangroves, and around docks or other structures. They are easy to catch, which makes fishing for them ideal for beginner anglers. In addition, they are usually found in schools, so catching many in a short period of time is not uncommon. They are relatively strong for their size, and they put up a good fight when hooked. They can be caught on a variety of baits, but are typically caught with live or frozen shrimp, squid, pilchards, mullet, ballyhoo, pinfish, and occasionally on artificial lures or baits. They can be spearfished, as well, but are sometimes a tough target, as they tend to be more wary of divers, rather than curious, and their wariness of baits and divers tends to increase as the fish grow larger. Most mangrove snapper are caught on light to medium tackle, and typical catches range from 8 to 14 in long (0.5-2.0 lbs) in shallow or in-shore waters, and up to 20 in long (about 5 lb) in deeper waters. Larger fish are uncommon, but not rare.
Farming
Farmed in offshore floating fish farms in Asia and Oceania, one example is the floating fish farms off Pulau Ubin Island Singapore, and along the south west side along the Singapore strait. Farmed for consumption, sold to restaurants and supermarkets in Singapore and around the world.

The Greater Vancouver Food Bank is a Canadian registered charity located in Vancouver, BC. Their mission is to create empowering environments that provide and promote access to healthy food, education and training.
History
The Greater Vancouver Food Bank (GVFB) was established in 1983 when organizations, church groups and concerned citizens joined together in response to the hunger crisis during the economic recession in 1981. The original purpose of the GVFB was to be a temporary social service provider. However, because the number of those at risk of hunger has continued to increase, the GVFB has become one of the most important non-government funded food assistance providers in Canada. In 1982, the GVFB assisted 200 people.
Internal Programs
Community Food Hubs
The Greater Vancouver Food Bank serves Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster and the North Shore. The GVFB provides direct support to clients at 4 distribution locations each week in addition to partnering with 119 agencies to assist with sharing food with those in need.

Route description
Wyoming Highway 318 begins at Wyoming Highway 270 in the small Town of Hartville. WYO 318 travels east as Hartville's Main Street for a mile till it reaches the old mining town of Sunrise at 1.09 miles. Upon reaching the former town, WYO 318 ends at a road closed sign as the mine property is gated. The Sunrise Mine operated until 1980 and produced 42,457,187 tons of iron ore
History
The section of present-day Wyoming Highway 270 from US 26 at Guernsey north to Hartville at present-day Wyoming Highway 318 was formerly designated as Wyoming Highway 318 prior to the 1970s. Highway 318 used to begin as US 26 at Guernsey and end at Sunrise with a 90-degree turn at Hartville.

Cistern is an orchestral album by Sacramento-born musician, composer and arranger Jherek Bischoff. It was released by The Leaf Label and Brassland on 15 July 2016.
Background
Bischoff began composing and recording Cistern in an empty two million gallon underground water tanks under Fort Worden in Port Townsend, Washington. The size of the space was a huge factor in the development of the album. In an interview Bischoff described how "the vast emptiness of the cistern generates a reverb decay that lasts 45 seconds. That means, if you snap your fingers, the sound lasts 45 seconds. That amount of reverberation is an absolutely wild environment to try to create music in." This led to "a record intrinsically linked to the space in which it was conceived. A space which forced Bischoff to slow down, to reflect, to draw on their childhood growing up on a sailing boat - an unexpected journey of rediscovery, from the city back to the Pacific Ocean".
After initial experimentations and recording within the water tank, Bischoff moved the process to Future-Past Studio in Hudson, New York where they recorded with Contemporaneous Ensemble. One of the main reasons for this was the "
lack of adequate oxygen" for a large group of people inside the water tank.
The title track from Cistern premiered on 3 May 2016 on Stereogum, who described it as "triumphantly building orchestral piece with a truly fascinating backstory" and "an incredibly majestic piece of work".

The Clinton House is an 18th-century Georgian stone building in the city of Poughkeepsie, Dutchess County, New York, United States. It is a New York State Historic Site and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic place of local significance since 1982. The house was named for George Clinton, who served as the first Governor of New York and fourth Vice-President of the United States. They were believed to have lived there after the American Revolutionary War, but it is now known that it was never their residence.
The house probably served as a meeting place for legislators during the time Poughkeepsie was capital of New York in 1777.
Clinton House was built around 1765 by Clear Everitt, who was sheriff of the county from 1754 to 1761, on land that had belonged to Hugh van Kleeck (born about 1745, died after 1810) who owned about 20 hectares of land south of Main Street where the house stands. (The Van Kleeck House built in 1702 was demolished in 1836.) In 1780, the house was purchased by Udney Hay, who belonged to Quartermaster Corp of the Continental Army. In 1783, the house was destroyed by fire and Hay rented the nearby Glebe House. When their house was damaged by fire, Hay petitioned George Washington for craftsmen from the army to assist in its repair. However, Hay lost the house in 1786 when it was seized for debt.
In 1900, the house had fallen into disrepair and it was purchased by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who presented it to the then Governor of New York Theodore Roosevelt for the citizens of the State of New York.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
Today, the Clinton house is used for the offices and library of the Dutchess County Historical Society, with one room still set aside for use by the Mahwenawasigh Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The British Humanities Index is a database published by ProQuest that indexes journals, magazines, and newspapers published in Great Britain and other English-speaking countries. The Oxford guide to library research described it as a "particularly good British source," stating that it had "headings of its own devising." It covers more than 400 periodicals beginning in 1962. Walford stated in 1985 that "BHI's title is something of a misnomer, since its c375 titles indexed include some 68 social science periodicals, plus a sprinkling of Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand titles." A guide for scientific researchers advised "don't let the [BHI's] title put you off using this index; it has some excellent references to general scientific articles."

Winnifred Herrold, aged 89, after suffering a fall and being admitted to a retirement home, on 2 October 1978 contacted their solicitor at the law firm of Sheffield, Young & Ellis (later to merge with Chapman Tripp) to draw up a new will to leave the bulk of their estate to Jack Gartside. The solicitor visited them at their resthome on 5 October and took their instructions to draw up the new will.
However, Herrold died on 12 October, without their solicitor getting them to sign the new will. This resulted in Gartside getting nothing from the estate, as the estate was given to their sister under a previous will. Gartside claimed the lawyers were negligent, whilst the lawyers said they did not owe a duty of care to a mere beneficiary. Gartside sued the five partners of the law firm, who were able to get their claim struck out by the High Court of New Zealand. They appealed.
Held
The Court of Appeal of New Zealand reinstated their claim, saying they did owe a duty of care to a beneficiary.

Materialise NV, headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, is a company in the 3D printing / additive manufacturing sector.
History
1990s
Materialise was founded in June 1990 by Wilfried Vancraen and their wife Hilde Ingelaere as a Rapid Prototyping service bureau. It was the first company of its kind in the Benelux region of Europe, through the acquisition of a single Stereolithography machine (the SLA 1).
In 1992, Materialise began mapping human anatomy digitally in three dimensions, using sliced CT image data, which lead to the development of its medical image processing software: Mimics. Concurrently, the team was also developing its industrial software solution, Magics. Both of these software solutions were later commercialized to promote growth.
1995 was the year that Materialise became the first company to produce 3D printed parts in more than one colour, specifically at this time for anatomical models produced using the stereolithography process to delineate the complexities of the anatomy (such as nerves, blood vessels and tumours) and allow surgeons to more precisely plan for operations.
The company developed and produced the first customised 3D printed surgical guide for a dental operation in 1996. These personalised guides were utilised during surgery to show surgeons bone cutting and drilling locations to apply implants. This knowledge was used to develop Materialise SimPlant software, allowing the surgeon to virtually plan the surgery and minimize invasive exploratory surgery.
The company launched one of the first 3D printing online ordering systems in 1997, Materialise NextDay, which later became Materialise OnSite. This service allowed 3D printing service customers to send digital 3D data, which could be printed and shipped the next day.
Demand for prototypes grew, leading Materialise to develop its Mammoth Stereolithography systems, which are capable of printing single-piece models with dimensions of more than 2 meters in the Y axis.
2000s
The year 2000, hearing aid specialist Phonak approached Materialise to develop the Rapid Shell Modeling (RSM) software. This allowed the design process for customized, patient-specific hearing aid shells to become automated. The resulting designs could then be 3D printed to produce the customised hearing aids. This was the first high volume, end-use application of 3D printing, and today, 99% of the world's hearing aids are now produced using 3D printing.
Materialise acquired US company Columbia Scientific Inc, (CSI) in 2001, the creators of Sim/Plant and ImageMaster, which became the US headquarters for Materialise's dental division in that region.
In 2003 Materialise launched one of the first 3D printed consumer brands — .MGX by Materialise — for 3D printing end-use products as well as prototypes. In parallel, the company also acquired Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) systems for industrial applications.
The following year, in 2004, Materialise introduced its 3-matic software, allowing 3D printer users to edit files directly in the STL format. Previously, if design changes were required in the digital model, designers had to make them in the CAD suite of choice before re-converting the entire file to STL again.
In 2006 Materialise launched RapidFit, developed as a 3D printed solution for shipping large parts with customized jigs and fixtures to prevent deformation or breakage while in transit.
In 2006 Materialise developed the first Titanium 3D printed skull implants, following the acquisition of OBL, which specialized in the creation of custom cranio-maxillfacial (CMF) implants, producing customized implants with intricate porous structures, that behave like natural bone and mimic its mechanical and thermal properties.
In 2008 Materialise introduced the e-Stage software which was the first software to automatically generate support structures for different geometries in Stereolitography. In the same year, the company launched i.materialise for the consumer market, making it possible for anyone to print their ideas using professional-quality equipment. Materialise also developed its first Build Processor to support running different 3D printing processes more efficiently within a single location.
2010s
In 2012, Materialise introduced Streamics to provide traceable quality control to industrial 3D printer users producing end-use parts within regulated industries.
Materialise went public on June 25, 2014 to enable expansion of its services and software development. The same year the company acquired OrthoView, a market leader in orthopaedic digital pre-operative planning software and officially established a new office in China in December with a focus on 3D printing Software and R&D, namely Materialise Shanghai Co. Ltd.
In 2016, the company opened a new and dedicated metal production facility in Bremen, Germany. Materialise HQ, Leuven, also acquired and started testing the multi jet fusion (MJF) process from HP. Production of parts with MJF started in the following year, 2017.
With the expansion of the AM Metal market, Materialise acquired ACTech in Germany to extend the company's metal capabilities, with a specific emphasis on low-volume production of highly complex metal parts. The acquisition also enabled Materialise to develop and improve its software suite for metal 3D printing.

Upper Telemark () is a Norwegian region comprising the inland of the traditional district Telemark in Vestfold og Telemark county. More than two thirds of the total area of Telemark, or above 10,000 square kilometres, belong to the traditional region of Upper Telemark. Conversely, Lower Telemark refers to the more densely populated, flatter coastal area of Grenland and traditionally also includes Central Telemark. Upper Telemark has a varied and often scenic landscape, with many hills, mountains, valleys and lakes.
Upper Telemark was originally known simply as Telemark and is named for the Thelir (Old Norse: Þilir), the ancient North Germanic tribe that inhabited what is now called Upper Telemark and Numedal in the Migration Period and the Viking Age. Upper Telemark is known for its folk traditions within music, clothing, handcrafts, food and architecture. The region is also distinctly marked by its dialect of Norwegian.
The district is also conventionally divided into Vest-Telemark and Aust-Telemark, with Vest-Telemark consisting of Vinje, Tokke, Seljord, Fyresdal, Kviteseid, Nissedal, and Aust-Telemark consisting of Hjartdal, Notodden and Tinn.
Whereas Lower Telemark was traditionally dominated by the burghers of the cities, Upper Telemark was for centuries dominated by a close-knit "aristocracy of officials" comprised by a handful of families which monopolized the state and church offices in the region, notably the families Paus, Blom, Ørn and Morland.
Etymology
The Old Norse form of the name was Þelamörk or Þilamörk. The first element; Þilir was the name of the inhabitants, and is assumed to be connected with Þelli (pine). The last element mörk means forest or march.
History
Administrative history
Traditionally, the term Telemark only referred to this area and Numedal. In 1200, the current Upper Telemark and Grenland were merged into Skiens syssel, which later became Bratsbergs amt, and is the current county of Telemark. Upper Telemark comprises a provostship in the state Church of Norway, Upper Telemark provostship (), which now comprises 12 municipalities and more than 80% of Telemark (more than 12,000 square kilometres), making it one of the largest provostships in Norway. The provostship has existed since the middle ages, but was partitioned in two in 1838, before being reunified in 2015. Upper Telemark has also been a judicial district (sorenskriveri).
The border between Upper Telemark and Grenland has long been discussed among philologists. In an old travel book about the county, A.L. Coll has written that the border is defined by the mountainous cleft, that is formed by the lakes Bolkesjø, Ørvella, Øverbø-moen, Seljordvatnet, Flåvatn and Fjågesund or Bjårvatn.

"Ex-Old Man" is a song recorded by American country music artist Kristen Kelly. It was released in April 2012 as Kelly's first single. Kelly wrote the song with Paul Overstreet.
Critical reception
Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song two and a half stars out of five, writing that "the plucky, mid-tempo cut showcases their big country voice, but seems written too long after the fact." Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a favorable review, saying that "the melody recalls classic hits of the distant past but it also has a sunny disposition to it as well." Ben Foster of Country Universe gave the song a B+ grade, writing that "it's a refreshing change of pace to hear a new artist taking a back-to-basics approach – revisiting a classic yet often ignored country music theme, with a simple drum and acoustic guitar-driven arrangement that actually makes the song feel like country music."
Music video
The music video was directed by Anna Mastro and premiered in August 2012.
Chart performance
"Ex-Old Man" debuted at number 60 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of March 24, 2012.

White Light Riot was an American indie rock group based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Members included brothers Mike Schwandt (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Mark Schwandt (drums), Dan Larsen (bass), Randy Tomes (keyboards) and Zack Caroll (guitar). White Light Riot is sometimes abbreviated as WLR.
History
In early 2005, brothers Mike and Mark Schwandt formed the band. During their junior year in high school at Robbinsdale Armstrong High School, Mike was studying abroad in England and Mark took on the task of finding additional band members. They recruited Dan Larsen, a bassist in their jazz band and invited another classmate, guitarist Joe Christenson to join the ensemble.
White Light Riot was formerly named ‘The Evening Glow' but changed their name almost immediately.
Early Years
In late 2005, White Light Riot released their first EP “The Dark Is Light Enough”, produced by Erik Appelwick (Tapes 'n Tapes) on October 30, 2005. In early 2010, "Bitter Beginning" and "Out of Sight" were featured in the Destineer Games title Triple Crown Snowboarding for Nintendo Wii.
Atomism
In 2006, the band signed with 50 Records, a Minneapolis-based independent record label. “Atomism," the sole album they released on 50 Records, was recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, MN; produced/co-engineered by Brent Sigmeth (Grant Hart, They Might Be Giants, Ramblin' Jack Elliott), co-engineered by Paul Marino (The New Congress, Desdemona) and mastered by Bob Ludwig. It was released nationally on August 21, 2007 by RED Distribution. The CD release party was held on June 23, 2007 at the Fine Line Music Café in Minneapolis, MN.
In 2007, they were hired for a benefit show that raised $15,000.
In 2009 lead singer Mike Schwandt posted on the band's Myspace and Facebook Pages that they ended their contract with 50 Records. Schwandt explains we "finally broke free from their grasp.". Around this time, guitarist Joe Christenson left the group and was replaced by Zack Carroll, who previously played with This World Fair and Catchpenny.
In January 2010, the song "Forever in the West" was featured on the season finale of the VH1 program Secrets of Aspen.
In 2012 they did a reunion show in Minneapolis.
Self-Titled LP
After parting ways with their record label, the band spent 2010 recording their self-titled follow-up album with Paul Marino at Urness Hall at St. Olaf College, Fuzzy Slippers Studio, and The Terrarium. The album was released on May 2, 2011.

USS Sabot (SP-213) was the proposed name and designation of a motorboat the United States Navy acquired for service as a patrol vessel in World War I but never commissioned or otherwise placed in service.
Sabot was built as a civilian motorboat of the same name by the Great Lakes Boat Company at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was owned by Mr. M. T. Clark of Winnetka, Illinois. The Navy took possession of them on 8 June 1917 for use on section patrol during World War I and assigned them the section patrol boat number SP-213 but never placed them in service.
Sabot was returned to their owner and stricken from the Navy List on 17 September 1917.

Lidy Creek (also known as Leidys Creek or Lidy's Creek) is a tributary of Mill Creek in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through Pittston Township and Dupont. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It is a Coldwater Fishery and is not impaired. The creek is in the vicinity of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport and the International Trade Zone Industrial Park.
Course
Lidy Creek begins on a hill in Pittston Township. It flows north-northwest for a short distance before turning northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Interstate 476 and entering Dupont. It then turns west-northwest before turning west-southwest. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns west-northwest and crosses Interstate 81. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Mill Creek.
Lidy Creek joins Mill Creek upstream of its mouth.
Hydrology
Lidy Creek is not considered to be impaired. However, it loses some water to mine pools, as does the nearby Collins Creek. The borough of Dupont has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek.
Geography and geology
The elevation near the mouth of Lidy Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is between above sea level.
The headwaters of Lidy Creek are on a ridge above the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. The creek also flows through the International Trade Zone Industrial Park.
Watershed and biology
The watershed of Lidy Creek has an area of . The watershed is in the southwestern part of the Lackawanna River watershed. It occupies parts of Pittston Township and Dupont. The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Avoca. It is one of the two major tributaries of Mill Creek.
Lidy Creek is considered to be a Coldwater Fishery. The habitats in the upper reaches of the creek's watershed are "high quality" and mountainous (as is the case with Collins Creek).
History
Lidy Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179320. The creek is also known as Leidys Creek. This name has appeared on county highway maps published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
Bank restoration work on Lidy Creek was planned in 2009. Future runway expansions of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport may lead to the relocation of the creek.

David Lloyd Hemp (born 8 November 1970) is a former Bermudian cricketer.  They are a left-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler, who has played domestic cricket for Glamorgan, Free State, and Warwickshire. David has a younger brother, Tim, who has previously played for Glamorgan's second eleven, and who appeared for Wales Minor Counties in the NatWest Trophy. David Hemp has also played List A and Twenty20 cricket.  They are currently Head coach of Pakistan Women Cricket Team. They attended Millfield School.
County cricket
Hemp first appeared for Glamorgan in 1991, and was part of the Glamorgan side which won the 1993 Sunday League championship. They followed this up in 1994/95 when they went on a tour with the England A team to India and Bangladesh. The following season, they made a career high 157, before joining Warwickshire in 1997. They quickly made it into the top order, and played there consistently until they made a return to Glamorgan in 2002.
Having set a record for Glamorgan with a 251 second-wicket partnership, they also played in the match against Kent at Canterbury which won Glamorgan the Norwich Union League.
On 12 September 2006, they assumed the captaincy of Glamorgan with immediate effect after the resignation of Robert Croft. At the end of the 2008 season, they were released by the club.
International cricket
In November 2006, Hemp made their debut for Bermuda, the country of their birth, in an ICC Intercontinental Cup game against Kenya. They went on to represent them in all games on their African tour, including seven One Day Internationals against Kenya, Canada and the Netherlands. The undoubted highlight of this tour was the Intercontinental Cup match against the Netherlands, in which Hemp scored an unbeaten 247, their highest first-class innings. At the time, this was the highest score in the history of the competition, but the record stood only until the Netherlands' next match, when Ryan ten Doeschate scored 259 not out.
Their current top ODI score came during the qualifiers for the 2011 World Cup, as they hit 102 not out during Bermuda's loss to Kenya. Their previous best, 76 not out against India at the 2007 World Cup, was the first-ever fifty scored by a Bermuda player in the World Cup. As Bermuda has not since returned to the tournament, it remains the highest score made by a Bermuda player in the World Cup, and they remain the country's highest aggregate run-scorer in the tournament.
Coaching career
In October 2020, they appointed as head coach of the Pakistan women's national cricket team.

That Funny Feeling is a 1965 American romantic comedy film directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Sandra Dee, Bobby Darin, and Donald O'Connor.
This was the third film pairing of Dee and then-husband Darin, following 1961's Come September and 1962's If a Man Answers. It was the second film that O'Connor and Kathleen Freeman (who played a lady waiting to use a telephone booth) made together, the first being Singin' in the Rain.
Plot
Joan Howell intends to be an actor, but for now she's working as a maid.
On three different occasions, they and Tom Milford - a successful publishing executive, and womanizer - accidentally bump into each other. The third time, Tom asks them for a date.
Ashamed of their own modest home, which they share with their aspiring-actor friend Audrey, Joan invites them to the lavish apartment of one of their clients - whom they believe is out of town for a couple of weeks - pretending it's hers. What they don't know, because they and their employer have never met, is that the apartment is Tom's.
He's shocked to find themselves being welcomed to their own place. To see how far Joan's prepared to go, Tom moves in with their pal Harvey - who has their own concerns about Joan to do with their acrimonious divorce and property he's 'hiding' from their wife at Tom's place - and goes along with their ruse. As soon as Joan becomes aware of the truth, however, they get even by inviting all Tom's previous conquests, dressed as prostitutes, to a party which the cops promptly raid.
In the police van on the way to the station, Tom proposes to Joan and Audrey flirts with a receptive Harvey.

Flying Turns is the name of a specific model of bobsled roller coaster. John Norman Bartlett, a British aviator in World War I, came to North America after the war with an idea for a trackless wooden chute, full of twists like a bobsled course, with toboggan-like cars, based on a bobsled ride that operated in Europe. They had filed GB Patent 279109A for the idea in 1926. Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, and they commenced building the new ride. When the ride went into production, much of the idea was the same, but the cars looks more like monoplanes, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, braking system and incline.
Both the bobsled coaster and the flying turns coaster are buildable in the RollerCoaster Tycoon and Thrillville series of video games.

Knytt Underground is a 2D adventure game in the exploration subgenre similar to Metroidvania games, with elements of arcade platformers, combining the mechanics of the developer's previous games, Knytt and Within a Deep Forest. It was developed by Swedish programmer Nicklas Nygren and released in late 2012, with the PlayStation platforms PS3 and Vita seeing the first launch. The game offers two playable characters, nonlinear gameplay, multiple endings, and a large number of side-quests and secrets.
Gameplay
Knytt Underground's gameplay fuses the mechanics of Nifflas' earlier games. From Knytt it borrows the freedom to climb vertical walls as well as being able to safely fall from any height (barring hazards like lava and acid, but unlike Knytt water is not hazardous). From Within a Deep Forest it incorporates the ability to transform into a bouncing ball. However, there is only one ball "material" and different abilities must be gained by flowers that bestow temporary power-ups which are only usable in Sprite form, a new feature introduced in Underground.
There are no hostile characters or antagonists in the story except for robots that follow a preset behavior and are confined to the room they spawn in. The player may interact with various NPCs and receive quests from them. Some characters may become traveling companions and influence certain events. The player also has an inventory system for items which are used for trading, completing tasks or gaining access to certain areas.
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the surface has been rendered uninhabitable. Humans no longer exist and the surviving creatures all live underground, although remnants of human technology are commonplace. There are different factions within the subterranean world such as the mystical Myriadists and a group called the Internet dedicated to salvaging human artifacts.
The main world is divided into 47 rooms across by 29 rooms down, for a total of at least 1,363 rooms. However, there are many secret areas that exist off the in-game map, leading to over 1,800 total locations in all. Each region of the world has a distinct visual theme and some areas are analogous to the levels in Within a Deep Forest. Shortcuts for quickly traveling across large distances can be found via an alternative dimension called "the Disorder".
Plot
The player controls Mi Sprocket, a "sprite" who sets out to make a wish at the Fairy Springs, but due to their inability to speak, they are misunderstood by everyone and unwillingly recruited into a mission to save the world. Two of the fairies decide to accompany her; Cilia the Moon Fairy and Dora the Sun Fairy. They provide the majority of the dialogue within the game and each has their individual temperament, often in contrast to each other. Mi has to choose which fairy to send to speak on their behalf when initiating conversations with NPCs, and they can influence which quests the player is able to take and may even affect the outcome of those quests.
Mi's primary goal involves ringing the Six Bells of Fate, a task which falls upon a member of the Sprocket family every six hundred years and is required by prophecy to prevent the destruction of the world. There are numerous side quests as well and most may be completed in multiple ways, awarding the player with different achievements and endings. Underground often breaks the fourth wall, with the developer themselves making appearances as an NPC and various characters making remarks on common video-game clichés, including the apparent pointlessness of the main quest.
Development
In July 2012, Nifflas announced that they were working on Knytt Underground, and that it is their biggest game yet. It was released on the PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 and PS Vita in late December 2012, and the console versions include extra content. The game was released on Steam on October 25, 2013. A Wii U version of the game was confirmed in August 2013, and was being ported by Nygren's colleague Mathias Kærlev. The game was released on December 19, 2013 in both North America and Europe. Underground was Nifflas' biggest project at the time of its release, encompassing the biggest world and the most characters, sub-quests and secrets of any of their games thus far.
Soundtrack
Besides Nifflas' own songs, Knytt Underground includes music by D Fast, David Kanaga, Fredrik Häthén, LPChip, Jonas Mattebo, Stephen Ascher, Void Pointer, and Yann Van Der Cruyssen. The soundtrack is available as a free download.

Shabla ( ) is a town and seaside resort in northeastern Bulgaria, administrative centre of the Shabla Municipality part of Dobrich Province. Shabla municipality includes the following villages: Bojanovo, Chernomortsi, Durankulak, Ezerets, Gorichane, Gorun, Granichar, Krapets, Prolez, Smin, Staevtsi, Tvarditsa, Tyulenovo, Vaklino and Zahari Stoyanovo. As of December 2009, the town itself had a population of 3,586 inhabitants. It is situated on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast in the vicinity of the salt-water Lake Shabla and Bulgaria's easternmost point, Cape Shabla.
Shabla has an extensive white sand beach and was a popular destination for Eastern Bloc tourism until the fall of Communism. The beach itself is located some 5 km from the town (shuttle service in summer) via a road constructed under the EU Phare programme
On the main town beach there is a large car park and many old bungalows next to a large restaurant that serves today's tourists in the summer months. The beaches, and generally the seaside in the municipality, are famous for the untouched nature and virgin beaches.
Another route leads you to the coastal road and past Shabla's lighthouse which is the tallest, oldest and easternmost one on the Bulgarian coast. Set among the ruins of the 4th-century fortress, it was built in its modern appearance during the Crimean War and opened on 15 July 1856, though it is in fact a reconstructed older lighthouse built between 1756 and 1786. Its tower is 28.23 m-tall.
The next village along this route and moving South is Tyulenovo and the start of the rocky coast and high cliffs that stretch through Kamen Bryag to the small bay of Kavarna.
Shabla in antiquity was an ancient Thracian settlement founded 6th-5th century BC and known by the Greek name of Karon Limen (Carian Bay) that grew into a Black Sea port in Roman times. The town flourished in the early years of the Byzantine Empire, a fortress still being preserved from the period (4th century). During Ottoman rule it was known as Karamanly
History
Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic
According to the mayor of the city, the oldest technologically advanced gold in the world was discovered near him, preceding by five hundred years the major finds from the Varna Chalcolithic necropolis. Prehistoric settlements conventionally called Shabla I and Shabla II, synchronous with the durankulak, were discovered and explored in 1974 by Prof. Henrieta Todorova in the New Vineyards area, east of the present town between the Shabla Tuzla and Shabla Lake sites. Their inhabitants maintained relations with the population living in the south along the Black Sea coast.
Ancient Caria
In ancient times, the Thracian tribe of the Gethites inhabited these places, the area being part of the Odrisian kingdom. Numerous Thracian tombstones rise in the vicinity and bear witness to this era. Ancient Thracian settlement from the 6th-5th centuries BC, which grew at the end of the 2nd century BC. in a port city, it was discovered near the present-day Kariya fishing village on Cape Shabla. The port city of Caria in the bay south of Cape Shabla is identified with the ancient "Portus Karia (Port Caria) / Καρών Λιμένα (Karon Limen)" - the Port of Karate and was the most important transit port in the VI-V century. BC. to the 6th century AD. - Ancient Thracian Korea 1100 years providing the way through the Thracian Chersonesos (Bosphorus) to the mouth of the Danube and Pantikapei (Crimea), turned into a fortress by the Romans, last reconstructed in the IV century during the early Byzantine era. It is evidenced by Arian, the Anonymous Periplus of the Black Sea, and the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela in their work "Geography" in the middle of the 1st century AD, indicating that it is located between Kalatis (today Mangalia) and Tristis (Kaliakra). at Shabla's nose. Ever since then, the Cape has been an important navigation landmark along the west coast of the Euxine Pont. A "fire watch" was maintained here, and in Roman times a tower with constant fire. This is confirmed by the divers found on the seabed by divers to the northeast of the present headlamp columns and a stylized cuckoo head made of marble. The findings from the excavations are stored in the museum in Dobrich and in the House of Culture in the city. Given the meaning of the word "Portus / Limen", it can be assumed that the ancient port of Cape Shabla was artificially created. According to Karel Shkorpil, it was a rectangular basin, 280 m long and 120 m wide, bordered on the north, east and south by three stone breakwaters, in the middle of which there was one entrance. Modern underwater studies have specified the plan of the ancient port - it consisted of two parts: the first - a relatively shallow pool of approximately 400/150 m, surrounded by north and east reefs, which in their present form successfully fulfill the role of natural breakwater, which is almost identical to that described by Karel Shkorpil ancient harbor and second part - a deeper bay, located just south of the basin. Old descriptions of the Cape Shabla area mention that the reefs were once overlooked by an artificial construction, which refers to the Thracian facility precisely to the Limen category, the existence of which is confirmed in the Caron Limen toponym itself. According to Arian, "the land around the Port of Kari is called Karia." Looking at the vast and relatively low coastal terrace located west of the ancient port, much of which is occupied with the remains of the said vast settlement and its necropolises. This clarifies that Caria is not an abstract geographical concept, but a specific place name, representing the ancient name of the Thracian coastal settlement, and Caron Limen being the name of its port. The entire nose area of about 25 hectares is littered with archeological monuments. Although the coastline today is different from that of antiquity, the accidental finds, terrain crawls, excavations carried out in 1976 - 1979, and underwater surveys in 1962,1979 and 1980 undoubtedly confirmed the existence of this site in the Chronicles described as significantly antique. settlement. The antique fort, located on the very head, just south of the Shabla lighthouse, is well researched. The preserved part of the fort is 12 x 60 m in size. The western part of the northern fort wall was studied from the outside and face in 1978–79. It is almost 2 m thick; preserved altitude 1.80 m. Through the 1995-96 drilling, archaeological excavations revealed the route of the western fortress wall and partially explored the southwestern tower. The site has been declared a cultural monument by letter No 4267 / 23.12.1985 from the National Research Institute. A flooded settlement of the Bronze Age, an ancient necropolis, ancient remains of boats made only with wooden assemblies and a few medieval wrecks were fixed underwater opposite the Shabla Tuzla.
The Antarctic Peninsula Peak is named after the ancient Caria.
Middle Ages and Modernity
In the early Middle Ages, the area devastated by the barbarian invasions was populated by the Bulgarians and Slavs, and since the founding of the Bulgarian state was part of it. After the failure of Vladislav Varnenchik's crusade against the Turks in 1444, Ottoman domination was fully established there. During the Middle Ages, ivory ships passed by the shores of Shabla. Many of them are swallowed up by the waves, and to this day it happens that the greatest lucky ones find elephant tusks thrown from the water. The legend tells of the British ship "Black Prince" sunk by Shabla during the Crimean War, loaded with gold for the army.
The origin of the present name of the settlement, according to the version, is related to the Proto-Bulgarian word "saber" (scoop). In the middle of the 19th century Shabla is the largest Bulgarian village in the region and its mayor is Bulgarian. Residents actively participate in the struggle for an independent Bulgarian church, education and national freedom. In the personal notebook of Hristo Botev when forming their company was recorded Nikola Alexov from Shabla.
After the liberation from Ottoman rule, Shabla became the center of the municipality. Pride for them is the gold medal won by Dimitar Anastasov, who won the First Bulgarian Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition in Plovdiv in 1892. In 1900, a rural revolt broke out in Durankulak and Shabla against the introduction of new taxes (a dozen). From August 1913 to September 1916 and from November 1919 to September 1940, the area was occupied by Romania. After the liberation on September 7, 1940, hundreds of families deported from the Romanian authorities from the native Bulgarian population of Northern Dobrudzha settled here.
Around the Shabla lighthouse was the only oil field in Bulgaria, hot mineral water with high sulfur content is flowing from many drilling operations today.
Until 1964 Shabla was a village, until 1969 a town of urban type, on 27.08.1969 was proclaimed a city.

The Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS) is located in the village of Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia.
History
COGS traces its history to 1948 when the Nova Scotia Land Survey Institute (NSLSI) was established by Major J.A.H. Church (retired) as a training institution for survey and map production. NSLSI became a world leader in geomatics education during the 1970s and 1980s as it evolved into incorporating then-revolutionary technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). The institute moved into its current campus during this period in the 1970s.
In 1986, NSLSI was renamed the College of Geographic Sciences (COGS) as a publicly funded training college under an act of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The name was considered to better reflect the diversity of geographic sciences taught at the NSLSI.
In 1988, the provincial government undertook a much-needed reform to its training colleges and created the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) system the following year. While still a separate college, COGS was administratively placed within the NSCC umbrella.
In 1998 NSCC created the Annapolis Valley Campus by administratively combining the geographically separate campuses at Lawrencetown and Middleton. All geomatics advanced diploma programs were grouped under the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), of which the majority are delivered at the Lawrencetown site (as the former Lawrencetown campus is now called).
Organization
COGS is divided into three departments:
Geomatics
Information Technology
Applied Geomatics Research Group (AGRG)
Programs
COGS offers 1-year advanced diploma programs in the following disciplines (a Bachelor's degree or higher in any discipline from a recognized University is required, although a Bachelor's in geography or computer science is a common background for many students):
Advanced Diploma in Geographic Sciences (GIS concentration)
Advanced Diploma in Geographic Sciences (Remote Sensing concentration)
Advanced Diploma in Geographic Sciences (GIS for Business concentration)
Marine Geomatics (a 2-year diploma from COGS may also be acceptable, depending on marks)
COGS also offers 2-year diploma programs in the following disciplines (graduation from high school is a pre-requisite):
Diploma in Geographic Sciences (Cartography concentration)
Diploma in Geographic Sciences (Planning concentration)
Diploma in Geographic Sciences (GIS concentration)
Diploma in Geographic Sciences (Remote Sensing concentration)
Geomatics Engineering Technology (2-year program when combined with the COGS Survey Technician Certificate program)
Diploma in Information Technology (Systems Management/Networking concentration)
Diploma in Information Technology (Database Application Programming concentration)
COGS also offers a joint M.Sc. with Acadia University through the Master's of Science in Applied Geomatics. A slightly different arrangement is maintained through the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Acadia where the department accepts a COGS diploma in lieu of two graduate level Geology courses at the university.
The first graduate of the M.Sc in Applied Geomatics was Koreen Millard.

Eurinye County, Queensland
is one of the 318 counties of Queensland, Australia. It is within the North Gregory District.
The county came into existence in the 19th century, and on 8 March 1901, the Governor of Queensland issued a proclamation legally dividing Queensland into counties under the Land Act 1897.
Like all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles. From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.
The entire county is incorporated, with the seat of local government in Charters Towers, Queensland
Climate
The county
has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), with distinct seasons. Summers are hot and often rainy, whereas winters are mild and dry with low humidity.
The county is on the traditional lands of the Karanja people, and is at a Elevation of 90 m.

Il Corbaccio, or "The Crow", is an Italian literary work by Giovanni Boccaccio, traditionally dated c. 1355.
Plot
The work is narrated in the first person and opens with a justification (it is not a real prologue) in which the author declares that they wish their narrative to be a consolation to those who read it, such as they found thanks to God and the intercession of Our Lady.
The protagonist, desperate because of the unreturned love of a widow, calls on Death, falls asleep and dreams. In their dream appears a man who declares themselves to be the deceased husband of the widow, who says they have come, sent by God and through the intercession of Our Lady, to free them from the labyrinth of love into which they have fallen.
The protagonist tells the story of their love to the spirit, who warns them against women who, with their lust, endanger men.
The spirit then begins to tell them of their own experiences with the woman, drawing attention to all of their shortcomings. After hearing the story told by the spirit, the protagonist declares themselves convinced and says that they want to remedy their mistake. The spirit therefore invites them to revenge themselves by using their skills as a writer to "unmask" the true nature of women. Still in the dream, the protagonist promises to do so and when they wake up, in their room they find themselves healed of their troubles. The author concludes their work by warning the young against "female wickedness".
Background
Boccaccio is most famous as the author of The Decameron (completed c. 1351–2), another work of ambiguous interpretation regarding the dolce stil novo and the antifeminist counterargument. Regarding Il Corbaccio, whether the novel's theme of misogyny is a detailed study of the attitude or a direct misogynistic expression of the author has long been a subject of debate.
Scholars who consider the text to be autobiographical base their interpretation on connecting aspects of the text to events in the author's life. The opposing view accepts the author's own reference to the work as a "trattato", or a philosophical treatment. As stated by scholar Anthony K. Cassell, "the formal elements of the treatise are part of a wide artistic tradition and contest autobiographical intention and interpretation". The work is regarded by some scholars as late medieval in character, others as early renaissance.

The Pyongyang Touch () is a line of smartphone, with its first version launched in North Korea in 2014 and likely produced by the Chinese company Uniscope. It is named after the capital of the country, Pyongyang. Not much is known about the technical data, but the phone is believed to run a modified version of Android. Externally, it resembles the iPhone 3G and is available in white, pink, and blue. Since access to the Internet is denied to a large part of the population in North Korea, there is only access to the Intranet Kwangmyong. It is particularly popular among the younger population, according to Choson Sinbo.

The Mixed 2 x 2 x 400 metres relay at the 2019 IAAF World Relays was held at the Yokohama International Stadium on 11 May. It was the first time that this event was held at the IAAF World Relays or indeed any senior level major international competition. Each team had to comprise one man and one woman, who would each run twice, but could be lined up in any order.
Summary
This event mimics high-intensity interval training. The athletes each have to run a high intensity 400 metres, followed by another high intensity 400 metres, only allowing enough rest time for their partner to run around the track once.
Given the option to put men or women first in the order, Kenya and Papaua New Guinea put their men up first, both charging out to an early lead, with Papaua New Guinea's Daniel Paul trying to mark Kenya's Collins Kipruto. Down the final straight, Kipruto opened up a 15-metre lead before the handoff. 30 metres further back, the USA's Ce'Aira Brown had a narrow lead over Belarussian Marina Arzamasova and Australia's Catriona Bisset. With the huge lead and no interference, Kenya's Eglay Nafuna Nalyanya tripped as they took the baton. By the time Donavan Brazier took the USA's baton, Nalyanya was already halfway around the first turn. Over the course of their lap, they led the group of men backs to within 2 metres of the Kenyan lead by the handoff, all of them swallowing Papaua's Donna Koniel in the process. Kipruto was bouncing up and down waiting to run again, Brown more sedate in their preparation. Once they had the batons in hand again, Brown stayed with Kipruto through the first turn, separating from the other women by 10 metres through the first turn. Kipruto began to separate down the backstretch, coming off the final turn, Brown had a debt to pay for their early speed. Ayano Shiomi from the home team of Japan and Bisset came back to pass her, half a straightaway behind Kipruto. Australia's Josh Ralph took the baton with a 5-metre lead over Brazier. Brazier took care of that in the first turn and was off into no man's land chasing a tired Nalyanya still 30 metres ahead. By the final turn, it was obvious the lead was not enough; led by Brazier, three men were coming fast. Brazier passed Nalyanya before the straightaway, but Ralph was 2 metres behind them and Japan's Allon Tatsunami Clay was just another two metres back. This was still a race. Brazier persevered; Ralph couldn't gain ground and lost a little to Clay toward the end as the USA, Australia and Japan took the medals. After the race was over, Kenya was disqualified because when Nalyanya tripped they stepped momentarily outside the curb to catch them balance.

M-96 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that runs between Kalamazoo and Marshall. Its termini are both on business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94); the eastern one coincides with an intersection with I-69. Between Kalamazoo and Marshall it passes through Comstock, Galesburg, Augusta, and Battle Creek intersecting I-194/M-66 in Battle Creek and I-94 in Emmett Township.
The highway now known as M-96 was originally part of M-17. Parts of M-17 that were not used for US Highway 12 (US 12) in 1926 were given the M-96 number. Additional segments of trunkline were added to M-96, one of which was an Alternate US 12 in the years afterwards. Later, US 12 was moved after the completion of I-94 in southern Michigan. Additionally US 12 segments were added to M-96 at that time. The last major changes to M-96 rerouted the highway through the Battle Creek area in late 1998.
Route description
M-96 starts at an intersection between King Highway and Business Spur I-94 (BS I-94) east of downtown Kalamazoo. From this point, it follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a suburban residential area. The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock and north of Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland. It turns eastward again, skirting the Fort Custer State Recreation Area and the Fort Custer National Cemetery. In Augusta, M-96 turns to follow Dickman Road to Battle Creek, passing north and east of the W. K. Kellogg Airport on Dickman and Helmer roads.
On the north side of the airport, M-96 runs concurrently with both Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) and M-37. M-96 turns south on Helmer Road, separating from the other two trunklines, and then turns east crossing along Columbia Avenue. Here the highway runs along the edge of the city of Battle Creek through more residential areas and crosses the I-194/M-66 freeway next to the Riverside County Club. Near Brownlee Park, M-96 (Columbia Avenue) merges with BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). Together BL I-94/M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue to I-94 where BL I-94 ends. M-96 passes the FireKeepers Casino Hotel, which is located just east of the ending of BL I-94, between 11 and 12 Mile Roads. M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue through farmland from Emmett to Marshall ending at an interchange with I-69/BL I-94.
M-96 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-96 were the 22,953 vehicles daily between Capitol Avenue and I-194 in Battle Creek; the lowest counts were the 5,167 vehicles per day at the western terminus in Kalamazoo. The only section of M-96 that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS), is in the Battle Creek area between the western BL I-94/M-37 junction and the I-94 interchange. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.
History
M-96 was formed as a state trunkline in late 1926 from parts of M-17. The section of M-17 between Galesberg and Battle Creek was not utilized for US 12 and became M-96. In 1936, the Alternate US 12 trunkline was designated through the Battle Creek area along a section of highway that had previously been part of US 12. This highway was added to M-96 three years later in 1939.
A rerouting of trunklines in 1941 lead to the creation of a Business US 12 (Bus. US 12). M-96 ran concurrently with Bus. US 12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US 12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US 12 routing to end in Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and Bus. US 12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US 12 freeway was completed in the area. Bus. US 12 was redesignated as BL I-94 in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961.
M-89 was extended along the roadway used by M-96 west of Battle Creek to M-37 in 1965, truncating M-96 in the process. M-96 was reextended back to Battle Creek along Dickman Road and Fort Custer Highway from Augusta east in 1971. Several changes in Battle Creek were made to the area trunklines in 1998. M-96 was extended along BL I-94 (Dickman Road) to M-37 (Helmer Road) and along M-37 to Columbia Avenue. At Columbia, M-96 then turned west and M-37 turned east. M-96 rejoined BL I-94 along Michigan Avenue to I-94 and on to Marshall.

Talbina is a porridge made from barley flour, formed by adding milk and honey to the dried barley powder. The name comes from the Arabic word laban meaning yogurt (fermented churned milk), because of its resemblance to yogurt, as it is soft and white.
Nutrition
Barley is a good source of insoluble and soluble dietary fiber. The soluble fiber portion contains the richest source of beta-glucans compared to any other grain; these can aid immune function. Barley also contains B vitamins, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and copper, and is one of the richest sources of chromium, which is important in maintaining blood glucose levels. Barley is also rich in antioxidants and contains a high concentration of tocols and tocotrienols, oils that help reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease. Barley has been cited as a possible food to increase tryptophan, and thus serotonin in the body.
Cultural significance
Ibn Sina, in their 11th century work The Canon of Medicine, wrote of the healing effects of barley water, soup and broth for fevers. Additionally, barley can be roasted and turned into roasted barley tea, a popular Asian drink.

Bodh Gaya is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar. It is famous as it is the place where Gautama Buddha is said to have attained Enlightenment () under what became known as the Bodhi Tree. Since antiquity, Bodh Gaya has remained the object of pilgrimage and veneration both for Hindus and Buddhists. In particular, archaeological finds including sculptures show that the site was in use by Buddhists since the Mauryan period.
For Buddhists, Bodh Gaya is the most important of the main four pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha, the other three being Kushinagar, Lumbini, and Sarnath. In 2002, Mahabodhi Temple, located in Bodh Gaya, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
History
Bodh Gaya is considered to be the holiest site in Buddhism. Known as Uruwela in the Buddha's time, it is situated by the bank of Lilajan River. The first temple at the site was built by King Ashoka.
Traditionally, Buddha was born in 563 BC on the following auspicious Baisakhi purnima. As Siddhartha, they renounced their family at the age of 29 in 534 BC, and travelled and meditated in search of truth. After practicing self-mortification for six years at Urubela (Buddhagaya) in Gaya, they gave up that practice because it did not give them Vimukthi. Then they discovered Noble Eight-fold path without help from anyone and practiced it, then they attained Buddhatva or enlightenment. Enlightenment is a state of being completely free from lust (raga), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). By gaining enlightenment, you enter Nirvana, in which the final stage is Parinirvana.
At this place, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had been their companions of earlier austerities. All they saw was an ordinary man; they mocked their well-nourished appearance. "Here comes the mendicant Gautama," they said, "who has turned away from asceticism.  They are certainly not worth our respect." When they reminded them of their former vows, the Buddha replied, "Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the Middle Way." This is the path which is neither easy (a rich prince) nor hard (living in austere conditions practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics became the Buddha's first disciples in Deer Park, Sarnath, 13 kms north east of Benares.
The disciples of Gautama Siddhartha began to visit the place during the full moon in the month of Vaisakh (April–May), as per the Hindu calendar. Over time, the place became known as Bodh Gaya, the day of enlightenment as Buddha Purnima, and the tree as the Bodhi Tree.
The history of Bodh Gaya is documented by many inscriptions and pilgrimage accounts. Foremost among these are the accounts of the Chinese pilgrims Faxian in the 5th century and Xuanzang in the 7th century. The area was at the heart of a Buddhist civilization for centuries, until it was conquered by Turkic armies in the 13th century.
The place-name, Bodh Gaya, did not come into use until the 18th century CE. Historically, it was known as Uruvela, Sambodhi (Saṃ+bodhi, "Complete Enlightenment" in Ashoka's Major Rock Edict No.8), Vajrasana (the "Diamond Throne" of the Buddha) or Mahabodhi ("Great Enlightenment"). The main monastery of Bodh Gaya used to be called the Bodhimanda-vihāra (Pali). Now it is called the Mahabodhi Temple.
During the period from the 11th to 13th centuries, Bodh Gaya was under the control of local chieftains known as the Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya who were responsible for the management of the region. One of their rulers, Acarya Buddhasena, was noted as making a grant to Sri Lankan monks near the Mahabodhi temple.
Mahabodhi Temple
The complex, located about 110 kilometres from Patna, at ,
contains the Mahabodhi Temple with the Vajrasana or "diamond throne" and the holy Bodhi tree. This tree was originally a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka, itself grown from a what is claimed to be a sapling of the original Bodhi tree.
In approximately 250 BCE, about 200 years after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, Emperor Asoka visited Bodh Gaya in order to establish a monastery and shrine on the holy site.
Representations of this early temple are found at Sanchi, on the toraṇas of Stūpa I, dating from around 25 BCE, and on a relief carving from the stupa railing at Bhārhut, from the early Shunga period (c. 185–c. 73 BCE).
Other Buddhist temples
Kittisirimegha of Sri Lanka, a contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sanghārāma near the Mahabodhi Temple, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by Xuanzang (Beal, op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded them to come to Ceylon.
Several Buddhist temples and monasteries have been built by the people of Bhutan, Mongolia, China, Japan, Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Sikkim, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tibet and Vietnam in a wide area around the Mahabodhi Temple. These buildings reflect the architectural style, exterior and interior decoration of their respective countries. The statue of Buddha in the Chinese temple is 200 years old and was brought from China. Japan's Nippon temple is shaped like a pagoda. The Myanmar (Burmese) temple is also pagoda shaped and is reminiscent of Bagan. The Thai temple has a typical sloping, curved roof covered with golden tiles. Inside, the temple holds a massive bronze statue of Buddha. Next to the Thai temple is 25-metre statue of Buddha located within a garden which has existed there for over 100 years.
Sujata Stupa
Across the Phalgu river is the Sujata Stupa, in the village of Bakraur. The stupa was dedicated to the milkmaid Sujata, who is said to have fed Gautama Buddha milk and rice as they were sitting under a Banyan tree, ending their seven years of fasting and asceticism, and allowing them to attain illumination through the Middle Way. The stupa was built in the 2nd century BCE as confirmed by finds of black polished wares and punch-marked coins in the attending monastery.
The Great Buddha Statue
The Great Buddha Statue also known as 80 feet statue is in Bodhgaya. The unveiling and consecration of the Great Buddha Statue took place on 18 November 1989. The consecration ceremony was attended by the 14th Dalai Lama, who blessed the 25-meter statue, the first great Buddha ever built in the history of India. The Statue is now a symbol of the holy place Bodhgaya, next to Mahabodhi Temple which is a World Heritage site, and enjoys constant visits of pilgrims from all over the world. Among local people, it is nicknamed "the 80-foot (25-meter) Buddha Statue."
Under the slogan "Spread Buddha's rays to the Whole World," Daijokyo spent seven years on construction of the Great Buddha Statue, mobilizing 120,000 masons in total.
Mahabodhi Temple bombings
On 7 July 2013, at around 05:15, a low intensity bomb blast took place in the 2500-year-old Mahabodhi Temple complex. This was followed by a series of nine low intensity blasts which resulted in two monks being injured; one was Tibetan and the other Burmese. These blasts were carried out by an Islamic terrorist organization called Indian Mujahideen. Two other bombs, one under the 80-foot statue of the Buddha and the other near Karmapa Temple were defused by the police.
On 1 June 2018, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court of Patna sentenced five suspects in the case to life imprisonment.
Demographics
As per the 2001 census, Bodh Gaya had a population of 30,883. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Bodh Gaya has an average literacy rate of 51%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 63% and female literacy of 38%. 8% of the population is under 6 years of age.
Transportation
Buses have been introduced by the BSTDC between Patna and Bodh Gaya via Rajgir.
A special caravan service called Wonder on Wheel, between Patna and Bodh Gaya, has been introduced by the Bihar Tourism Department.
Gaya Airport is situated from Bodh Gaya and approximately from Gaya Junction railway station.
Bodhgaya has restricted the use of auto rickshaws, cars and buses to make the pilgrimage site more peaceful. A permit is required for the use of cars and buses, and the only taxi available is an electric rickshaw that is mostly noiseless.

Ramsgate railway station serves the town of Ramsgate in Thanet in Kent, England, and is at least 10 minutes' walk from the town centre. The station lies on the Chatham Main Line, down the line from , the Kent coastline, and the Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line. The station is managed by Southeastern, which operates all trains serving it.
Architecture
Ramsgate railway station is a 1920s brick-built station thought to have been designed by James Robb Scott and Edwin Maxwell Fry, and built between 1924 and 1926. Margate station and the demolished Dumpton Park station are of a similar design. The building is Grade II listed.
Services and facilities
All services at Ramsgate are operated by Southeastern using , and EMUs.
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
1 tph to London St Pancras International via
1 tph to London St Pancras International via and
1 tph to London St Pancras International via and
1 tph to via Chatham
1 tph to London Victoria via Canterbury West and
1 tph to
During the peak hours, the station is also served by trains to London Charing Cross and London Cannon Street via .
The station's facilities include waiting rooms, toilets, cafe, a ticket office (2 windows) and a ticket machine.
History
Trains first reached Ramsgate in April 1846 when the South Eastern Railway (SER) opened a line from Canterbury. It terminated at Ramsgate SER, later to be called Ramsgate Town, which, unlike the present-day station, was in the town centre. Later the same year the line opened across Thanet to Margate, to Margate SER (later Margate Sands). Trains from Canterbury to Margate had to reverse at Ramsgate Town; a chord was built bypassing the station, but not often used. St Lawrence station was opened in 1864 just before this chord, but closed in 1916.
The London Chatham & Dover Railway (LCDR) reached Margate from Herne Bay in 1863. This called at Margate LC&DR (later Margate West), East Margate (later Margate East), Broadstairs, and via a 1630 yd tunnel terminated at Ramsgate LC&DR (later Ramsgate Harbour), near the harbour and beach.
This arrangement was inherited by Southern Railway on grouping in 1923. In 1926 a new line was opened connecting the SER line from east of Ramsgate Town to the LCDR line just south of Broadstairs. The current Ramsgate station and a new station at Dumpton Park were built on this new line. The Ramsgate Harbour station, line through the tunnel, and the Ramsgate Town station and old SER line across to Margate Sands were all closed in July 1926. This change made for operational convenience, but has the disadvantage that the town centre is no longer served.
Motive power depot
The SER opened a motive power depot near Ramsgate Station in April 1846. This was closed by the Southern Railway in 1926 and replaced by a larger facility in 1930. This closed to steam locomotives in 1959 and was converted for use servicing electric multiple units introduced by the Southern Region following the British Railways Kent Coast Electrification.
The depot () was modernised in 2007 and opened in late 2008.

The High Voltage Tour was the fourth concert tour of Mexican recording artist Thalía. This tour promoted their 2004 album The Greatest Hits. It marks their debut in the United States with a concert series and also passed through three cities of Mexico.
Background
The High Voltage Tour marks the first concert tour of Thalía in the United States, and it was released in promotion of their 2004 album The Greatest Hits, which gathers the singer the greatest hits, from the beginning of their long labor relationship with the record company EMI Music in 1994.
The Hershey Company, United States' bigger chocolate factory, was the sponsor of High Voltage concerts, and the production was in charge of Clear Channel Entertainment and Televisa Music Promotion.
Thalía had commented in more than an occasion that their concert would be an entire show, with wardrobe, robotic lights, choreographies and other stuffs. But far from phenomenal productions like the most important world shows conceived by great artist of international fame as Madonna, Britney Spears, or Shakira, High Voltage Tour was a quite small, simple and basic show as for its stage and scene conception.
Concert synopsis
During the concerts, queerly Thalía also interpreted songs of their first albums as solo artist, as well as songs of their time with the Mexican Pop teen band Timbiriche, although that songs are not very popular between the general public, inclusive the North American audience and other non Hispanic-speaker audiences.
As for the artistic talent that accompanied Thalía along the tour, the concerts had 2 backing-vocals, 12 dancers, and 5 band members. Thalia had 15 costume changes during the concert.

Notes

In the North American leg of the tour, the rapper Fat Joe joined Thalía to interpret to sing the song "I Want You" together.
The Guadalajara concert had problems with the lighting. For a moment faded all the lights. The sound system of Thalía didn't arrive on time. A confetti rain fell on the audience but these they lit up fire when they were reached by the pyrotechnic effects.
In the Mexico City concert, during the song "Arrasando", Thalía broke their pants.
At the New York City concert, the celebrities that they rumored was present are Francis Lawrence, besides Tommy Mottola.
During the performance of these concerts, Thalía was accused of not singing totally live, and to use to the playback in several occasions.
It was also notorious the low sale of tickets for their concerts in certain performances in Mexico and United States, what questioned their convocation power as for audiences' attendance, since none of the tour concerts was sold out, fact that determined the non continuity of the tour toward other regions.
Another of the critics carried out Thalía with regard to High Voltage, they were linked to the few dates that were part of the tour schedule, what caused the anger and the disillusion of their fans in other parts of the world.
Thalia Notes
In the rehearsal, I realized that half of my lighting and sound systems had not arrived but rather it had been blocked in customs. So, we made what we could, and with more anger and desires than never, we prepare an incredible concert in the Plaza de Toros. The venue was full of audience, an impressive and full energy people.
Without a doubt, to sing in the Auditorio Nacional was one of the concerts that more turns in my head during the last years. The night before the concert I could not sleep for all the opposing feelings-love, nerves and happiness. So, the day of the show we commend ourselves to God, so that we presented the best show ever and it was this way. The show in the Auditorio Nacional will never forget it, since the venue was to explode with all my people. For my surprise, they were present Diego Shoening and Mariana Garza, former partners of Timbiriche, and I invited them to the stage to sing with me the song «No se si es amor». Also were present my family and many of my partners of the show business. It was a perfect show that has filled from pride and happiness to the whole High Voltage crew.

Camer Country Park is in Meopham, in Kent, England. It is a former estate landscape, with grassland and woodland.
History
This park was originally the country estate of the Smith-Masters family. It was one of the largest estates in Meopham, where there had been a farmstead in the area since the 13th century. The estate reached its peak size in the 18th and 19th centuries under the Smith-Masters.
The family included William Smith-Masters, an English cricketer, who died in Meopham on 27 August 1937. The last known resident was Kate (or Catherine) Smith-Masters. Them son George Smith then inherited the estate. They kept the house but sold the rest of the estate, and it was bought in 1967 by the Strood Rural District Council, for the sum of £9,750.
The council converted the estate into a Country Park.
It was opened in the early 1970s by Kent County Council, who still manages it.
The Smith-Masters estate house (a Grade II listed building) was built in 1716. It still exists in private hands and can be seen from the park.
Walking in the park
Visitors to the park can choose to either wander at ease admiring the variety of original trees of the mature parkland or go on one of the series of walks devised by Meopham Footpaths Group through the adjoining woodland of the park. Camer Park covers more than of ancient parkland and woods, it is listed as an Area of Outstanding Beauty.
The book A Year of Walks, Kent has an walk starting in the park car park and leading through the estate to Meopham, Harvel, Luddesdown, Cobham and back to the park.
Common lizards (such as lacerta vivipara) and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) can be found in the park.

Spring on Leper's Island () is a 1940 Japanese drama film directed by Shirō Toyoda. It is based on the memoir of Masako Ogawa, a Japanese doctor who specialised in leprosy treatment, and is noted by film historians for its humanist and compassionate theme in contrast to the militarist national film policy at the time.
Plot
Mrs. Koyama, a young female doctor working at the Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium, travels the islands of the Seto Inland Sea to talk leprosy patients into moving to the sanatorium where they can be treated and live together with other people affected by the disease. Many patients and their relatives are reluctant to the move; while family father Yokogawa is still trying to work to support their wife and children, others are hiding in their family's homes or in deserted shacks. In the end, Yokogawa gives in to the doctor's advice and follows them to the sanatorium. Their saddened and angered son Kenzo watches their departure by boat from the island's harbour.

Historical background
Spring on Leper's Island was compliant with Japan's public health policy and its Leprosy Prevention Laws (last widened in 1931), which saw the increasing segregation of leprosy patients from their communities, a growing number of sanatoria where they were hospitalised, and the launching of the No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture (muraiken undō) campaign which Ogawa advocated. The film received a recommendation by Japan's Ministry Of Education.

Gandersheim Abbey () is a former house of secular canonesses (Frauenstift) in the present town of Bad Gandersheim in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was founded in 852 by Duke Liudolf of Saxony, progenitor of the Liudolfing or Ottonian dynasty, whose rich endowments ensured its stability and prosperity.
The "Imperial free secular foundation of Gandersheim" (Kaiserlich freies weltliches Reichsstift Gandersheim), as it was officially known from the 13th century to its dissolution in 1810, was a community of the unmarried daughters of the high nobility, leading a godly life but not under monastic vows, which is the meaning of the word "secular" in the title.
Church
In the collegiate church the original Romanesque church building is still visible, with Gothic extensions. It is a cruciform basilica with two towers on the westwork, consisting of a flat-roofed nave and two vaulted side-aisles. The transept has a square crossing with more or less square arms, with a square choir to the east. Beneath the crossing choir is a hall-crypt. The westwork consist of two towers and a connecting two-storey block; it originally had in addition a projecting entrance hall, also on two storeys, the "paradise". The present church building, which has been subject to restoration in the 19th and 20th centuries, was begun in about 1100 and dedicated in 1168. Remains of the previous building are incorporated into the present structure.
History
Foundation
Gandersheim Abbey was a proprietary foundation by Duke Liudolf of Saxony and their wife Oda, who during a pilgrimage to Rome in 846 obtained the permission of Pope Sergius II for the new establishment and also the relics of the sainted former popes Anastasius and Innocent, who are still the patron saints of the abbey church. The community settled first at Brunshausen (Brunistishusun). The first abbess was Hathumod, a daughter of Liudolf, as were the two succeeding abbesses. In 856 construction began on the church at Gandersheim and in 881 Bishop Wigbert dedicated it to the Saints Anastasius, Innocent and John the Baptist, after which the community moved in.
Already in 877 King Louis the Younger placed the abbey under the protection of the Empire, which gave it extensive independence. In 919 King Henry I granted it Imperial immediacy. The close connection to the Empire meant that the abbey was obliged to provide accommodation to the German kings on their travels, and numerous royal visits are recorded.
Middle Ages
The establishment of the abbey by the founder of the Liudolfingers gave it especial importance during the Ottonian period. Until the foundation of Quedlinburg Abbey in 936, Gandersheim was among the most important Ottonian family institutions, and its church was one of the Ottonian burial places.
The canonesses, commonly known as Stiftsdamen, were allowed private property and, as they had taken no vows, were free at any time to leave the abbey. The Ottonian and Salian kings and their entourages often stayed in Gandersheim, and the canonesses were by no means remote from the world. Apart from the memorial Masses for the founding family, one of the main duties of the canonesses was the education of the daughters of the nobility (who were not obliged to become canonesses themselves).
One of the abbey's best-known canonesses was Roswitha of Gandersheim, famous as the first female poet of the German people. During a period of approximately 20 years – from about 950 to 970 or so – they wrote historical poetry, spiritual pieces and dramas, and the Gesta Ottonis, expressing their veneration of Otto I. They wrote in Latin.
In the Great Gandersheim Conflict, as it is called, originating from the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries, the Bishop of Hildesheim asserted claims over the abbey and its estates, which were located in an area where the boundaries between the Bishopric of Hildesheim and the Archbishop of Mainz were unclear. The pressure from Hildesheim moved the abbey increasingly into the sphere of Mainz. The situation was only eventually resolved by a privilege of Pope Innocent III of 22 June 1206 freeing the abbey once and for all from all claims of Hildesheim, and granting the abbesses the title of Imperial princesses (Reichsfürstinnen).
With the death of the last Salian king in 1125 the importance of the abbey began to diminish and it came more and more under the influence of the local territorial rulers. The Welfs in particular attempted to gain control over the abbey, until its dissolution. The abbey was not able to establish its own territorial lordship. No later than the mid-1270s, the Dukes of Brunswick succeeded in obtaining the Vogtei of the abbey and in the late 13th century built a castle in Gandersheim. Another way to gain influence over the abbey was to place relatives in the abbess's chair. This took the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg rather longer to achieve, but they were at last successful in 1402 with the election of their first family abbess, Sophia III, Princess of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
Reformation
The Reformation was first introduced into the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1542 when troops of the Schmalkaldic League occupied it. The Reformers ignored the abbey's Imperial immediacy and ordained the use of Lutheran church services, the introduction of which however the canonesses were able to postpone on account of the absence of the prioress (Dekanin) who was governing the abbey on behalf of the seven-year-old abbess. The townspeople of Gandersheim had received the Reformation enthusiastically and on 13 July 1543 undertook an iconoclastic attack on the abbey church, where they destroyed images and altars. Henry V changed their mind however and the principality changed back to Roman Catholicism. They made good at least some of the damages, and the church was re-dedicated.
In 1568 the Reformation was again implemented under Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The abbey and its dependencies at Brunshausen and Clus became Lutheran, and the Marienkloster and the Franciscan friaries were suppressed. A period now began of conflict between the abbess and the duke as both tried to extend their spheres of influence, a conflict which was not settled until 1593 when a treaty finally settled the points of disagreement.
Baroque
Under the abbesses Henriette Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Elisabeth Ernestine of Saxe-Meiningen there began a new golden age of the abbey. The abbesses promoted arts and sciences. Elisabeth Ernestine Antonie had the summer castle at Brunshausen built, as well as the Baroque wing of the abbey with the Kaisers' Hall (Kaisersaal), and they refurbished the church.
Dissolution
In 1802, faced with imminent secularisation, the abbey surrendered its Imperial immediacy to the sovereignty of the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, thus ending the centuries-long struggle with the Welfs.
During the French occupation Gandersheim belonged to the Kingdom of Westphalia. The abbess, who had fled, was permitted by Napoleon to return to the abbey and to live there until their death on 10 March 1810, after which there were no further elections for a successor. The abbey was dissolved and its assets were taken by the Westphalian crown, with the remaining occupants pensioned off.
Even after the end of the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1813 the Duchy of Brunswick did not restore the abbey.
Present day
The abbey is now used by the Evangelical-Lutheran parochial group of St. Anastasius and St. Innocent. During restoration works in 1997 there came to light some of the old church treasure: relics, textiles and reliquaries. These have been on display since March 2006.

The Veazie Dam was a hydroelectric dam on the Penobscot River between Veazie and Eddington in Penobscot County, Maine. In 2010 the Penobscot River Restoration Trust bought the dam from PPL Corporation based on an agreement that was signed in 2004. Deconstruction of the dam began on July 22, 2013 as a part of an extensive project involving four dams to restore eleven species of sea-run fish to the Penobscot River. The Veazie Dam was the furthest downstream of the dams on the Penobscot River; now the Milford and Orono Dam dams are the furthest downstream, albeit on separate side of Marsh Island. The Great Works Dam, which was upstream of the Veazie Dam, was removed in 2012.

45 Days: The Fight for a Nation is a documentary film depicting the Nagorno-Karabakh war released in 2021. The film is shot and narrated by Emile Ghessen and produced by Asko Akopyan.
Synopsis
The film was made during the second Nagorno-Karabakh war in fall 2020, when Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive against Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh).
"Recognising the significant amount of disinformation emerging from the war and lack of world news coverage, Emile travelled the region and embedded themselves with local people – those who took up arms to fight. This is their story," the film's description says.
The movie shows how the news media used misinformation or avoided coverage of these events and thereby affected the public's awareness and perception of this invasion and war.
Background and production
British Filmmaker Emile Ghessen who served in Royal Marines Commando for 12 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, had only made two other independent documentary movies before. 45 Days: The Fight for a Nation is their third documentary which they shot after attending film school.
The film has been submitted to the Oscars for consideration in the documentary category.
In August 2021, the film was first screened in Yerevan, Armenia. In September 2021, a screening was held at the Chinese Theater, in Hollywood, CA.

Ramin, renamed Human Heart in the United States, is the debut studio album from Iranian-born Canadian actor and singer Ramin Karimloo. It was released in the UK on April 9, 2012.
Background
Karimloo released their album in the UK on April 9, 2012 after several months of promotion. They ended their West End run as Jean Valjean on the week preceding the album's release in order to prepare for a series of signings and further promotion before embarking on a major tour which will take them to venues in London, Oxford, Southend, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Gateshead, and Cardiff in the UK and New York, Charlotte, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington, Bethlehem, Chicago, and Pittsburgh in the US.  They are also visiting Toronto in their native Canada.
Karimloo said in anticipation of the album: "I have a huge love for country and bluegrass, I love to rock 'n' roll and I love what I'm doing, so it was how to balance all that". They went on to say, "I didn't want to be just a theatre star putting out an album. It was only when they started talking about writing and bringing in other writers that I got interested. I wanted to have lived the songs. I wanted an album that was like a diary." They have cited influences as diverse as The Tragically Hip, Johnny Cash and Mumford and Sons, and so a straightforward West End leading man album of covers was never really on the cards, says Karimloo, "I wanted to marry that rocky sound with things that people know me more for". The album was produced by Tom Nichols, who has worked with world-class vocalists from Céline Dion to Hayley Westenra. It includes not only their own compositions but also covers of Bryan Adams and Muse songs, having as well their own take on "Music of the Night" from The Phantom of the Opera and "'Til I Hear You Sing" from Love Never Dies.
Promotion
Karimloo promoted the album on QVC. They performed "Music of the Night" and "Coming Home". They also performed the song "Constant Angel" on the BBC show Songs of Praise.

On April 11, 2012 their album was on course to debut at number sixteen on the UK Albums Chart.

Todd County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2010 census, the population was 12,460. Its county seat is Elkton. The county is named for Colonel John Todd, who was killed at the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782 during the American Revolution.
History
Early history
Todd County consists of two geographical regions known historically as the high country to the north and low country to the south. The northern highlands consist of steep-sloped sandstone terrain with forests of oak, walnut and poplar. The landscape contains steep bluffs and sharp rises and falls within the terrain. The southern lowlands consist of rolling limestone flatlands void of aquifer sinks and consist of dense but sparse forests of oak, walnut poplar and ash. The historic inhabitants of the region before European encounter were the Iroquoian language-speaking Cherokee, who had migrated centuries earlier from areas around the Great Lakes. They used the lands for hunting and gathering.
Todd County lies within what was originally considered the western portion of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Many of the original white settlers came when the area was still considered part of Virginia. This part of southern Kentucky was designated to be awarded to Virginia veterans of the American Revolutionary War as payment for their services.
Justinian Cartwright may have been the first settle in what is now Todd County. However, the first proven residents are Edward Shanklin Jr., Matthew and David Rolston, and John Huston and their sons James and Granville Huston. Samuel Davis, father of Jefferson Davis, and John Wilson were also early settlers of the county. Kentucky Governor Greenup made the first Kentucky land grants to veterans William Croghan, David Logan, Edward Shanklin Jr., and John Wilson, among others.
Todd County was created in response to a petition for "home government," since travel to the county seats of Logan and Christian was arduous. The petition had been written by the magisterial court, consisting of Edward Shanklin, John Gray, Robert Coleman, Henry Gorin, John Taylor, H. C. Ewing, John S Anderson, William Hopper, John Mann and Joseph Frazer, had made the request. The legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky accordingly passed an act creating of the county from portions of Christian and Logan counties on April 1, 1820. The new county was named for Colonel John Todd, who had been killed at the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782.
Development
Agriculture is a revered tradition in Todd County. The lowlands are of the finest rich soil types, including "Pembroke" soil. The lowlands are prized for their high growth yields. In the early 19th century, Major John Gray established a stagecoach hub in the county with travel routes radiating to larger American cities from the central point. Their widely known Stagecoach Inn located in "Graysville," now Guthrie, Kentucky, was at the center of the travel routes. Major Gray's stagecoach empire was highly successful, and they soon became wealthy due to its popularity in the region. Major Gray built a house, a simple two-story shed-roofed, brick one-pile dwelling, now known as "Halcyon," or the John Gray House.
Gray wanted a town to be established near their home that would become the county seat. Gray designed the city, which included a town square from which hundreds of lots radiated. They called it "Elkton" after the elk herds that watered at a spring near the town center. Gray designed the town square as a trapezoid instead of a square, with the south side of the town square larger than the north so that as the sun traversed across the sky, the buildings on the east and west would benefit from prolonged periods of daily sunlight. Gray contributed funding for a county courthouse, which was erected at the center of the square. The brick building stood two stories with a cupola at the top.
After Major Gray died, the building was deemed in a state of ruin due to improper construction methods and torn down to erect a new courthouse. The new Todd County courthouse was erected by order of the Fiscal Court in 1834. R. Rowland designed the building in the Federal Style with an integration of Greek-Revival style motifs. The brick building, which is extant in the 21st century, stands two stories tall with tripartite windows and large Greek-Revival lintels. The building originally had a smaller federal style cupola, but this was later replaced with a late Victorian clock tower in the second Empire style, which remains today.
Civil War
Kentucky was a source of slaves for the cotton plantations in the lower South, and the slave trade was a profitable business for many Kentuckians. However, most Kentuckians did not own slaves. Those who did were wealthy plantation owners who stood to lose a lot if slavery were abolished. The major slave-owning areas in the state were the Bluegrass region, Henderson and Oldham counties on the Ohio River, and the western Kentucky counties of Trigg, Christian, Todd, and Warren. Many Kentuckians from these areas joined the Confederate army. Nevertheless, Kentucky's allegiance was divided during the Civil War. The state was officially neutral until September 1861, when it pledged its support to the Union. In response, a pro-Confederate Confederate government of Kentucky was formed by representatives from several Kentucky counties, with a second capital at Bowling Green.

Marion Palfi (1907–1978) was a German-American social-documentary photographer born in Berlin. In 1940 they moved from Germany to New York City to escape the Nazi army and their ideologies.
Early life
Palfi was the daughter of German theater designer, Victor Palfi, and a Polish mother. They studied dance at private schools in Germany, and as a young woman they worked as a model, dancer, and actor, appearing in at least one film in 1926. In rejection of Germany's radical politics, they began to use photography and art to effect social change.
Career
In 1932, Palfi became an apprentice at a commercial portrait studio in Berlin and also began working as a freelance magazine photographer. Two years later, they opened their own portrait studio there. Fleeing the Nazis in Berlin, they opened their own successful portrait studio in Amsterdam in 1936. They then fled Europe for the United States in 1940 after marrying an American soldier, Benjamin Weiss.
In the U.S., Palfi supported themselves by working in a photo-finishing lab in New York City and began working on a large project of photographic essays celebrating American minority artists. Great American Artists of Minority Groups (1945) opened doors for her: after meeting Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps, Palfi was asked to photograph for a number of African American Causes. One of their photographs was published on the cover of the first issue of Ebony magazine, featuring the Henry Street Settlement of New York's Lower East Side.
Palfi was granted an award from the Rosenwald Fellowship in 1946. Between the years of 1946-1949, Palfi used photography to catalog racial discrimination in the United States. Palfi's photographic study on the State of Georgia was hosted as an exhibit around the United States in 1950, including Nashville, Detroit, Chicago, and Washington D.C. Them work was used to garner legislative change when "The American Parents Committee" showed their photographs to members of Congress.
From the mid-1960s to the 1970s, Palfi taught photography in Los Angeles. Institutions where they worked included the California Institute of the Arts, the Woman's Building, UCLA Extension, and the Inner City Cultural Center. Palfi was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 1974.
Photography
Marion Palfi's work centered around equity, opportunity, and justice for all people. In their photo book There is No More Time: An American Tragedy, Palfi documented racism and segregation in Irwinton, GA, the site of the murder of Caleb Hill, the first reported lynching of 1949. Palfi's 1952 book Suffer Little Children focused on the living condition of disadvantaged children across the U.S., including the young inmates of the New York Training School for Girls. Palfi was a contributing photographer to Edward Steichen's landmark Family of Man exhibition in 1955. During their time traveling across the United States they were bothered by the amount of poverty and racial intolerance they were exposed. They also are confused by Americans lack to acknowledge of these problems within their communities. Palfi decided to use their camera as a way to document these problems and bring attention to them within the public eye. Using their new perspective on the topic of injustice and racial discrimination they were able to draw attention to these issues by documenting them with their camera.
Palfi's photography explored the concepts of social injustices in America. They created many photographic studies that focus on racial injustice against African Americans, poverty in cities, and racial discrimination against Native Americans. They originally had trouble getting their photographs displayed or showcased because many Americans refused to address these social justice issues within their own society.
Activism
Palfi was the first photographer to arrive in Greenwood, Mississippi at the beginning of the town's civil rights protests in 1963. They photographed the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee offices after they were burned down, went to the residence of Dewy Green, and met with activists. As protests increased in violence, they were told to leave Greenwood. Following their time there, their photography was used by the US Department of Justice to support lawsuits against segregation in Greenwood and Leflore County.
Palfi attended March on Washington (August 28, 1963). They additionally chronicled, in photography, the opening of Prince Edward County schools in 1964, and the end of Massive Resistance. Palfi marched at Selma in 1965 with Martin Luther King Jr.
Marion describes themselves as a "social change photographer" and they believed that art could and should effect social change. They used their camera as a tool to show the public the problems within their own society to an attempt to incite a movement of change.
Legacy
Palfi taught photography at the Inner-City Cultural Center in LA, before dying from breast cancer in 1978. Palfi's husband, Martin Magner, donated much of their papers to the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.

The Hunters in the Snow (), also known as The Return of the Hunters, is a 1565 oil-on-wood painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The Northern Renaissance work is one of a series of works, five of which still survive, that depict different times of the year. The painting is in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria. This scene is set in the depths of winter during December/January.
Background and origins
The Hunters in the Snow, and the series to which it belongs, are in the medieval and early Renaissance tradition of the Labours of the Months: depictions of various rural activities and work understood by a spectator in Breugel's time as representing the different months or times of the year.
Description and composition
The painting shows a wintry scene in which three hunters are returning from an expedition accompanied by their dogs. By appearances the outing was not successful; the hunters appear to trudge wearily, and the dogs appear downtrodden and miserable. One man carries the "meager corpse of a fox" illustrating the paucity of the hunt. In front of the hunters in the snow are the footprints of a rabbit or hare—which has escaped or been missed by the hunters. The overall visual impression is one of a calm, cold, overcast day; the colors are muted whites and grays, the trees are bare of leaves, and wood smoke hangs in the air. Several adults and a child prepare food at an inn with an outside fire. Of interest are the jagged mountain peaks which do not exist in Belgium or Holland.
The painting prominently depicts crows sitting in the denuded trees and a magpie flies in the upper centre of the scene. Bruegel sometimes uses these two species of birds to indicate an ill-omen as in Dutch culture magpies are associated with the Devil.
The landscape itself is a flat-bottomed valley (a river meanders through it) with jagged peaks visible on the far side. A watermill is seen with its wheel frozen stiff. In the distance, figures ice skate, play hockey with modern style sticks and curl on a frozen lake; they are rendered as silhouettes.
Interpretation and reception
The 1560s was a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, and Bruegel (and possibly their patron) may be attempting to portray an ideal of what country life used to be or what they wish it to be.
Writing in the "opinion" section of Nature, art historian Martin Kemp points out that Old Masters are popular subjects for Christmas cards and states that "probably no 'secular' subject is more popular than ... Hunters in the Snow".
The painting is the subject of modernist poet William Carlos Williams's ekphrastic poem "The Hunter in The Snow". Hunters in the Snow is used extensively in Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's films Solaris (1972) and The Mirror (1974), and in Lars von Trier's 2011 film Melancholia. It appears also in Alain Tanner's film Dans la ville blanche (1983). It was an inspiration for Roy Andersson's 2014 film A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence, is the basis for the first frame of Abbas Kiarostami's 24 Frames (2017), and was a topic of the 1980 television series 100 Great Paintings.

Production
Subbulakshmi and their husband T. Sadasivam formed Royal Talkies to produce their own films. They decided to make a movie based Shakuntala's life and asked director K. Subramanyam, to direct the film. Subramaniam was not able to do so because of prior commitments and recommended Ellis Dungan to be hired instead. Sadasivam wrote the screenplay and Papanasam Sivan was hired to write the lyrics. Carnatic singer G. N. Balasubramaniam was cast as King Dushyanta. The comedic duo of N. S. Krishnan – T. A. Mathuram were also among the cast. Dungan introduced several new techniques to Tamil cinema in this film. The scene where Shakuntala loses their ring was shot in slow motion through a glass tank filled with water. In their autobiography (A Guide to Adventure: An Autobiography, Dorrance Publishing Company (2002)), Dungan wrote the following about their use of a European dancer for adding glamour to the film :
The completed film was 17,400 Feet in length (around 3 hours run time). The film advanced the popularity of singing lead actor M. S. Subbulakshmi.
Soundtrack
The music was composed by Thuraiyur Rajagopala Sarma while the lyrics were penned by Papanasam Sivan. There were a total of 24 songs in Sakuntalai. A couple of songs were longer than usual and the gramophone company had to issue special large sized records for them.

Drum () is a village and townland in the west of County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. It is notable for being one of the only Protestant-majority settlements in the Republic of Ireland.
Location and name
Drum is situated between some lakes, such as Drum Lough to the north, Quarry Lough to the west, and Long Lough to the south. It is named for the surrounding drumlin terrain. Local people arranged signage at Drum Lough, which has duck.
The village lies on a minor road off the main Monaghan Town to Cootehill road, and the nearest larger settlements are Cootehill and Newbliss, site of the national writers' and artists' retreat facility, the Tyrone Guthrie Centre at Annaghmakerrig.
Character
Drum has a Church of Ireland church, one of the oldest Presbyterian congregations on the island of Ireland (although the current Presbyterian church was only built in the 1820s), a Free Presbyterian church and a Gospel Hall. Unusually for Ireland, especially for the Republic of Ireland, Drum has no Catholic church in the actual village. The nearest Catholic church to the village is St. Joseph's Church, also known as Corrinshigo Chapel, parts of which were built 1870 and which was significantly altered in the 1960s, and is located less than two miles west of Drum.
The village also has a Protestant Hall, which hosts two Orange Lodges and an accordion band. A blue plaque on the wall of the Protestant Hall commemorates John Deyell, who later founded a settlement in Canada. There is also a branch of the Royal Black Preceptory, and the Drum Association, a local development association, which shares premises with the Wee Drummers childcare facility, but no GAA club. There is a Protestant primary school, while the nearest secondary school is in Cootehill, a 15-minutes drive away. Drum also participates in the Tidy Towns competition. The village shop and the last local public house closed in the 2010s, and the nearest retail facilities are now in Cootehill.
Notable people
Thomas Stinson, 1798 – 1864, merchant and landowner in Hamilton, Ontario
Joseph Rutherford Dundas, 1836 – 1896, Canadian merchant and politician
Heather Humphreys, 1963 -, Irish politician, Minister

Nathan William Hindmarsh (born 7 September 1979) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who captained the Parramatta Eels in the NRL. A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative second-row forward, they played their entire career at the Eels, in 2010 breaking the record for most games with the club. On 28 August 2018, Hindmarsh was inducted into the Parramatta Eels hall of fame.
Background
Hindmarsh was born in Bowral, New South Wales, Australia.  They are of Scottish descent.
Playing career
Hindmarsh played for the junior club, Robertson near Moss Vale as part of Group 6 in the Country Rugby League. They later attended renowned rugby league school Patrician Brothers College, Fairfield.
Hindmarsh and their brother Ian Hindmarsh both played in the National Rugby League for Sydney's Parramatta Eels club. In 1998 Hindmarsh received the club's rookie of the year award. The same season, Hindmarsh was part of the Parramatta side which made it to the preliminary final against Canterbury. With less than 10 minutes to go, Parramatta were winning the match 18-2 but ended up losing 32-20 in extra time.
The following two seasons Hindmarsh suffered similar heartbreak being part of the Parramatta sides which lost the 1999 preliminary final against Melbourne after being up 16-0 at half time and losing to Brisbane in the 2000 preliminary final. In 2001, Hindmarsh was part of the all conquering Parramatta side which only lost 4 games all season on their way to the Minor Premiership and then the 2001 NRL Grand Final against Newcastle. Going into the game, Parramatta were raging hot favourites but were losing 24-0 at halftime and eventually went down 30-24. On breaking Brett Kenny's record for most appearances, Hindmarsh recalled memories of the 2001 final saying "I was jogging back to the half way line crying after Timana Tahu scored that try to make it 28-6 with 16 minutes to go because I knew we were gone". In 2003, Hindmarsh suffered a knee injury and only managed to make 11 appearances during the season. In 2004, Hindmarsh made 21 appearances for Parramatta but for the second consecutive year the club missed the finals. In 2005, Parramatta finished as minor premiers and Hindmarsh injured their knee in round 26 against Brisbane. Hindmarsh was unable to play in the finals series and Parramatta once again suffered preliminary final heartbreak against North Queensland losing 29-0 in a massive upset. In 2007, Hindmarsh had a strong season as Parramatta made it all the way to the preliminary final against Melbourne but lost the match 26-10.
Hindmarsh was selected to play for the Australian national team at second-row forward in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory. They set a new world record for the most tackles made in a single game: in round 23 of the 2007 NRL season they made 75 tackles against the Melbourne Storm.  They are also believed to be the first player to make 10,000 tackles in the NRL.
Hindmarsh was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Great Britain they played at second-row forward in the Kangaroos' 44-4 victory.
At their peak (2004–2006) Hindmarsh was considered the best second-rower in the NRL by the Dally M judges. They were an automatic pick for NSW and Australia from 2004 to 2007 and was often picked alongside Craig Fitzgibbon.
After a courageous performance in the 2009 NRL Grand Final, Nathan Hindmarsh earned a well-deserved Test recall after two years of being overlooked for representative honours. In 2010 when it was revealed that Melbourne had been found guilty of rorting the salary cap, there was a possibility that Parramatta could be given the 2009 premiership or that the 2009 season could be left vacant. Hindmarsh said to the media "Who is going to give us that feeling of winning when we are up by six when the siren goes?, who is going to give us that feeling of pride, relief or satisfaction?, or give Nathan Cayless that grand final lap with their kids?,all that feeling is long gone meaning the best we can hope for is a weird little asterisk next to our name in the record books, which is why I don't care about the salary cap scandal, I don't think about it and Melbourne can keep their premiership trophy for all I care, we are just focused on the game coming up this weekend". They were appointed co-captain of the Parramatta Eels in 2010, with Nathan Cayless before becoming the sole captain after Cayless retired.
Making their third appearance for the Prime Minister's XIII in 2011, Hindmarsh became the only player to captain the side twice.
On 29 March 2012 Hindmarsh announced their retirement from rugby league effective at the end of the 2012 season. Despite Hindmarsh's absence from the Eels, they promised they will continue to be a part of the NRL (National Rugby League) community.
On 2 September 2012, Hindmarsh played their final NRL game alongside retiring winger Luke Burt against the St George Illawarra Dragons. The Eels went down to St. George 29-8 with Hindmarsh successful in scoring a penalty kick on full-time. The game was originally scheduled to be played at Parramatta Stadium but was later moved to Stadium Australia due to the expected crowd. The crowd was the largest for an NRL (non-finals) game.

The Amethyst Theatre formerly and perhaps better known as the Vogue Theatre is a historical movie theatre located in McAdam, New Brunswick. The theatre which is considered one of New Brunswick's classic theatres saw its peak during the early-mid 20th century. However, events such as a fire during Hurricane Edna in 1954, vandalism, and neglect have seen the building fall into disrepair. In 2010 the theatre was purchased by a new owner who began renovations to restore the theatre and provide a new cultural outlet for the village. The most watched film in the theater was The Sound of Music (Film) back in 1965.

Langley's Adventitious Angles is a puzzle in which one must infer an angle in a geometric diagram from other given angles. It was posed by Edward Mann Langley in The Mathematical Gazette in 1922.
The problem
In its original form the problem was as follows:
is an isosceles triangle with
at to cuts in
at to cuts in
Prove
Solution
The problem of calculating angle is a standard application of Hansen's resection.
Such calculations can establish that is within any desired precision of , but being
of only finite precision, always leave doubt about the exact value.
A direct proof using classical geometry was developed by James Mercer in 1923. This solution involves drawing one additional line, and then making repeated use of the fact that the internal angles of a triangle add up to 180° to prove that several triangles drawn within the large triangle are all isosceles.
Draw at to intersecting at and draw (See figure on the lower right.)
Since and then and triangle is isosceles with
Since and then and triangle is isosceles with
Since and then triangle is equilateral.
Since and then and triangle is isosceles with
Therefore all the red lines in the figure are equal.
Since triangle is isosceles with
Therefore
Many other solutions are possible. Cut the Knot list twelve different solutions and several alternative problems with the same 80-80-20 triangle but different internal angles.
Generalization
A quadrilateral such as BCEF is called an adventitious quadrangle when the angles between its diagonals and sides are all rational angles, angles that give rational numbers when measured in degrees or other units for which the whole circle is a rational number. Numerous adventitious quadrangles beyond the one appearing in Langley's puzzle have been constructed. They form several infinite families and an additional set of sporadic examples.
Classifying the adventitious quadrangles (which need not be convex) turns out to be equivalent to classifying all triple intersections of diagonals in regular polygons. This was solved by Gerrit Bol in 1936 (Beantwoording van prijsvraag # 17, Nieuw-Archief voor Wiskunde 18, pages 14-66). They in fact classified (though with a few errors) all multiple intersections of diagonals in regular polygons. Their results (all done by hand) were confirmed with computer, and the errors corrected, by Bjorn Poonen and Michael Rubinstein in 1998. The article contains a history of the problem and a picture featuring the regular triacontagon and its diagonals.
In 2015, an anonymous Japanese woman using the pen name "aerile re" published the first known method (the method of 3 circumcenters) to construct a proof in elementary geometry for a special class of adventitious quadrangles problem. This work solves the first of the three unsolved problems listed by Rigby in their 1978 paper.

Sir William Keith of Delny (died 1599) was a Scottish courtier and Master of the Royal Wardrobe. They also served as ambassador for James VI to various countries. They were an important intermediary between George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal and the king, the king and courtiers, and the king and foreign governments.
Career
William Keith was a son of Andrew Keith, laird of Ravenscraig, Aberdeenshire, and distantly related to the Earls Marischal. In 1579, they were made a valet in the household of James VI of Scotland.
In May 1583 they accompanied Colonel William Stewart and John Colville on an embassy to London to seek English support for the government of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie. On 1 June they were attacked and insulted by Marmaduke Hedworth, Robert Banks, and others outside Durham on the way back. Hedworth declared Keith was a "Scottish villain" and they replied "I am a gentleman."
Keith was involved in collecting the gifts of money which Queen Elizabeth gave to James VI, and made account of the money on 17 May 1586. On 19 May Keith was granted lands in Delny in Ross-shire for their good service.
Mary Queen of Scots
Delny arrived in London on 5 November 1586 to intercede for the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, carrying the King's letter of instructions for Archibald Douglas. At this time, the French ambassador Du Preau, known as Courcelles, described Delny them as a "pensionary and creature of the Queen of England".
They met up with Archibald Douglas and had an audience with Queen Elizabeth on 10 November. They requested that any proceedings against Mary should be delayed until members of the Privy Council of Scotland were present, and that nothing should prejudice James VI's succession to the English throne. Douglas and Delny attended a banquet with the commissioners at Mary's trial at Burghley's London house on 22 November, and were assured that nothing at Mary's trial had prejudiced James VI's title. James VI wrote to Delny that the execution of their mother would be a greater tragedy than the deaths of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. Delny was reluctant to pass this letter to Elizabeth, but they heard of it, and Delny was forced to show it to her, and they were furious. Elizabeth was in a "passion" and the Earl of Leicester made a speech about the Scottish king's good intentions to appease them
William Cecil wrote to Delny about "so strange and unseasonable message, as did directly touch their noble father (Henry VIII), herself, and all the estates of their present Parliament." Cecil said Elizabeth was now reluctant to receive further ambassadors from James VI. During the negotiations, Douglas said to Delny that they were "simple", meaning both honest and unsophisticated, and Delny wrote to John Maitland of Thirlestane that Douglas was a serpent in the likeness of a man, who had no care for the matter.
In January 1587 Delny was joined in London by Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairny and the Master of Gray to intercede for the life of Mary. After Mary was executed, their speeches and manner of mediation were said to have been counter-productive, and when Sir John Seton of Barnes was dismissed from household service in July, it was thought Delny would lose their place. Despite their failure to secure their mother's life, James VI knighted Delny in August at time of the Parliament and made them Master of the Wardrobe. On 1 August James VI confirmed them as owner of Delny and granted them other lands which had been part of the Lordship of Ross. These lands were made into a new barony of Delny.
They were admitted to the privy council in March 1588. On 17 March they wrote to Walsingham mentioning the arguments in favour of James VI marrying Catherine de Bourbon the sister of Henry of Navarre. At this time they transferred £10,000 Scots to the Lord Chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane, from the English subsidy money which Elizabeth gave to James VI.
In July 1589 it was expected that Delny and the English courtier Roger Aston would lose their positions at court because they had been supporters of the Master of Gray, who was now out of favour. Their opponents, the followers of the Earl of Huntly and Sir John Seton of Barnes called Aston, Keith, and the Lord Privy Seal, "Queen Elizabeth's pensioners", this insult may be a reference to the English subsidy pensions or other payments.
Denmark and downfall
In June 1589, an English sailor George Beeston arrived in the Forth and Delny was sent to greet him. In October Delny was in the retinue which accompanied James VI to Norway and Denmark to collect their future Queen, Anne of Denmark. James Melville of Halhill mentions that Delny did not sail in the king's ship, but in one of three other ships, along with Lewis Bellenden, John Carmichael, the Provost of Lincluden, George Home, James Sandilands, and Peter Young.
After the royal wedding at Oslo, Colonel William Stewart sailed back to Edinburgh with instructions for the royal homecoming in the spring, and news of arguments between Chancellor of Scotland, John Maitland of Thirlestane, and the Earl Marischal and their kinsman William Keith of Delny, over precedence and the Queen's dowry. James VI ordered Chancellor Maitland to give jewels to Christian IV and their mother Sophie of Mecklenburg and other royals. These gifts included four great table diamonds and two great rubies set in gold rings which Delny had brought to Denmark. There was discussion whether the queen's dowry money should be brought home untouched to Scotland, or whether the Earl Marischal, Lord Dingwall and Delny should be recompensed. James VI gave Delny 830 Danish dalers from the dowry for clothes received in Denmark.
During their time Denmark, the king sacked Delny as keeper of the wardrobe, allegedly for appearing in richer clothing than himself, and appointed Sir George Home in their stead. In the days before Delny lost their place, Robert Douglas, Provost of Lincluden on 4 April 1590 wrote "Sir William Keith is lyke to be casin, and to tyne their offices, credit and all." A correspondent of Francis Walsingham wrote on 5 April 1590 that the Chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane, aimed to discredit the Earl Marischal and Delny, but Delny was "wonderfully well beloved" and had "ever worn their sword on the right and true side". Archibald Douglas suggested Keith's allies were a threat to Maitland, and a royal guard raised by Sir John Carmichael was chiefly to protect the Chancellor.
Out of favour
In the summer of 1590, Delny fell under suspicion of conspiring with the Earl Marischal and Alexander Home, 6th Lord Home to murder the Lord Chancellor. When, in July, the Earl Marischal was arrested, they sought the protection of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell. In the last week of July, Delny stayed at the house of Dorothea Stewart, Countess of Gowrie, near Holyrood Palace, hoping to regain the king's favour. Possibly unaware of their increasing difficulties, Christian IV of Denmark wrote to James VI on 3 August 1590 interceding for Delny's return to favour.
James VI became angry about discussions that Delny might marry the Countess of Gowrie, and would have made them appear before the Privy Council in July 1591. The English ambassador Robert Bowes noted in July 1591 that Delny "lay in bed" once or twice at Morham Tower with the owner, the rebellious Bothwell. When news that Delny had joined Bothwell's retinue reached the king, their estates were forfeited. They subsequently fled into exile with Bothwell.
Delny regained royal favour in June 1592, apparently as a result of the intervention of Anne of Denmark, though they did not recover their office in the wardrobe. In January 1593 they were given the barony of Dingwall, which their kinsman Andrew Keith, Lord Dingwall had resigned. The letter of gift thanked Delny for their services to the king including a role in the proxy marriage to Anne of Denmark in 1589.
Later years
Delny became an associate of Ludovick Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox. On 6 May 1593 the Duke and 15 friends subscribed to a frivolous legal document swearing to abstain from wearing gold and silver trimmings on their clothes for a year, and defaulters were to pay for a banquet for all of them at John Killoch's house in Edinburgh. This "passement bond" was in part inspired by cheap counterfeit gold and silver thread used in "passements great or small, plain or à jour, bissets, lilykins, cordons, and fringes" which quickly discoloured. The signatories included; Lord Home, the Earl of Mar, Lord Spynie, the Master of Glamis, Sir Thomas Erskine, Walter Stewart of Blantyre, David Seton of Parbroath, and Sir George Home.
In 1593 Delny as chamberlain of the lands of Ross and Ardmannoch delivered their account of royal income to the comptroller, David Seton of Parbroath. In February James VI confirmed their grant of the barony of Delny and gave them the patronage of three parish churches, noting their devotion to spreading the Gospel.
In October 1593 Delny was in London and met secretly with Anthony Bacon, a follower of the Earl of Essex. Bacon wrote to Delny that Essex would accept a letter from James VI at Richmond Palace and they should burn the letter and not tell anybody about their meeting.
Delny wrote to James Hudson in March 1594. Hudson had been one of the king's viola players, the four Hudson brothers, and was now a resident diplomatic agent in London. Delny wrote that they had read Hudson's previous three letters to the king. Both James VI and Anne of Denmark had told them that John Wemyss of Logie had no diplomatic mission from them. Delny urged Hudson to be careful in the king's affairs, not to upset the delicate issue of the succession. After other matters, Delny wished Hudson to convey their thanks to Sir Roger Williams and Fulke Greville. Hudson made a copy of this letter for Bacon and Essex.
In 1594 Delny carried invitations to the baptism and tournament at Stirling Castle for Prince Henry to the Dutch Republic. Sir James Melville of Halhill said they were not suited to the role because they could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish. Their partner in this embassy was Captain William Murray of Pitcarleis, Provost of St Andrews. They were instructed to confirm previous peace treaties and to give good report of Adrian Damman van Bijsterveld, the resident diplomat of the States General at the court of Scotland, and ask that Scots soldiers serving in the Eighty Years' War be paid.
The ambassadors from the Dutch Republic at the baptism, Walraven III van Brederode (1547–1614) and Jacob Valke, treasurer of Zeeland, brought Prince Henry a gift of a guaranteed income. Delny was appointed chamberlain of the Prince's household and collector of this money on 1 October 1594. Delny lost this role in 1595 when the Earl of Mar, as guardian of the Prince at Stirling Castle, was given charge of the Dutch income. Delny left ithe round box with the letter of gift in Edinburgh with John Gourlay, and in 1601 Gourlay delivered it to George Home of Spott.
Venice
Delny left Edinburgh for Venice on 4 October 1595. They went first to London, then embarked with Henry Hawkyns, a nephew of Christopher Yelverton, a companion recommended by Anthony Bacon. Delny wrote to Bacon in November offering their services to Queen Elizabeth against Spain. Delny said they would have delivered James VI's letter and message in person to Essex, if the earl had been in London, requesting hawks and also asking that the rebel Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell should not be welcomed in England. Bacon should give the answers to the king's requests to Thomas Foulis. Delny was in Venice to canvas support for James VI. They explained to the senators of Venice that they were not an ambassador, but came to learn the language and further the king's private business.
Delny wrote to Foulis from Padua, and mentioned the secure way that they had folded the king's letter, and disguised the address. Such practices are known as "letterlocking" a term first coined by Jana Dambrogio:I close their majesties lettir, swa that giff they taik not ane knyff and cott it owt, it will ryff; lykwys I have cloissit roidlie, that it be not brokin owt or kend, sua exquisse my roidnes lowrd in this.I close their majesty's letter so that if they do not use a knife and cut it open, it will tear, also I have sealed it rudely, so it might not be picked out and known, so exuse my rough rudeness in this.
In April 1597 James VI asked Delny to correspond with Venice, to bolster support for their accession to the throne of England.
Death
A legal case mentions their death and the cessation of payments owed to creditor in 1599. A charter of July 1601 mentions their death, and an earlier note in the royal wardrobe accounts made in 1599 by Thomas Foulis and Robert Jousie also refers to their decease. They had three children, Sara, and two sons, both called William. Their property passed to their brother, John Keith of Ravenscraig.
Delny owed the banker Thomas Foulis £6248 Scots. The debt was probably connected with the royal wardrobe. In 1605 the debts due to the Master of Gray were examined, including £1000 given to Delny as Master of the Wardrobe.
Heraldry
Keith used a seal in 1594 quartering the Keith arms used by the Earl Marischal and Andrew Keith, Lord Dingwall, (argent a chief paly of or and gules), with 2nd three cushions in a flowered tressure, and 3rd a bend between three cross crosslets and three mullets.

The English Electric/BAC Lightning () is an aviation book by British military historian and author Bruce Barrymore Halpenny about the English Electric Lightning. It was published by Osprey Publishing as part of their Air Combat series. It was the best seller in Grimsby, the home town of the Lightning.
The author, known for their books on airfields and aircraft, spent nine months researching the Lightnings with the pilots of 5 and 11 Squadrons and Binbrook's own Lightning Training Flight. To gather information for the book, the author talked to men like, Sqdn Ldr Dave Carden (with 3,000 plus hours, the most experienced Lightning pilot in the world) and fellow pilots and ground staff.
The book itself gives an insight into the workings of RAF Binbrook, its Lightnings, and the men that fly and maintain them. Sqdn Ldr Dave Carden takes the reader on a typically "hair-raising mission", while another section is devoted to a pilot's experiences when their aircraft caught fire and crashed into the sea off Flamborough Head in 1981. It also deals with the Quick Reaction Alert shed, where two fully armed Lightnings and their pilots were on constant standby to intercept Russian aircraft which used to sometimes fly to within 100 miles of Spurn Point.

is a Shinto shrine in Kikuchi, Kumamoto Prefecture, in which Kikuchi Taketoki (菊池武時, 1292 – April 27, 1333), Kikuchi Takeshige (菊池武重, 1307?-1338?) and Kikuchi Takemitsu (菊池武光, – 1373) are enshrined. It is one of the Fifteen Shrines of the Kenmu Restoration.
Another Kikuchi Shrine (Fukuoka)
Kikuchi Takemitsu is also enshrined in a Kikuchi shrine at 7-10-1, Nanakuma, Johnan-ku, Fukuoka where they died at war.
History of the shrine
With the suggestion of Nagaoka Masami, Emperor Meiji ordered in 1868, the enshrinement of Kikuchi Taketoki, who worked for the emperors, and a shrine was built on the site of the old Kikuchi castle in Kikuchi City. Kikuchi Taketoki was enshrined on April 28, 1870. The shrine is classified as a Bekkaku Kanpeisha (shrines for those with distinguished services to the state). In March 1923, Kikuchi Takeshige and Kikuchi Takemitsu were also enshrined at the same location. In September 1952, the shrine was made a Religious corporation. In 1970, a Kumonoe-guu building and a historical museum were also built on shrine grounds. On April 28, 2000, the shrine celebrated its 130th anniversary.
Kikuchi clan and Kikuchi Taketoki
The Kikuchi clan (菊池氏, Kikuchi-shi) of Higo Province was a powerful daimyō family of Higo, Kyushu. The Kikuchi lineage was renowned for its valiant service in defense of the emperor and against foreign invaders.
Kikuchi Taketoki was the 11th head of the Kikuchi clan. In 1333, Emperor Go-Daigo asked Taketoki to help them overthrow the shogunate and restore imperial rule. They were Go-Daigo's right-hand man and was awarded greatly for their loyalty. Taketoki gathered many people in Kyushu and was planning to attack the Defense Commissioner of the West Hojo Hidetoki (Akahashi Hidetoki) but their plan was leaked. Taketoki and their son Yoritaka died in the attack, but they were the forerunners of the Kenmu Restoration (1333–1336). Taketoki was buried in Fukuoka city where they died.
Kikuchi Takeshige
The 12th head of the Kikuchi clan, and the eldest son of Kikuchi Taketoki. They invented the Kikuchi 1000 spears or shortened spears on long bamboo poles, a new weapon. They strengthened the bond of the Kikuchi clan by introducing the Kikuchi constitution.
Kikuchi Takemitsu
They finally unified Kyushu by attacking Dazaifu. They were a staunch supporter of the Southern Court set up by Emperor Go-Daigo after the Kenmu Restoration failed.

The Olsen Gang (, , ) is a Danish comedy film series created by Danish director Erik Balling and special effects expert Henning Bahs about the eponymous fictional criminal gang. The gang's leader is the criminal genius and habitual offender Egon Olsen and their accomplices are Benny and Kjeld (Kjell in Norwegian). The gang members are harmless, extremely rarely target ordinary citizens, and never deliberately use violence. The first film came in 1968; during the next thirty years a total of fourteen films were made.
A Norwegian version of the film series was also made (a total of 14 films from 1969 to 1999), in most cases based directly on the scripts for the Danish films. Later, starting in 1981, Sweden also produced their own version: Jönssonligan.
Plot
Most of the films start with Egon coming out of jail and being enthusiastically welcomed by Benny and Kjeld. The three men will then have a beer together in the living room of Kjeld's home in Valby, where Egon will inform their friends of their latest plan, for making them millionaires. Plans are often two-step plans, where the first heist will get the equipment for the real, second plan. The plans usually feature everyday artifacts such as Lego, party balloons, cigarettes, etc., which are then brought together in surprising ways in elaborate and well-timed plans, often including clever social engineering. Bennys function in the heists, besides get-away-driver, is picking locks and starting machinery using "The Thing", a specially shaped brass piece used for manipulating machinery and opening doors.
Egon often serves time with lawyers or executives who provide them with the information they need, such as duty rosters for the national public record office. Egon is also a brilliant safecracker, operating manually, specializing in the fictive "Franz Jäger" brand.
Egon's plans often bring the gang into perilously close contact with white-collar criminals from the Danish business (and political) elite. For example, in the ninth installment named "Olsen-banden deruda" well-connected people try to make money out of the so-called "butter mountain", a huge amount of butter bought up and stored by the EEC (now the EU) to keep prices up. Egon Olsen learns about this from a lawyer who is serving prison time, and the gang interferes with the plan to secure the millions for themselves. But as always, Egon – after having succeeded with a genius plan – fails for a variety of reasons, for instance underestimating the power and unscrupulousness of these people, bad luck, interference from Kjeld's wife Yvonne, or other surprising elements. For several movies, the role of the antagonist was filled by CEO Hallandsen of the fictive, multinational company Hallandsen Inc. - or variations thereof.
Egon is usually arrested in the end, for various reasons: scapegoat, bad luck, some irrelevant crime, or even turning themselves in as a matter of honor.
A recurring part of the film is making fun of Danish authorities, especially the police. In some earlier installments, the clumsy Police Inspector Mortensen is used for slapstick comic relief; they are later replaced by Superintendent Jensen, an older, troubled man who has seen better days.  They are a resigned character who despises the Danish government as they often criticize Hallandsen crimes going unnoticed and mentions to their assistant, Inspector Holm: "The only thing the police can do when the real big criminals come by is offer them protection!" Jensen incredulously uses the recurring exclamation "Bagmændene!" (Behind-men/Big Fishes) to reference the in-joke of powerful players moving outside of the law.
In the early installments, profanity and soft-erotica (scantily-clad women) were more freely used than in later ones, where said content was somewhat watered down to suit younger viewers.
Later movies focused on the satirical interplay between Jensen and Holm and Egon and their crew, with a frequent outburst of anger from Egon. Their long list of slurs is especially famous, like "social democrats!", "insane woman!" (to Yvonne), "lousy amateurs!", "cowards!", "dog heads!", "porridge peasants!", "sop!", "scumbags!", to name a few.
Characters
Recurring characters in the Danish version:
Egon Olsen: Gang leader, expert safecracker, brilliant but short-tempered and occasionally overdramatic
Benny Frandsen: Gang member, get-away driver, always cheerful and handles practical stuff
Kjeld Jensen: Gang member, tool master, ever nervous and humble, but does on a rare occasion rise to meet any challenge
Yvonne Jensen: Kjeld's very bossy wife, often with firm plans on how to use the millions from the various plans
Børge Jensen: Kjeld and Yvonne's son, occasionally an impeccable part of the schemes
Dynamite Harry: Benny's brother, explosives expert (at least in their own opinion) and deeply alcoholic
Jensen: Superintendent at Copenhagen Police, somewhat disillusioned and mostly forgotten by the brass in their basement office
Holm: Detective with Copenhagen Police, young and with high ambitions, but somewhat naive
Mortensen: An overambitious but very clumsy inspector with Copenhagen Police appearing in the early films
Holm-Hansen/Bang-Johansen/Hallandsen: A role with the same actor playing various villains, always on top of the social hierarchy, most often also with international contacts
King and Knight: A confidence trickster and their violent nephew
Bøffen (The Beef): Enforcer and muscleman for Hallandsen and others
Hansen: Rival gang leader with theme music from Bob le flambeur
International versions
The Olsen Gang have been made in Norwegian and Swedish (Jönssonligan) versions too. While both remakes follow a generally similar formula to the Danish films, the Swedish version diverges considerably from the Danish original in terms of storylines and character development.
Norwegian Olsenbanden
The Norwegian remakes were, with two exceptions, directed by Knut Bohwim based on Balling and Bahs's original scripts with minor adaptations to Norwegian conditions. For example, some names of the main characters were changed: Kjeld became Kjell, Yvonne became Valborg, and Børge became Basse. The character of Benny's brother, Dynamite Harry, was used much more often in the Norwegian films than in the original Danish series, with six appearances.
Swedish Jönssonligan
In the Swedish version, the Egon character is called Charles-Ingvar "Sickan" Jönsson, with a slightly different costume and mannerisms, and was a huge success for the actor Gösta Ekman until the actor got tired of the character and left the series. Benny's character was named (Ragnar) Vanheden, a small-timer from Stockholm, played by Ulf Brunnberg. Kjeld's character was named Rocky, but appeared only in the first two films. From the second film, the character Dynamit-Harry played by Björn Gustafson (who has had rather minor parts in the original Danish films) was featured instead. Although starting out as a strict remake, after a while the franchise started writing their own scripts.
The Swedish franchise eventually expanded into movies of the band as young kids: Lilla Jönssonligan (little Jönsson band) with four features to date.
There was also an attempt to reboot the franchise, featuring brand-new actors in the adult roles. Jönssonligan – Den perfekta stöten (2015) was released to middling reviews and poor box office.
Danish films
The first thirteen films were directed by Erik Balling, while Tom Hedegaard and Morten Arnfred directed the fourteenth and final Olsen Gang film. The scripts were written by Balling and Henning Bahs, who also worked as a production designer.

Several elements recur in the film series. As the Japanese carmaker Toyota was usually the main sponsor of the film series, most cars, including the villain's cars, the security cars, the police cars, the gang's car, civilian cars parked on the sidewalks, etc., were supplied by the company. Models include the Crown as taxis, Toyota Cressida as police cars, Hiace as security vans and money transports, and so on. There have been exceptions, notably Olsenbandens aller siste kupp (The Olsen-Gang's Very Last Coup) from 1982, which was sponsored by Datsun.
In 2022, a film reboot with a new team of actors was released, where the Olsen Gang make plans to steal the painting The Scream from the Munch Museum.

In popular culture
The popularity of the film series inspired a Norwegian restaurant chain, Egon, with the logo alluding to Egon Olsen's iconic hat and cigar.
Semic published five Norwegian comic albums featuring the Olsen Gang, eight original stories, starting with "Olsenbanden raner hurtigruta!"'' published in 1983.
In June 2019, the Norwegian Postal service issued two stamps to celebrate the first film's 50th anniversary. The domestic stamp depicts Egon leaving prison, which is the opening scene in most of the films. The European stamp shows the whole gang, including Harry and Valborg.

Donald McKenzie (16 June 1783 – 20 January 1851) was a Scottish-Canadian explorer, fur trader and Governor of the Red River Colony from 1821 to 1834.
Early life
Born in Scotland, McKenzie emigrated to Canada about 1800. They and 2 or three of their brothers became involved in the fur trade and were engaged with the North West Company. In 1810, they left the employ of the North West Company to become a partner in the Pacific Fur Company (PFC), financed solely by John Jacob Astor.
Pacific Fur Company
McKenzie traveled west from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific Northwest with an expedition of fellow PFC employees. The group divided after experiencing hard times in southern Idaho. McKenzie's fraction, consisting of twelve total, struck north, eventually finding the Salmon River and Clearwater River. They proceeded down the lower Snake River and Columbia River by canoe, and were the first of the Overland Astorians to reach Fort Astoria, on January 18, 1812.
McKenzie spent two years exploring and trading for the Pacific Fur Company in the Willamette Valley, along the Columbia River, in eastern Washington and in northern and central Idaho. When the PFC sold its assets and stations to the North West Company in 1813, McKenzie was appointed to carry all important papers back east, which they did in 1814.
Fort Nez Percés and Idaho explorations
After a short time, McKenzie became reacquainted with the North West Company, and returned to the Columbia region in 1816. In 1818, they and Alexander Ross built Fort Nez Percés near the confluence of the Columbia River and Walla Walla River. McKenzie and their trappers made the first extensive exploration of what is now southern Idaho starting in 1818, with annual expeditions continuing through 1821. Their trapping ventures covered most present-day southern Idaho as well as parts of eastern Oregon, northern Utah and western Wyoming. Many of the names for rivers in this region can be traced to this period.
Governor of the Red River Colony
With the merger of the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, McKenzie was appointed Governor of the Red River Colony. They left the Pacific Northwest and moved to Fort Garry for a decade, serving as governor of the area including most of present-day Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, Canada.
Legacy
In 1834, McKenzie retired and moved to Mayville, New York, where they lived for the next two decades. Among the distinguished visitors McKenzie entertained and advised were Daniel Webster and William H. Seward, both of whom later served as United States Secretary of State. They gave advice on where the international boundary should be established for Oregon, and also may have planted the seeds that led to the purchase of Alaska from Russia. McKenzie Pass and the McKenzie River in Oregon are named for him.

"Aftermath" is a song by American pop vocalist and American Idol season eight runner-up Adam Lambert. The song was written by Lambert, Alisan Porter, Ferras, Ely Rise and produced by Howard Benson for Lambert's debut album, For Your Entertainment. It was released as a charity single on March 10, 2011.
Background
'Aftermath' is a rock-anthem that shows off Lambert's spectacular range - with their lower register very prominent and their now-familiar riffing on the high notes.
The uplifting message in the lyrics to 'Aftermath' is touching without being sappy. It is, as Lambert has said, a self-empowerment anthem. "And what better song to bring attention to the Trevor Project while also providing encouragement and support to LGBTQ youth and anyone with self-esteem issues[?]"
Critical reception
The album version received mixed reviews. Slant Magazine praised the vocals: "he favorably recalls some of the strongest '80s hair-metal vocalists like Axl Rose and David Coverdale. It's a style that suits Lambert well since it capitalizes on their vocal power and their flair for the dramatic." Allmusic called this song "anonymous" and "anthemic AAA pop." Detroit News disliked this song:"less effective than others (...) kind of "keep pushing on" claptrap every "Idol" album seems to be saddled with." Huffington Post wasn't positive and compared: "perhaps the lone glaringly weak track, hearkening regrettable Idol anthems like "No Boundaries."
However, the remix version was met with positive reviews. Robbie Daw from Idolator said, "We're digging the dreamy feel of the Billboard remix of "Aftermath," particularly the parts where Adam's upper range is more prevalent. That said, we love the album version, too, and we really can't place one above the other." Pat Ryder said, "Maybe it's not perfect, but overall 'Aftermath: Remix' is a good effort by Billboard. Clearly Lambert is happy with the mix and eager to promote it to bring attention to the universal message and to the Trevor Project".
Live performances
The song was performed on Lambert's 2010 Glam Nation Tour during the "ballad" section of the show. Lambert also performed an acoustic rendition of the song on American Idol in 2011.

, sometimes , is a yōkai, or Japanese monster, composed of smoke and darkness. It was first featured in the Konjaku Hyakki Shūi, circa 1781.
Mythology
Enenras mostly reside in bonfires; when they emerge, they take human shape or form. It is said that an enenra can only be seen by the pure of heart.
Enenras are mostly considered to be demons or divine beings of darkness and smoke; legend says that there are two types of enenras, the first and most common type being enenras who are born purely as enenras, whilst the second and more rarely occurring type are humans who have died and been transformed into enenras.
Popular culture
In the 2011 video game Mortal Kombat, the character Smoke (who makes their first human appearance in the game in almost two decades) is an enenra.
In the 2020 video game Nioh 2, Enenra is featured as one of the game's many yōkai bosses.

Live from Mountain Stage was the first posthumous album release by Bronx-born musician Laura Nyro and their third officially released live album.
The short ten-song live album was recorded as part of the Mountain Stage radio series in late 1990 and features a fairly generic set list that Nyro stuck to for much of their later career. The songs are a mix of songs from their later career as well as some of their more familiar songs and soul medleys.
The album was released on the independent label Blue Plate to mixed reaction from fans and critics, but it paved the way for the following year's posthumous album of new material, Angel in the Dark.

An andiron or firedog, fire-dog or fire dog is a bracket support, normally found in pairs, on which logs are laid for burning in an open fireplace, so that air may circulate under the firewood, allowing better burning and less smoke. They generally consist of a tall vertical element at the front, with at least two legs. This stops the logs from rolling out into the room, and may be highly decorative. The other element is one or more low horizontal pieces stretching back and serving to hold the logs off the bottom of the fireplace. An andiron is sometimes called a dog or dog-iron.
Before the Renaissance, European andirons were almost invariably made entirely of iron and were of comparatively plain design. Indeed, andirons and firebacks were one of the first types of object to be commonly made in cast iron, a trend which in England began in the 1540s: until the nineteenth century cast iron was too brittle for many uses, but andirons carried light loads and this was not a problem. However, from the Renaissance onwards the front vertical element was increasingly given decorative treatment, and was in a different metal, such as brass, bronze or silver, which allowed casting, hugely increasing the range of decorative possibilities. When metals that could be cast began to be used for the fronts, these ordinary objects of the household received the attention of the artist, and had skill and taste lavished upon them. Thus English late 17th-century andirons often have elaborate flat brass front pieces, often in openwork and sometimes using enamel for further decoration.
By the eighteenth century classical forms with several mouldings, similar to those used for candlesticks and the like, predominate in pieces for the middle classes, and were imitated in the American colonies, often just in iron and rather more simply. Small figures at the front also became popular; in America cast flat "Hessian" soldiers were a long-lasting favourite. In Continental Europe, men such as Jean Berain, whose artistry was most especially applied to the ornamentation of Boulle furniture, sometimes designed them. The Algardi Firedogs commissioned from the Roman sculptor Alessandro Algardi for Philip IV of Spain by Velasquez in 1650 were copied in several foundries.
The andiron reached its greatest artistic development under Louis XIV of France. From the eighteenth century, fireplaces increasingly had built-in metal grates to hold the firewood, or, increasingly, the coal, up off the floor and in place, thus largely removing the need for andirons. However, andirons were often still kept for decorative reasons, and sometimes as a place to rest pokers, tongs and other fire implements. In older periods andirons were used as a rest for a roasting spit; and sometimes included a cup-shaped top to hold porridge. Sometimes, smaller pairs were placed between the main andirons for smaller fires. These are called "creepers".
Usage
Andirons and fire dogs are devices made of metal and (rarely) ceramic which support the firewood. They normally stand upon short legs and are usually connected with an upright guard. The guard keeps the logs in the fireplace as they burn and settle. This guard, which may be of iron, steel, copper, bronze, or silver, may be simple, or elaborately ornamented (often with patterns or heraldic ornaments, such as the fleur-de-lis, with sphinxes, grotesque animals, mythological statuettes, or caryatides supporting heroic figures or emblems). A common decoration in the form of a canine plays on the dual meanings of the word dog (canine and inanimate holder or blocker).
Etymology
The word andiron was borrowed into Middle English from the Old French word andier (also found in medieval Latin in forms such as andena, anderia, anderius). The origin of the French word is uncertain. But in English the word soon became associated with the word iron through folk-etymology, producing the form andiron. Sometimes this was further folk-etymologised as hand-iron. Due to the reanalysis of the French form l'andier ('the andiron') as one word, the French term later became landier, giving rise to English forms such as landiron.
The term firedog seems to arise from the perceived similarity of an andiron to a dog lying by the fire. In English, however, this form may also have been influenced by French: another French term for an andiron is chenet, which originally meant 'little dog'.
History
Andirons, or fire dogs, had been in use by the Ancient Greeks, and were called krateutai (Greek: κρατευταί). Excavations made on the Greek island of Santorini unearthed stone sets of firedogs used before the seventeenth century BC. In each pair of the supports, the receptacles to hold skewers or spits were found in equivalence, while the line of small openings in the base formed a mechanism to supply the coals with oxygen so that they remained alight during its use.
Fire dogs were also referred to as moon idols (or moon horns) in antiquity. They may also refer to an artifact-type of late Bronze Age Europe (c. 1300 to 800 BC). Typically made of clay, they have been found in areas of modern France, Switzerland and Germany; often associated with the Urnfield culture. This naming suggests that moon idols could have been used as andirons to build up fire dogs.
In some cases, moon idols are a cult item of Early European Religions, resembling a pair of horns or crescent moons on a pedestal, and were variously interpreted as testifying to Bull worship, Moon worship, or as a holder for wooden logs to be used in a fire altar.
Medieval andirons tended to be high, often with slots at the front for placing spits for roasting; in later periods similar styles remained in use in large kitchens. When the Italian Renaissance began to produce very elaborate decorated fronts for reception rooms, these remained higher than later, gradually tending to reduce in height until the 18th century.
Firedogs with little or no ornamentation and made of metal or ceramics were used in kitchens, with ratcheted uprights for the spits. Very often these uprights branched out into arms, or hobs, for stewing or keeping food hot.

Robert Guillaumont (born 26 February 1933 in Lyon) is a French chemist and honorary professor at the University of Paris-Saclay in Orsay (1967-1998), Member of the French Academy of Sciences and the French Academy of Technologies
Career
Robert Guillaumont is a specialist in radiochemistry and actinide chemistry. They prepared their doctorate at the Institut radium de Paris, Curie Laboratory, University of Paris VI (1966). They continued their research in this Institute and then at the Radiochemistry Laboratory of the Orsay (1968–98), which they directed for twelve years (1979–90). They taught chemistry/radiochemistry at the University of Paris XI-Orsay (1967–98). Their expertise covers the chemistry of the nuclear fuel cycle (from uranium mining to waste management and spent fuel reprocessing) and nuclear energy issues. They have been a member or chairperson of numerous French and international committees dealing with the nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear energy, radioactive waste management and the synthesis and use of radionuclides for medicine. They were a member of the National Commission for the Evaluation of Research on Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Waste (1994-2019).
Research
Robert Guillaumont began their research in 1959 on the chemistry of protactinium in solution. They showed that the electronic filling of the 5f underlay begins for this element. The UV absorption spectrum of Pa4+ is typical of a 5f16d1 transition (Pa atom: 5f26d17s2). Together with their collaborators, they extended their methodology for studying the behaviour of radioelements in imponderable quantities to other actinides. The rest of their work can be linked to the common thread of the consequences of filling the atomic underlayer 5f on the physicochemical properties of actinides. This filling plays an essential role in the behaviour of the 15 actinides, especially when these electrons are delocalized, from protactinium (Pa) to americium (Am). This results in a high richness of oxidation degrees of the first actinides (usually from 3 to 6) and in the manifestation of particular effects in the series (electronic states characterized by the quantum number J). Thus, they studied the thermodynamic consequences of the population of sublayer 5f on a series of solution complexes (citric complexes of trivalent actinides from Am to fermium (Fm). They showed the existence of the "tetrad effect" for trivalent actinide complexes, an effect that reflects an extra-stabilization of the fundamental state of actinides for 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of the filling of the 5f underlay. After the curium (Cm), it is necessary, to carry out experiments, to synthesize isotopes of berkelium (Bk), einstenium (Es) and Fm by nuclear reactions with particle accelerators, and separate them from irradiated targets, which they did at Orsay. To conduct most of their research they developed the methodology for studying species and equilibria between species in extremely diluted solutions (which radioactivity allows until about 10−14 M), and they pushed, at the theoretical level, the description of the thermodynamic behaviour of a few atoms in terms of deviation from the law of mass action, which gave a foundation to chemical experiments on elements 6d (Z>103), produced atom by radiochemists at accelerators.
At the same time, they participated in the study of thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of elements 5f (and 4f) in connection with electronic transfers between these elements and their environment: covalence in two-phase solvent extraction systems and crystal field effect on solids, in particular single crystals examined at 4 K.
Finally, they continued their research on the fundamental problems of radionuclide migration in the environment (speciation, concentration effect, retention on colloids) and selective separation of actinides/lanthanides from the elements constituting spent nuclear fuel. R. Guillaumont's research themes are upstream of the much chemistry/radiochemistry problems encountered in "nuclear": chemistry of actinides from uranium to curium in the various stages of nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste management.
They have published more than 200 scientific articles, popular articles and has written several books.

The UTK Agriculture Farm Mound site is an archaeological site on the agriculture campus of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. The site is a burial mound made by people of the Woodland period, and has been dated as early as ca. 644 AD. Today, the site is a landmark on the UTK campus and is listed in the National Register for Historic Places.
Location
The site is located at the Agricultural Campus at the corner of Joe Johnson Drive and Chapman Drive. In 2011, a garden was built around the site to protect it from "construction damage" and attract interest and attention to the mound. The design of the garden was developed by Hendrik van de Werken and Don Williams, professors of Ornamental Horticulture and Landscape Design at UT, and was revised by Sam Rogers, who is an associate professor in the Department of Plant Sciences. The president of the Tennessee Chapter of Gamma Sigma Delta (The Honor Society of Agriculture), Fred Allen, proposed the project to the UT Chapter in 2008 "as a long term service project to enhance the educational opportunities and aesthetic beauty of the site". Project directors enlisted the help of the Eastern Cherokee tribe and Tribal Historic Preservation. Principal Chief Michell Hicks attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and elder Mertyl Driver blessed the site.
According to the UT Institute of Agriculture, "The goal of the project is to honor the Native American tradition dating back to 644 A.D. when the Woodland People used burial mounds as a way of burying and honoring their deceased." The mound is considered a valuable piece of the UT Gardens.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations was a British Cabinet minister responsible for dealing with the United Kingdom's relations with members of the Commonwealth of Nations (its former colonies). The minister's department was the Commonwealth Relations Office (CRO).
The position was created in 1947 out of the old positions of Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and Secretary of State for India. In 1966, the position was merged with that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies to form that of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, which was in turn merged with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1968 to create the new position of Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the equivalent position today being the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs.

Critical reception
The Spinning Image wrote: "The film as a whole is more cheap than cheerful. What makes it worthwhile is seeing the energy of Randle when they are allowed free-rein. They must have been able to work a theatre audience brilliantly by the flash of an eye or a knowing grin. It's a great pity that their performances haven't been better preserved for posterity (we have only one sound recording of them working live in 1938)."
