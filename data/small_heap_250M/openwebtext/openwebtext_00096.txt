Chico >> Frustrated by what he calls a worsening bicycle theft problem in the city of Chico, William Caput decided to take action.
For about four hours on Saturday, Caput and several others planted a “bait bike” at several locations in the city, including outside grocery stores and in the downtown area, watching through binoculars and waiting for a thief to cut the bike's inexpensive lock and ride away.
No one bit. But if someone had, Caput said this is what would have happened.
Caput would get in a nearby car, radio a mobile team comprising two bicyclists and start to follow the suspect from a safe distance. Someone would be filming the scene from the car, and police would be called.
“Hopefully they (would) respond in a timely manner,” said Caput, a 38-year-old father who works on network security at Build.com.
The civilian bait bike operation, which has been discouraged by the Chico Police Department, is the latest manifestation of the frustration some feel toward what they see as a growing bike theft problem in the city.
Caput's operation was initially advertised on the Facebook group Chico Stolen Bike, which comprises more than 1,000 members who discuss and post pictures of suspected bike thieves, photos of their own stolen bikes or found bikes.
The group encourages forwarding information to police and discourages the promotion of “vigilante actions,” according to one of the group's administrators.
Caput said he was amazed to see the number of suspected bike thefts occurring in broad daylight when he joined the group about two months ago. And then news broke in June that a “ghost bike” honoring the memory of Kristina Chesterman was stolen from the corner of Nord Avenue and First Street, where the 21-year-old Chico State University nursing student was killed by a drunken driver in 2013.
“That was kind of a tipping point for me,” Caput said. “I found that very offensive and just completely wrong.”
Caput lamented what he saw as inaction on the Facebook group, as well as from the Police Department and City Council.
“You can either lead, follow or get out of the way,” he said. “Cliche, but … someone needs to take the lead on it.”
Police response
The idea of a civilian bait bike operation hasn't been welcomed by law enforcement. Chico police Lt. Rob Merrifield said while he appreciates the energy spent on the issue, the department's position is that it's a “very bad idea.”
Merrifield said people could get hurt or be placed in a position to take on a civil liability. He added that officers may not be able to immediately respond to a call regarding a bike theft in progress, as it may be a lower priority compared to a separate crime.
He did say, however, that bike thefts have been a growing problem over the last year.
From January to the end of May, 168 bike thefts were reported to the Police Department, according to numbers provided to this newspaper by police. During the same period in 2014, 149 thefts were reported.
Merrifield would neither confirm nor deny if the Police Department is operating its own bait bike program, but he did say he believes arresting a few people for bike thefts wouldn't solve the problem.
“I think where we make the most impact is prevention and education,” he said, adding that making the public aware of the problem, identifying ways to prevent bikes from being stolen and helping return bikes to their owners is key.
To that end, acquiring a bicycle license through the city's Finance Department or even having a bike's serial number handy can help officers return the roughly 50 bikes the Police Department takes in per month, Merrifield said. Further, if bikes aren't reported stolen, officers can't prove the suspected stolen bikes they come across in the field have actually been stolen.
Caput said when he initially floated the idea of a civilian bait bike operation on the Chico Stolen Bike Facebook group, it was met with support as well as criticism. But he intends to bolster the operation with the hope of deterring bike thefts within the city.
Caput added that it's no one's intention to approach a suspected bike thief in the act, but doing nothing is “not an excuse.”
“We already live in a society where if an accident happens, people pull out their phones and film it instead of helping the victim,” Caput said, adding, “And if the police want that type of community, these police need to move and work in a different community.”

You've heard it all before, I'm sure, but I'm going to say it again, in case you've been blocking it out, or in case no one told you, somehow. Let's start at the beginning.
If you are a hockey fan, you probably watch the NHL. The on-ice product combines over a century of history and mystique with extremely high level talent and accessibility over a variety of mediums. The NHL fan community is strong, widespread, loyal, and engaged. I love hockey because of the NHL-- but the NHL itself has some problems, by nature because it has become an enormous brand and multinational corporation in a society that is inherently biased towards men and that distributes wealth in transparently unconscionable ways.
We love our favorite NHLers. They're (usually) not bad guys by any means. They are Phil Kessel's Twitter bio -- they're nice guys, they try hard, and they love the game.
They also own Porsches, build mansions, and at the very least have an entire brilliant staff managing their equipment and carrying their bags for them.
Would you still do your job at the highest possible level if you weren't getting paid to do it?
By nature, professional sports can be somewhat infantilizing, enabling poor attitudes and bad behavior, but the NHL is somewhat of a dark horse among professional sports in North America in that its cultural climate encourages humility. This may be because hockey is a team sport that requires more cohesion and actual teamwork than most other games do. But it's also why outspoken, strong-willed Joshua Ho-Sang was apparently considered too risky to be invited to Team Canada camps. "If I am a problem child, that means they don't like problems, that they have an issue with fixing things, that they like when things are easy. That actually means that they don't possess the ability to develop and that they are just taking players to fit their role that have been developed somewhere else," said Ho-Sang in and interview with TSN, quoted in the linked piece.
It's true--men's hockey culture really doesn't like to fix things. Ho-Sang has a certain astuteness about the nature of change that most kids his age don't have. And we live in a cultural climate and power structure where silence is rewarded, and where change comes slowly, if at all, well after everyone has already realized that something is (for lack of a better term) kind of fucked up.
I could go on and try to philosophically break down the nature of athlete culture and celebrity culture and what its function is in society, but I won't, because that's way beside the point I want to make here. I love hockey, I watch hockey because I love it; it's a form of entertainment that I dig, as many of you do as well. Let's just accept that part as an established truth.
So, let's talk about how the NHL treats us, the fans, its loyal consumers, all in an effort to protect their brand and corporation.
The NHL allowed four strikes/lockouts over the course of a mere 20 years. This means that the NHL player's union (the NHLPA) and the League's owners could not settle the players' collective bargaining agreement. In the most recent lockout, pretty much everyone involved in these messy labor negotiations on both sides was a millionaire, and most of the sticking points ended up being about money: how much people were going to get, what percentages of it would go where and to whom, and when they were going to get it.
The NHL expands to markets that can't financially sustain their own operations, greatly diluting the talent pool available to each team and funneling tens of millions of dollars into failing enterprises on a regular basis; meanwhile the ownership of big-market teams lines their pockets.
The NHL let a dangerous culture of fighting become the norm, to the point that otherwise intelligent people really believed it wasn't dangerous. People literally had to die in order to change the conversation about it. 2011 was a summer of death among NHL enforcers: Derek Boogaard (accidental overdose), Wade Belak (possible accident or possible suicide), and Rick Rypien (suicide). At the time, everyone, including NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, was quick to say that the link between the enforcer role and head injuries, depression, and substance abuse was tenuous at best. However, the subsequent near-disappearance of enforcers from the NHL feels like a much-too-late acknowledgement of the problem and desperately insufficient tribute to their memories.
Oh yeah, and all of these people are still getting paid a lot of money.
Would you still do your job at the highest possible level if you weren't getting paid to do it?
In the 2014 Sochi Olympics, Canada won the gold medal in both men's and women's ice hockey. For the men, the gold-medal-winning goal was scored by Jonathan Toews, a 26-year-old who at the time had been playing in the NHL for nearly 7 years. In the 2014-15 season, he stands to make $6.3 million dollars. The year after, he'll make $10.5 million, every year until 2023.
The game, by the way, was a cruise of a win for Team Canada. They beat Sweden 3-0. Team Sweden was no slouch, but Team Canada made it look easy. Down 2-0 going into the third period, Sweden managed a mere 4 shots before the end of the game.
The women's gold medal game was a hard-fought affair between Team Canada and Team USA. It was easily one of the greatest hockey games played in years--perhaps of all time. Team USA led 2-0 on goals from Meghan Duggan and Alex Carpenter until only three and a half minutes remained. Canada managed to tie it with 55 seconds to go, and went on to win in overtime. The player who won the game--who also scored the game-tying goal--was Marie-Philip Poulin. Oh, and she also scored the only two goals for Canada when they won the Olympic gold medal in 2010 in Vancouver, also against the USA. Marie-Philip Poulin, at the time of her second career "golden goal", was a senior at Boston University.

"Make us look cool," Hilary Knight said to me when I met her after an exhibition game at BU's Walter Brown Arena in October. Knight is a forward for the Boston Blades of the Canadian Women's Hockey League, and an Olympic silver medalist. I had just introduced myself to her and told her I would be writing about the Blades for Stanley Cup of Chowder.
"You are cool," I blurted. "No, seriously." Knight's tone had been deadpan; she was serious about her request, but it was a self-assured one. She seemed to mean: figure out how to show everyone else how cool we already are.
This was my first Blades game, by the way, and it was an exhibition match that didn't count for either the Blades or the BU Terriers. But the tenor of the game was intense and practiced. Both teams played hard and energetically in a way that was markedly different from NHL games I've seen--some of which have been pretty intense themselves. Maybe it was the fact that it was quiet. Maybe it was the fact that the players are engaged in what they are doing without the benefit of spectatorship. In the NHL, players must develop a Panopticon-style awareness that they are being watched at all times. Women's hockey is a slowly growing sport, and the players are achieving transcendent athletic prowess and playing an astonishingly exciting brand of hockey--while seemingly no one is watching.
Knight's comment was related to a perceived image problem with the CWHL, which is that no one is aggressively selling the fact that it's good. The CWHL seems to approach its product with a strange kind of self-consciousness, almost as if they are unaware that their teams are actually a tightly-knit community of collegiate and high school superstars, Olympians, and passionate staff that men's hockey really can only dream of having at such a pervasive level. Elena at Watch This Hockey wrote an articulate plea to the CWHL asking them to tell people about what the league actually is--exciting, elite talent.
The CWHL seems to approach its product with a strange kind of self-consciousness.
Elena also mentions the "rec league" atmosphere. It's getting better, it seems, in the last few years, but that comparison is legit. After every CWHL game, the players carry their own gear out of the building, through the same doors the fans use. Lots of kids come out for these games. The players mingle with the fans afterwards. When an autograph session was announced after the Blades' home opener (this year at the Clark Athletic Center at UMass Boston), I thought it was because it was the home opener. But they announced it again the next day, too. (In two games over the weekend of November 15-16, the Blades scored 11 goals and thoroughly trounced the Toronto Furies. To call it impressive would be an understatement.)
People have been writing about the magic of the CWHL for awhile now. The league is in its eighth season. In December 2012, with the NHL stuck in its 2012-2013 lockout, Steve Wulf wrote about attending a Blades game at the Veterans Arena in Somerville for espnW: "Once the puck is dropped, you realize you've been let in on a secret. Even though the teams are playing their third game in 42 hours, the speed and stickwork are breath-taking."
At the exact same time (literally, three days prior), SBNation published a detailed profile of then-new Blades' coach Digit Murphy by WBUR's Bill Littlefield. One of the final paragraphs of that article sticks in my chest like an arrow, because it's so painfully true:
The larger context matters to Murphy, because she understands the challenge she has accepted with the Blades as part of a more ambitious struggle. "It's about how women value themselves, and how society values women," she says. "We have to value our athletes for the sport they play. You're not gonna get things unless you ask 'Why not?' It's about how you value yourself."
And that's the great thing about the CWHL, the reason why I couldn't stop myself from telling Hilary Knight that she was cool. These women, preeminent athletes in their sport, have come to value themselves on their own merit, rather than by who is watching and how much they are paid. Unlike the kids you see pulling on jerseys as their mothers cry at the NHL draft, they haven't been raised in a society that treats what they love to do as an opportunity to make millions of dollars, let alone a viable career choice. It isn't. Yet.
I can also fully recognize the irony of what I want, as a female hockey fan and writer who wants to get as many people interested in the CWHL as possible: the complaints I have about the NHL are proportional and related to its size and revenue focus. All good things come to an end, and wealth breeds corruption. Media saturation makes the NHL a lesser product, an enterprise first and a sport second. And everyone knows the old cliche, said about everything from your favorite band to the Los Angeles Kings: "I liked them before they were cool." Well, the CWHL is cool, by mere virtue of the fact that it doesn't need you to tell it that it is.
But I don't see a dystopian future in which the CWHL has become as diluted and messy and money-driven as the NHL has become--simply because all the key figures in the sport know what true value is. They've already learned the hard way how to be who they are. It took hundreds of years of male-dominated Western culture to create the NHL. In just eight years, the CWHL has become something even better. Whether it can actually, realistically become popular the way the men's sport has become is, of course, a difficult question. We show up to NHL games because they are ubiquitous and inescapable, as is the information and journalism about them. You have to ask yourself "why not?" but you also have to ask "why?" in the first place. Why? Because the CWHL is, at this point, more competitive than the NHL, because the CWHL is a more concentrated pool of extremely elite talent, because each game, even in the regular season (hell, even in exhibition) is played with toughness and focus.
I'm not trying to dump on the NHL, necessarily. I watch and love the NHL; I'll probably be a Penguins fan until I die. I'm not suggesting that anyone stop watching the NHL, not by any means. But if you have a chance, you should try going out for a CWHL game on a Saturday night instead of staying in and watching men's hockey. Lots of other people will be watching the NHL regular season in your stead and be able to fill you in later.
As I try to recap Boston Blades games in a journalistic sense, I find myself struggling to convey how actually wonderful the experience of a Blades game is. But I'm going to keep trying. This is a sweet spot for the Canadian Women's Hockey League. I would urge you not to miss it, especially if you live in or near a CWHL city (right now, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, Brampton, or Calgary). You will be surprised at what you see, who you meet, and how good it feels to be involved in a venture that is at once unpretentious and enthusiastic.
As I've mentioned here in the past, the CWHL season streaming package consisting of 23 live games over the course of the season is available for just $10CAD.
All Calgary Inferno home games have free live audio coverage, available at cwhl.ca.
All single game tickets are $15CAD and available for purchase online via credit card, with instant printout for e-tickets.
A season pass to all home games is available for each team at a cost of $140CAD.
Like it or not, if you're not watching the CWHL, you're missing out. We're reaching an era where an increased understanding of feminism/equality and unprecedented ease of content delivery are combining to create real choices in how we spend our money and our time, and how we express our passions. It's still an uphill battle to achieve parity and sustainability. But if you want to see and meet people who know that, and are willing to do it anyway: go out to a CWHL game.
The list is neither long nor impressive: Maryland-Baltimore County. Belmont. Eastern Washington.
Those are the trio of notches John Thompson III and the Georgetown Hoyas have on their belt in the past decade when it matters most -- during the NCAA tournament.
"Everyone knows a change needs to be made," one former player said. "But no one will dare stand up and say it."
Editor's Picks Georgetown lost its local recruiting grip. Can John Thompson III get it back? The Hoyas are struggling through another season after failing to make last year's postseason. How can John Thompson III get things corrected?
Not with Big John Thompson, the legendary former coach and the current coach's father, around.
"Everyone is scared to death," another ex-player said.
When John Thompson III took over in 2004, replacing a train wreck of a five-plus year run by Craig Esherick, the Hoyas community rejoiced. Who better than Big John's kid to get the program back to national relevance after five years in which Esherick's teams appeared in the NCAA tournament just once?
It didn't take long, either. There was a Sweet 16 appearance in JT3's second year, and a Final Four appearance in 2007, led by Jeff Green and Roy Hibbert -- two players who had committed to the program before JT3's arrival.
But since that magical run, there just hasn't been much to justify former Hoyas being able to stick their chests out about.
Four former players spoke, but none were willing to go on the record and speak about the status of JT3 and the program.
"Loyalty and fear," one told ESPN on why they weren't willing to attach their name to anything. "Fear of Big John and where you stand. You don't mess with him."
"I'm still scared of him, and I'm a grown man now," added another.
That's part of the issue. Big John, now 75, built the Georgetown program. He guided the Hoyas to three Final Fours, a national title and 596 wins from 1972-99. The school recently named the brand-new $65 million John R. Thompson Jr., Intercollegiate Athletic Center after him. In a way, the Hall of Famer still presides over the program. He sits along the baseline for every home game at the Verizon Center. He is close with those in power at the university, including school president John J. DeGioia, who was a student at the school back when Big John was coaching. It's unlikely that any move will be made with JT3 even after what's on track to be a third time in four years in which the Hoyas -- now 14-16 overall and 5-12 in the Big East after Tuesday's 62-59 loss against Seton Hall -- won't make the NCAA tournament. Since Georgetown is a private university, contract details are not available.
The elder John Thompson declined to speak for this story. JT3 issued a statement through the Georgetown athletics department.
"First and foremost, our fans are terrific and have been terrific," he said. "They've experienced some good times with us, and now, with the stretch we are having, I understand their frustration. There is no one more frustrated than I am. We are accustomed to winning. I know that our players and staff are working hard and playing hard. No one cares more about this program and its tradition than I do."

Earlier this year, JT3 spoke of optimism. He said last season was an aberration -- that this year's Georgetown squad would get back to the tournament. He spoke about the new facility and how it would help with recruiting.
But the Hoyas (14-16, 5-12 Big East) have regressed even deeper into the depths of despair in the conference. Georgetown will finish well under .500 in the league for the second consecutive year and sit above only DePaul in the standings. The Blue Demons have just two Big East wins this season -- one coming against Georgetown.
"I love the school, and he's a really, really good man," one former Hoya said of JT3. "But he's just not getting it done."
In 2008, there was a legitimate excuse. After all, that Georgetown team ran into Davidson and a kid named Steph Curry in the NCAA tournament. Two years later, Georgetown got beat by Ohio University in the first round. In 2011, it was 11th-seeded VCU that manhandled the Hoyas by 18 in the opener. The next year it was a second-round loss to another 11-seed, this time NC State. Florida Gulf Coast, seeded 15th, showed second-seeded Georgetown the door in the first round in 2013. In 2014, the Hoyas missed the tournament. In 2015 it was a second-round out before again missing the tournament last season.
It's now been a decade since Georgetown fans had any rooting interest come the second weekend.
"How many more years are they going to give him of not making the tournament?" asked one former player.
There are five Hoyas currently in the NBA: Hibbert, Green, Greg Monroe, Otto Porter and Hollis Thompson. Again, JT3 didn't recruit Hibbert and Green. He did a terrific job evaluating Porter and beat out a ton of big boys for the Monroe, who was rated by some as the No. 1 player in the country.
But recruiting has been sub-par. Josh Hart, who helped Villanova to a national title a season ago and is a Wooden Award candidate this year, played at nearby Sidwell Friends. Kris Jenkins, who made the title-winning shot for the Wildcats in April, went to Gonzaga Prep in Washington, D.C.
The Hoyas landed six players in ESPN's Top 100 from 2012-14. Three transferred -- Isaac Copeland (Nebraska), Paul White (Oregon) and Stephen Domingo (Cal) -- out of the program. Reggie Cameron barely plays. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera was productive, and so is current Hoya L.J. Peak.

Two of the former players maintain that JT3 and his staff -- which has seen turnover in recent years -- doesn't recruit to its system.
"He still tries to recruit high-level guys, regardless of the fit," one player said. "He needs high-skilled guys, not necessarily the top talent. Obviously, some of the guys fit well -- but most of them don't.
"Georgetown actually looks like the team the Princeton offense was actually built to beat."
This is a proud program with tradition. Big John made the Hoyas a national name and brought in big-time pros -- Patrick Ewing, Allen Iverson, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo -- to play for Georgetown.
But now the talent isn't all that's dwindling. Fan apathy has set in as well. From 2007 to 2011, Georgetown was drawing in excess of 12,000 to the 20,000-plus seat Verizon Center. For the past two seasons, it's been less than half-full. There have been "Fire Thompson" chants heard throughout the building this season, and a petition has spread to spearhead the movement for a coaching change.
Even the student newspaper has turned on JT3, with a recent column saying it's time to make a move.
Georgetown is not feared, respected nor nationally relevant anymore. We, the students, are all too aware; it is the athletic department, DeGioia and Thompson who choose to remain blissfully ignorant.
-- Chris Balthazard and Michael Ippolito wrote in The Hoya last week
Alumni want Final Four appearances again -- or, at the very least, NCAA tournament berths. Instead, they will likely be watching a handful or Big East teams not named Georgetown hear their names called on Selection Sunday.
"It's embarrassing," one former player said. "And something needs to be done."
But with that security blanket -- Big John sitting along the baseline, his name affixed to the practice facility -- casting a mammoth shadow around the program, it doesn't appear that a change is likely anytime soon.
Bronson Arroyo enjoys pitching for the Reds and "would love to retire in this uniform," but the veteran right-hander stressed that he was looking for more than a one-year contract on the free agent market this winter in an interview with Pete McCarthy and various fans during an MLB.com Chatting Cage segment (MLB.com's Mark Sheldon and Jeremy Warnemuende have a partial transcript).
Arroyo said it would take at least a two-year deal for him to remain in Cincinnati:
"There's obviously a limit to how long we can play this game, and we're all trying to maximize our opportunities as far as money. If it wasn't for the dollar bill, I know I would be in this uniform until the day I retire, because I know they enjoy what I do around here, and what I bring to the table on and off the field and inside the locker room. But at the end of the day, dollars and cents always weigh a little heavier than anything else in life, usually.
"If my price tag is a little bit too much or they feel like they don't want to give me more than a one-year deal here, then it's going to be very difficult, because it's probably going to be the last time I have an opportunity to go out and sign a multiyear deal with a ballclub."
The Reds have enjoyed unusual durability from their starting rotation over the last two seasons, as Arroyo, Homer Bailey, Mat Latos and Mike Leake have combined to make 239 starts. Johnny Cueto was a perfect 33-for-33 in 2012 but has made multiple trips to the DL this season, opening the door for rookie Tony Cingrani to impress in his place. Cueto's health status could make the Reds think about bringing back a durable veteran like Arroyo, who has averaged 208 innings over his eight seasons in Cincinnati.
The problem could be a payroll crunch. The mid-market Reds already have $79MM committed to the 2014 payroll, and that's before counting arbitration raises to Bailey and Leake or counting what the team may have to spend to re-sign (or acquire a replacement for) Shin-Soo Choo. Cincinnati also has promising young arms like Robert Stephenson and Daniel Corcino in the farm system and Aroldis Chapman could still be converted to a starter. The Reds could prefer to spend on extending Bailey and/or Leake rather than locking up a pitcher who will be 37 next Opening Days.
That said, the Reds will get a revenue increase in the form of a new TV contract in 2016, and the Joey Votto and Brandon Phillips extensions show that the club isn't afraid to spend big on key players. Arroyo obviously isn't the class of those players, but his durability and good form will surely net him a multiyear deal from some team this winter. Arroyo has a 3.62 ERA, 5.6 K/9 and 4.15 K/BB over 179 IPs this season.
The 1.0.0 of Idris has been released just a few months back, just enough to start trying out the language and some of the possibilities dependent typing offers.
But this post is not about dependent typing. There is already a really good book that came out this year, named Type Driven Development with Idris, exploring the benefits (and trade-offs) of dependent typing. I highly recommend you to read it.
Instead, this post describes some of the pleasant surprises you get trying out Idris, coming from the Haskell world. These pleasant surprises have nothing to do with the dependent typing features. They are simple yet impacting modifications, which improve the developer experience substantially.
I listed my top 10 in the hope they will convince you to give a try at Idris.
1) Idris Strings are not lists
It does not seem like much, but Haskell Strings are such a pain to deal with, that this improvement got the first place.
Haskell String are lists of characters. This big mistake in terms of efficiency is corrected by two very good packages: Data.Text and Data.ByteString. Nevertheless, this is still a source of pain and accidental complexity:
Newcomers to Haskell almost always face the inefficiency of Strings
Strings are not first class, and forces use the Overloaded Strings extension
The code gets obscured by successive by pack and unpack calls
Idris learned from the mistakes of Haskell and made Strings first class. You can call pack and unpack strings to go back an forth to a List Char representation. This is illustrated by this simplistic implementation of the caesar cipher algorithm:
We can test this function in the REPL:
2) Overloading without Type Classes
Overloading of function has also been a subject of numerous complains in the Haskell community. Of course, we can work around the issue by using Type Classes, but this has some drawbacks as well.
Idris learned from This complains as well, and offers a kind of overloading. You can import the same name from different modules and Idris will not care, as long as it can deduce which one to use.
Even better, Idris introduce the notion of namespace, that we can use inside a module to introduce overloads. For instance, we can create a plus operator that works for both scalars and lists in the same module.
As long as Idris can deduce which overload to use, the developer does not have to prefix the symbol with the namespace:
This is a very nice improvement over Haskell rules that forbid any kind of overloading, and has nice benefits on the code:
It improves composability of software (by limiting conflicts of names)
It avoids using awkward operators to avoid ones used by other libraries
It remains safe and clear, by supporting explicit namespace prefix
3) Records fields are namespaced
The notion of namespace of Idris really shines when it comes to records. The fields of a record live in the namespace of their respective record. The net effect is that they do not collide with the names of the other records as they do in Haskell.
So we can have several records with the same field name. For instance, we define below an Account and Customer record, each having an address field:
As for the overloading rules and namespace, Idris will try to infer which function is being referred to when using the name address. Most often, the developer does not have to provide any hint.
Here is an example of function that uses both the customer address and account address to check if they both match:
This type-checks correctly. In case of ambiguous calls, you can always add the namespace as prefix to help Idris figuring your intent:
4) Records update and access syntax
Updating values in nested record does come at the cost of verbosity in Haskell. There are packages that help to navigate data structure, such as lenses, but a lot of Haskell users recognise it as a pretty big dependency.
Idris offers a lighter update syntax for the fields of nested records. We can update the address of the account of a customer that way:
Idris also offers the possibility to apply a function over a field in a nested record. For instance, we can complete (by concatenation) the address of the account of the customer with $=:
We can try both our previous function in the REPL to convince ourselves that they work properly (and they do):
This does not replace the need for lenses (which are much more general). But it is nice to count of some basic support in core Idris when we do not need that much power.
5) Monad and Functor got fixed
The Haskell Monad return is absent of Idris, and so is the fail method, which most Haskell developers recognise as being a design mistake.
In Idris, Monad extends the Applicative (as it does now in Haskell, but did not for quite a long time) and so pure makes sure that return is not needed. Since the return naming is conflicting with the return statement of many programming languages, this is one less distinction to explain to newcomers to Idris when compared to Haskell.
You can also notice the presence of join in the interface of the Monad, allowing to define whichever of bind or join is more intuitive depending on the Monad instance:
Looking at the Functor type class, fmap is renamed map in Idris. This also improves over Haskell, by avoiding the awkward explanation to newcomers to Haskell of why map is in fact named fmap for legacy reasons:
6) Laziness is opt-in, not opt-out
There are plenty of good reasons for laziness, there is no denying it. Reading the amazing Why Functional Programming matters shows how much it helps to modularise and decoupling our software, by allowing the separation of processes producing data from the one consuming it.
But there are plenty of drawbacks to laziness as well. Some are technical (space leaks) and some are psychological (non strict evaluation is not intuitive when coming from other languages).
A bit like Clojure (and other FP languages) did before, Idris embraces opt-in laziness, with a strict evaluation by default. Streams are the lazy equivalent of Lists and the language features both. You can notice the different pretty easily, when playing with infinite and finite ranges:
7) A smaller Num class
For all of those who likes to play with DSL in Haskell, the fact that the Haskell Num class is split into smaller bits in Idris is a small but nevertheless enjoyable improvement:
The Haskell version often leads to dummy implementations of to negate, abs or signum methods. This should not occur anymore in the Idris version of the Num class.
8) The Cast type class
Idris removed the Read type class and replaces it with the more general Cast type class. The Read type class allowed to parse a String into a type a, effectively a transformation from a String to any other type. The Cast class is parameterized on the input type as well, allowing to transform between any two types implementing the type class.
We can read a string into an integer like follows (you can note that reading an invalid string returns a default value instead of throwing an exception):
The generalisation allows avoiding the multiplication of functions to convert between the numeric types. For instance, we can use it to convert (with losses) a double into an integer value:
9) Clear separation of evaluation and execution
Let us write a simple function that reads the input from the command line, interprets it as a number, double this number, before printing it on the screen:
If you evaluate a call to this function in the Idris REPL, you will get the following big pile of Abstract Syntax Tree, which correspond to the recipe to execute the IO expression described by double_it:
To execute the function and not just evaluate it, you need to say so explicitly, by using :exec as prefix to the expression to execute:
Why considering this an improvement over Haskell. If you are a Lisp adept, you can but appreciate the reification of the IO actions into a proper AST. It may just be personal taste, but I just love it.
10) The Do notation without monads
I kept the best part of Idris for the last. Before of its support for overloading, Idris allows the developer to define a bind operator out of the Monad class, and the do notation is based on the sole presence of this operator.
This is truly an awesome idea. It allows the developer to profit from the nice syntax of the do notation, without having to comply to the interface of the Monad bind operator.
It avoids forcing awkward design just to fit the Monad type class requirements
It opens up the notation for numerous types that could not be made proper instance of Functor, Applicative or Monad, because they are not parameterised
It allows keeping the do notation for dependent types, which much rarely conform to the interface of Monad
It also allows us to abuse even more the do notation. More power means more changes to do horrors as well. Here is an example of abuse that shows that we do not even need a parameterized type for the do notation anymore:
It describes a not very useful StringBuilder DSL
Evaluating an expression of this DSL with eval_string yields a String
yields a String Defining the bind operator allows us to describe our DSL expression with do
Here is an example of usage of this DSL, in which we create an StringBuilder expression named john, using our beloved and dreaded do notation:
Evaluating our StringBuilder expression shows us the AST, and calling eval_string on it interprets it as a String:
Conclusion
Idris offers some pleasant surprises for the Haskell programmers, even without considering the dependent typing support. There are many other pleasant surprises I got, such as the distinction between print and printLn, which is now aligned with putStr and putStrLn, and many others.
These changes mostly show how helpful it is to be able to start all over again from scratch and fixing these pesky mistakes we did at the beginning.
One day suspension for Memphis cop that caused deadly delay David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published: Thursday April 9, 2009
Print This Email This A Tennessee police officer has been suspended without pay for a single day over delaying a motorist whose mother was dying in the back seat, according to published reports.
Deputy Micah McNinch pulled over Wayne Ables on March 12 after 2 a.m. as he raced his infirmed mother to a hospital just a mile from the site of the stop. McNinch pulled Ables over for expired tags and, as evidenced in new video released to news agencies, kept the pair there while an ambulance and fire truck were en route.
After 11 minutes, the emergency vehicles arrived. The driver had pleaded with the officer to escort them to the hospital a mere five minutes away.
"Ables says he told McNinch his mother was in the back seat, suffering from severe breathing problems," reported My Eyewitness News. "According to audio taken from the dash camera the deputy didnt want to give Ables his ticket until the ambulance arrived to the scene. 'I don't want to give him this copy to sign until the ambulance gets here. Otherwise he will leave and weve got an ambulance and a fire truck coming up her for no reason.'"
"According to the Shelby County Sheriffs Office, deputies are instructed not to escort vehicles during traffic stops, but Sheriff Mark Luttrell says there are times when the policy needs to be worked around," the publication noted in a separate report. "Luttrell and Ables both say this shouldve been one of those times. Able says his mother died in the back seat, just 8/10 of a mile from the hospital. 'The last word I heard my mom say is I can't breathe son, I can't breathe, I need some air. That's what I'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life. When he sees his mom, give her a big hug, tell her he loves her, because I cant do that with my mom anymore.'"
"While paramedics were in route, Mr. Ables never alerted Deputy McNinch his mothers condition had worsened," they reported.
"There were some judgemental errors made, and he needed to be held accountable for that," said Shelby County Sheriff Mark Luttrell told Memphis CBS affiliate WREG.
"But for the most part, he says McNinch followed policy. His file is clean, it includes two good performance reviews. So rather than severely punish him, he was suspended for one day without pay.
"'I forgive him, because it's what my mom would want, because my mom would, she'd do it for me,' said Ables.
"'As long as there are lessons learned here and they can put it in policy,' he added."
Oddly enough, the Shelby County Sheriffs Department is the same which once appointed Elvis Presley to Deputy Sheriff [PDF link] in a PR stunt.
"Elvis had an infatuation with law enforcement, and he worked his way up to the ranks at the Shelby County Sheriff's Office in his hometown of Memphis," noted Heritage Auction Galleries. "He first received an honorary sheriff's badge from Sheriff Bill Morris in 1970, and ultimately acquired several authentic badges (as well as actual law enforcement authority) from subsequent sheriffs in Shelby County."

Welcome to the worst breakfast-related crisis since Lord of the Rings: There might be an impending Nutella shortage. And there's a good chance the culprit is climate change.
The price of hazelnuts, a main ingredient in the delicious chocolate spread, is up 60 percent after unseasonable ice storms devastated hazel tree farms in Turkey's Black Sea coastal region this year. And colder winters and heavier precipitation are exactly what the EU's Centre for Climate Adaptation says the Black Sea coast should expect as climate change advances. Though Nutella's manufacturer hasn't raised its prices yet, it's facing increasing strain as palm oil and cocoa get more expensive, too.
It would be bad enough if Nutella were the only food that melting ice caps and changing weather patterns are threatening to rob from the breakfast table. But no—the list of climate change's culinary casualties goes on. Here are some other ways it's making the most important meal of the day a little less satisfying:
This competition is starting to get REALLY heavy. We're down to the Final Four in March Metal Mascot Madness! The winner of the Headbanger Region is slated to fight the victor from our Stage Dive Region, so let's get it moving.
In this matchup, we've got two of England's all-time greatest metal bands and their respective mascots. After destroying Sargent D. of S.O.D. fame in Round One, Iron Maiden mascot Eddie the Head laid waste to all competition moving forward. Eddie beat Quiet Riot's Man in the Metal Mask in Round 2 before defeating Judas Priest's steel-winged deity, the Painkiller.
In the Stage Dive Region, Black Sabbath 's mascot Henry (an angel to some and demon to others) took the top prize. Henry's first challenge was against Manowar's Manowarrior. After a Round One win, Henry flew upward to face Avenged Sevenfold's Deathbat before returning to the ground and snuffing out Sodom's Knarrenheinz.
Which mascot will make it to the Championship Round? The winner of Eddie the Head vs. Henry is up to you! Cast your votes below!
Voting for this round ends on Friday, April 3 at 8AM ET. Fans can vote once per hour, so keep coming back to make sure that your favorite metal mascot wins!

It was a beautiful summer day when Janine Lauster saw an elderly woman in a wheelchair being pushed up to her just-opened Wawel Polish Patisserie on St-Laurent Blvd.
The woman's companion came in and ordered her an ice cream, so Janine impulsively grabbed a small table and two chairs and brought them outside — and the woman happily munched ice cream in the sun.
Shortly after they'd left Janine was still inside serving customers when a city inspector marched in. He handed her a $250 ticket for “illegal furniture occupying the public domain.”
That was a year ago and Janine is still battling the ticket — heading for municipal court this September to challenge her ice cream charge.
“We explained to the inspector we were just doing something nice for someone,” says the gregarious Janine, showing me a photo she took of the woman in the wheelchair eating ice cream.
“But the inspector didn't care. He just said the rules are the rules.”
In the months that followed Janine visited her borough office twice to appeal, where people clucked sympathetically but ultimately gave no help. By then her ticket's cost had risen to $400 — so she's off to court.
“I have to sell lots of pastries to make that much,” says Janine, an enthusiastic 27-year old business grad from Germany. She immigrated here 18 months ago, and threw her life savings into the colourful shop she co-owns. She works 50-hour weeks baking bread, strudel and what her sign proclaims as ‘The World's Best Donuts.' “I'm also fighting for the principle – it's just wrong to punish people for doing the right thing.”
But it's hard fighting Montreal City Hall — even when you occasionally win, as other St-Laurent merchants have learned.
The past two summers many shop-owners there were ticketed for simply putting two or three plastic chairs out by their windows, where people could take the sun — illegally! — and I conspired with them.
I often went to the street's Hungarian butcher shop for a take-out sausage sandwich, then sat on its flimsy outdoor chairs eating scofflaw sandwiches that cost the owner two $500 tickets last summer alone.
“The inspectors told me to get a permit for a fancy terrasse I'd pay thousands of dollars for,” says Angelo, the shop's owner. “But I'm just a butcher who sells some sandwiches.”
“It was enraging,” adds Steve Da Silva, co-owner of Vieille Europe gourmet grocery, which also got huge tickets. “We were just giving customers and mostly passersby a free place to sit.
“Handicapped people, homeless and especially old people like to stop and rest in our chairs for hours, to watch street life. We helped improve the Main, make it more inviting and festive, but the bureaucrats punished us.”
Last year, the fed-up merchants banded together and got their street association to demand the city legalize their chairs. The civil servants refused saying it was too complicated, but finally the local borough asked inspectors to turn a blind eye.
This summer there have been no tickets, yet — “but it's still illegal under law” says one merchant. “We're always looking over our shoulders hoping we don't get a ticket.”
It was a similar battle when St-Laurent merchants asked to put up festive holiday lights last Christmas — and city bureaucrats vetoed the plan. At the last minute Mayor Coderre intervened personally, ending months of frustration.
But our Supermayor can't be everywhere, battling our uncivil civil servants one by one.
Says one frustrated merchant who ran the street association in another part of town: “There's an overwhelming culture of bureaucracy and hidebound rules in our civil service that's almost impossible to change.
“Our bureaucrats have no sympathy and no idea how hard it is to run a small business. They're out to make money, not help us.”
Back at Wawel Patisserie, Janine has bought a permit for a terrasse this summer. It's the tiniest terrasse on all St-Laurent with three two-seat tables crammed into a wooden frame she built and festooned with flower boxes.
The City charges her $2,000 per summer — cheaper than bigger nearby terrasses that cost as much as $20,000, but a small fortune for her.
They tell her it's a cleaning and maintenance fee, but there's a huge Montreal pothole marring her terrasse's pavement — and most mornings she has to clean cigarette butts, garbage, beer cans and even vomit off the pavement.
If you ask me, the City should subsidize terrasses that enhance Montreal street life, not charge discouraging fees and fines. Why not charge pedestrians to use sidewalks? Or children to use playgrounds?
“As a shop owner, it's so discouraging to see how the city hurts us instead of helps us. It's wrong … it's just wrong,” says Janine – and she's going to court hoping to make it just a little more right.

Darwin's victims of crime come face-to-face with perpetrators as part of new program
Updated
When Wayne Wood's home in Darwin's northern suburbs was broken into earlier this year, his wife was livid.
"She was so angry," Mr Wood recalled.
"She said as far as she was concerned, we should bring the rattan [cane] from Singapore [to punish the offenders]."
The couple had been watching tennis on television at night, when several young people entered their home, stole a wallet and purse and took their car for a high-speed joy ride.
When the juveniles were caught, one of the offenders was given an alternative to incarceration: meet his victims face-to-face and hear firsthand how they had been affected by his actions.
The initiative is known as victim-offender conferencing.
Fifteen court-ordered conferences have taken place in the Northern Territory since the Government rolled out the new diversionary program in April.
"The kids find it incredibly challenging coming face-to-face with the person they've hurt," said Jared Sharp from Jesuit Social Services, which runs the program.
"They are often confronted by victims of crime who are really angry and want the young people to see the impact of their actions."
Mr Wood said his victim-offender conference made an impact.
"They got the kid sitting in there and he was in tears because I said to him 'didn't it ever occur to you when you were driving on the wrong side of the road at 150 kilometres per hour ... that you could kill somebody, or worse still, you could kill yourself?'" he said.
"And I think that brought home to him that there was a lot more involved than simply stealing someone's car or taking their stuff."
It also gave Mr Wood a chance to direct his feelings towards the perpetrator.
"[The conferences are] more for the victims because we were [previously] denied a voice, and now through the program ... we feel we can speak out and say, 'I'm angry about this'."
Promising outcomes
Of the 15 conferences conducted so far, one offender has committed crimes again.
But Mr Sharp said recidivism rates at this early stage of the program should not be the measurement of success.
Instead, he pointed to the outcome plans that were developed by the young offenders.
"In every single one of our conferences so far, the young person has come and they've agreed to an outcome plan," Mr Sharp said.
"And that outcome plan involves some form of making amends to a victim, whether by way of a verbal apology, a written apology, painting a painting, writing a card, making something for the victim or doing community work."
The 16-year-old offender in Mr Wood's case created an artwork.
"He painted a lovely picture of a cat for my wife," he said.
He said after initially refusing to attend the conference, his wife now saw merit in the program.
'I feel like I know him'
Shirley Downing, 85, is another victim who felt "violated, angry and fearful" after her car was stolen from her Darwin home.
She has since had a conference with one of the offenders, who wrote her a letter to apologise.
"I feel I know him like a son," she said, before reassessing her comment.
"Well, I don't know him like a son, but I do feel that I know the situation, or similar situation from which he has come."
The program has funding for 65 victim-offender conferences over the next year.

With the stroke of a pen Bernie Ecclestone made history earlier this week when he signed his name on the contract between Formula One World Championship, the company he runs, and the coalition of the BBC and BSkyB. Next year, for the first time in F1's history, not all races will be broadcast in Britain on free-to-air television as Sky Sports will be showing all races, qualifying and practice sessions live. The BBC will be broadcasting highlights of each race but its portfolio of live broadcasts will cover just half of them. To say that it caused a stir in the fan community is a huge understatement.
An annual subscription to Sky Sports costs around £470 but for the same sum you could buy three-day general admission tickets to six races including Monaco, Silverstone, Turkey and Canada. It's little wonder therefore that a poll on one sports reporter's website showed that as of Saturday morning 81% of readers would not buy a subscription to watch F1 on Sky Sports. So how did this happen?
"The issue ultimately is the money that CVC Capital Partners, the owners, via Bernie, take out of the sport," is the explanation from another sports reporter and although it reflects the general opinion in F1 it isn't accurate. The real reason for the new deal is much more straightforward than that - the BBC broke its contract.
The BBC got the rights to broadcast F1 in 2008 with its coverage beginning the following year. The reason that the rights were available in the first place was because ITV had broken its contract which was due to run until the end of last year. According to the Telegraph and other media sources at the time, ITV dropped F1 in order to "save money which can be used to expand coverage of football." Not coincidentally, at the same time as the BBC announced it had picked up F1, ITV announced that it had retained the rights to broadcast Champions League football matches as part of a deal from 2009 to 2012.
With ITV, the BBC's main competition, out of the picture, there was no chance of a bidding war inflating the price of the F1 rights when the deal was done in 2008. More importantly, the BBC knew F1 was a distressed seller since ITV had broken its contract leaving it high and dry.
According to a report by the UK's communications regulator Ofcom, ITV was paying £29m annually under its contract which ran from 2006 to 2010. Given that F1 was a distressed seller and there was no bidding war when it was sold, it is safe to assume that the BBC paid perhaps only a 5% to 10% premium on ITV's fee which would take it to around the £31m ($50m) figure estimated in F1 trade guide Formula Money. Even this has become too much for the Beeb to justify.
Faced with a freeze on the license fee, the BBC has been forced to make cuts and it was suggested that nothing was too sacred to be dropped even its coverage of the prestigious Wimbledon tennis tournament. Despite its high viewing figures, it wasn't tough for the BBC to conclude that F1 had to be cut in some way in order to save its crown jewel of Wimbledon.
This created a dilemma for Ecclestone who said last month that "I will do my best to keep F1 on the BBC." He added that "the BBC have done a great job for us and we like their shows and the people obviously like it because so many are watching." It left the BBC with a decision: either break its contract by dropping F1 completely, a move which would have saddled it with a huge financial penalty, or find some way of reducing its annual fee. The most logical way of reducing its fee is to reduce the amount of coverage it gets and this is exactly what it did.
It wasn't that simple though. Reducing its coverage by half required finding a partner to broadcast the other 50% of races. There is good reason why the BBC turned to BSkyB.
Bernie Ecclestone: "The BBC brought Sky to us with the idea of a joint contract" © Getty Images Enlarge
Both ITV and Channel 4 were in negotiations with Ecclestone about taking over the F1 rights and the F1 boss said that, if necessary, he would have asked Channel 5 if it wanted to make a bid. However, all of these stations are direct terrestrial rivals to the BBC whereas BSkyB is the main player in the pay-per-view arena. It explains why, according to Ecclestone, "the BBC brought Sky to us with the idea of a joint contract." Likewise, when asked whether he felt it was a shame that a terrestrial broadcaster would no longer be showing every race live he said "it was not us who made that decision."
Nevertheless, it certainly hasn't left Ecclestone out of pocket with F1 getting around £15m from the BBC under the new deal, which runs until 2018, with BSkyB paying an estimated £25m. Its premium is thought to be due to the fact that switching to pay-per-view could reduce F1's viewing figures and in turn dent the teams' sponsorship revenues which depend on wide exposure.
Earlier this month Ecclestone said "it isn't possible that F1 could go on to pay-TV, we wouldn't want to do that." Since the BBC will be broadcasting not only six races live, but also a highlights package for every race, Ecclestone has been able to stay true to his word. Nevertheless, the teams are likely to have initially seen this as a technicality. However, if BSkyB and BBC are together paying significantly more than was previously being received this will have improved the teams' moods since they share 50% of F1's profits as prize money.
Bearing this in mind, it may well be no coincidence that the teams reportedly had a hostile reaction to the deal on Friday morning, with talk that they may even try to torpedo it, but by the afternoon, once they had sat in on a joint meeting with Ecclestone in the Hungarian GP paddock, they started to show support. There were other significant factors at work too.
It is understood that the teams were not given more than 24 hours notice about the deal with many finding out from the media reports on Friday morning. The initial media reports and the press release about the deal did not state that the BBC will be broadcasting anything other than highlights for the half of the races which it won't be showing live. This hugely concerned many teams since the UK terrestrial coverage of those races would simply disappear.
It affects British teams more than the others since the heart of their fan-base is in Britain. It is why McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh spoke to Ecclestone about it and seemingly got him to agree to the BBC's highlights package being a delayed showing of the race itself. "Bernie assured me, and I asked him several times, the deferred coverage will not be highlights, it will be a full race," said Whitmarsh. Given that the BBC's own press release does not reflect this, and the contract has been signed, it remains to be see how much influence Ecclestone could have.
Other team principals don't seem to share Whitmarsh's concern. Lotus Renault team principal Eric Boullier said "I think it is rather good news and should be positively welcomed by fans." It is hard to understand how anyone could seriously think that fans would welcome something which previously cost £145.50 (the price of a television license fee) rising in price by an additional £470. Some may use it as a good example of how out of touch F1 is with the real world.
Ironically, the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) has held numerous events this year to canvass fans' opinions but if it wants to avoid accusations that these were simply window dressing it could be argued that it should take a strong stand against the BSkyB deal since it is clearly not in the interests of the UK fans who do not have a Sky subscription. Likewise, FOTA claims to place environmental issues close to its heart so presumably, if the BBC and Sky Sports use two broadcast crews, as is expected, the teams' should object due to the extra emissions which this unnecessary duplication will cause.
Sadly, the very fact that the teams did not even know about the deal in advance shows just how little power FOTA really commands.

The fans aren't the only ones who would lose out as a result of lower viewing figures on pay-per-view. Paul Hembery, Pirelli's motorsport director has said that if this broadcast model is replicated across Europe then "we know from being involved in other sports that can create problems. Because you do end up with having less visibility, so it is a concern."
In defence, this deal only covers one territory and one sports reporter suggested it may even bring benefits for fans. "Soccer became a game of the masses. F1 in bars and pubs? Huge potential to make F1 a social event," he wrote on his Twitter page. In reality it isn't likely that this will stimulate communal viewing of F1 since there is no tradition of watching F1 in pubs as there is with football. There is also the problem that the timing of F1 sometimes clashes with football matches and these already have the run of the pubs and bars.
One conclusion which can safely be drawn from the recent decision is that it makes it even less likely that BSkyB's 39% owner News Corp will be taking over F1 any time soon as it was considering doing.
The phone hacking scandal engulfing the company already looked to have halted its interest in acquiring F1 and its broadcast deal is a further roadblock. The reason for this is that it would put News Corp on both sides of the table since it would be receiving money from broadcasters as an owner of F1 and paying money to F1 as a broadcaster itself. It is this same kind of conflict which prevented BSkyB from acquiring football team Manchester United in the late 1990s. Given that many fans strongly opposed the very idea of News Corp buying into F1 they can take consolation from the fact that the new broadcast deal has probably put the brakes on that.

The Sundance Institute—the organization responsible for the annual film festival that has given rise to the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Ava DuVernay—is looking to nurture a whole new kind of talent: virtual reality filmmakers.
As part of a collaboration with VR firm Jaunt Studios, the institute is launching a residency program that will bring on four filmmakers for a program "designed to empower artists on the cutting edge of storytelling," according to an announcement about the new initiative. The six-month residency will be run as part of Sundance's New Frontier program with resources and VR production equipment provided by Jaunt.
"Virtual reality and other multimedia forms are accelerating the evolution of storytelling," Sundance Institute executive director Keri Putnam said in a statement. "We hope their unique voices, diverse perspectives and creativity will help define the potential of this new medium."
Many of the leaders in VR filmmaking have already gotten a huge boost from Sundance. Director Chris Milk, now a founder of VR studio Vrse, brought his earliest VR projects to the festival. Oculus launched its in-house filmmaking initiative, Story Studio, at Sundance last January. And Rose Troche, who got her start at Sundance 21 years ago with the black-and-white indie Go Fish, came back to the festival this year with a VR experience examining sexual assault. Setting up a program to develop those projects from within the institute is just the next logical step.
During their residency, filmmakers will explore new VR techniques and receive a grant to produce virtual reality short films. The Sundance Institute has named Australian artist and documentarian Lynette Wallworth as the first resident in the program. Three more residents will be named in the coming months.

The article below, which contains some extra material, formed the basis of the interview.
“America must stop being Dr. Frankenstein's monster.” — JB Campbell
The American and Israeli Jews are worried that their power is slipping because of growing public awareness of their terrible achievements in the past, such as the destruction of Iraq. They were thwarted in their planned destruction of Syria and are now determined to show their power over at least sixty cowardly US senators to achieve the destruction of Iran.
The Jews here in America say they are a tiny minority – just two percent – yet they are able to control sixty percent of the US Senate in any important matter, such as maneuvering the US military to attack Iran – in the middle of negotiations! The Jews in America proved this in 1917 and 1941, despite the anti-war attitude of the American people back then. We waged total war against people the Jews didn't like. Scores of millions died and much of the world was destroyed. The peoples of the world have never known peace since those horrible years.
They proved it in 1991 and in 2003. The Jewish Neo-Cons demanded total war against Iraq despite no hostile action by that country, which was totally destroyed.
The Jews are again showing their power over cowardly American politicians. Virtually overnight they are able to blackmail enough US senators to destroy another peaceful country with sadistic and aggressive sanctions. Sanctions, like surveillance, are a prelude to total war and are in fact a form of total war, as we saw with Japan, Germany and Iraq.
Like Iran, America has a Jewish problem.
The Jews have made the entire US Congress a laughingstock – except, no one can laugh at such a Frankenstein monster. The monster has slaughtered millions of innocent, normal people all over the world – over two million just in Iraq since '91.
Dr. Frankenstein wants his monster to kill millions more.
Jewish power in America can only be ended by the American Defense Party, which is dedicated to shutting down the tyrannical federal government. It is tyrannical because it is controlled by Jews, who own the Federal Reserve, AIPAC and the Council on Foreign Relations. There is no other way to deal with these insatiable criminals who have seized control of the US government and have used it for a hundred years to kill millions of normal people and create a totalitarian world government.
They must be stopped forever and only the American Defense Party has the plan to do this. America must stop being Dr. Frankenstein's monster.
The Queen's Nursing Institute (QNI) in England has published a new guide for community nurses supporting homeless people living with epilepsy. Developed with epilepsy specialist nurses in the UK and nurses with clinical and research experience working with homeless people, the guidance was drawn up in response to growing evidence that the homeless are at much greater risk of having or developing epilepsy.
Informal evidence from health professionals suggests that specialist epilepsy services do not effectively reach homeless people. A French study found that even discounting the presence of alcohol-related seizures, 8 percent of a homeless population studied had active epilepsy, which is least eight times the epilepsy rate in the general population.
The authors observe that homeless people may struggle to gain access to specialist services they need, so frontline nurses should be sure they know how to identify epilepsy, offer basic advice, and link homeless clients to specialist services.
The QNI new guidance is intended as a resource and reference for professionals and their patients during health appointments, to equip community nurses with greater knowledge and confidence when supporting people with epilepsy, and epilepsy professionals with better understanding of the risks and realities associated with caring for epileptic patients in general, particularly people with epilepsy who are also experiencing homelessness.
The 12-page document Working with Epilepsy and Homelessness: Guidance for Community Nurses, addresses specific risks and needs of homeless people and contains useful advice to help enable nurses support homeless patients who have epilepsy, as well as practical guidelines for coordinating their care.
It includes information about causes of epilepsy, various seizure types, essential first aid, treatment, and the practicalities of living with epilepsy while homeless. The guide provides an overview of what epilepsy is, how it is treated, and the sorts of support nurses can provide to homeless epileptics to help them minimize risk of harm and live as well as they can with their epilepsy under the circumstances.
The guidance document was developed as part of the QNI's Homeless Health Project with funding from the The Monument Trust. Its authors were informed by the knowledge and experience of 10 epilepsy specialist nurses and 10 specialist homeless health professionals from the UK.
“For people who have a regular address, employment, and who are registered with a GP, it can often be difficult to access the right services to support them with their epilepsy,” Tony Linklater, an epilepsy specialist nurse at the Sir William Gowers Unit at the Epilepsy Society's Chalfont Centre in Buckinghamshire, said in an Epilepsy Society press release.
“For people who are homeless and possibly living on the street, this problem can be exacerbated many times. We have a well-documented shortage of epilepsy specialist nurses in the UK so it is vital that we make sure our community nurses have the right information and knowledge about epilepsy, so they can feel confident to recognize epilepsy, give basic advice and signpost to specialist services,” he said.
The QNI's Homeless Health Project Manager David Parker-Radford, said in the release that diagnosing epilepsy and treating it can be complex and requires many health appointments and tests.
“This means it is even more vital that epilepsy services find proactive ways to reach vulnerable high-risk people, including those who may not be registered with a GP. All people living with epilepsy have the right to excellent care and treatment not only those with stable support and housing,” he said.
The QNI is a charity established in 1887 with a grant of £70,000 allocated by Queen Victoria from the Women's Jubilee Fund. Originally named the Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses, the organization received a Royal Charter 1889 with its mandate to provide the “training, support, maintenance, and supply” of nurses to care for the sick poor, as well as to establish training homes and supervising centers.
The past decade of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has given military physicians such as myself the important opportunity to gather unprecedented data on some of our most pressing medical issues. This data set has spurred advances in the care of trauma, hemorrhagic shock, traumatic brain injury, and other occupational injuries common to young men and women in combat. Our job, and indeed our temperament, is to make observations, gather data, test hypotheses, and solve problems all day long—all while in the middle of a combat zone.
Which brings me to one of the most common medical inquiries I receive in combat: "How the hell am I supposed to jack off up in this motherfucker?"
Whether you're in the military of civilian sector, many of you will be faced with this problem, and I want you to benefit from the cumulative experience of the bold young Americans of the Marine Corps infantry. Collectively, they have MacGyvered themselves out of scenarios that you and I have never even dreamt of, and I don't want you to feel stuck when a solution has already been devised, implemented, revised, and optimized.
I present to you a series of real-life scenarios that Marines and sailors in my infantry battalion have faced over the past several years, as well as the field-tested solutions they devised to handle each one. None of what follows are hypothetical. All have been successfully completed, and I have even witnessed a few of the outcomes. Following each solution, I present a rub (or friction point) that I hope you might avoid as you negotiate your own obstacles.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #1
You are embarked on a naval vessel and you decide to masturbate while in bed. Unfortunately, you lack the traditional "happy sock" in which you would normally deposit your ejaculate. Climax is imminent. Where will you deposit your knuckle babies?
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: Simply push the covers down to your thighs, roll over onto a hip, and ejaculate away from the wall and into the aisle between your bed and others' beds.
The rub: The beds, or racks, in the enlisted berthing areas of most naval vessels are disparagingly called "coffin racks" because they are tiny and arranged in columns of five. They are also in aisles so densely packed that any semen arcing down from your rack will be in plain sight to up to 30 of your comrades. This was the experience of the top-rack user in this scenario. Needless to say, he was immediately put to work cleaning the decks.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #2
You are in the shower aboard a naval vessel and decide to masturbate. You wish to avoid a repeat of yesterday's mishap when a senior-ranking member noticed the jellyfish turds on your shower shoes—evidence of reckless ejaculation. Climax is imminent. Where will you deposit your tub babies?
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: One may square one's shoulders to the bulkhead (shipboard term for "wall") and from near point-blank range be rather certain that the entire load is safely deposited on the bulkhead, away from one's shower shoes. Leaving it on the bulkhead is the most reliable way to ensure containment.
The rub: There is a special place in hell reserved for you. You will eternally clean the floors in a demonic porn theater where all the films feature old women doing Swedish drill and where everlasting ropes of electrified jizz will lash your back as you squeegee the tiles around your laughing patrons' frozen, hooved feet.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #3
You are on a defensive overwatch post at night, alone in your shallow fighting hole, maintaining a vigilant defensive posture upon which your sleeping comrades' safety depends. After hours of darkness and only periodic radio checks, you grow sleepy and need to restore your alertness.
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: One may restore alertness by masturbating furiously while on post.
The rub: Masturbating while on post is frowned upon and considered a dereliction of duty. That radio you have been periodically using to check in with the Combat Operations Center (COC) should be kept handy during your revival jerk, but you should be careful not to press the button that transmits audio. If you do accidentally lean on the talk button while jerking, then all your slapping and panting will be transmitted to all the other radios currently being operated on your channel. There will be many. Because you cannot receive transmissions while broadcasting your emissions, nobody can alert you via radio and someone from the COC will have to check post-by-post to find the offending jerk artist. He will be unhappy with you once you meet.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #4
You are in a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle (MRAP) maintaining night-time overwatch of a critical piece of ground and your crew of four is growing bored and tired. You wish to restore your vigilance by masturbating, but do not want to jerk it in a vehicle full of dudes.
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: Everyone jerks; nobody talks.
The rub: If anyone talks, the spell is broken, and in the minds of its passengers the MRAP is transformed into a Castro Street bathhouse, and a gay panic ensues. To avoid inconvenient urges to speak, you may listen to an iPod or other media device. If you do not have one of your own, ask nicely and someone may give you one of his ear buds. It is not recommended that you critique the song choice under any circumstance. Like in commuter slugging, all goodwill depends on your silent acceptance.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #5
You have been doing an awful lot of jerking in the MRAP, and you're curious just how much fluid loss you are experiencing.
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: One may store many days' worth of ejaculate in a Dasani water bottle. These bottles are amazingly crush-resistant and allow easy viewing of your accumulated seed swamp.
The rub: The 115-degree air temperature and the astounding radiant heat absorbed by your little greenhouse bottle cause ghastly curdling and vapor production that is most apparent when climax is imminent and you choose to open the bottle. You and your friends' progress to orgasm is repeatedly thwarted by the rancid fumes of your improperly stored juices.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #6
You have forcibly secured a hostile walled agricultural compound and established a forward fighting position that serves as the living quarters for 200 men. They frequently decide to masturbate and wish to have a relatively private place to do so.
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: One may designate any room or crudely constructed booth as a "jack shack." The most effective procedure for establishing a jack shack is to (1) ensure no other function has been assigned to the space; (2) make a sign that says "jack shack"; (3) make a flippable sign that reads "vacant" on one side and "jerkin' it" on the other; (4) hang the signs; (5) jerk it.
The rub: As you somehow approach orgasm while surrounded by fleas, goat droppings, and untold zillions of camel spiders, and even though the space is clearly labeled and you have turned the sign to the "jerkin' it" setting, some dumbass may still barge in and say, "Oh shit, I didn't know that was serious." A temporary fix for this is to add a quick "no, really" to the "jerkin' it" sign.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #7
During a winter night in a defensive position in Afghanistan, you do not wish to leave the warmth of your sleeping bag to masturbate in the remote, frigid, infested jack shack. Perseverant, you decide to masturbate. Unfortunately, you lack the traditional "happy sock" in which you would normally deposit your ejaculate. Climax is imminent. Where will you deposit your knuckle babies?
Advertisement
Field-tested solution #1: One can remove his polar-fleece beanie hat and use it to catch and isolate his load from his body and bedding.
The rub #1: Laundry is nigh-impossible; it's below freezing everywhere you go; and you're going to want to wear the hat. If you choose the warmth of the beanie, you must choose whether to wear your beanie butter side up or butter side down. Your choice will either publicize your perversion or test the limits of just how dirty your hair can become.
Field-tested solution #2: If one is particularly thin in stature and confident in his muzzle velocity, he may choose to simply jizz into the far distant regions of his sleeping bag and sleep soundly in an isolated zone of the bag that is calculated to be semen-free.
Advertisement
The rub #2: In an infantry unit, everyone is issued a sleeping bag—nearly all of them used. While talking loosely about your new technique, you confirm the blood-curdling fears of everyone else who sleeps in previously issued gear. You will single-handedly crush the morale of your unit for no less than eight days and nights.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #8
You are minding your own business, squatting on your haunches for a quick rest between moving crates of supplies. You have not masturbated very recently, nor do you plan to. Yet upon standing, your flaccid penis erupts with semen, and the new sogginess in your pants is not even accompanied by an orgasm. This also happened the last time you took a nice big shit.
Advertisement
Field-tested solution: One may present to medical with the chief complaint of "when I shit, I nut," and the doctor soon names your condition "defectory ejaculosis."
The rub: To rule out the most likely reason for semen in the toilet in the absence of an orgasm, the doctor must ask about sexual practices. He suspects that your section chief is in fact the love child of a hickory tree and a bulldozer. This will remain an open question until five of your buddies develop the same symptoms and experience immediate, synchronous resolution when you run out of a weightlifting nutritional supplement that you have all been sharing. Your doctor alerts the supplement manufacturer of their potential side effect of unprovoked jizzbombs.
★ ★ ★
Scenario #9
You have worked 200 consecutive 18-hour days without a beer or a hug or real contact with anyone you love. You're sick of it, and routine masturbation has grown stale. You need a new form of stimulation or you're going to flip the fuck out.
Advertisement
Field-tested solution #1: Using simple procedure available on YouTube, one can MacGyver a water bottle, a glove from a first-aid kit, a sock, and a dollop of lube from a corpsman's pack to create a field-expedient pocket pussy.
The rub #1: There you are, standing on one bare foot, stuffing your johnson into a mangled plastic bottle with loose fittings and sharp edges, doing all this under threat of attack and with no real end in sight. It is at this moment that you may gain a poignant disgust for the life choices that led you here. The experience of employing your field-expedient pocket pussy may be more of a downer than you had planned.
Field-tested solution #2: One may choose to locate the comrade who, with great foresight, packed a slick silicon replica of a vulva and vagina—a true store-bought pocket pussy—and respectfully ask to borrow it. Astounding to outsiders, but reasonable to those who have been in the situation, your buddy may permit you to defile his precious.
Advertisement
The rub #2: Your buddy has many buddies, and in a bind up to 12 buddies have been reported to knowingly share one communal pocket pussy. This relationship may suddenly develop an emotional component when one of you falls ill. Whether it was Dengue fever, malaria, or appendicitis that caused your buddy's feverish vomiting and hospitalization, someone will likely tell the group, "Don't worry, it was just real bad syphilis."
In closing, I hope this data may contribute to advances in the field of masturbation that will afford warfighters, missionaries, and scientists alike a higher quality of life when working in austere conditions. Ideally, members of other communities will rally behind this salvo by publishing data gathered from austere workplaces such as forestry preserves, archaeological excavation sites, oil rigs, space stations, and Boy Scout camp. It is only through such military-civilian dialogue that we may disseminate our advances in technique, forged of ingenuity and tempered in sacrifice, in order build a more perfect world.

St. Louis Rams running back Todd Gurley, who led all NFL rookies in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, was selected as the 2015 Rookie of the Year and 2015 Offensive Rookie of the Year, chosen in voting conducted by the Professional Football Writers of America (PFWA).
Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters, who tied for the NFL lead in interceptions, was selected as the 2015 Defensive Rookie of the Year by the PFWA.
Gurley, a first-round pick (No. 10 overall) out of Georgia, rushed 229 times for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns in 13 games, while averaging 4.8 yards per attempt. He led all NFL rookies in rushing yards (third overall in the NFL), rushing touchdowns and scrimmage yards (1,294). Coming back from a knee injury suffered in his junior season at Georgia, Gurley made his NFL debut in Week 3. The following week, he began a streak of four straight 100-yard rushing games as part of five overall in 2015. He became the first rookie in NFL history to rush for 125 yards or more in four consecutive games. Gurley was named the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Month for October after he rushed for 433 yards and two touchdowns in three games.
Peters, a first-round pick (No. 18 overall) out of Washington, tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with eight, led the league in interception yards with 280 and tied for first in the NFL in passes defensed with 26. He intercepted the first pass he saw in his NFL career, and he returned a pair of picks for touchdowns. He finished fourth on the Chiefs in total tackles with 60.
Gurley is the fourth Rams player to be selected Offensive Rookie of the Year and the first since quarterback Sam Bradford in 2010, and he is the third Rams back to gain the PFWA honor, joining Eric Dickerson (1983) and Jerome Bettis (1993). Peters is the fourth Chiefs player to be selected Defensive Rookie of the Year and the first since CB/PR Dale Carter in 1992. Other Kansas City winners of the award were CB James Marsalis (AFL 1969) and LB Derrick Thomas (1989).
The Buccaneers and Seahawks led all clubs with four All-Rookie selections. Tampa Bay had quarterback Jameis Winston, guard Ali Marpet, tackle Donovan Smith and linebacker Kwon Alexander earn honors. Seattle had running back Thomas Rawls and a rare triple honor by Tyler Lockett, who was selected at kick returner, punt returner and special teamer. The Minnesota Vikings were third in most All-Rookie slots with three players on the squad. In all, 15 clubs are represented among the 27 players honored.
The All-Rookie offense includes Winston at quarterback, Gurley and Rawls at running back, Oakland's Amari Cooper and Minnesota's Stefon Diggs at wide receiver, New York Giants tight end Will Tye, Kansas City center Mitch Morse, Marpet and Washington's Brandon Scherff at guard and St. Louis' Rob Havenstein and Smith at tackle.
The All-Rookie defense includes New England's Malcom Brown, Chicago's Eddie Goldman, Minnesota's Danielle Hunter and the New York Jets' Leonard Williams on the defensive line, Alexander, New Orleans' Stephone Anthony and Minnesota's Eric Kendricks at linebacker, Buffalo's Ronald Darby and Peters at cornerback and Chicago's Adrian Amos and the New York Giants' Landon Collins at safety.
The All-Rookie special teams consists of San Diego placekicker Josh Lambo, Miami punter Matt Darr and Lockett at kick returner, punt returner and special teamer.

CORRECTION: Bryant enacted a new following system in January that involved unfollowing everyone on his list. We regret the error.

Kobe Bryant just unfollowed every one of his teammates from Twitter. #coachvino — Otto Von Biz Markie (@Passionweiss) February 28, 2014
Kobe Bryant has a pretty staunch social media policy that dictates he won't follow players that don't help the Lakers, at least this was his rationale when he unfollowed former teammate Dwight Howard last summer shortly after the center signed with the Rockets:
I wish d12 the best honestly. I just find it hard to follow players that wanna kick my teams ass #thatsjustme — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) July 9, 2013
And thus, perhaps this was his motivation for, according to the tweet above from Jeff Weiss, unfollowing his current Lakers teammates, who certainly haven't been helping the franchise out much this year. The squad has only mustered a record of 19-39 on the season, which is good enough for dead last in the Western Conference.
If he was attempting to pull off the most passive aggressive motivational tactic possible, then he knocked this one out of the park.
Donald Trump's campaign is bracing for new revelations after a video of the presidential nominee talking about grabbing women “by the pussy” was made public, Fox News reported Saturday.
This report came courtesy of Trump advisor Ben Carson, who spoke to chief Fox political correspondent Ed Henry about the fallout from the recording.
Carson claimed to have spoken with Trump about the possibility that more damning stories about the Republican nominee will be released.
“They have more things & they will drip them out,” Carson said, according to a tweet from the Fox host.
.@RealBenCarson told me he spoke to @realDonaldTrump this am: “He's not going anywhere. He told me he is staying in.” More top 2pm @FoxNews — Ed Henry (@edhenry) October 8, 2016
.@RealBenCarson told me he & @realDonaldTrump talked about more revelations coming: “They have have more things & they will drip them out” — Ed Henry (@edhenry) October 8, 2016
The content of Henry's conversation with Carson was also discussed on air by host Martha MacCallum, who said she wanted to “bring it to the viewers at home.”
“They believe there's more to come,” MacCallum said. “That there will be other bombshells like what we heard last night.”
According to @marthamaccallum on Fox, Ben Carson told @edhenry that Trump believes there are other similar “bombshells” coming: pic.twitter.com/B6AmclSAK4 — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 8, 2016
In the 2005 video published by the Washington Post on Friday, Trump tells Billy Bush, then the host of Access Hollywood, that he used his celebrity status to grope women without their permission. Trump issued an apology for the offensive, predatory comments in the recording, but has insisted he will never drop out of the race.
They favor the government over the voluntary sector.
I have long been puzzled by the enthusiasm with which many young liberal bloggers cheer on proposals to raise tax rates on high earners. I can understand why they might favor them, but not why they seem to invest so much psychic energy in the issue.
Some of this may just be team ball: You cheer when your side puts up numbers on the scoreboard. So Democratic cheerleaders are rah-rahing what they insist on calling repeal of the Bush tax cuts (which have been in effect now longer than the Clinton tax increases they rolled back).

But the liberal bloggers cannot be entirely ignorant of the fact that we have a pretty progressive income tax already. In 2009, the top 1 percent of earners reported 17 percent of adjusted gross income and paid 37 percent of total income-tax revenues.
#ad#By some measures, the American tax system, including the payroll tax and state and local taxes, is more progressive — in the sense of extracting disproportionate shares of revenue from high earners — than most European tax regimes, which rely heavily on value-added taxes.
Plus, as liberal economist Lane Kenworthy points out, you don't get much income redistribution from higher tax rates.
Advertisement
You get more from transfer payments. But, as House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan has documented, federal transfers are getting less progressive. Social Security and Medicare increasingly transfer money from young low earners to old people with relatively high incomes and considerable accumulated wealth.
Advertisement
One argument for higher rates is that increased revenues will reduce the federal budget deficit. But do liberal bloggers really care all that much about budget deficits? These same people often rue the fact that the Obama Democrats didn't plow an additional $1 trillion into their stimulus package.
I think the answer to the puzzle can be found in a remark Barack Obama made during the 2008 fall campaign — a remark that seemed to go mostly unnoticed.
ABC's Charlie Gibson asked candidate Obama if he would raise capital-gains taxes even if, as in the past, that brought in less revenue to the federal government.
Yes, said Obama. “I would look at raising the capital-gains tax for purposes of fairness.”
Advertisement
Ponder that answer for a moment. A candidate for president — president now — said he wants to take more money from people who earned it even though doing so would produce less money for the government.
Advertisement
The philosophy that has to be behind that answer is also behind the Obama-administration budgets that have proposed capping the charitable deduction for high earners. The clearly intended result would be a massive transfer of money from the voluntary sector of society into government.
Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s identified the voluntary sector as a unique feature of American democracy, one that gave it strength and character. He compared it positively with his own France, where centralized government stifled initiative and innovation.
The cap on charitable deductions has gone nowhere in Congress, where many Democratic members undoubtedly heard protests from their friends and supporters in the voluntary sector. We can see where that proposal leads from the Obama mandate that voluntary-sector organizations must buy health insurance that finances procedures their leaders consider deeply immoral. Centralized government will decide what's moral, and you'll be forced to pay for it.
Higher tax rates on high earners, even if they produce less revenue, are an attempt to centralize power in government and to limit the autonomy and countervailing power of individuals in the voluntary sector.
Advertisement
Which is why the liberal bloggers cheer them on. And why they eagerly join the Obama White House in demonizing the Koch brothers, who donate large sums to conservative causes. (Disclosure: I have spoken at two Koch conferences and was reimbursed for travel expenses.)
The Obama Democrats don't want their funders such as George Soros getting competition from the likes of Charles and David Koch.
Similarly, the prospect of Republicans spending as much money as Democrats (unlike 2004 and 2008, when Democrats spent more) led Obama to declare inoperative his denunciations of super PACs and to create his own, with Cabinet members authorized to raise money for it.
This election is a contest between a Democrat who wants to make this country more like Tocqueville's France and Republicans who want to keep it more like Tocqueville's America. The liberal bloggers are rooting for France.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis condemned a deadly blast at a church in Egypt and said at a Palm Sunday Mass that the world was suffering from wars, terrorism and “interests that are armed and ready to strike”.
Francis, who has not made any direct public comment on the current Middle East crisis, said the Mass as international tensions increased following the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, which the Pentagon says was involved in a chemical weapons attack that killed 87 people.
While the pope, who is due to visit Egypt April 28-29, was celebrating the Mass for tens of thousands of people, the Vatican received word of the blast that killed at least 21 people and injured 50 in a Coptic church in the Nile Delta.
“I pray for the dead and the victims. May the Lord convert the hearts of people who sow terror, violence and death and even the hearts of those who produce and traffic in weapons,” he said in hastily prepared comments at the end.
The blast was the latest assault on a religious minority that has increasingly been targeted by Islamist militants, and there have been deep security concerns over the pope's trip.
Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week that culminates on Easter Sunday, commemorates the day Christians believe Jesus entered Jerusalem and was welcomed as the messiah, only to be crucified five days later.
Francis, marking the fifth Easter season of his pontificate, blessed palm and olive branches in the center of St. Peter's Square before saying Mass.
“He (Jesus) is present in our many brothers and sisters who today endure sufferings like his own: they suffer from slave labor, from family tragedies, from diseases,” he said.
“They suffer from wars and terrorism, from interests that are armed and ready to strike. Women and men who are cheated, violated in their dignity, discarded,” he added.
Before the U.S. missile strike, Francis said he was horrified by the suspected chemical weapons attack, calling it an “unacceptable massacre” of innocent civilians.
Allies of the United States have expressed support for Washington's actions, calling them a proportionate response to Syrian forces' suspected use of chemical weapons. But they were denounced as illegal by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran.

Palm Sunday marks the start of a hectic week for the Pope, who on Thursday he visits a prison south of Rome to wash and kiss the feet of 12 inmates, commemorating Jesus' gesture of humility toward his apostles the night before he died.
Previous popes held the service either at the Vatican or a Rome basilica but Francis changed the tradition to stress the importance of going to the poor, the sick and the imprisoned.
He has drawn ultra-traditionalist ire for including Muslims and women in a service previously limited to Catholic men.
Abstraction vs. Physicality: The twin Suns of Homestuck.
For those of you who aren't up to date, I'm far from the first to argue for a Gnostic reading of Homestuck. Sam herself was describing it as an inherently Gnostic story as early as 2012 (and predicting the “Characters escaped from the narrative” angle to Act 7 that early, too). BetweenGenesisFrogs has been doing great writing from this angle, and yeah, so have I.
The gist is that Gnosticism posits two distinct worlds that exist in parallel:
The world of darkness, the low world ruled by the false God, Yaldabaoth:
The physical world of material reality, that we interact with on a physical basis. This world is described as false, limiting, and the source of suffering.
Then there's the world of Light, the spiritual worlds of Ideas and true information. The way the creation myth works is that there is a True God who goes by many names, the most modern of which is Abraxas. This God contains all opposites and emanates a series of Aeons — Deities/Ideas that come in pairs, and who are meant to “create reality together”.
If these Aeons sound familiar, well, they should. Besides the various parallels smattered throughout the story with specific pairs of characters, Homestuck has a literal set of pairs of Ideas that together make up all reality:
The Aspects.
So what we end up with is a work greatly informed by Gnosticism.
And one of the core principles of Gnosticism, the one we're going to discuss here, is that distinction between the invisible but “Good” World of Ideas and the tangible but “Flawed” World of Matter.
The capacity to perceive ideas is an intrinsic Good in Homestuck's universe. Hence why the artistic instinct is so championed: Anyone who adds ideas to reality through art is bettering that reality for themselves and all others, according to this philosophy.
This is why Caliborn is marked as a villain by his incredible inability to engage meaningfully with any art, or any Ideas other than the ones he has espoused for himself. What Caliborn creates, he creates poorly — and a lot of his “creation” is tantamount to stealing.
Understanding this gives new meaning to what have, up until now, seemed like somewhat arbitrary symbols:
The two different styles of Sun depicted in Homestuck.
This comic by my pal SamusRidley illustrates the point quite nicely.
On the one hand you have the blank white, Schematic Homestuck sun, which characters can look at with no issue. This sun is a representation of the idea of a sun. It is a depiction of the idea of Light, on a conceptual level, much like the Light aspect itself.
On the other, you have the photorealistic sun. This sun is realistic and presented as physical, literal.
This sun is still a symbol, but the physical sun denotes Material reality, and looks more photographic and well-executed to reflect this. The schematic sun, by contrast, is a representation of a concept — a cartoon, a blank suggestion of Ideas.
Sam herself put it best:
“ Both the schematic, abstract sun and the photorealistic, seemingly “real” sun are symbolic. They both carry meaning within the narrative. But the fact that one is schematic and the other is photorealistic is significant (it signifies).
Because in our culture we have a whole sort of mythology about photographs — that they're more real, that they're trustworthy, that they are in essence the simple truth. Whereas a cartoon is “just” a fabricated image.
But Homestuck flips that mythology on its head, turning the schematic, more abstract and notional image, the image closer to language, the image that needs to be read, into the true world of ideas that underlies reality.”
(Don't worry, I'm not going to write paragraphs for ALL of these. I really need to cut down my word count. Which means I should probably shut up now, wait, shit —
As such, what few symbols the photorealistic Sun DOES contain stress it's objective reality and raw physicality. In place of Blank #ffffff White, the physical sun looks bright and angry— and it is given a particular photo-realistic pallete, at least by comparison to the rest of the comic.
This sun is not a symbol for the concept of Light. It's a symbol for little else than all of the literal, physical realities that the Sun represents. The sun conveys heat and intense, unceasing, dangerous light. It is overbearing and browbeating when it appears. And the events it appears during define absolutely everything about the characters it appears TO.
Dave's strife battle with Bro is the epitome and conclusion of years of abuse for Dave, and the dominating tension of the sun conveys all of Dave's pent up stress and desperation, mirroring the pressure he puts himself under.
This relationship defines all of Dave's feelings about himself and interactions with others throughout the story, and the overbearing sense of weight he gives his abuser's implications for his identity are unquestionably True to him.
The same can be said of Alternia, where the sun is DESCRIBED as overbearing and dementedly forceful. The sun that blinds Terezi is also this colored-in, physical sun. Her viewing of it is also the result of an act of troll violence, an act that carries along the history of karmic acts that reverberates across her people throughout centuries and lifetimes.
Just like all of the feelings of inferiority to heteromasculinity Dave carries with him feel intrinsically True to him, troll ideals of cultural violence and suppression of emotion feels Real to Terezi. But neither thing is truly real. They are both just excellently formed, incredibly bright Lies.
But Terezi also sees her first glimpse of True light through Vriska's actions, and she grows to cherish the moment for this fact. Awakening on Prospit also guides Terezi further from Troll society's crude, imposed reality of violence and enslavement and towards Skaia/Sburb's ideology of self-fulfillment.
Do you see what's happening? Vriska's blinding sets Terezi on the path to lift herself out from the confines of Alternia's crude, material reality and up towards freedom and self-actualization in the Pleroma — the World of Light, the World of Ideas. It's the Gnostic path to Enlightenment, built into a character arc.
In contrast we have Kanaya, a troll who's values are pretty much completely untouched by the rest of Troll society and who's forms of self-identification and expression are informed entirely by Sburb. She's also the only Troll noted not to be affected by Alternia's overbearingly powerful Sun — Just as she is unaffected by it's brutalizing ideology.
Much as material reality is a lie in Gnostic faith, in Homestuck, the physicality of the sun is used to mark the extremely well-consructed ideological Traps that both Humans and Trolls are trapped in by their respective physical realities.
This is much as we in the modern day are encouraged to think in mutually exploitative and dehumanizing patterns by the physical worlds in our lives.You know exactly what I'm talking about, right? I don't seriously have to give a whole explainer on that, right. Ok let's move on.
This reaches comically explicit heights with Calliope. Like, how on the nose can it get? Calliope's entire existence has so little freedom it consists of a single room. Of a silent cage that plays host to an exhausting familial chess game, a death match of mutual disapproval and loathing.
Her only escape from Caliborn's spiteful, self-aggrandizing moralizing is escaping into fiction and friendships carried out online, and Calliope literally blurs the line between these two so much they don't exist. Her best friends ARE her favorite characters, and all she wants in life is the opportunity to escape the physical walls around her and be able to Be With Them.
She's LITERALLY TIED TO THE ROOM WITH A BIG CHAIN, she's as Homestuck as it gets — Calliope is CHAINED to her material reality,
both literally AND ideologically, as she believes all sorts of things are true about her own nature that hold her back and make her hate herself.
If any of that sounds familiar, well — it should, because in a lot of ways it was literally my childhood. I think in a way it was a LOT of people's childhoods. Calliope is the millennial nerd fandom experience for those of us growing up in conservative environments or with conservative family with control over our lives, distilled into a metaphysical microcosm.
Like me — like us — Calliope hates herself. Calliope hates her life and the arbitrary, meaningless rules keeping her and her brother connected, and keeping her from living out the life she dreams of — with friends and love and possibility and creative potential.
But she can do nothing to escape her confines except go online and engage with reality on a conceptual level — in the realm of Ideas. You know, just like we do in fandom? This is what Gnosticism is getting at — that the world of Ideas is intrinsically Good, for humanity and for ourselves.
The base, physical reality we live in is a burden, a falsehood, and we are diminished whenever we are bound to it. That's what Homestuck is getting at.
That's the lived experience Calliope represents. This dynamic is mirrored and recolored for every single character in the comic, pre-Sburb entry.
If you STILL don't quite buy that this is intentional, consider that the Gnostic depiction of Yaldabaoth depicts a red, colored sun:
After years of false starts and broken promises, it looks like the time for virtual reality gaming is finally here with the introductions of the Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, and HTC Vive. But 21 years ago, Nintendo tried to jumpstart the VR gaming revolution with the release of the highly anticipated Virtual Boy.
Nintendo spent untold millions advertising what the company hoped would be the next great gaming system, but no publicity for the Virtual Boy was more important than the articles running in Nintendo Power, the company's official magazine. Now that the magazine has become available on Archive.org, gamers can see just how high the company's hopes were for the Virtual Boy before its inevitable failure.
"It's in your face. It's in your eyes. It's in your blood." That's how Nintendo Power's August 1995 issue begins a 20-page feature article on the Virtual Boy. The article goes into detail on the system's specs, like its "two RTI mirror-scanning LED arrays," which promises an "immersive 3D experience" for gamers. It even explains how the system's monochrome red screen cut costs down for consumers, despite the Virtual Boy still retailing for $179. For comparison, the SNES launched at $200, with higher quality graphics and far superior games.
Still, Nintendo Power made the arrival of the system seem like the next big step in gaming. But an immersive 3D experience isn't worth much without the games to back it up, and the magazine did its best to ensure fans that there would be a treasure trove of great titles waiting for them upon the system's release.
Four pages of the magazine are spent building up Mario's Tennis, which was bundled with every Virtual Boy sold. Another four are spent on Galactic Pinball; this game would later go on to be one of Virtual Boy's best reviewed games, because it didn't make complete use of the system's clunky VR features.
But no title encapsulates the plight of the Virtual Boy better than the game tie-in to Waterworld. With similar narratives between the movie's troubled production and the Virtual Boy's development, the notoriously over-budget Kevin Costner bomb wound up becoming one of the worst reviewed games on the system, despite the promise of awesome battles against evil jetskiers.
While the magazine promised cutting-edge virtual reality tech and a 3D experience unlike anything on the shelf, what gamers got was a red, monochromatic image on the screen, with some clunky gameplay that many complained resulted in headaches and nausea if the headpiece was on for too long.
The system only sold an estimated 770,000 units, compared to the 40 million Game Boys and the 61.9 million NES units sold. The games were another problem, as only a handful were ever actually released. With no great titles to write about, Nintendo Power was left to try and make games like Virtual Fishing sound appealing.
Though the system debuted in North America in August 1995, it was discontinued by Nintendo in March 1996. By then Nintendo Power had moved on to the company's next innovation, one that would leave a much better lineage: the Nintendo 64.
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Reuters) - Israel does not plan to cooperate with a U.N. agency's investigation into alleged war crimes by Israeli troops and Hamas militants during fighting in Gaza, an Israeli government official said on Wednesday.
Israeli forces launched a 22-day offensive in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip in late December with the stated goal of stopping cross-border rockets fired by Palestinian militants.
According to a Palestinian rights group, 1,417 Palestinians, including 926 civilians, were killed in the fighting. Israel disputes those figures.
The United Nations Human Rights Council appointed former U.N. war crimes prosector Richard Goldstone this month to head the investigation into allegations of human rights violations by both sides during the Dec. 27 to Jan. 18 conflict.
The Israeli government official said a letter was sent to Goldstone, a South African judge, through the Israeli embassy in Geneva informing him and the council that Israel believed it was "impossible to cooperate with the committee" in its inquiry.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on Jan. 12 condemning Israel's military offensive and calling for its cessation was not supported by most democratic countries.
Hamas has not voiced opposition to Goldstone's inquiry but has yet to say whether it will cooperate. Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged the United States and the European Union to pressure Israel and Hamas to go along with the investigation.
Goldstone's four-member team is expected to travel to the region in a few weeks and will issue a report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in July, the investigator said this month.
Human rights groups have criticised Israel's conduct during the Gaza offensive and called for an investigation into possible war crimes.
In addition to looking at Israel's conduct, Goldstone has said his inquiry would assess possible Palestinian violations of human rights. Militants fired hundreds of rockets into southern Israel during the fighting.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Two former Yugoslav intelligence chiefs were jailed for life by a German court on Wednesday for masterminding the murder of a Yugoslav dissident in the southern German state of Bavaria more than three decades ago.

The court in Munich found Croats Josip Perkovic, 71, and Zdravko Mustac, 74, who were top officials in the communist-era Yugoslav secret service, guilty of complicity in the murder of Stjepan Durekovic, also a Croat.
Durekovic was found dead of gunshot wounds and head injuries in a garage in the town of Wolfratshausen in 1983.
The crime went back three decades to the period before the break-up of Yugoslavia in war in the early 1990s leading to the emergence of seven independent Balkan states.
“The prime motive was to kill a regime critic, a separatist,” presiding judge Manfred Dauster told the higher regional court in Munich. “Durekovic was to be muzzled - politically, but also physically.”
Croatia extradited Perkovic and Mustac in 2014, under pressure from Germany.
Defense lawyers plan go to Germany's federal high court to appeal Wednesday's ruling in Munich. If the sentences are upheld, Perkovic and Mustac will be able to apply to serve them in Croatia.
Another man, the owner of the garage who had managed to win Durekovic's confidence, was sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany in 2008 for his part in the murder. At the time, the court established that 22 Croats were murdered in West Germany, at the behest of the Yugoslav leadership.
Croatia initially refused to comply with Germany's extradition requests for the two men, triggering a diplomatic dispute in 2013 that threatened to overshadow the state's accession to the European Union.
Shortly before joining the EU on July 1 2013, in a move that irked its EU partners, Zagreb changed its laws to prevent the extradition of suspects in crimes committed before 2002, when new EU extradition rules took effect.
The Zagreb government said at the time that it wanted to protect veterans of Croatia's 1991-95 independence war from facing potential prosecution elsewhere in the EU. It denied any connection with the Perkovic case and pointed out that some EU member states had the same 2002 time limit.
The government later removed the time restriction after the European Commission warned it could face legal action, including possible loss of EU development funds.
Perkovic helped set up Croatia's national intelligence agency as it seceded from Belgrade in 1991, when Yugoslavia broke up in bloodshed, and held senior security posts through the 1990s.
A new study offers persuasive evidence that dinosaurs hunted at night, challenging prevailing assumptions that they were mostly active by day.
A new study by researchers at the University of California Davis offers persuasive evidence that small carnivorous dinosaurs like velociraptors hunted by night, while their larger, plant-eating counterparts foraged intermittently 24 hours a day. Their findings, published this week in the journal Science, challenge the prevailing assumption that dinosaurs dominated the daylight hours, leaving early mammals no choice but to venture out at night.
“We can now clearly demonstrate that dinosaurs were not strictly day-active,” explained Lars Schmitz, a postdoctoral researcher and co-author of the paper. “We can solidly end the view that all dinosaurs were diurnal whereas mammals were nocturnal. If mammals truly–which still needs to be shown–were hiding from the dinosaurs in the dark, the dinosaurs were certainly capable of following them.”
Schmitz and his colleague, Ryosuke Motani, a professor of geology and co-author of the paper, reached these groundbreaking conclusions about dinosaurs' daily schedules after verifying that eye size and dimensions can accurately predict whether animals are active by day, by night or at all hours. Diurnal (day-active) animals feature a small opening in the middle of their scleral ring, the bony ocular structure found in dinosaurs, lizards and birds but not in humans and other mammals. Nocturnal animals have a much larger opening, while cathemeral creatures—which roam about regardless of the time—fall somewhere in between.

The researchers compared the scleral rings and eye sockets of dinosaurs and other ancient beasts to those of 164 living species with known habits. They discovered that plant-eating dinosaurs probably grazed by night and day, much like modern herbivores such as elephants. Small carnivorous dinosaurs like the spry velociraptors of “Jurassic Park” fame, meanwhile, prowled for prey by the light of the moon. (Large carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus rex were excluded from the study because no fossils with sufficiently preserved scleral rings were available.)

“It was a surprise, but it makes sense,” Motani said of the study's results. For example, large herbivores probably needed to snack around the clock because of their massive metabolisms. As for predators like velociraptors, it has already been established that they benefit from the cover of darkness while stalking their victims.
Perhaps most of all, the study raises major questions about the behavior patterns of early mammals, which were previously thought to have a monopoly on nocturnality, said H. Richard Lane, program director in the National Science Foundation's Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research along with the German government. Modern mammals can be diurnal, nocturnal or cathemeral, with human beings falling into the first category.
"I can only imagine the fuel and comfort it provides for those fighting with their lives for their beloved Egypt."
Here in Cairo, Tahrir Square is teeming with journalists covering the Egyptian revolution. It's easy to spot them—they're the ones not chanting in Arabic while trying to micro-blog. If they see their own, they usually lock eyes and give a head nod. Others are more territorial. I'm pretty sure I saw a famous white-haired CNN reporter trace his thumb across his neck in a threatening manner when he noticed me noticing him. ​
I am here to witness arguably the most inspired uprising of my generation. But while the real journalists focus on the "important" issues, a man with my appetite is busy exploring less media-friendly angles—I'm after the hungry side of the revolution. ​
Liberation requires massive amounts of strength. Without discounting the passion that alone has fueled millions into a weeks-long protest, it is clear that Egyptians also rely on another direct source of energy. And that is a deceptively simple comfort food: koshary, the legendary dish that every Egyptian can both wax poetic on and furiously debate the merits of.
​I arrived in Cairo on February 2, in the midst of intense clashes between pro- and anti-government demonstrators in Tahrir Square. I attempted to walk through the mobs to my hotel, and subsequently sprinted away from several stampedes. Hours later, I was covering more battles outside the Square, where the Kasr al Nile Bridge feeds into the sprawl. Amid frantic fighting, I noticed many were clutching the same bowl of food, eating while dodging airborne rocks with side-steps and jukes. They were eating koshary. ​
Koshary is food of the people. Though associated with lower classes in Egypt, it would be tremendously ignorant to dismiss it as a "poor people's comfort food." Yes, koshary is very cheap to make and eat. But in a country with mass poverty, its very accessibility underscores the importance in its ability to feed everyone. Egyptians of all standing have fond personal memories of koshary. It is as close to a national dish as exists in Egypt and among the Egyptian Diaspora. ​
What's in Koshary?
As with most national foods, koshary is essentially a platform with countless variations. Every version however includes at least the following: pasta (usually elbow macaroni, but often ditalini mixed with broken vermicelli); brown lentils; fried onions; shatta, a tomato-chili sauce; and vinegar. Lentils, shatta and then fried onions are piled on a base of macaroni and condiments are added to taste. Nutritionally, it provides extended moxie from complex carbohydrates, protein and fiber. Ideal food for a revolution indeed. ​ With such few ingredients, each vendor has little room to stand out. Competition is fierce. Allegiances to vendors rival those to local football clubs Al-Ahly and Zamalek (death is not an uncommon consequence of this rivalry). Recipes for the perfect shatta or vinegar are harder to steal than a sarcophagus. It's a joy to hear locals speak about their favorite versions with such conviction—that, too, in the middle of advancing mobs.
Where Are All the Vendors?
Despite the surrounding turmoil, every person graciously took the time to discuss the significance of koshary. My Arabic skills consisted of pointing at their food, rubbing my belly and giving the "thumbs up" sign. Thankfully, Egyptians are much less ignorant than I, and easily speak at least broken English.
Determined to avoid rotting food at our hotel, we began asking protesters where we could find koshary nearby. ("We" included me and a friend, Sarsura, whose excellent grasp of Arabic was the key difference in eating well and starving.) Due to the chaos in Tahrir Square, nearly all businesses remain closed. The economic consequences have been enormous—Egypt's finance minister recently announced that the loss on Egypt's stock exchange during the crisis now exceeds the one during credit crunch.
While devastating for store owners, the revolution has spurred its share of entrepreneurs (read: hustlers), who sell homemade shai (tea) and koshary. Large bags, stuffed with plastic cups of koshary, hang from the backs of vendors' bicycles; they are emptied within minutes. The next time you see a flash mob in Cairo, check and see who's in the middle of it. If you're lucky, it's one of these guys on a bike. ​ At dusk many demonstrators, largely families and the elderly, slowly retreated back home, making way for shadier and more aggressive men arriving packed in door-less minivans. Some women pointed us west over the Kasr al Nile bridge, away from the Square, towards possible vendors. Along the bridge, several men guided us farther west, towards the Sheraton hotel. At the Sheraton, a soldier on a tank grinned and motioned across the street. After a few paces, we found ourselves facing a civilian checkpoint. ​
Two men approached us with a lazy curiosity. I suppose a funny-looking Indian man (me) wouldn't raise alarms; I'm certain the curiosity was due more to the striking Egyptian woman with me. Exasperated, we asked about a koshary vendor. They confidently assured us that the Holy Grail laid two streets to the left.
A car sped towards the checkpoint and screeched to a halt. One man grabbed a hockey stick; he was quickly joined by his fellow civilians wielding clubs as they surrounded the car. As the drama unfolded to our right, one man, unfazed, continued to give us directions to the vendor. Such is the national desire to feed hungry strangers.
We soldiered down the empty streets (i.e. barely-a-soul-was-stirring empty). Cairo residents say the streets have never been this barren in their lifetime. In a city of 7 million plus, facing unemployment rates from 30% to 70%, thousands are always loitering outside. Gridlock usually provides a constant buzz of horns and curses. On the way into Cairo, our cab driver expressed his utter disbelief - and based on his driving, utter bliss - that he was able to drive above 20 mph for the first time in memory.
A few pockets of people milled about on the sidewalks even with a government-imposed curfew - smoking, joking around, looking to score a passionate debate. For many, an empty avenue in downtown Cairo signals an end to their world. Yet for the vast majority of the angered masses, it is a welcome apocalypse. ​ Apparently, Egyptians are notorious for giving bad directions. I am notorious for ignoring directions. Lost again, we asked a group of animated men for help, and they eagerly pointed around the corner.
So, How Does It Taste?
Salvation. The place was closing shop, but we reached in time. The first bite of koshary was sensational. Musky, soft, crunchy, tangy, with a bright heat. Lentils and shatta get stuck inside the little pasta tubes, bombarded by crunchy onions, leading to a textural orgy.
One vendor was aware of his exact role in this revolution. "We feed everyone," he said. "We ask no questions."
Context usually makes things tastier than they really are. Here, context merely made us more grateful for the koshary. Its deliciousness is absolute in any setting. I felt restored, human.
I can only imagine the fuel and comfort it provides for those fighting with their lives for their beloved Masr (Egypt).

At the heart of the city lies a stretch of paving stones, an open top pedestrian mall that in any European city would most likely be full of street vendors, casual strollers and whiffs of fancy coffees. Ottawa's Sparks Street, largely owned by Public Works and the National Capital Commission, however, has become a no-mans land of tiny shops, empty restaurants and public art hardly seen by said public. Save for the lunch hour rush from the surrounding office towers or the occasional fire drill at the NCC, which uses it as a meeting place, the street lies empty during the week, despite its silent potential. So where is the street life needed to populate Sparks to a level where it feels safe, exciting and inviting? Why has a place of prime real estate and urban value in the heart of the city been left to become a non-place void of experience?
The idea of the “pedestrian street” is as old as the city itself, and has recently been a part of an urban revival of sorts as walking becomes more prevalent and promoted as a way to help combat both the environmental and obesity crises. But walking has also had a fashionable and political history, from the Flâneurs of Paris to the modern day psychogeographers of London; for it is in urban public spaces, such as the pedestrian street or covered arcade, where we rub shoulders with both the familiar and the foreign parts of our cities and society. It is where we come to see and be seen as we go about our daily routines and extracurricular adventures.
Spark's dire situation is well known. There have been criticisms of over imposing street clutter (with café tables, sculptures and signage interrupting the flow of people who are left to dodge hard objects in their path) and the fact that there are no real large business draws (Zellers having been the closest thing to a pull, and which will soon be replaced by Toronto-based restaurant The Bier Markt). And neither is there enough of a boutique-store nor “cultural hotspot” vibe to attract either people or dollars, and to make matters worse, Sparks is often a dark, windswept tunnel starving for sunlight.
But this is not to say Sparks Street is not trying to reinvent itself. A quick visit to the Street's website would leave you wondering why it often seems so desolate with its advertised festivals, live entertainment and a New Years Eve party billed as a “Time Square experience”. Stop by during Rib Fest or the Busker Festival and you will have a hard time even finding a place to rest your overflowing container of barbequed meat.
Perhaps then, it is more of an urban design than programming issue that is the demise of Sparks Street. It is easy enough to fill a space but how do we make it a meaningful experience rather than one based solely on entertainment. How do we (re)design and create a place that allows for both planned and impromptu performances, experiences and simple everyday life? Perhaps Sparks suffers most greatly from the fact that there are few residential units in the area, being heavily surrounded by office towers and government buildings, and thus is almost deserted past the evening rush hour. Also significant is the fact that there is no meaningful end to the pedestrian path, which starts purposefully at the War Memorial and with close proximity to the bubbling Byward Market, but dissolves into a vehicular road at the Memorial Arch on Lyon, an urban monument which is hardly even mentioned in Ottawa culture or registered in our psyche. In short, there is no real reason for someone to continue down Sparks, save for returning to their hotel or to catch a bus on Bank Street. So is it a geographical, urban design or business flaw? What will save Sparks and return it to its former glory of 1961 when, according to the Sparks Street Mall website, “The plan was a huge success and it convinced the City of Ottawa to permanently close the street to vehicles creating North America's first permanent outdoor pedestrian mall”? That is a pretty impressive claim to fame. So why the fall from grace?
Sparks Street and its unrealized possibilities need to be explored at both a planning and community level – a project perhaps best left to the imaginative minds of design students and town hall meetings, with ideas of movement and play at the heart of the competition brief. An urban intervention of sorts that will restore Sparks to a dynamic hub of activity and experience and a place in the Nation's Capital that works both on the scale of national civic pride and local neighbourhood joy. A place all Ottawans and Canadians alike will want to visit and return to. A place with an identity and character. A place with a spark.
Even while campaigning for somebody else, Barack Obama can't help but talk about himself.
During two appearances for Hillary Clinton on Thursday, the president referred to himself a total of 207 times — 110 in Miami and 97 in Jacksonville, Florida.
“Now, I have to say that I've been going to some college campuses and I realize that eight years ago some of you were ten,” Obama said during roughly 43-minute speech at Florida International University.
He then went on to defend his own record on the economy, energy and Obamacare.
“Can I just say I was driving through North Carolina yesterday and we passed by a gas station … and I noticed gas at $1.99.”
“Thanks, Obama,” he said, echoing someone in the audience.
During the Miami speech, he mentioned himself 30 times before talking about Hillary Clinton.
Here's Obama's speech in Miami:
Meanwhile, at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Obama focused a little less on himself before mentioning Hillary.
He talked about himself only 27 times before talking about his candidate and a total of 97 times during the roughly 41-minute speech.
Criticizing congressional Republicans, Obama said, “I mean, Democrats have their flaws. I promise you. I know them.
“Just like I got my flaws. I understand, we all got blind spots. But generally speaking, Democrats have consistently tried to work with the other side and do reasonable things and just make the government work,” he said.
He accused Republicans of opposing “anything good for the country” if a Democrat proposes it.
“In fact, sometimes I propose things that are in their platform just to see what they'll do. And they'll say ‘no' and I'll say, ‘But, you just proposed this.' Don't matter.
“‘We can't do it now cause you proposed it',” Obama said, apparently talking like the Republicans.
“‘In fact, it's your fault we can't support it because you supported it even though we said we wanted to do it.'”
“I'm not on the ballot, I'm not on this ballot,” he later said to boos.
Here's his full speech:
By overriding a veto from Gov. Roy Cooper (D-N.C.), the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature enacted a new budget today that cuts the state's personal and corporate income tax rates. Under this new budget, the state's flat personal income tax rate will drop from 5.499 to 5.25% in January of 2019, and the corporate tax rate will fall from 3% to 2.5%, which represents a 16% reduction in one of the most harmful forms of taxation. The newly-enacted budget also cuts the franchise tax rate for S-Corporations.
This new budget, which received bipartisan support from a three-fifths super-majority of state lawmakers, builds upon the Tar Heel State's impressive record of pro-growth, rate-reducing tax reform. Unfortunately, this latest round of tax relief in North Carolina will garner far less media coverage than the tax changes implemented in Kansas five years ago, even though North Carolina's population and economy are both more than three times the size of Kansas's.
It's remarkable how much progress North Carolina has made in improving its business tax climate in recent years, going from having one of the worst businesses tax climates in the country (ranked 44th), to one of the best today (now 11th best according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation). When Republicans took total control of the North Carolina government in 2010, the state had the highest personal and corporate income tax rates in the region, at 7.75% and 6.9%, respectively. Thanks to enactment of multiple rounds of tax relief, beginning with the landmark 2013 tax reform act, North Carolina will soon have a personal income tax rate that is 30% lower than what the top rate was only four years ago. The corporate rate, having been reduced by more than 63% since 2013, is now the lowest corporate income tax rate among states that impose such a tax.
North Carolina, more than any other state in recent years, has provided a model for what pro-growth tax reform and conservative fiscal policy looks like, and it deserves more attention from the national media than it receives. Democrat opposition to rate-reducing tax reform proposals in state capitals and at the federal level, such as Speaker Ryan's House Blueprint or the Trump administration's tax reform proposal, almost always involves a reference or allusion to Kansas these days. Opponents of tax relief proclaim that what has happened in that one small state since it cut taxes five years ago, and made mistakes in the process, somehow proves that passing any form of tax relief, at any time, at any level of government is a bad idea.
However, the Left's obsession with Kansas actually demonstrates what a weak hand Democrats have to play in opposing federal tax reform, or rate-reducing tax relief in the states. Because a more representative sample involving aggregate data looking at all 50 states debunks the liberal assertion that high levels of taxation and spending do no economic harm, they have resorted to cherry-picking one state, Kansas, and alleging that one case study to have determined that any sort of rate-reducing tax reform is inadvisable. It's an absurd premise, but it's all they've got.
One problem with the Left's obsession with Kansas, and Democrats' decision to make it central to their nationwide tax relief opposition strategy, is that the single Kansas case study that Democrats want the world to believe is so conclusive can be countered and rebutted with many more case studies from other states, North Carolina being one of the most prominent, that have passed rate-reducing tax reform in recent years and are prospering.
One of the biggest mistakes Kansas lawmakers made was their failure to rein in spending at the same time that they cut taxes. In fact, in the same year that Kansas lawmakers passed a $4.5 billion tax cut in 2012, they increased spending by over $432 million, which represented a 7.6% spending hike. That is a recipe for trouble, and it is a major reason why Kansas lawmakers came back and raised taxes at the beginning of June, which followed their passage of regressive tax hikes in 2015.
North Carolina didn't make the same mistake as Kansas. Since they began cutting taxes in 2013, North Carolina legislators have kept annual increases in state spending below the rate of population growth and inflation. As a result, at the same time North Carolina taxpayers have been allowed to keep billions more of their hard-earned income, the state has experienced repeated budget surpluses. As they did in 2015, North Carolina legislators are once again returning surplus dollars back to taxpayers with the personal and corporate income tax rate cuts included in the state's new budget.
The national media and Democratic politicians don't want to talk about North Carolina's experience with tax reform and fiscal policy, because it destroys their Kansas-centric strategy to opposing tax relief. It's not just North Carolina that opponents of tax reform have to ignore. They have to ignore the experience of other states that have approved tax relief in recent years – states like Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Arizona, and Indiana – and are outperforming high-tax states in terms of job creation, economic expansion, and population growth. Opponents of tax relief also have to ignore the experience of the nine states that do not have an income tax.
In the decade from 2005-2015, the nine states with zero income tax saw population increase by an average of 12.9%, while population in all 50 states rose by 8.8%. During that same period, the nine states with the highest income tax rates saw population grow by only 6.6%. The nine states with zero income tax also had economic, personal income, and payroll growth that outpaced all states on average, and outperformed the high income tax states to an even greater extent.
It's not just North Carolina and other states' experience that debunks the bogus claim that Kansas proves that all tax relief is to be avoided, but also a great deal of social science. John Hood, chairman of the John Locke Foundation, has taken the time to survey over 680 peer-reviewed academic journal articles on fiscal policy published over the past quarter century. According to Hood, “the preponderance of peer-reviewed research finds a negative relationship between state taxes and measures such as job creation and income growth.”
In announcing his opposition to the new budget, Gov. Cooper portrayed the income tax cuts as a giveaway to the rich. Cooper's claim is flat out false. In fact, despite what the first term Democratic governor has misled the public to believe, this new budget will actually shift the income tax burden from the middle class to to higher income households. When the income tax cuts take effect in 2019, households with annual income below $100,000 will contribute a lower percentage of total income tax collections than they presently do. Meanwhile, this budget will have households with income greater than $100,000 paying greater share of total income tax collections than under current law.
With this latest round of personal and corporate income tax relief, Senate President Phil Berger, Speaker Tim Moore, and their colleagues in the General Assembly are strengthening North Carolina's impressive record of pro-growth tax reform. While this latest round of tax relief will benefit individuals, families, and employers across the North Carolina who will get to keep more of their hard-earned income, it will also help lawmakers in other states and in Congress by demonstrating the positive results that come from passing rate-reducing tax reform, coupled with spending restraint.

From New York, to London, to Tokyo, tall buildings are a familiar – though not always popular – part of the cityscape. In Paris, there is vocal opposition against proposals for three new towers in the city centre – the Tour Triangle, the Tour Duo and the new Palais de Justice. Meanwhile, London appears set for a skyscraper boom, with hundreds of new towers to be built in the UK capital over the coming years.
Some people are concerned that these new developments will destroy the cities' historic skylines. In particular, Alain de Botton has warned that London could be turned into “a bad version of Dubai or Shanghai”. But this comparison is laughable, and the fear that London is set to be overrun by empty crystalline towers is entirely misplaced.
Boom or blip?
Research tells us that London has 263 buildings of 20 storeys or more in height, either under construction or proposed to be built. To many, this is a huge and frightening number. But let's put this figure in context: Shanghai had 6,266 20-storey towers already built by 2014, with thousands more in the pipeline. China is without doubt the global centre of tall building construction. To accommodate an extra 350 million urban dwellers by 2025, it is estimated the country will build 50,000 new skyscrapers. This is 190 times the number proposed in London, and equivalent to ten New York Cities.
Meanwhile, Switzerland – a country known better for timber chalets than glass skyscrapers – has plans to build between 140 and 160 new towers. The country has a population similar to London's, but much more land to build on, so you'd think there would be relatively little demand for high-rise buildings. And yet Switzerland is still proposing to build almost two-thirds as many towers as London.
When it comes to tall residential buildings, those with roughly 45 storeys or more are likely to be more than 150 metres tall. London currently has 16 towers of this height, while Dubai has 146, and Shanghai has 125. Should all the proposed towers get built, London will see this figure rise to 47. This might sound like a boom to Londoners, but on an international scale, it is actually little more than a blip. London is not going to turn into Shanghai-on-Thames any time soon.
Getting dense
One of the main arguments for building tall is to create greater density. By stacking dwellings on top of each other, a plot of land can accommodate more people, and reduce the need to build outwards into the countryside. Yet many argue that low-rise and terraced housing can achieve the same density as towers. While this may be possible on larger sites, where the inclusion of streets and squares is viable, when it comes to developing London's smallest brownfield sites, the only way to accommodate higher numbers of houses is to build upwards.
Paris is often cited as the prime example of a low-rise, high-density city. The city accommodates 21,500 people per square kilometre, making it one of the densest in the Western world. And yet there has not been a single skyscraper built in central Paris since 1973, when the 59-storey Tour Montparnasse became the “most hated building in Paris”. Instead, the focus has been on buildings of six to eight storeys.
But the idea that Paris is a city without skyscrapers is actually a myth. Instead, all of its new tall buildings are clustered in a region known as La Défense, at the outskirts of the city, away from its historic centre. This has allowed Paris to develop a dense office district and compete financially with other cities while maintaining the character of its low-rise boulevards in the centre.
While outside the political boundary of Paris proper, these towers are still part of the urban landscape: they are physically and visually connected to the city via the Axe historique, which links La Défense with landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and Louvre. If we include La Défense, Paris actually has more skyscrapers than London, with 19 taller than 150 metres in height, compared to London's 16.
So Londoners shouldn't think that the skyscraper is an enemy of the historic low-rise city. Far from it. We need to recognise that high-rise construction can be a key tool to preserve the historic urban realm, allowing the development demanded by economic and population growth to be diverted away from historic areas, preserving their character for residents and tourists alike.
The height of the housing crisis
It's not just high-rise office blocks that attract opprobrium: residential towers are also accused of assaulting the eyes. Currently, London is experiencing a housing crisis: 210,000 new dwellings will be needed over the next five years to cope with population growth. But future Londoners will not be forced to live in towers.
Even if all 263 of the planned skyscrapers actually get built, they will only create 14,800 new homes, meeting just 7% of the total demand for housing. The remaining 93% is likely to come from low-rise buildings, which should go some way to reassuring the skyscraper sceptics.
Another criticism of London's residential towers is that they are creating safe-deposit boxes in the sky; investment homes for the super-rich, which will remain empty until they can be sold on for a tidy profit. While it is true there is a shameful lack of affordable housing in modern high-rise apartment blocks in London, there is little evidence that new units are going to remain unoccupied.
This is not to say that empty houses are not a challenge in London: in 2014 alone, more than 20,000 dwellings were vacant for longer than six months. The borough of Lambeth – home to several tall residential towers – had the highest number of empty houses, with 1,354. But the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, characterised by low-rise, high-density architecture, was placed second, with 1,250 vacant dwellings.
Empty millionaire pads aren't only found on top of towers, but across all luxury developments, including low-rise housing. The issue of empty houses won't be addressed by stopping the spread of skyscrapers.
Healthy variety
Detractors of the high-rise will also tell you that tall buildings are expensive to build and maintain, and unsustainable due to high energy needs. This, they say, makes the tall building unsuitable for affordable housing. Again though, this doesn't tell the full story: while building vertically is often more expensive up front, there can be notable energy and cost savings over the longer term.
Stacking up housing allows residents to live closer to the centre of a city, giving them better access to public transportation and cultural facilities and reducing the energy needed for transit. Heating is the largest consumer of energy in our dwellings, and here tall buildings offer benefits, too. Due to their compact form, high-rise towers lose very little heat through their walls, and have been found to have the lowest heating needs of all building types. This means a reduced carbon footprint, and lower bills for residents as energy prices continue to rise.
It would be foolish for anyone to suggest London should follow the path of Dubai, Hong Kong and Shanghai and attempt to house its population entirely in tall buildings. But surely it's just as foolish to limit all London's future housing to terraces, or six to eight storey buildings, as those like de Botton are suggesting. London doesn't need just one or two building types – it needs a wide mix of housing. These should probably be mostly low or medium-rise buildings, as is the case today. But they should also include strategically-placed skyscrapers, to increase population density and help London meet its desperate housing needs.

The careers of Ibrahim Afellay and Wesley Sneijder have much in common: The two Utrecht-born players both took their first steps with local amateur clubs in the city before joining a top Dutch team and developing over time to become the best midfielders in the Eredivisie; then they moved to the Spanish league. However, the duo have only played together at international level with Holland. In fact, while the current Inter schemer wore the shirts of DOS Utrecht, Ajax and Real Madrid, his fellow Utrecht native joined Elinkwijk Utrecht, PSV Eindhoven, and now, Barcelona.
Afellay is two years younger than Sneijder; yet when the midfielder made his debut for PSV's first team on 4th February, 2004, at the age of 17, he was widely considered the PSV Academy's answer to Ajax's golden youth product. In Holland, the Dutch player of Moroccan descent followed Sneijder's footsteps, tracing his fellow Utrecht native's progress. When Sneijder left Ajax for Real Madrid in the summer of 2007, he left as, undisputedly, the Eredivisie's finest midfielder. In the last two seasons, Afellay has had that mantle too. The Dutch league began to seem too small for his ambition and quality. A move abroad, as it had been for Sneijder, was just a matter of time.
Of course, there are differences between the Dutchmen. 2010 was, for Sneijder, the year every player spends an idle moment dreaming about. Four trophies won – the Champions League, Serie A, Coppa Italia and FIFA Club World Cup – with Inter and reaching the World Cup final with Holland. Afellay must hope Josep Guardiola can help him to continue to replicate Sneijder and work the same wonders Jose Mourinho did with the 26-year-old.
The Afellay deal, for just €3M due to the player's contract expiring at the end of the current campaign, arrived at just the right time for both Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven. The Catalans were looking for an attacking midfielder who could replace – if necessary – stars like Xavi or Andres Iniesta, or even be deployed on the wing. Barcelona's poor financial situation, which was a contributory factor in their decision to take shirt sponsorship from the Qatar Foundation – the club's debts are around €480M – however, would not allow them to snare their main target, Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas.
Finances are a touchy subject over at the Philips Stadion too. Last summer, the Dutch side had debts of €17.5M, and could not count on Champions League income. Since 2009, PSV have been forced to shed their highest earners: Jeremie Brechet, Edison Mendez, Danko Lazovic, Timmy Simons, Andre Ooijer and Carlos Salcido have all departed. This January was Afellay's turn, despite the fact that last August PSV turned down an offer from Hamburg, due to the midfielder's concerns about the state of the Bundesliga club and how he would be utilised. However, with Afellay's contract running to an end in June, PSV could not allow their star to depart for free. Barcelona's offer was not quite as high as expected, but the Philips-backed club had to make the best of a bad situation.
Afellay bid farewell to PSV on 22nd December, 2010, in the home clash against Roda Kerkrade; he remains the best 2010/11 Eredivsie performer. The 24-year-old spent eight seasons in the first team, winning four Dutch titles, one Dutch Cup and one Johan Cruyff Schaal (the Dutch Super Cup). Moreover, in 2007, Afellay was awarded the Johan Cruyff Award for the Young Player of the Year. According to the rules of the accolade, every winner can choose the location of a Cruyff Court (a public playground which provides a safe area for local children and other members of the community). Afellay chose Al Hoceima, a Moroccan city to which his family can trace their roots.
It hasn't been all plain sailing for Barcelona's newest signing though. Injuries and growth spurts hampered the Dutchman during his first year as a professional. Until 2008, Afellay regularly missed between seven and ten Eredivisie matches every season due to injury niggles. For the same reason, he missed the two UEFA Under-21 Championships Holland won in 2006 and 2007. Unlucky though is a word Afellay does not want to hear: “I lost my father when I was six. My mother had to break her back to bring up her five children. So, being sidelined for a month or two is not what I would call bad luck.”
With PSV, “Ibi” – as he has become known – developed into a complete player, one who can operate in a variety of positions. In a 4-2-3-1 system, Afellay can play as an attacking midfielder, or even as a sitting midfielder – as he has this season under coach Fred Rutten, playing behind the quartet Balazs Dzsudzsak-Ola Toivonen-Jonathan Reis-Jeremain Lens. Barcelona's new boy can also move to the left flank, as he often does for Holland, due to the concurrent presence of two genuine number 10s, Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart. So far, Afellay has picked up 30 caps with the Oranje, although he has mostly been used as a substitute. Last October, the midfielder picked up his first two international goals in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Sweden.
Afellay's great adventure in the Catalan capital – he is the 21st Dutch player in the history of the club – began with a article in Spanish daily El Perodico joking: “The first three balls Afellay touched during his first training session were far better than all Winston Bogarde's performances in his time at Barcelona.”
Nobody expects Afellay to become the next Cruyff, but an impact similar to that of Marc Overmars or the De Boer brothers at the Camp Nou would be more than enough to delight the Catalan faithful. Afellay is capable of such brilliance, as he continues to track Sneijder with relish.
It's 9 a.m. in China, and nearly 80 million users are logged on to online chat network QQ, most of them on the Chinese mainland. Later today, that number will reach nearly 150 million. In smoky web cafes, office blocks and homes across China, millions of Chinese make QQ China's dominant online community.
With its cutesy penguin logo, QQ is “like MSN and Facebook rolled into one,” according to Zixue Tai, Chinese internet researcher and author of “The Chinese Internet: Cyberspace and Civil Society.” QQ has grown so spectacularly that it almost resembles a region of Chinain itself, with a population rivalling most provinces. “It's hard to find anyone in Chinese cities who doesn't use QQ,” Tai says.
Like most of the Chinese internet, QQ was originally based on a foreign model: “QQ started as a copy of America Online's messenger program,” Tai says. QQ was launched in 1999 by Tencent, a small company based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen. Tencent's founder, Ma Huateng (马化腾), who goes by the English name Pony Ma, was a recent computing graduate who grew up close to Shenzhen.
QQ's total user base is now more than 700 million. That's higher than China's total online population, estimated to be around 500 million, suggesting that some QQ users have registered several accounts. Eighty-five percent of instant messaging users in China rely on QQ, with just 14 percent turning to Microsoft's MSN messenger as their main means of staying tuned in, according to the China Internet Network Information Center.
Each user is assigned a unique QQ number, and the fact that Chinese business cards often carry this in place of an email address is testament to the service's ubiquity. “It's a source of pride for Chinese people, that we have a home-grown site to rival MSN or Facebook,” explains Tai. QQ's rise turned Tencent into China's largest internet company, though its company registration is currently in the Cayman Islands.
With nearly half of its registered users under 25, QQ is changing the social habits of a generation of Chinese. “There's no question QQ has transformed China's youth culture,” Tai says. A survey carried out by MTV in 2008 found that China was the only Asian country where young people reported having more online than offline friends.
As millions of Chinese youths migrate from the countryside to cities in search of work, they use QQ to keep in touch with old friends and make new ones. QQ's search function made it easier to find friends online, enabling its users to reach out to others who share the same interests. Early versions of QQ were set to accept conversation requests from strangers by default. “Users' privacy concern level is low in China,” researchers atRenminUniversity wrote in a 2008 report. “Users are happy to be connected with strangers in a virtual community.”
A variety of factors have made Chinese youth especially willing to engage in social media. Rural-to-urban migration that separates families, loneliness created by China's one-child policy and the monotony of China's mainstream media are all factors, according to Tai. “The popularity of QQ reflects an increasing fragmentation of society,” he says.
Beyond Chat
By the mid-2000s, QQ had trounced its rivals and established itself as the champion of China's instant-messaging market. The fact that QQ was free to use was a central part of its appeal, but it became a problem for Tencent, which lacked a way of capitalizing on the network's popularity. QQ's development since then has essentially been the story of the search for reliable income streams.
Tencent's first innovation was QQ Zone, a MySpace inspired site which gave users a customizable web page for uploading text, photos and music. Today QQ Zone has over 150 million active users, uploading an average of 60 million photos every day. Users could pay extra to upgrade their QQ zone with different backgrounds and banners. “When I was in high school, I'd spend at least RMB 100 a year on my QQ space,” says Peng Yuan, a university student in Beijing.
Tencent realized that though its users weren't wealthy, they were willing to pay small amounts for individual online purchases. Today, over 80 percent of Tencent's revenue comes from value-added services that users pay for using QQ coins (币, Bì) QQ's virtual currency. Tencent introduced QQ coins in 2002, and the currency has since become the main driver of China's virtual goods market, valued at about US$5 billion in 2009.
One of the most popular ways for users to spend their QQ coins is to tailor their online identity with Tencent's avatar design service, QQ Show (秀, Xiù). Based on Cyworld, a South Korean service that enables users to chat online using self-designed avatars, Tencent designed QQ Show as a place for users to “show their online identity,” according to Camellia Yang, an analyst at internet research firm Synegage.
QQ Show's users start out with a simple cartoon avatar, which they can alter for small payments made with QQ coins. Users can change their avatars' physical characteristics, such as height and hairstyle, and can also buy clothes and makeup, all of which is visible to other users during chat sessions. There are now 440 million uniquely customized avatars on QQ Zone, according to Synegage. “The QQ Show concept spread through word of mouth, like viral advertising,” Yang says.
Tencent partnered with clothing brands, such as 361 Degrees, a sportswear manufacturer, allowing QQ Show users to buy a purple 361 Degree hoodie, or a pink 361 branded handbags for their avatars. For many teenage users, buying clothes for their avatars is a replacement for buying clothes for themselves “In high school I could easily afford a RMB10 dress for my avatar, but buying one for myself was less affordable,” Peng says.
QQ Show now offers virtual shopping malls packed with Chinese brands, and even virtual car dealerships, where sports cars can be bought from cartoon car salesmen with immaculately drawn side-partings. “It was exciting telling friends that I'd changed my avatar's clothes, and seeing their reactions,” Peng says.
QQ Show's success demonstrates the often intimate relationship Chinese youth have with their online personas. In a 2008 survey, twice as many Chinese internet users as Americans said that they lead parallel lives online. More than two-thirds of Chinese surveyed said they felt that they are free to do and say things online that they would not do or say offline, compared with just a third of American respondents. “Having a bright, extravagant QQ avatar was a big comfort to me when I was upset,” Peng says, remembering her schooldays.
QQ coins are in such demand that they even impact China's national currency. Thousands of QQ users who'd earned coins in online games began selling them for cash in 2007, launching China's first period of virtual currency speculation. In some rural areas, where debit and credit cards are scarce, stores began to accept QQ coins as payment for real goods and services, while China Merchants Bank launched a debit card offering 25 percent discounts when making QQ Show payments.
“QQ coins were being traded with such volume and frequency that they did start to drag down the value of the yuan,” one financial analyst told the Wall Street Journal. In other words, demand was so great that QQ coins began to have more buying power than genuine Chinese banknotes.
The rise of QQ coins was also blamed for a variety of perceived social evils in China. QQ's network was awash with talk of “QQ girls” who offered to trade online sex for QQ coins. Gambling is illegal in China, but online mahjong games paid for with QQ coins could be converted into cash prizes, creating a new grey gambling market.
A Chinese court handed down the country's first-ever criminal punishment for the theft of virtual goods in 2009, in the northern province of Heilongjiang. Three men approached their victim in a cybercafé after noticing that his QQ account was unusually full of virtual goods. After the victim was assaulted, he was forced to hand over nearly RMB100,000 worth of virtual goods to the attackers, including weapons for online games, according to official reports.
The growing impact of QQ coins was also enough to worry top government ministries in China, including the central bank, which announced it was “on the lookout for any assault by such virtual currencies on the real economic and financial order.”
A Social Force?
Another QQ innovation over MSN was the “QQ Group” (群 Qún), which offered chat users with shared interests a way to stay permanently in touch. “QQ is fundamentally a group thing,” internet researcher Tai says.
There are now over 100 million QQ groups, catering to a panoply of social interests, from fans of particular TV shows to astronomy enthusiasts. A look through the groups on offer also highlights some of the more unique aspects of Chinese society. There are QQ groups for so-called xiaosan (小三), or the mistresses of wealthy businessmen, as well as the wives who discover their husband has a mistress. Another group caters to women who have found out that their husbands are gay.
“People who use QQ groups are looking for information which isn't available in the mainstream media,” Tai says. The groups give a platform to Chinese subcultures, but do not extend to more political groups. “Very few QQ groups are formed based on political interest,” he says. Tencent is open about its censorship of sensitive political content from QQ, but most of QQ's user base lacks an interest in political topics. “If you are starting political conversations on QQ you are likely to become a loner,” Tai adds.
Aging Populations
Tencent is still China's largest internet company, with annual growth reaching as high as 60 percent over the last decade. But its expansion is slowing, and there is a pervasive feeling that the online goods and games market may have reached saturation point. “There is a ceiling on internet value-added services, so that is giving us a sense of urgency,” Tencent founder Pony Ma told reporters last year. In response to declining revenues, Ma has pledged to invest more than 10 percent of sales into Tencent's research and development program, which already employs half the company's staff.
In recent years QQ has faced tougher competition from new social networking services such as Renren, which were deliberately modeled on Facebook. “Since I started university, I've been using Renren much more than QQ,” Peng says. “The add-ons and apps are better suited to university students. But I still open my QQ account; it's the most basic part of using the internet,” she adds. That's a view reflected by internet analyst Yang. “Nearly all Chinese people have the habit of logging on to QQ after turning on their computers,” she says.
New social networks, such as Tencent's own voice messaging service Weixin (微信), are unlikely to change that habit, according to Yang. “When Weixin asks if you want to add friends, adding your QQ friends is the first option,” she says. Microblogging services serve a different function than QQ, according to Tai: “Weibo is still fundamentally about sharing information, such as news links and commentary,” he says. “But QQ is mainly an entertainment platform.”
Reaching the elderly still offers QQ a hope for expansion. “There's definitely been an increase in middle-aged and elderly users of QQ in the last few years,” Tai says, explaining that elderly users are turning to QQ to stay in touch with family members. That raises an enticing prospect for China's virtual goods market: virtual armchairs and false teeth, anyone?

Before addressing the nation, the president phoned the outlets to say, "The best thing that could happen is exactly what happened."
Before President Donald Trump spoke to the American people after the defeat of his proposed health care bill, he first reached out to two outlets he has previously referred to as "fake news."
Moments after Trump and GOP leaders pulled their Obamacare repeal bill off the House floor on Friday, Trump spoke to The New York Times over the telephone, where he blamed Democrats and predicted the Affordable Care Act will "explode."
“The best thing that could happen is exactly what happened — watch,” he told the Times. “It's enough already.”
The Washington Post's Robert Costa wrote that Trump called his cellphone to inform him that the health care bill was dead.
"President Trump called me on my cellphone on Friday afternoon at 3:31 p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint since it was a blocked number," wrote Costa. "Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lede: 'Hello, Bob,' Trump began. 'So, we just pulled it.'"
Trump, who had vowed throughout his campaign and after taking office that he would fix America's health care system, also told Costa that the Democrats were to blame.
“The beauty,” Trump said while referring to the Democrats, “is that they own Obamacare. So when it explodes they come to us and we make one beautiful deal for the people.”
Shortly after, Trump addressed the nation, where he again predicted on live television that the Affordable Care Act, which he referred to only as Obamacare, will ultimately explode and force the Democrats to work with them on a better plan.
"We were very close and it was a very tight margin," said Trump from the Oval Office. "We had no Democrat support, we had no votes from the Democrats. They weren't going to give us a single vote so it was a very difficult thing to do.
"The best thing we can do politically speak is let Obamacare explode. It's exploding right now. Almost all states have big problems," he said, naming Tennessee and Kentucky as examples.
Trump, who recently gave an interview to Time magazine about all of the events he claims to have predicted, then predicted a "very, very bad" 2017.
"A lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing Phase 1, but when you add Phase 2 and Phase 3, which I think we would have gotten, it became a great bill," he said.
When taking questions later, Trump conceded, however, that he there were "things in this bill that I didn't particularly like." He said, "We can do a better bill" and said that Obamacare was 100 percent Democratic and that "having a bi-partisan" bill would be a "good thing."
Trump: I'd love to see Obamacare do well but it can't. “It's imploding, soon will explode.” https://t.co/47BEWUcOPy https://t.co/vobeR05TeQ — CNN (@CNN) March 24, 2017
Despite the humiliating loss, Trump reiterated that the best thing that could happen is what happened today, because "we'll end up with a truly great bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.
"What would be really good is if the Democrats, when it explodes, which it will soon, is if they got together with us and if we got a real health care bill," he said. "I'd be totally open to it."
He then singled out Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
"I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because now they own it," he said. "They 100 percent own it. This is not a Republican health care. They have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will, at some point in the future."
He added, "When they all become civilized and get together and try to work out a great health care [system] for this country we're totally open to it."

Trump said he learned a lot from the process, including about loyalty, the voting process and about some "very archaic rules in obviously the Senate and the House." He maintained that the experience will result in a better health care plan in the "no-so-distant" future.
He continued, "Bad things are going to happen to Obamacare. There's not much you can do to help it. I've been saying that for a year and a half: The insurance companies are leaving and you have states in some cases [that] soon will not be covered. There's no way out of that."
Despite harping on the fact that "we will be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future," he insisted that he does want great health care for the people of this nation. Saying of the Democrats, "Whenever they're ready, we're ready."
Before signing off on Friday, Trump reminded Americans that he never said he planned to repeal and replace the bill within 64 days of taking office.
"I have a long time," he said. "I really believe there will be some Democratic support that will happen."
Many politicians were swift to react to the development on social media, including Trump's former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton who called today a "victory for all Americans."
MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A kinkajou, which is normally found in rain forests in South America, was discovered in the attic of a southwest Miami-Dade County home during the weekend.
"This 99-year-old woman is sound asleep, she feels something, she wakes up and this kinkajou -- this furry, big animal -- is curled up asleep on her chest," Dr. Don Harris of South Dade Animal Hospital said.
Harris said the woman and animal were both startled, and the kinkajou eventually made its way to the attic.
Cathy Moghari was able to help lure the kinkajou out.
"I start thinking, 'How are we going to get this animal out?' So I googled kinkajou sounds and found a video," Moghari said. "And I was holding it up to the ceiling, and we hear a rumbling. And, sure enough, it came out to the opening that we had in the ceiling."
Kinkajous are nocturnal animals that rarely are seen in the day and are native to Central and South America.
However, special permits allow people in the U.S. to keep the animal as exotic pets, and this one likely slipped out from its owner sometime over the past few weeks.
"This particular animal is kind of a cross between a raccoon and a monkey," Harris said. "It's in the raccoon family, so they're very dangerous."
Moghari said she picked up the kinkajou, took it home for the night and took it to the veterinarian Tuesday morning. Moghari said she wasn't scared by the animal.
No, but I have respect for it," she said.

Is Sonia Gandhi's sycophants coming home to roost? I ask the question not just because I was attacked on national television last week by one of her toadies, although I admit it gives me a useful peg. Said toady was Mani Shankar Aiyar and he was obnoxious to the point of being crass. But I understand his behaviour. His survival in politics depends on his unreserved, unquestioning devotion to the Gandhi family so he has to exhibit his loyalty any chance he gets. There are others like him who have scuttled out of different corners of Sonia's court to make me their favourite hate object since my book Durbar came out. They are of no consequence except in the drawing rooms of Delhi.
It is sycophants that Sonia has placed in high office who are really letting her down at a time when her government is being seen as beleaguered and incompetent. At the top of this list is the Prime Minister. The reason why he was given his job, not once but twice, was because his loyalty to the Gandhi dynasty was absolute. He could be trusted to take the blame for all mistakes and to give credit to the Gandhis for all things good. What neither he nor Sonia noticed was that when you are given charge of running a government, unquestioning loyalty is usually a serious handicap.
If the good Dr Manmohan Singh had been less loyal, he would have told Sonia long ago that her economic advisors in the National Advisory Council (NAC) were giving her bad advice. He would have told her that the centralised welfare schemes they imposed upon him had been tried in the past and failed. He said nothing so the NAC do-gooders were allowed to squander vast amounts of taxpayers' money on schemes of dubious merit. He said nothing either when corrupt ministers started using their discretionary powers to make private fortunes out of licences and contracts. They took full advantage of the infrastructure of crony socialism that continues to give officials the powers of life and death over private investors.
When the investment climate became poisoned and the economy started to collapse, another Sonia loyalist in the Ministry of Environment used his discretionary powers to block major projects. According to the government's own figures, recently given by the Finance Minister, public money worth Rs 10 lakh crore lies stuck in projects that have stalled for want of clearances of one kind or another. When the Prime Minister finally put his foot down and 'promoted' Jairam Ramesh, he was replaced by another Sonia loyalist who has been as obstructive. The Environment Ministry still has not drawn up measureable standards and norms, so every project has to be assessed individually. Is it any wonder that even tiny Southeast Asian countries like Thailand have roads, ports, airports and railways that are 50 years ahead of ours?
In this week, when we mourn the shocking, tragic death of Sarabjit Singh, it is important to remember that he died because Indian diplomacy failed. Indian diplomacy has become such a feeble thing that our smallest neighbours treat it with contempt. So why should it surprise us when China and Pakistan behave badly? The ministers in charge of national security are all Sonia loyalists. Such grateful loyalists that they are given to declaring publicly that they would die for her and that they would do anything she orders them to. Sycophancy makes them talk this way and the knowledge that they have been chosen for high office not because of their ability but because of loyalty to the leader.
There is a cautionary tale here that other political parties would do well to pay attention to. Democratic feudalism worked well in another era and it was this that gave the Gandhi dynasty such power. It no longer seems to work so those political parties which, in careful emulation of Congress, have created their own dynasties and whose leaders surround themselves with their own caboodle of sycophants need to tread carefully. Not just because sycophants are nearly always useless when the going gets tough but, because most Indian voters appear to be sick and tired of feudal methods of governance.
Young Indians are inclined to be irreverent, impatient and not as easily fooled as their parents were. They want leaders who can make India a better country and give them the opportunities that will enable them to make their own lives better. Political leaders of the feudal kind who live behind high walls of security through which only sycophants find access can never deliver these things. This is because the one thing that sycophants do very, very well is shelter the object of their devotion from people who would dare to tell them the truth. So, between the leader and reality, the chasm widens and widens.

Prosecution of five Blackwater employees could be thrown out over immunized statements
A US District Court judge has barred the public from attending — or the media from reporting on — hearings in the trial of five Blackwater employees charged over the killing of 14 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad's Nisoor Square in 2007.
A breaking story at the Washington Post reports that hearings to determine whether evidence against the accused was properly collected will be kept under wraps.
At issue are statements the State Department collected from Blackwater immediately after the incident. In exchange for the employees' co-operation, the State Department, then under the control of the Bush administration, granted the Blackwater guards immunity from prosecution over their statements.
The current case being pursued by the Justice Department is being crafted so as to avoid using the immunized statements. But Judge Urbina ordered hearings into whether those statements were used to gather evidence after all. If it turns out they were, the judge will likely throw out the case against the five Blackwater employees, the Post reports.
The Nisoor Square massacre took place on September 17, 2007, when Blackwater guards escorting a State Department convoy through Baghdad opened fire on civilians in Nisoor Square, in what is largely considered an unprovoked act. Evidently the Blackwater guards started firing when a civilian vehicle was spotted driving down the wrong side of the road near the convoy.
The Post reports:
The five guards — Paul Slough, Nicholas Slatten, Evan Liberty, Dustin Heard and Donald Ball — are charged with voluntary manslaughter and weapons violations in the killing of 14 civilians and the wounding [of] 20 others. The Justice Department alleges that the guards unleashed an unprovoked attack on Iraqi civilians in Nisoor Square while in a convoy. One guard, Jeremy P. Ridgeway, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against the others. The proceedings underway in the District's federal court, known as Kastigar hearings, will probe how well investigators gathered evidence without being tainted by those immunized statements. If the judge finds the government's case is tainted, he might be forced to throw out the indictment.
The State Department canceled its Iraq security contract with Blackwater, now known as Xe Services, shortly after President Obama's inauguration. The Post reported at the time that the company had made $1.3 billion from contracts with the State Department.
No hat again.I RARELY upload anything this late past where I usually like to on a Saturday but you can blame Anime Milwaukee for that. Long Story short....that was a fun convention to vend again for the 3rd year.I did get to meet a few pony people there which was cool as always. I had this DBZ AJ available to buy there and while I didn't get anyone buying this one....the others I can tell people are digging these V4s.So yeah this DBZ AJ I really like how this came out. Again I am trying to keep with that theme of keeping all the ponies on these versions to be all standing and that is the challenge.I decided to make that orb thing or whatever you want to call it green cause it matches a lot better. Usually I keep AJ as the more physically muscled guess if you will pony. Buff I guess works because it is shown always she is probably the most gifted physically in the show.Still the BG I think suits this one well I like how bright and poppy this feels.But that's enough to type on this I think. I got one more left on the DBZ ponies before trying something a little different. IDK if I can debut it in time before S6 but we will see. Just sucks I won't be able to get through everything I wanted to do before the season. I planned for May so the only hope is that there are a lot of breaks this season. Applejack © HasbroArt © Me
Story highlights Thrilled supporters cheer Marissa Alexander's release
Alexander was released Wednesday night and is with her family
A court ordered that she can get a new trial
Her case has drawn national attention from civil rights leaders
A Florida woman who was sentenced to 20 years for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband has been released from prison as she awaits a new trial, her attorney said.
Marissa Alexander was released Wednesday night, attorney Bruce Zimet said.
Last month, an appellate court ordered a new trial for Alexander. The case will be retried because the jury had incorrect directions, the court ruled.
Alexander's case gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who say nobody was hurt and the sentence for the mother of three was too harsh.

The case shined the spotlight on Florida's "stand your ground" law after she unsuccessfully argued before her 2012 trial that she was immune to prosecution because of the law.
According to court paperwork filed in Duval County, Florida, Alexander was granted a pretrial release with special conditions and a $150,000 bond.
Alexander will be under electronic monitoring at all times and on home detention until the completion of her case, the documents state.
A campaign supporting Alexander said that she was back home with her family.
"We hope the decision means that the Florida justice system has relented in its vindictive, hostile and racist legal assault on this African-American mother of three," the statement by the Free Marissa Now Mobilization Campaign said.
Thrilled supporters in Jacksonville, Florida, cheered Alexander's release Thursday, but also said they were prepared to keep fighting.
"We do know this is temporary joy. ... This is a victory, but the battle's not over yet. The battle will be won in court," said Anthony Heard of Free Marissa Now. "We're all just happy that she'll be home for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we're going to focus on that right now."

We're all getting excited about the practical effects we've seen from the set of Star Wars Episode 7. Many people complain about the abundance of computer-generated effects in George Lucas' Star Wars prequels, but what they don't realize is more practical miniature models were created for any one of the Star Wars prequel films than were made for the entire combined original trilogy. I thought that bit of Star Wars prequels miniatures trivia might surprise many of you.
While I don't dislike the films as much as most, I'm in no way a prequel apologist — the movies are what they are. That said, there are some things to admire in the prequel trilogy. So take a trip with me back in time to look at some of the amazing handcrafted artistry that went into the most despised trilogy of films in movie history. You will be shocked at what parts and at just how much of it was created practically by the visual effects magicians at Industrial Light and Magic.
Star Wars Prequels Miniatures
Here is a look at some of the practical miniatures created for the Podracing sequence in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Not only did they create the huge podracing arena set but they also build incredibly detailed miniature versions of the podracing vehicles. Notice how the far shots of the podracing crowd were just painted q-tips. One of the shots below even features an actress on a balcony overlooking a small miniature model set.
Here is a look at the incredibly expansive miniature set created for the lava fight sequence on Mustafar. They shot this miniature for five to six months in darkness. The 25 feet wide by 50 feet long miniature set was built on a tilt so that they could pour slime down the lava streams as lights would illuminate from below.
Here is a brief look at a few of the many miniatures used to bring Naboo to life:

Charter schools have become a central feature of the school “choice” movement, itself a key part of corporate school reform, which seeks to operate public schools as if they were businesses rather than civic institutions. There are now thousands of charters — which are publicly funded but independently operated, sometimes by for-profit companies — enrolling a few million students in 43 states and the District of Columbia who make up about 6 percent of public school students across the country.
While they are a small minority of the public school student population, outsized controversy surrounds charter schools in many communities, especially in states where lax oversight has resulted in financial irregularities and traditional public schools are negatively affected. There are so many issues surrounding charter schools that in October 2016, leaders of the NAACP, the oldest civil rights organization in the United States, bucked intense pressure from charter supporters and ratified a resolution calling for a moratorium on the expansion of charters and for stronger oversight of these schools.
[Why charter schools get public education advocates so angry]
Here's a cautionary post about the impact of charter schools in one school district in Pennsylvania, one of a number of states with extremely lax charter school laws. It was written by Carol Burris, a former New York high school principal who is executive director of the nonprofit Network for Public Education. She was named the 2010 Educator of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State, and in 2013, the same organization named her the New York State High School Principal of the Year. She has been chronicling problems with corporate school reform for years, including with a series about troubled charter schools in California.
[How messed up is California's charter school sector? You won't believe how much.]
On Jan. 11, the Senate education confirmation will hold confirmation hearings on Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire selected by President-elect Donald Trump to be the next U.S. education secretary. She is an unabashed supporter of charter schools and has worked in the past against strong oversight of the schools. Senators asking her questions may want to ask her about charter oversight and the dynamic around charters in Pennsylvania and the Bethlehem Area School District, as described by Burris.
By Carol Burris
Bethlehem is a proud city with a tidy historic downtown that appears well-kept and well-intentioned. Income is below the national average, and unemployment is slightly higher, yet it is still in far better shape than neighboring small cities such as Allentown.
The Bethlehem Steel Plant that once kept the economy robust closed down about 20 years ago. Now the small city is a small tech hub with tourism, major medical networks and local universities providing work for its nearly 75,000 residents.
The public schools of the city do a fine job serving their majority minority students, of whom nearly 60 percent receive free or reduced-priced lunch. There are few dropouts, and an outstanding music program keeps kids engaged. Bethlehem's two high schools offer AP courses, and SAT scores are consistently close to or above the national average, with most students taking the test.
It has not been easy supporting the public schools, however, given the financial challenges of the city. In addition, the district suffered a financial crisis in 2008 and then reeled under massive cuts in state aid in the 2011-12 school year. But the worst hit of all has come from the continuing and increasing siphoning of district dollars to charter schools — a whopping $25 million this year alone.
I went on the road to Bethlehem shortly before Christmas to understand the effect of charter schools on Pennsylvania's district public schools. I was told that Bethlehem was a good example of how public schools are victimized by the lax charter school laws of Pennsylvania, whose own auditor general has labeled, “the worst charter school laws in the nation.”
All of the problems associated with charter schools, such as, siphoning of public school funding, increased segregation, scandalous recruiting practices and blatant profiteering can be found in charters in and surrounding America's Christmas City.
The public school fund drain from charters
Pennsylvania requires districts to pay the charter school a per-pupil tuition fee based on how much the district spends on its own students. In Bethlehem's case, its per-pupil charter tuition cost per general education student is $10,635.77 and $22, 886.44 per special education student. In addition, the charter school students receive transportation funding from the taxpayers for attending any charter school located in the district or within 10 miles of any district boundary.
The argument that charter proponents make is that since the school is no longer educating the student, the per-pupil amount it sends to the charter represents real savings for the district. But anyone who understands school finance knows that assumption is ludicrous.
If class size is reduced from 28 to 27, or even to 25, you still must retain the teacher and her salary remains the same. The school does not lose a principal, custodian, cafeteria server or school nurse, even when sizable numbers leave. You can't lower the heat or turn off the lights because some students and their funding have left for charters.
Joseph Roy is the superintendent of the Bethlehem Area School District (BASD). He helped put the district back on its feet after the 2008 fiscal crisis. This year, he was chosen by his peers as Pennsylvania's Superintendent of the Year.
I asked Roy just how much the district loses on charter school tuition and how much it would cost if all of Bethlehem's 1,944 charter school students came back to the district. Roy told me that the district budgeted $26 million (about 10 percent of its annual budget) this year to pay for tuition and associated costs to charter schools. According to Roy, “We estimate that if all of the students in charters returned, even with hiring the additional needed staff, we would save $20 million. This is the cost of school choice.”
Roy talked about all of the things he could do for district kids if only that money came back.
“What we have lost is a lot of the ‘equity actions' that help students who need the most help,” he said. “If we weren't spending so much on charters, we would have more academic and social supports for our students living in poverty. We would have more professional development focused on equity and literacy. We would have social workers. And, importantly, we would not have raised property taxes to the extent we have if not for the charter expenses. The local working-class people of BASD are shouldering the cost of charter schools due to the state's lack of financial support and lack of desire to correct the problems.”
Because the Pennsylvania charter tuition formula is based on per-pupil spending, some districts are hit even worse. The New Hope-Solebury School District, for example, pays nearly $19,000 for every general education district student that elects to go to a charter school and almost $40,000 for every special education student. Those costs must even be paid to cyber charters that have no facilities costs at all.
In the case of special education students, the charter gets the higher rate, no matter how mild the disability, and it does not have to prove that it spent the money on special education services. Profits can become so lucrative that Pennsylvania Cyber Charter founder Nick Trombetta spent $8 million of taxpayer dollars for extravagant homes and an airplane. When Trombetta was arrested, it was not for the exorbitant profits, which were legal, but for tax fraud.
It is hard to understand why every taxpayer in Pennsylvania is not outraged at a legislature that repeatedly rejects sensible calls for reforms. When cash is flush and regulations are thin, those who seek to profit appear, and they ensure reform is thwarted.
Bethlehem Area School District experienced this firsthand.
Unethical student recruiting and private profit
Last August, a promotional flier with the return address of a new charter school, Innovative Arts Academy Charter School, appeared in mailboxes of Bethlehem district residents. The flier, which had a picture of a forlorn student with his head in his hands, along with information regarding a local high school drug arrest said, “Why worry about this type of student at school? Come visit Arts Academy Charter School. Now enrolling grades 6-12.”
Bethlehem residents were outraged. The new charter school's CEO, Lorraine Petrillo, immediately denied any involvement in the flier.
By the end of the month, Petrillo had resigned. Not only was she disturbed by the flier, which many inaccurately assumed was sent by her, Petrillo's Social Security number had been used by the charter school in an attempt to obtain a fraudulent loan. When the charter board then accepted a $100,000 loan from the school's landlord, she had had enough. In an email obtained by the press, Petrillo had the following to say:
“For the life of me, I don't understand why the board is still seeking the landlord or associated company's involvement in our financing after this past weekend. It might be ‘legal' but certainly, in my humble opinion, unethical.”
The landlord to whom she referred was real estate developer Abe Atiyeh. In 2007, Atiyeh had purchased the property in which her school would reside for $900,000. The month he bought it, he sold it for one dollar to Catty Schools LLC, a privately held company that lists him as its principal. The first attempt to house a charter school in the building failed when the Thomas Paine Charter School could not get approval.
The Lehigh Valley Christian High School moved in instead, paying Atiyeh's LLC $94,195 in rent in 2008. The next year, the rent jumped to $364,636. By 2013 when the private school left the building (because the building had no “curb appeal”), it had paid $1,736,691, total, in rent.
Prior to its departure, Lehigh Valley Christian was sharing Atiyeh's building with the Medical Academy Charter School, which was founded by Atiyeh's friend, Craig Haytmanek, in 2012. In 2013, Medical Academy also paid rent costing $295,088. The next year, it paid $404,717 to Linden Land Development LLC, another corporation at the Atiyeh address. It is unknown what the charter paid for rent in 2015 or in 2016, its final year of operation.
The Medical Academy Charter School was beset by serious problems from the start. Its curriculum came under question. Videos of student violence in the school started appearing on social media, and enrollment was stagnant. In 2015 and 2016, it had the lowest ratings in the Lehigh Valley. When it closed its doors in June 2016, still owing its teachers money, it had earned only 29.8 out of 100 points on the state report card.
In its place, however, would be yet another charter school, the Innovative Arts Academy Charter School, the school with the anonymous flier to which Atiyeh loaned $100,000. Members of the board of the failed charter, including Haytmanek, were members of the applicant board[1]. Atiyeh, of course, receives the new charter's rent as well[2].
On the road away from Bethlehem, I stopped by the Innovative Arts Academy. I saw a teacher and two students hanging out on steps facing a large parking lot. The school banner was torn. A dumpster was placed in front of it. The teacher told me that school enrollment was now below 300. He said that he and the students were filming, what I don't know. This year, well over $2 million from neighboring districts in the financially strained Lehigh Valley will go to the charter school.
The Senate Education Committee plans to hold its confirmation hearing this week on Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for U.S. secretary of education. DeVos believes that the marketplace of charters and choice is better than the stability of the public schools of Bethlehem. If poor parents buy the hype of anonymous fliers, then buyer beware. In the world of DeVos, the cream rises to the top, and the strongest will survive.
That is the founding principle of “school choice.” But what I learned in Bethlehem is both simple and clear. Pennsylvania's politicians, like those in so many states, have neither the stomach nor the will to curb the abuses of charter schools as they drain the public school coffers. America must choose either a patchwork of online schools and charters with profiteers on the prowl, or a transparent community public school system run by citizens elected by their neighbors. A dual school system with the private taking funding from the public, simply cannot survive.
Notes:
[1] Both resigned after public outcry.
[2] Atiyeh leases additional properties to charter schools that he helped start, also under controversial circumstances. Instances include a side deal with the Allentown School Board and using paid consultants to recruit charter school students.
Optical fibres made from thin air could transmit data to and from hard-to-reach places.
Regular optical fibres are made from two transparent materials that slow light down by different amounts. The difference in materials lets light reflect along the length of the cable without leaking out – perfect for sending a signal over long distances.
But it's hard to put fibres in some places, like the upper atmosphere or inside nuclear reactors. And signals sent through open air often degrade because the light spreads out.
Now, Howard Milchberg of the University of Maryland, College Park, and his colleagues have come up with a way to mimic a fibre in the air itself.

Sending lasers with lasers
The team shone four lasers in a square arrangement, heating air molecules and creating a low-density ring around a denser core of air. Light bounces around the dense core just like in a fibre.
The air fibre lasts for a few milliseconds – more than enough to send a signal. “This is an extremely long time from the vantage point of a laser,” says Milchberg. The results are published in the journal Optica.
So far the team has tested air fibres over a range of 1 metre. These delivered a signal 50 per cent stronger than through air alone over the same distance. Sending signals further gives light more chance to spread, so in theory, a 100-metre air-fibre could deliver a signal 1000 times stronger than sending it through air alone.
The team also transmitted a laser with 100 times more energy than those used to make the fibre. And they were able to receive signals: small flashes of light from the other end were detected. This suggests the fibre could be used for remote sensing, which could include detecting explosives at a distance.
Wayne Milera has been ruled out of Adelaide's clash with Hawthorn because of a quad complaint.
Milera experienced quad soreness late in the Club's win over the Sydney Swans on Saturday night.
GM of High Performance Brett Burton said the promising first-year Crow, who has played the opening four games of his debut AFL season, required further assessment on the injury.
“Wayne, unfortunately, hurt his quad in the last quarter and he'll be unavailable to play this week,” Burton said.
“We're still gathering information on that and we'll have an update in the next 24 - 48 hours.”
Ruckman Sam Jacobs has been cleared of any serious damage after an injury scare in the third quarter.
“You would've seen big ‘Sauce' Jacobs come off with a knee injury,” Burton said.
“He was assessed and it was just a knock on the knee, so he went back out and was able to finish the game.
“He'll be available to play this week.”
Brad Crouch is nearing a return after a fortnight out with a hamstring issue.
Burton said the young midfielder could be available for selection as early as this week.
“Brad's been going along really well over the last week or two,” he said.
“He's been building up his training loads from that slight hamstring strain. We'll assess him later in the week to see whether he'll be available for selection.”
The news isn't as good for Curtly Hampton, who suffered a setback in his recovery from a foot injury.
Hampton has had surgery to repair plantar fascia tissue in his left foot and will be sidelined for up to another two months.
“Curtly's had that foot issue for a while now,” Burton said.
“We made the decision to be aggressive with that and he had surgery on Friday just to release the plantar fascia.
“That surgery has quite a good success rate, so we expect Curtly to be available again in 6 – 8 weeks.”
Rookie-listed duo Paul Hunter (ankle) and Alex Keath, who had a limited football pre-season because of cricket commitments, will also be available for selection for the first time this SANFL season.
Adelaide's SANFL team takes on Glenelg at Gliderol Stadium on Sunday, April 24. Entry is free for ticketed Crows members.
Injury list as of Monday, April 18
Paul Hunter (ankle) – Available
Brad Crouch (hamstring) – Test
Wayne Milera (quad) – TBC
Curtly Hampton (foot) – 6-8 weeks
Omarosa Manigualt Newman has resigned from the Trump administration, according to the White House.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the news in a statement to reporters.
“We wish her the best in future endeavors and are grateful for her service,” Sanders said.
Omarosa, an assistant to President Donald Trump and the Director of OPL Communications was an early Trump loyalist, having ties to the president that stretch back to the early days of the Apprentice. But she clashed at times with the Washington political establishment in the White House.
She also famously clashed with White House reporter April Ryan, who suggested that there were fireworks over her departure.
“I heard there was drama and she was escorted out of the building and off campus,” Ryan said on Twitter after the news was announced.
Omarosa married Florida pastor John Allen Newman in April during her tenure at the White House.
According to the White House, Omarosa's departure will not be effective until January 20, 2018

A bright and spacious flat within a stone's throw of central London might be a pipe dream for many London renters, but it may soon become a reality for the city's growing homeless population - thanks to an ingenious new invention from an architect from Dagenham.
Twenty-six-year-old James Furzer has designed a series of off-the-ground sleeping pods, intended to create a safe refuge for rough sleepers - of which there are more than 750 on any given night in London alone.
The project, titled 'Homes for the Homeless', recently won the top prize in the Space for new Visions competition organised by Farko, and has been praised for its imaginative design.
The static pods - which come complete with a mattress, storage space and a makeshift living area - are built to be attached at above head height to the side of an existing building, and provide daytime refuge from bad weather and other dangers of life on the streets.

The spacious structures are made from plywood, do not require running electricity and can be accessed by a ladder which would hang from the door of the light and airy sleeping spaces. The average person would be expected to stay for 4-8 hours, enough for an uninterrupted sleep.
Furzer, an architectural technician, has said that he knows his design will not eradicate the capital's homeless problem but believes it's a step in the right direction.
He came up with the idea after seeing the growing number of metal spikes which have been placed in popular sleeping spots to deter the homeless from setting themselves up there for the night.
The 'anti-homeless spikes' have been a point of contention in many London boroughs, and earlier this week, artists in East London took similar measures, installing a mattress over a set of the steel prongs in a central Shoreditch location.

3 facts show that the government “fixed the facts” regarding 9/11 around a policy decision to exonerate the government from any blame whatsoever.
1. 9/11 Commission's Chief Counsel says Official Story “Almost Entirely Untrue . . . There Was an Agreement Not to Tell the Truth about What Happened”
As Daily Kos notes in a recent recommended story, the senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission – John Farmer – states in a new book that the official story of 9/11 “almost entirely untrue“.
As I noted last month, he also says:
At some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened.
and
I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The [Norad air defense] tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years…. This is not spin. This is not true.
If you think that Farmer has gone nuts, you should see what his colleagues on the 9/11 Commission say.
2. The Government Used Communist-Style “Minders” to Intimidate Witnesses
The government used “minders” to intimidate witnesses to the 9/11 Commission. In fact, according to an internal memo:
Minders “answer[ed] questions directed at witnesses;”
Minders acted as “monitors, reporting to their respective agencies on Commission staffs lines of inquiry and witnesses' verbatim responses.” The staff thought this “conveys to witnesses that their superiors will review their statements and may engage in retribution;” and
Minders “positioned themselves physically and have conducted themselves in a manner that we believe intimidates witnesses from giving full and candid responses to our questions.”
3. The Main Sources of Information Were Not Even Remotely Credible
The fact that people were tortured in order to justify the Iraq war by making a false linkage between Iraq and 9/11 is gaining attention.
Many people are starting to understand that top Bush administration officials not only knowingly lied about a non-existent connection between Al Qaida and Iraq, but they pushed and insisted that interrogators use special torture methods aimed at extracting false confessions to attempt to create such a false linkage.
Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee found that the U.S. used torture techniques specifically aimed at extracting false confessions (and see this).
And as Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times:
Let's say this slowly: the Bush administration wanted to use 9/11 as a pretext to invade Iraq, even though Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. So it tortured people to make them confess to the nonexistent link.
But many people still assume that the basics of the 9/11 Commission Report must be accurate, and based on reliable evidence. However, that is incorrect.
For example, according to NBC news:
Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured
At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being “tortured.”
One of the Commission's main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ
The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves
In fact, the self-confessed “mastermind” of 9/11 also confessed to crimes which he could not have committed. He later said that he gave the interrogators a lot of false information – telling them what he thought they wanted to hear – in an attempt to stop the torture. We also know that he was heavily tortured specifically for the purpose of trying to obtain false information about 9/11 – specifically, that Iraq had something to do with it.
(By the way, the supposed corroborating witness who “independently” fingered the “mastermind” was clinically crazy, so his testimony would be thrown out in any real trial).
Remember, as discussed above, the torture techniques used by the Bush administration to try to link Iraq and 9/11 were specifically geared towards creating false confessions (they were techniques created by the communists to be used in show trials).
So why do people believe the torture confessions regarding 9/11 itself?
The above-linked NBC news report quotes a couple of legal experts to this effect:
Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, says he is “shocked” that the Commission never asked about extreme interrogation measures.
“If you're sitting at the 9/11 Commission, with all the high-powered lawyers on the Commission and on the staff, first you ask what happened rather than guess,” said Ratner, whose center represents detainees at Guantanamo. “Most people look at the 9/11 Commission Report as a trusted historical document. If their conclusions were supported by information gained from torture, therefore their conclusions are suspect.“…
Karen Greenberg, director of the Center for Law and Security at New York University's School of Law, put it this way: “[I]t should have relied on sources not tainted. It calls into question how we were willing to use these interrogations to construct the narrative.”
The interrogations were “used” to “construct the narrative” which the 9/11 Commission decided to use.
Remember (as explored in the book The Commission by respected journalist Philip Shenon), that the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission was an administration insider whose area of expertise is the creation and maintenance of “public myths” thought to be true, even if not actually true. He wrote an outline of what he wanted the report to say very early in the process, controlled what the Commission did and did not analyze, then limited the scope of the Commission's inquiry so that the overwhelming majority of questions about 9/11 remained unasked (see this article and this article).
Just as the “facts” about Saddam's WMDs were “fixed around” the policy of launching a war in Iraq, the use of specialized torture techniques geared towards extracting false confessions appear to have been “used” to “construct the narrative” which Zelikow and other administration insiders had decided to use.
As constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley stated:
[The 9/11 Commission] was a commission that was really made for Washington – a commission composed of political appointees of both parties that ran interference for those parties – a commission that insisted at the beginning it would not impose blame on individuals.
Am I saying that 9/11 was an inside job? No, this essay is not addressing that issue one way or the other.
For the sake of clarity, however, it should be noted that there are 4 possibilities:
(1) 9/11 was carried out entirely by Muslim extremists (2) 9/11 was carried out by Muslim extremists, but elements within the United States government and/or defense industry aided them either actively or by passively failing to stop them (3) 9/11 was carried out by Muslim extremists, but they were aided by the secular Iraqi government(4) 9/11 was not carried out by Muslim extremists or
We already know that the Bush administration tried to falsely create evidence for the third option. Whether or not they also tried to falsely create evidence in favor of the first option and contradicting the second (or fourth) option is an important question, one which lies beyond the scope of this essay.

Four hundred years ago this year, two events marked what scientists and historians today regard as the birth of modern astronomy. The first of them, the beginning of Galileo's telescopic observations, has been immortalized by playwrights and authors and widely publicized as the cornerstone anniversary for the International Year of Astronomy. Through his looking glass, the Italian astronomer saw the mountains and valleys of the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, and sunspots—observations that would play a huge role in discrediting the prevailing, church-endorsed view of an Earth-centered cosmos.
The second event is not as well known, but is arguably equally important. It was the publication of Johannes Kepler's Astronomia Nova (The New Astronomy) in 1609, a treatise in which the German astronomer introduced the first two of his laws describing planetary motion.
The first law states that the planets travel in elliptical orbits around the sun and describes the sun's position as the focal point in that ellipse. The second law states that an imaginary line connecting a planet to the sun will sweep out a region of equal size in a given time period, wherever in the orbit that time period falls.
Kepler would later go on to introduce yet another law, this one relating the dimensions of an orbit to the time it takes to complete that orbit. He also made fundamental contributions to optics, working out how images are formed by pinhole cameras, a telescope and the human eye as well as developed the principles for corrective lenses for near- and farsightedness. He coined the terms "orbit" and "satellite" and explained how ocean tides are caused by the moon.
"He was an astronomer's astronomer," says Owen Gingerich, a professor emeritus of astronomy and science history at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
Kepler was born in the town of Weil der Stadt in modern-day Baden–Württemberg, Germany, in 1571. His parents were not very well off: His father was a mercenary and his mother a housewife who would later be accused of witchery. Kepler was introspective and sickly as a child but he excelled in mathematics. He decided to join the clergy and won a scholarship to the University of Tübingen, where he was first acquainted with the work of Polish astronomer Nicholaus Copernicus.
In 1609 the accepted view was that Earth was stationary at the center of the universe and the moon, sun and planets moved around it. The stars lay beyond, encircling Earth in a sphere. This view of the heavens had originated with the Greeks, and it was formalized as an astronomical system by Claudius Ptolemy in the second century A.D. Ptolemaic astronomy was not simple—to model the motion of the planets, it made use of a complicated system of circles and epicycles—but it had been accepted as truth for almost a millennium and a half.
In the middle of the 16th century Copernicus had put forward an alternate, heliocentric system in which the sun was the center of the universe, with Earth and the other planets encircling it. Copernicus's treatise on heliocentrism, De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres), was published in 1543. Kepler discovered it as a student in Tübingen and was much taken by Copernicus's views.
But most people were not similarly enamored with the concept of a heliocentric universe. First of all, Copernicus's ideas were not widely disseminated, as they ran counter to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church (although 73 years would pass before De Revolutionibus was listed as a forbidden work by the Church). It was only in universities and their surroundings that they found a following. Secondly, even for those who heard of it, Copernicus's heliocentric astronomy was by some measures hardly more accurate than Ptolemaic astronomy.
The Great Martian Catastrophe
As Gingerich explains, the Ptolemaic system predicted positions of Mars approximately every 32 years that were in error by about 5 degrees in longitude for a short time. Copernicus's system wasn't much better: it was off by about 4 degrees longitudinally. Gingerich calls this "the great Martian catastrophe"—a problem that observers such as Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe knew about, but that Kepler would solve.
After Tübingen Kepler worked as a mathematics teacher in Graz (in modern-day Austria), where he continued his interest in astronomy. It was in Graz that he wrote the Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery), published in 1596, in support of Copernicus. He sent copies of his book to leading astronomers, including Brahe—the greatest observational astronomer of the day. Brahe and Kepler started a correspondence in which they talked about Copernicanism and other astronomical issues. By then, Kepler had realized the need for raw data—observations that would help him understand the underlying laws of nature.
In 1600, as a consequence of the religious and political unrest during the Protestant Reformation, Kepler lost his job at Graz. He made his way to Prague, where Brahe was the court astronomer to Emperor Rudolph II. Prague was where Kepler would spend some of his most productive years. Brahe died suddenly in 1601, and Kepler succeeded him as court astronomer. In addition to his royal duties, Kepler tried to resolve the motion of Mars. He found that his initial model, which assumed that Mars revolved around the sun in a circular orbit, failed to match his predecessor's observations. He reluctantly altered the orbit and made it more egg-shaped.
"There is a myth that Kepler, fitting a curve through Tycho Brahe's records of Mars, discovered that planetary orbits are elliptical," Gingerich says. "The fact is that Tycho's observations showed that the orbit was not a circle, but the choice of an ellipse was largely theoretical."
It was one of those intellectual leaps that would change the course of science. Kepler found that not only did an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus explain the movement of Mars, but also of the other planets. In fact, as Gingerich points out, Kepler realized the momentous nature of his discovery. In the Astronomia Nova, the typeface suddenly becomes larger to account for the significance as Kepler explains the motion of Mars and puts forward his first two planetary laws. (The third would come later.)
But the underlying physical reason for the planetary motion eluded Kepler, who thought a sort of magnetism was responsible. That puzzle would have to wait for another revolutionary thinker, Isaac Newton, whose law of gravity appeared on the scientific stage and explained orbital behavior eight decades later.
Final Fantasy XV is not the only New Year's Resolution that Square Enix has in front of it for 2016. It has another massive project in the works which is sure to be picked apart and speculated upon by fans around the globe: the Final Fantasy VII Remake.
However, those looking to play the game in 2016 will have to wait a bit longer. Producer Yoshinori Kitase has stated in the latest issue of Famitsu that the game has “a year of preparations” ahead of it.
“I believe that this year will still be a year of preparations for Final Fantasy VII Remake. I'd like to create a new kind of value for the hardware that is the PlayStation 4 for our next announcement.”
So, no. Not even the towering powers of the PlayStation 4 are efficient enough to handle such an extreme project. Square Enix needs to push and advance it further over the next year in order to get development anywhere.
Also in the segment, Final Fantasy boss Shinji Hashimoto claimed that he wants to do more big surprises for fans over the coming year. The reveal of Final Fantasy VII Remake is already one of the biggest surprises of all time, so we'll have to wait an see what the company can do to live up to expectations.
I mean, what's comparable to a Final Fantasy VII Remake? I don't think there can be any other surprises ever again, unless Square Enix decides to tackle Final Fantasy VI in the same fashion as well.
Final Fantasy VII Remake will be “released first” on PlayStation 4.
Sen. Ed Markey of Massachussetts and Sen. Dick Blumenthal of Connecticut recently posed a handful of questions to the nation's cable and satellite providers about their set-top boxes — Are they required? How many customers have them? Is there an option for customers to purchase their own? etc. While some providers were more transparent in their responses than others, there was one thing they all agreed on: We're not telling you how much we make from leasing these devices.
For example, even though Comcast [PDF] says that virtually all 22 million pay-TV customers have set-top boxes, with a total of 59 million devices currently being used, and that the monthly lease per box ranges from $1-$2.50/month, it balks — citing “competitive sensitivity” — at providing the senators either the average per-customer revenue from these leases or the total revenue.
AT&T, which filed the response [PDF] before its merger with DirecTV was approved, likewise acknowledged that its entire U-Verse install base has a set-top box. While the company says the first device is provided at no charge, AT&T didn't provide any information about the average number of devices per household or the total number of devices currently in use, so we don't know how many U-Verse subscribers are paying $8/month for their additional set-top boxes. AT&T claimed it can't share any more detailed information because it's “commercially sensitive.”
Speaking of DirecTV, the country's largest satellite service (and second-largest pay-TV provider) provides so little information it's bordering on the deceptive. The only useful data in DirecTV's response [PDF] is that customers lease “roughly 2.5 boxes per household” and that it charges $6/box, but it glosses over the all the related fees it charges for things like Whole-Home DVR service.
Verizon [PDF] is much more willing to break down the pricing of its boxes, DVR services, and number of TV sets involved, showing how FiOS can run you anywhere from $11.99/month for a single TV up to $85.99 for eight TVs with “Quantum Premium Service.” But once again, in spite of this info dump on Verizon's part, the company joins the chorus of cablers refusing to say the average per-customer revenue or total annual revenue from leased devices.
The most amusing response comes from Time Warner Cable [PDF], who justified its refusal to answer virtually every question by stating that “TWC operates in a highly competitive market and does not make this information publicly available in the ordinary course of business.” [bolded for emphasis].
That's right, Time Warner Cable, whose $45 million merger with Comcast failed because of an obvious lack of competition in the cable marketplace, is apparently hoping that if it repeatedly states that it “operates in a highly competitive market,” it might come true.
After looking at these responses — and others from Cox, Cablevision, Charter, Brighthouse, Cox, and Dish — Sens. Markey and Blumenthal did their best to estimate how much these companies are making based on what little information they provided.
By their math, the average pay-TV customer will spend around $89/year for a single set-top box. And since the average household with pay-TV service has approximately 2.6 boxes, the senators estimate the average yearly cost of having these cable boxes is around $232.
Figuring that, between all these companies there are some 221 million set-top boxes being leased in the U.S. right now, that would put the industry's annual revenue at nearly $20 billion.
While the senators understand the technological need for having a set-top box, they believe that consumers should not be forced to lease just one or two models made available by their pay-TV provider.
“Consumers should have the same range of choices for their video set-top boxes as they have for their mobile phones,” said Senator Markey in a statement. “When Congress last year regrettably removed the requirement that cable company services be compatible with set-top boxes purchased in the marketplace rather than rented directly from the provider, we doomed consumers to being captive to cable company rental fees forever. We also endangered a competitive set-top box marketplace, replacing consumer choice with cable company control. We need a new, national consumer-friendly standard that will allow consumers to choose their own video box irrespective from their pay-TV provider. Consumers should not be forced to rent video boxes from their pay-TV provider in perpetuity.”
Blumenthal says the $200+ annual expense on set-top box leasing is “unjust and unjustifiable. As the world becomes increasingly connected and technology advances, new innovations must be able to break into the cable marketplace and provide the vigorous competition that drives down prices for consumers. Consumers deserve competitive options in accessing technology and television – not exorbitant prices dictated by monopoly cable companies.”
If we have anything to show for past hundred years of world wars, space exploration, arms races, globalization and technological innovation, it's that humankind has never had better resources to identify the potential causes of its own downfall. As we become more aware of the problems we create for ourselves, fiction expressing our fears about those increasingly urgent issues has also become increasingly popular. Consider the glut of dystopian action movies that have overloaded theaters this summer, including Oblivion, After Earth, Pacific Rim and most recently, Elysium, the sophomore film from filmmaker and noted dystopian visionary Neil Blomkamp.
For fans of the subgenre, this proliferation is an awfully exciting thing at first glance, though it leaves us with some questions: When does such a glut constitute too much of a good–or in this case, bad–thing? Are sinister visions of the future less meaningful when there are so many of them, and when they fail to discuss the possible solutions–or, in Elysium's case, present inadequate ones? Do dystopian auteurs operating in this day and age have moral responsibilities when presenting their visions? What, if any, good does dystopian entertainment actually do?
"In some ways you might say that [utopia and dystopia] are older than science fiction itself," says UCLA English professor Ursula K. Heise, who studies utopian and dystopian literature–or as she calls it, "speculative fiction"–especially as it applies to environmental, digital, and global issues. She notes that while most science fiction only dates back a few hundred years, we can trace utopia as far back as Plato's vision of Atlantis.
"Thomas More's 1516 book Utopia envisions a perfect society not in the future, but right now, in some unknown part of the earth's geography," said Heise. "It was writing on the border of literature and political [discourse], identifying the perfect world in order to point out what was wrong with the world they already had."
The problem with utopia, however, is that it's often very boring; after all, once you achieve the ideal society, it's hard to imagine any substantive change that might upset the delicate balance of its perfection. What's more, says Heise, perfection is less useful because it's unrealistic. The ideal society was far easier to envision when we didn't know how many opinions there were to consider. Over time, "utopia has become more difficult to write and more implausible. In order for us to imagine an ideal society, we'd all have to agree on what that ideal society is. We've become a lot more conscious of the fact that across the globe, especially in regards to gender, race and religion, we don't share one ideal." That's part of why dystopian media has essentially won out over utopia during the last century: It's much more narratively interesting and effective–even in supposedly "perfect" societies like those in Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World *and Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale–to deal with problems by turning into massive allegories than doing away with them altogether.
So finally we come to the 2013 cinematic dystopia glut, where we saw Elysium take issues like immigration, access to healthcare, worker's rights, and socioeconomic stratification to their futuristic, yet logical extremes. Heise notes that those extremes – the idea that the rich really could build a habitat on a space station, keeping out the poor by disenfranchising and murdering them – aren't really supposed to be taken literally, as "apocalyptic writing is not supposed to be a forecast; it's the intensity of the apocalyptic view of the future that's the point: The darker it is, the more urgently the author calls you to reform."
Of course, actual reform is quite difficult to obtain; despite dystopia's popularity in modern fiction, Heise says its actual effect on society is less consequential, beyond a general understanding of contemporary fears.
"With narrative films, there are two things to consider: How does it change the public debate, in policy and government, and how does it change the average moviegoer's individual perspective? The general wisdom and empirical work on that says that [dystopian film] does raise awareness of issues, but only for a short time. Right after people have seen these movies, they're more willing to confront the problems shown in the movie, voting for politicians who promise to fight those issues, but ask them two or three months down the line, and the effect has usually worn off." (To put it in perspective, she cites *Avatar *as an example of a movie that resonated among human rights activists, environmentalists, and indigenous populations themselves – but doesn't exactly drive climate change debate, or the election of Green Party candidates, in 2013.)
To make matters worse, Blomkamp's call for reform in Elysium involves an attempt to solve the complex problems he's forecasted in an extremely simplistic and nigh-magical way–a move that goes horribly awry and ultimately misdirects the viewer's attention *away *from the real issues at hand. Fiction and artistic license aside, Heise says in creating dystopias, the writer shoulders an implicit obligation to help people prevent the ills they perceive from worsening. In this case, that responsibility went into overdrive and combusted.
"[Elysium] sets up an interesting problem, but answers it with total clichés," Heise says. "You're pointing to a big structural, socioeconomic problem, and it's going to be solved by two white guys in cyborg armor beating each other up? You've gotta be kidding ... Healthcare [and immigration were] distractions, too: The idea is raised that once everyone is a citizen and ambulances go heal everybody, the problem is solved. The problem clearly wasn't that people were sick; healthcare's inaccessibility was a symptom of a radically inequitable economic system. These are treating the symptoms, not curing the disease."
In other words, while dystopian literature may not always change the world, it can have its uses. But the genre stops working altogether when its authors start trying to fix catastrophic, chillingly realistic problems with magical, utopian solutions. It's more likely to stick in moviegoers heads when they're left to debate the solutions on their own, as with the bleak cliffhanger ending of Blompkamp's previous film, District 9.
"Excluding disaster movies, there is an imperative in the dystopian genre, [an implied] call to action, to think about the problems before they become problems," she says. "[But] the problem with solving the problem [in the story] is that there will always be new problems coming out of your solutions," she says. "Elysium as a whole goes from complicated social, political and moral issues and simplifies them to black and white. I distress when movies and novels do this, because it's not as helpful as dystopias can be."
Participants from all over the planet will attend the World Conservation Congress to be held in Honolulu September 1 through 10 … and with the influx of world leaders, prominent CEOs and well-known environmentalists comes more security.
According to KHON News, a resolution put forth by the city council will enable authorities to make use of Honolulu's traffic cameras to monitor any suspicious activity during the event.
HPD officials said police have already begun installing new security cameras throughout downtown and Waikiki for the event … Cameras that according to the council's resolution could be used after the event for traffic monitoring.
In addition to using the cameras for security, a portion of the Ala Wai canal will be closed at certain times during the conference.
Event officials said the conference will attract more than 15,000 participants.
Pit of SnakesThe Projector spins the tape from reel to reel.
The smiles on their faces betray how they feel.
The lights dim low so were left in obscurity
And thats when I all because clear to me -
Like cartoon monsters, I can still see their eyes
And maybe the truth is that maybe I do this
To try and expose all of their lies.
Its like jumping into a pit of snakes, and I
Do it just so I can say I survived
With a win in my hand, then I do it again.
Its a wonder why Im still alive.
The actors make their way onto the screen
And herein starts the first real scene.
No, not it the movie, thats just a metaphor
For the drama that some people live for.
No, theyre watching my back for just the right time
For a knife in my shoulders, watch me slumping over -
The only blood spilled here will be mine.
And so I dive into the snake pit again and again,
Hoping to find something like a lover or a friend,
But coming up bruised and bloody time after time
And yet again and agai
* Obama says former governor shows values are not partisan
* Crist calls Obama “a leader with a cool head”
* Romney campaign says Obama making false attacks in Florida
By Jeff Mason
SEMINOLE, Florida, Sept 8 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama kicked off a two-day bus tour of the key election battleground state of Florida on Saturday with former Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who endorsed Obama's 2008 rival John McCain but has since left the Republican Party.
Trying to build on the momentum of this week's Democratic National Convention and overcome another tough jobs report, Obama is spending the weekend canvassing a state that he and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, both want to win in order to achieve victory in the Nov. 6 U.S. election.
The Democratic incumbent hopes Crist, a once popular Republican governor, will help Obama appeal to political independents, who are likely to determine the victor in the state.
“We have a leader with a cool head, and his name is President Barack Obama,” Crist told the crowd of some 11,000 at an outdoor rally.
“He is working hard for the middle class. He is working hard for Florida,” Crist said.
Crist campaigned for Republican presidential nominee McCain in 2008 but left the Republican Party in 2010 when polling suggested he would lose the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to Marco Rubio, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement. Crist ran as an independent and Rubio won in a three-way race.
Crist embraced Obama - literally - as the president campaigned for his economic stimulus bill in 2009, giving him a big hug that was videotaped and replayed endlessly. It reinforced Republican suspicions that Crist was not a true conservative.
Obama, with sleeves rolled up and no tie, embraced Crist again on Saturday after his remarks.
“I want to thank Charlie Crist for his introduction, for his support, for showing that the values that we're fighting for are not Democratic values or Republican values, they are American values,” Obama said.
‘ROMNEY DON'T CARE'
Obama has traveled to Florida 10 times so far this year, according to his campaign. Obama used his stop on Saturday to criticize Romney and his running mate, congressman Paul Ryan, for their opposition to his 2010 healthcare law and proposals to reform Medicare, the popular government health insurance program for the elderly.
“By the way, Florida, you should know I will never turn Medicare into a voucher system,” he said. “No American should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies.”
Ryan proposed a plan two years ago that would transform Medicare into a program in which recipients would use vouchers to buy private insurance.
Romney has also pledged to repeal the healthcare law often called “Obamacare.” Obama told the crowd the former Massachusetts governor's plan should be called “Romney don't care” and joked that Republicans believed tax cuts were so important they could help a person's love life.
Romney's campaign kept up the heat on the president over his economic record. Government data on Friday showed that U.S. employers added a lower-than-expected 96,000 jobs in August.
“After a disastrous convention week and a widely panned speech that was short on specifics, President Obama delivered more empty promises and false attacks today in Florida,” said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams.
“As yesterday's dismal jobs report showed - and as President Obama admitted - job creation in America isn't good enough, yet he didn't lay out any new ideas for getting our economy back on track.”
Brian Olinger, 40, who attended the president's rally, said Crist could help Obama in Florida. “Even though I was a Democrat, he did some good things for teachers and other people when he was governor,” he said.
How the brain ages is still largely an open question -- in part because this organ is mostly insulated from direct contact with other systems in the body, including the blood and immune systems. In research that was recently published in Science, Weizmann Institute researchers Prof. Michal Schwartz of the Neurobiology Department and Dr. Ido Amit of Immunology Department found evidence of a unique "signature" that may be the "missing link" between cognitive decline and aging. The scientists believe that this discovery may lead, in the future, to treatments that can slow or reverse cognitive decline in older people.
Until a decade ago, scientific dogma held that the blood-brain barrier prevents the blood-borne immune cells from attacking and destroying brain tissue. Yet in a long series of studies, Schwartz's group had shown that the immune system actually plays an important role both in healing the brain after injury and in maintaining the brain's normal functioning. They have found that this brain-immune interaction occurs across a barrier that is actually a unique interface within the brain's territory.
This interface, known as the choroid plexus, is found in each of the brain's four ventricles, and it separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid. Schwartz: "The choroid plexus acts as a 'remote control' for the immune system to affect brain activity. Biochemical 'danger' signals released from the brain are sensed through this interface; in turn, blood-borne immune cells assist by communicating with the choroid plexus.This cross-talk is important for preserving cognitive abilities and promoting the generation of new brain cells."
This finding led Schwartz and her group to suggest that cognitive decline over the years may be connected not only to one's "chronological age" but also to one's "immunological age," that is, changes in immune function over time might contribute to changes in brain function -- not necessarily in step with the count of one's years.
To test this theory, Schwartz and research students Kuti Baruch and Aleksandra Deczkowska teamed up with Amit and his research group in the Immunology Department. The researchers used next-generation sequencing technology to map changes in gene expression in 11 different organs, including the choroid plexus, in both young and aged mice, to identify and compare pathways involved in the aging process.
That is how they identified a strikingly unique "signature of aging" that exists solely in the choroid plexus -- not in the other organs. They discovered that one of the main elements of this signature was interferon beta -- a protein that the body normally produces to fight viral infection. This protein appears to have a negative effect on the brain: When the researchers injected an antibody that blocks interferon beta activity into the cerebrospinal fluid of the older mice, their cognitive abilities were restored, as was their ability to form new brain cells. The scientists were also able to identify this unique signature in elderly human brains. The scientists hope that this finding may, in the future, help prevent or reverse cognitive decline in old age, by finding ways to rejuvenate the "immunological age" of the brain.
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — A shooting in front of the campus for two San Francisco schools in the Excelsior District Tuesday afternoon left four teen students injured with one in critical condition, according to police.
Police said they responded to a report of shots fired at Brazil and La Grande avenues at around 3:17 p.m. and initially confirmed one victim in the shooting.
The shooting occurred in front of 325 La Grande Avenue, which is the campus for both the June Jordan School for Equity and City Arts and Tech High School.
A San Francisco Unified School District spokesperson said shots were fired outside the school right around dismissal time.
SFPD later confirmed that three people were shot in the school parking lot. The three victims then ran inside the school.
One victim, a female, is in critical condition with life-threatening injuries. Two male victims suffered non life-threatening injuries. All victims are juveniles who attended June Jordan.
SFPD believes at least one of the victims was targeted and that the others injured were bystanders.
Shortly before 6 p.m., police reported that an additional student had arrived at the Bayview police station with injuries from the shooting, bringing the total number hurt to four. Authorities said that student was transported to SF General Hospital. Police did not know the condition of that student.
A mother who was at the school to pick up her child from school said that she heard six shots.
SFPD at first thought it was an active shooter scene because they found the victims inside the school. They did a room-by-room search and determined there was no active shooter.
Police searched the area for a suspect and told residents and businesses in the area to stay inside.
Four male suspects were last seen running west on Brazil away from the June Jordan campus. The suspects are currently still at large. They were described as wearing dark pants and hooded sweatshirts.
At about 4 p.m., SFPD declared the school safe and lifted the lockout, according to the school district.
An SFUSD spokesperson said school will be open Wednesday with grief counselors on hand.

A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday, as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the ISIS group's Raqa stronghold.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels."The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses," the monitoring group said.It said most of the dead in the explosion in rebel-held Rashidin, west of Aleppo, were evacuees, but the blast also killed several rebels who had been guarding the buses.Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal.The evacuation process resumed following the blast, the Observatory said.AFP's reporter at the scene saw several bodies, body parts and blood scattered on the ground.The wounded including several children received treatment at a hospital in the government-held part of Aleppo.The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo, the coastal province of Latakia, or Damascus.The rebel group Ahrar al-Sham condemned the bombing."We reject any accusations levelled at opposition for this heinous crime," a senior official tweeted. "Our role was to secure civilians not kill them."More than 5,000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns, along with 2,200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani, on Friday.Syria's war has left more than 320,000 people dead since erupting in 2011, with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands trapped under siege.It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed jihadist groups to seize vast areas of the country.US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key jihadist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the ISIS bastion of Raqa.The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by a US-led coalition, surrounded Tabqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes.The town and a nearby dam are key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqa, the jihadists' de facto Syrian capital about 55 kilometres (35 miles) to the east.An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliance's forces were "trying to penetrate the town from the east and west".SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres (yards) of Tabqa and engaged in heavy fighting as IS counter-attacked, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.The SDF launched a campaign for Raqa in November, backed by US-led coalition air strikes, advisers and artillery. It has since captured most of the surrounding province.Tabqa sits on a key supply route into Raqa and served as an important ISIS command base, housing the group's main prison.Backed by Russia and local militias, pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains.The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas, which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment.The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays, and the 5,000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off, an AFP correspondent said.Around 2,220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory, one of them told AFP by telephone.State television said the car bombing had been carried out by "terrorist groups", a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups.The main opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) condemned the bombing, saying that "terrorism shall end if a political transition takes place".Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when, if ever, they would be able to return to their homes. "It's terrible to be uprooted like this, to go and live in a place that is not ours," said Jama Nayef, a vet from Fuaa.
Let's be honest, there are a lot of angry coaches in college football. Oftentimes, their frustrated expressions tell the story. USA TODAY Sports highlights the angriest coaches, based on their body language. (Note: This isn't what they're really thinking...but maybe). (Photo11: Thomas Campbell, USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights A Texas regent and a former regent talked with Nick Saban's agent about replacing Mack Brown
Saban earns $5.6 million per year, but Texas could certainly afford him
Brown, who is under contract until 2020 and will be paid $5.4 million this year
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Alabama coach Nick Saban insists he's not going anywhere.
Saban responded on his weekly radio show Thursday night to an Associated Press report that his agent talked to a University of Texas regent and a former regent a few days after the Jan. 7 national championship game. The conversation regarded the possibility of the Crimson Tide coach replacing Longhorns coach Mack Brown.
Saban responded that "I don't know about any of this stuff." He says he hasn't spoken to anybody about "that particular situation."
Saban said he and his wife Terry are happy at Alabama "and quite frankly, I'm just too damn old to start all over someplace else, to be honest with you."
Regent Wallace Hall of Dallas told the AP he spoke by telephone with agent Jimmy Sexton a few days after the Jan. 7 game. Tom Hicks, a former regent who is the brother of current Regent Steve Hicks, also was on the call. Tom Hicks, the former owner of the Texas Rangers, the Dallas Stars and the English professional soccer team Liverpool, was a regent in 1997 when Brown came to Texas and was instrumental in hiring him away from North Carolina.

Two days after the call with Sexton, Tom Hicks met with Brown over lunch and told him about the call, according to several people who spoke with the AP. He asked Brown if he was ready to retire.
Brown, who had just finished his 15th season at Texas, said he wanted to keep coaching and the matter was dropped.
Brown, who is under contract until 2020 and will be paid $5.4 million this year, won the 2005 national title and lost to Saban's Alabama team in the 2010 championship game. The Longhorns are 23-18 since that defeat and Brown is under fire from fans upset about a 1-2 start this year after consecutive lopsided losses to BYU and Mississippi.
Brown has said he plans to coach through his contract. But three sub-par seasons and two consecutive losses this year have led to speculation about Brown's future and Saban is often mentioned as a potential target as a replacement. Saban has won four national championships, one with LSU in 2003 and three with Alabama in 2009, 2011 and 2012. Saban earns $5.6 million per year, but Texas — the nation's wealthiest athletic program — could certainly afford him.
BREAKDOWN: Mack Brown could be at point of no return
Whether Sexton initiated the contact with Texas is unclear. He did not return a telephone message from the AP on Thursday. Alabama spokesman Jeff Turinton also declined comment.
Hall said a person he would not identify called him, unsolicited, and proposed an introduction to Sexton.
"I notified then-chairman Gene Powell, who then informed vice chairman and athletic liaison Steve Hicks, which resulted in a conference call with Mr. Sexton," Hall said in a prepared statement to the AP. "Introductions were made and then I withdrew from the process."
Tom Hicks declined comment on the call and the meeting with Brown. Steve Hicks told the AP he was in Australia the second week in January and said never talked to Sexton, Brown or Saban about the matter.
"Wallace Hall brought this to the chairman and myself. Nothing was authorized by the board and the chairman and myself thought the board should not be involved," Steve Hicks said. "Tom and Mack are friends and talk often. They simply visited and just talked the idea through. It was dropped and nothing happened … It was a short conversation."
Powell did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Joe Jamail, a billionaire trial lawyer who is one of the top donors to Texas, is Brown's attorney. When asked about the conference call with Sexton and the lunch meeting, Jamail suggested Hall was acting on his own and threatened to sue anyone outside the university if they try to pressure Brown to resign.
"If there are any more, get ready for a lawsuit," Jamail said. "Mack has publicly stated he wants to coach."
After Brown and Tom Hicks spoke, Sexton was informed that Brown would not retire, Hall said Thursday. He said he has not been in further contact with Sexton and didn't know if anyone else from the university had spoken with the agent.
Hall is under impeachment investigation by the state House of Representatives and lawmakers have complained that Hall has tried to force out university President Bill Powers, who has been a strong advocate for Brown. Steve Hicks has been among the regents backing Powers in a public spat that has embroiled the board members and state lawmakers for more than a year.
The conversation has been rumored for months. That a regent participated —whether on behalf of the board or on his own — underscores the pressure Brown is under to turn around his struggling program.
Texas went 69-9 from 2004-2009. But the Longhorns slid to 5-7 in 2010 before seasons of 8-5 in 2011 and 9-4 in 2012. With 19 returning starters, Brown suggested before the season that Texas was on the verge of returning to national prominence. Instead, the losses to BYU and Ole Miss have left Brown fending off questions about his future every week.
On Monday, Brown dismissed "rumors" about his job.
"They've been swirling for 16 years," Brown said.

WWE superstar Chris Jericho, the self-professed “Man of 1,004 Holds,” surprised even himself today when he managed to learn a 1,005th hold.
During a WWE house show in Omaha, while attempting to apply a standard reverse chikenwing, Jericho inadvertently executed a rarely seen hold called the “inverted Fujiwara near-naked chokesault.”
More from Kayfabe News
A look of surprised delight came over Jericho's face as his opponent, John Cena, immediately tapped out thanks to the unusual maneuver.
Though it was obvious that Jericho applied the hold by accident, he was his usual arrogant self backstage after the match, claiming to have “known the move for years.”
Sources close to Jericho, however, report that he immediately rummaged through his luggage to find a long print-out detailing all 1,004 holds in his arsenal, and hastily scribbled “inverted Fujiwara rear-naked chokesault” at the bottom of it.
Hear A Rare Outtake From The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper's' Recording Sessions
Courtesy of the artist
As the 50th anniversary of the greatest rock album of all time rapidly nears, Capitol Records is sharing a previously unreleased outtake from the Sgt. Pepper's recording sessions. The clip, premiered at The Guardian, is a stripped-down version of the album's opening title cut and includes some fantastic chatter between John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison.
It's an unadorned and intimate version of the song that offers a glimpse into how The Beatles first imagined the track. It's also disorienting to hear it without any of the horns or sound effects (there's no cheering crowd or laughter). And a number of guitar licks are noticeably missing.
The Sgt. Pepper's outtake is just one of many, many bonus tracks coming out on a four-disc, 50th anniversary edition of the album. The full record has also been remixed by Giles Martin, son of the late Beatles producer George Martin. It's due out May 26. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was originally released on June 1, 1967.
Village in New York, United States
Sleepy Hollow is a village in the town of Mount Pleasant, in Westchester County, New York. The village is located on the east bank of the Hudson River, about 30 miles (48 km) north of New York City, and is served by the Philipse Manor stop on the Metro-North Hudson Line. To the south of Sleepy Hollow is the village of Tarrytown, and to the north and east are unincorporated parts of Mount Pleasant. The population of the village at the 2010 census was 9,870.[2]
Originally incorporated as North Tarrytown in the late 19th century, in 1996 the village officially adopted the traditional name for the area.[3] The village is known to many via "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", a short story about the local area and its infamous specter, the Headless Horseman, written by Washington Irving, who lived in Tarrytown and is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Owing to this story, as well as the village's roots in early American history and folklore, Sleepy Hollow is considered by some to be one of the "most haunted places in the world".[4][5][6]
The village is home to the Philipsburg Manor House and the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, as well as the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, where in addition to Washington Irving, numerous other notable people are buried.
History [ edit ]
The land that would become Sleepy Hollow was first bought from Adriaen van der Donck, a patroon in New Netherland before the English takeover in 1664. Starting in 1672 Frederick Philipse began acquiring large parcels of land mainly in today's southern Westchester County. Comprising some 52,000 acres (81 sq mi) of land, it was bounded by the Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the Croton River, the Hudson River, and the Bronx River. Philipse was granted a royal charter in 1693, creating the Manor of Philipsburg and establishing him as first lord.[7]
In today's Sleepy Hollow he established an upper mill and shipping depot, today part of the Philipse Manor House historic site. A pious man, he was architect and financier of the town's Old Dutch Church, said also to have built the pulpit with his own hands.[8]
When Philipse died in 1702, the manor was divided between his son, Adolphus Philipse, and his grandson, Frederick Philipse II. Adolph received the Upper Mills property, which extended from Dobbs Ferry to the Croton River. Frederick II was given the Lower Mills at the confluence of the Saw Mill and Hudson Rivers, the two parcels being reunited on his uncle's death. His son, Frederick III, became the third lord of the manor in 1751.[9]
In 1779, Frederick Philipse III, a Loyalist, was attained for treason, The manor was confiscated and sold at public auction, split between 287 buyers. The largest tract of land (about 750 acres (300 ha)) was at the Upper Mills; it passed to numerous owners until 1951, when it was acquired by Sleepy Hollow Restorations. Thanks to the philanthropy of John D. Rockefeller Jr., about 20 acres (8.1 ha) were restored as today's historic site.[9]

Building a Better Bear
Mitt Romney is not the only one worried about Russia's geopolitical ambitions. Four years after the end of the brief Russo-Georgian war, Tbilisi is again agitated. On September 15, Russia is conducting military exercises in Armenia, and two days later it is starting a much bigger war game in the North Caucasus. These military maneuvers to Georgia's immediate south and north coincide with the final phase of the country's political campaign season, in which the opposition force, headed by a billionaire who made his money in Russia, is challenging President Mikheil Saakashvili's control over the legislature. No wonder Saakashvili's government is anxious.
The Russian army will not attack Georgia or depose its president. Saakashvili is profoundly despised in the Kremlin, but one thing President Vladimir Putin and others, to their surprise, have learned since the 2008 war is that, as long as Saakashvili remains in power, Georgia has zero chance of joining NATO. In the eyes of Berlin, Paris, and even Washington, the current Georgian president is not a dependable partner. Rather, the Russians are concerned about the rising tensions between Armenia, which they have pledged to defend, and Azerbaijan, which, 20 years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, refuses to recognize the secession of Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian occupation of part of Azerbaijani territory. An even more serious security concern in Moscow is the widening crisis in the Middle East involving Syria and Iran — but it is not a concern that the Kremlin would consider acting on militarily.
This distinction between neighborhood conflicts and more global concerns is a new one — and it is very much in keeping with the military doctrine adopted two years ago as part of Moscow's effort to reform Russia's armed forces. That doctrine, for the first time in 100 years, eschews the notion of fighting a large-scale war. In the current official thinking, Russia's relations with other great powers, such as the United States and China, are securely managed through nuclear deterrence; the main mission of its armed forces is now to prepare for local conflicts, along the country's borders or even within them.
This may be little comfort for Saakashvili, but it is a quantum leap for the Russian military and its political leadership. Not always appreciated by Putin's critics or even his supporters, Russia's military reform, signaled by the appointment of former business manager and tax official Anatoly Serdyukov as defense minister in February 2007, has been a fairly successful effort to redesign a well-entrenched piece of the state machinery. Although the blueprints for reform were being readied previously, it was the 2008 Georgia war that gave it real impetus.
The Russian military's performance during the five days that the war lasted was anything but stellar. Control of the operation through various levels of headquarters was plainly cumbersome; communications were abominable or even nonexistent; and the losses, both human and material, were too high. The resultant soul-searching in the Kremlin and the brooding over the price of victory created an atmosphere propitious for military reform to begin openly and in earnest. The "lessons of the war" also weakened the unreconstructed traditionalists, military and nonmilitary alike, who were driven by inertia and who had clung to the decaying remnants of the Soviet military system for nearly two decades, in the vain hope that it might be revived.
The reform, sanctioned by Putin, formally overseen by Dmitry Medvedev, and ruthlessly executed by Serdyukov, is aimed at replacing the scaled-down and dysfunctional version of the Red Army with a more modern military institution. The plan's centerpiece is to replace the concept of a mobilization army — the bedrock of the Soviet system whose main function was to draft millions of men into the armed forces at a moment's notice — with a permanent, mobile, and more professional fighting force. The command-and-control structure would be streamlined, the weapons arsenal upgraded, combat readiness enhanced, and conscripts increasingly replaced with volunteer soldiers.
Under its "new look," the Russian military is to have just four military districts, to be called commands in wartime (Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern) reporting to the General Staff in Moscow; within the districts, brigades will be the main large units. Divisions will be allowed to continue to exist only within the airborne forces. In total, the Russian armed forces will number 150,000 commissioned officers, a similar number of volunteers, and 700,000 conscripts. The proportion of modern weaponry and material — that is, material more recent than the 1970s and 1980s vintage equipment that dominates the arsenal today — is to increase from around 20 percent now to 70 percent by 2020.
So far, these goals have only partially been met. Streamlining, painful as it was, has occurred; the pay of the commissioned officers has doubled or tripled; soldiers have begun to exercise more often; pilots have started to log more hours; and sailors are once again navigating the seas. Still, the government's defense procurement plans have failed miserably; a stable corps of noncommissioned officers has yet to be built; and the reform of military education and training, beyond drastic cuts, has been put on hold for the time being.
Yet, for the first time in two decades, something is moving in the Russian armed forces. For a country that vociferously insists on its strategic independence — in Russia they call it being a "great power" — possessing a usable military instrument is a clear must. Spending roughly $700 billion over 10 years to upgrade weapons and military equipment, as Putin has repeatedly vowed to do, is not unwarranted. There is a question, asked by former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, among others, as to how much military spending the country can afford under present economic circumstances, but the most important question is not budgetary — it is strategic in the grandest sense.
The progress of Russian military reform resembles building a body from the feet up, with the head to come last. The proudly pragmatic Putin leadership sees Russia alone and essentially friendless in the world. It still counts the United States as a potential military adversary and NATO as its tool; it hopes for continued neighborliness with China, but it will take no chances; and it faces a diverse set of real enemies along its southern border. It is time to take a new look at Russia's strategic environment and try to improve it.
If there is one thing that would do that, it is the demilitarization of relations with the United States, and cooperating on missile defenses in Europe is the most important step toward that goal. This would be a huge load off Moscow's back, freeing it of the fear that the United States is out to deploy a first-strike capability. Ridding themselves of the residual adversity of the United States, Russians would be able to address real security challenges. For the United States, a Russia engaged in strategic and institutionalized military collaboration with America would be a virtual guarantee that, whatever else may happen on the world's strategic landscape, Russia will not land on the wrong side — and perhaps Gov. Romney can sleep better at night.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has donated $5 million worth of aid to the nine federal refugee resettlement agencies in the U.S., according to the Deseret News.
The donation comprises $1.2 million in cash and $3.8 million in commodities to be used during 2018, and it marks the second straight year the church has made such a donation.
Each of the nine organizations will receive a different amount. Episcopal Migration Ministries, for example, received $50,000 in cash and $200,000 of in-kind donations.
“The support from the LDS church has allowed Episcopal Migration Ministries to grant support projects for housing and health issues focused on homelessness prevention and intensive services for refugee cases with medical needs,” the organization said in a statement. “We are thankful for LDS church leadership in support of refugee resettlement.”
The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, meanwhile, received $40,000 in cash and $160,000 in in-kind donations.
“With this gift, many refugee families will now have chairs and a proper table around which they can share a meal with one another,” said Mike Mitchell, associate vice president of HIAS' U.S. programs, according to the Deseret News. “Many haven't had such a blessing for years but thanks to the LDS Church, they now do.”
Another resettlement agency, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, received a total of $600,000 in cash and commodities. Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services received $130,000 in cash and $520,000 in commodities.
The other five agencies that will receive donations from the Mormon Church include Church World Service, the Ethiopian Community Development Council, the International Rescue Committee, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and World Relief Corporation.
Together, the nine agencies are responsible for contracting with the State Department to resettle refugees who arrive in the United States.
The LDS church's donations were made possible by members' donations to the LDS Humanitarian Fund. The LDS church's First Presidency wrote a letter to church members in October 2015 encouraging them to donate to the fund.
The LDS Humanitarian Fund has helped refugees in Europe and the Middle East, in addition to the United States.
America is headed down a suicidal path, contends Leo Hohman in “Stealth Invasion: Muslim Conquest Through Immigration and Resettlement Jihad,” available now in hard copy or e-book at the WND Superstore.
Kim Wall death: Inventor Peter Madsen had disturbing videos on computer
Posted
A Danish inventor charged with murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall in his homemade submarine had video footage on his computer showing women being violently killed, a court heard on Tuesday.
Key points: Peter Madsen charged with murdering reporter Kim Wall on his submarine
Madsen claims Ms Wall died accidentally
Court reveals disturbing videos were found on Madsen's computer
A police prosecutor said officers found images "which we presume to be real" of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on Peter Madsen's computer in a laboratory he ran.
That, together with new post-mortem evidence showing Ms Wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals "around or shortly after her death", was adding to the case against Mr Madsen, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told the Copenhagen court.
Mr Buch-Jepsen said DNA tests from Madsen's nails, face and neck showed a clear match with Ms Wall's, but the exact cause of death remained unknown.
"Our suspicion hasn't changed, it has been strengthened since [the last hearing on] September 5," he said.
Mr Madsen, who denies murdering Ms Wall and another charge of mutilating her body, appeared in court via video link dressed in a green boilersuit.
He said the computer searched by police was not his.
"They are the space laboratory's tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory," he said.
The court heard he had been working on building a space rocket in the lab.
Journalist went missing at sea
Mr Madsen remained calm during the pre-trial session, sitting with his hands folded most of the time. The court ordered him to be detained for another four months as investigations continued.
Ms Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Mr Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre submarine in August.
Mr Madsen has told the court in past hearings Ms Wall died accidentally, saying she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on his UC3 Nautilus submarine.
On August 23, police identified a headless female torso washed ashore in Copenhagen as Ms Wall's.
Mr Madsen also denied amputating her limbs, saying he tried to bury her whole body at sea.

The unusual thing I discovered after writing about the experience of having a toxic parent — other than that writing really is as cathartic as everybody always says it is — is the number of friends, acquaintances, and Facebook buddies who looked at the list of characteristics and emailed me immediately about their own parents. Turns out toxicity isn't as isolating as it may seem. Many of us, particularly daughters and their mothers, appear to be working through difficulties of behavior, emotional priority, guilt, shame, and general manipulation. But once you've figured out that you have a toxic parent — what on earth do you do with them?
If I had a blueprint for the situation, believe me, I'd give one to you. I'd put it on billboards, hire cheerful urchins to distribute it on street corners, and generally market the hell out of it. This Is The Cure-All For Your Toxic Parent Needs. Take Twice A Day With The Advice Of Your Therapist. Regrettably, this is not something I can provide, but there are tips and tricks from the battleground. Some of them will seem like common sense, others may take a bit of work to accept, but you'll get there.
You're not alone, and you are not crazy. (You're also not going to go to prison for parent-murder. I hope.) Take these seven tips and use them to make a slightly better future.
1. Get Therapy
I can't emphasize this one enough. Don't believe in therapy? Give a highly recommended therapist a chance. Don't have the money? See if your GP knows any clinics with student pricing, whether your insurance might cover a certain kind of counseling, or whether you can get into a local college's therapy services. Do some investigation into the average pricing in your state, and call some therapists to see if you can negotiate.
Getting professional help to advise you on dealing with toxic parents isn't going to magically solve anything — therapy tends to bring up old wounds and may make you feel worse before it makes you feel better — but it's damn good practice to have a pro in your corner. (There was, however, a famous article in the New York Times in 2009 pointing out that therapists often want you to have a relationship with your parents — even if, ultimately, it may not be the best thing for you. Be open to talking about this.)
2. Discover Your Boundaries
Boundaries are not, typically, things that toxic parents have a lot of time for, at least in other people. So you may not have fully developed or understood your own no-go zones, your space, your limits. What treatment are you willing to put up with, and what makes you draw a line in the sand? Are you OK with a bit of good-natured ribbing, but will pull out the second a hint of passive-aggressiveness hits your interactions? Are questions about your relationship or health off-limits?
Limits are healthy; separating yourself from your parents' toxic idea of you is very dependent on your finding what they are.
3. Find Space For Your Own Emotions
Toxic families, rather like Tolstoy's unhappy ones, are all toxic in different ways, but chances are pretty good that you weren't given much of a chance to express your feelings about what was happening to you growing up — or not in any helpful way. It can be hard to carve out space as an adult to feel this stuff when it's been stuffed under the dysfunctional rug for so long. A therapist will help you get it out rather than conforming to the old patterns.
4. Find Good, Loving Support
Do not do this on your own. Dealing with toxic parents in any capacity — even if it's maintaining an everyday routine with them while quietly dissecting the patterns of your relationship — is draining. It's emotional labor. You're going to need people in your corner. Often other family members will not want to get involved (and likely for good reason), so look for people outside your family circle, from close friends to partners.
There's no shame in telling them you're going through some parent stuff. If they think you're just having an adolescent rage 10 years too late, drop 'em, or at least give them a talking-to.
5. Read About It
One thing that has been seriously helpful in diagnosing the toxicity in my family dynamic has been going back to the sources. Aside from Susan Forward's seminal Toxic Parents, available in PDF online, psychological articles about toxic families and dysfunction and books like Will I Ever Be Good Enough?, Healing The Child Within, and the more recent Difficult Mothers have all been helpful in different ways. More generally, books like Nancy Friday's My Mother, Myself have been recommended as helpful for general dysfunction involving mothers and daughters, with the caveat that it is slightly dated.
Go trawling the literature for something that really seems to hit home for you — it'll help more than you know.
6. Get Backup On Family Occasions
Backup can be physical — literally having another person, a best friend, or partner there to have your back — or it can be less tangible.
A friend introduced me to the concept of "scripts" when dealing with potentially toxic parents: already rehearsed responses, often neutral as well as assertive, to whatever they may throw at you. There's an excellent set of suggestions for all occasions over at Captain Awkward, and it will help to you to feel prepared and adult, as opposed to the small child you're used to.
7. Figure Out What You Want From The Relationship
I'm lucky. I'm not dependent on my parents for either money or love, so whatever I have from them can be seen as a bonus rather than a necessary part of my life. But there can be a large gap between what you really want from your relationship with your parent — a mom who allows you to be angry, for instance, or a dad who doesn't prioritize himself over you — and what your parents can realistically do.
Stepping out of toxicity is a significant change, and challenging a family dynamic is always going to meet with resistance. What you want may not be what you get, but figuring out what sort of parent you'd like, and communicating that, may help close the gap.

This week on CounterSpin: Alleged San Bernardino killers Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik did not pledge allegiance to ISIS on social media, the FBI now says, but no matter: The California killings have already added fuel to an upsurge of Islamophobia in US media and politics that in some ways is worse than that seen in the wake of September 11, 2001.

As Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hansen took the stage to announce that he was launching a National Women's Soccer League team in Utah, the club's season-ticket interest form went live on the RSL website.
At that point the team didn't have a name, coach or any players. Yet in the two and a half weeks between the announcement and Dec. 4, when season tickets went on sale for RSL season-ticket holders, about 1,000 people had filled out the form, according to RSL Chief Business Officer Andy Carroll. Utah Royals FC, as the NWSL team has since been named, has sold a little over 2,000 season tickets since.
“The acceptance in the community has been exceptional,” Carroll said, “and we expected that actually.”
In the two weeks following the Nov. 16 announcement, the pieces started to fit together to form a more complete picture of the new NWSL team. Four days after the official announcement, the league said the Kansas City franchise would cease operations and the rights to its players would be assigned to Utah.
A week later, the Royals hired former Seattle Reign FC coach Laura Harvey. They followed that up with the release of the team name and logo four days later.
Despite the uncertainty that came with an expedited team-launching process, roughly 1,000 RSL season-ticket holders bought Royals season tickets the week the team began selling them. The next week Utah made tickets available to the general public, and the Royals added 1,000 more season-ticket holders as they began to make their way down the list of people who had filled out interest forms.
“We're still working on the list of people that showed interest,” Carroll said. “There are lots of other avenues that we have, but that's what we've essentially been mining since the 4th.”
Hansen said he expects Royals games to average at least 12,000 in fans per home game next season, and to hit that number, Caroll said, the team is aiming for 5,000 season ticket holders by the beginning of the season. He predicts they will reach 3,000 by Jan. 1.
Those attendance figures are ambitious when compared to the rest of the league. The NWSL averaged 5,061 per game last season. But the rate at which Utah soccer fans are already buying season tickets bodes well for the new club.
In an informal Twitter survey conducted by the Tribune, low cost was a common reason responders had bought season tickets.
I bought two. Good seats are incredibly affordable, my daughter already loves going to RioT for Monarchs/RSL games, and she ∗lit up∗ once she found out they're bringing a woman's team. — Trevor Brady (@trevor_brady) December 19, 2017
Royals season tickets for the 12-game home schedule range between $120 and $300.
Season tickets in the the premium seating areas — including the Zions Bank Club Seats, Interform Cub and Audi Executive Club — cost anywhere between $600 to $1,500. Added perks, including food, come with those selections.
“There were a number of factors,” Carroll said of setting ticket prices, “but certainly making it accessible to a broad part of the community was important to us and that was one of our key criteria.”
Many new Royals fans also mentioned a desire to support women's soccer and feel rooted in that community.
“It's going to be amazing to watch some amazing female athletes right in our home, instead of waiting for a chance for the [U.S. Women's national team] to come to town,” @hikingnugg tweeted. “It's a great opportunity for the young women in this state and I can't wait to share this exciting experience with my nieces.”

Those who haven't purchased season tickets often cited the distance from their homes to Sandy and uncertainly about the schedule.
We have not bought tickets yet, but plan on going to games. Just waiting for a better sense of the Royal's scheduled, @RealSaltLake schedule and my own schedule — John Ryan (@JJRyanMD) December 19, 2017
No season tickets but definitely planning on attending a few games. STH is a commitment and having to commute to Sandy is less than enjoyable. Had it been a stadium in Downtown SLC, probably be attending every game. Hope the Royals NWSL success! — Derrick Blake (@derrickSLC) December 19, 2017
After a dominating defensive performance against the Buffalo Bills, the Carolina Panthers regressed heavily on Sunday. The most disappointing outcome, however, was the lethargic display by the Panthers run defense. Despite holding LeSean McCoy to 12 yards a week prior, the Panthers allowed 149 rushing yards to the Saints.
The Panthers outstanding run defense versus Buffalo was the combination of sound fundamentals and excellent gap integrity. The inverse of that performance took place on Sunday. The Saints deserve credit, though. They were able to manipulate the gaps by placing an emphasis on presnap motion.
Presnap Motion
The Saints first rushing attempt was only a 5 yard gain, but the way they motioned some of their pass catchers was a sign of things to come.
The Panthers are lined up in a 4-3 over. Strong safety Mike Adams is in the box. When Brees motions Tommy Lee Lewis, Shaq Thompson follows.
Saints first carry of the game. CAR in a 4-3 over. Man across board. Saints shift the WR to strong side. Opens up lane thru B gap pic.twitter.com/tIp2LeNmjE — Billy Marshall (@BillyM_91) September 26, 2017
If the embed doesn't load click here.
Due to the motion and Thompson following, Brees is alerted that the Panthers are in man coverage. Therefore, the run goes to the weakside where the Saints have the advantage. Why is the B gap unaccounted for? If Thompson follows, then Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis have to shift quicker.
The next run was a combination of motion and a deceptive play fake.
Before the snap, the Panthers have each gap accounted. The Saints fake a screen after the snap, which causes Davis to move away from the playside run.
Kuechly and Davis are intertwined into the same A gap. The B gap to the playside is open. In addition, the tight end has a free lane to lead Adrian Peterson. Peterson bounces the ball outside, but this was a great job of moving the linebackers without getting physical.

The next run was the first explosive run by the Saints.

Before the snap the strong side of the formation is to the right. Bree motions Fleener and the strong side is now to the left. As a result, Davis starts shifting to the weakside. The Saints have the numbers, again, to the playside.
The interior of the Panthers defense is expected to be a strength, but the Saints showed their physicality at the point of attack.

Once again, New Orleans shifts the strong side to the formation with motion. The Panthers don't shift. The center and right guard combine for a duo block on Kawann Short. He gets driven back. Davis should be targeting the B gap, but he hits the A gap instead. Mark Ingram has an open hole for a nice gain. Taking the correct gap fits are becoming a common theme.
More good stuff by Brees. Moves the WR away from the strong side which forces 54 to follow. 58 shifts to account for C gap, but no A gap LB pic.twitter.com/D9oYpuHr4e — Billy Marshall (@BillyM_91) September 26, 2017

Bree motions the wide receiver to the weakside, which makes Shaq Thompson follow. Thomas Davis moves to account for the C gap. The Saints center and right guard combine for another duo block. Kuechly anticipates the inside run, but his aggressiveness causes him to over pursue the carry. The gap is unaccounted by any linebacker. Alvin Kamara has a sizable hole.

It wasn't all bad for the run defense. The force or edge players on the perimeter had some issues, but this was a positive. The Panthers communicate well after the motion. The Saints run a pitch to the strong side, but Carolina has the numbers advantage. Daryl Worley quickly approaches Ingram after the toss and forces a tackle for loss.

This is an example of the force player not executing. Prior to the snap, New Orleans has the Panthers defense running all over. The motion by the wide receiver causes Thompson to follow him. The Panthers had Mike Adams in the box, but he interchanges his role with Kurt Coleman. Coleman is now in the box to the strong side. Brandon Coleman's block, opens a hole for Ingram. Bradberry is isolated, but as the force player he has to make this tackle sooner.

The Saints don't implement any motion on this run, but the Panthers were clearly expecting them to do so. The defensive line shifts to the weakside before the snap, but the Saints run a power concept to the strongside. This was another case of New Orleans having the numbers advantage to the playside.
Nail in the coffin. NO runs a wide zone on Kamara TD. LBs shift after the TE motion. 59 accounts for wrong gap and can't get off block. pic.twitter.com/9A0X9l16bN — Billy Marshall (@BillyM_91) September 26, 2017
If the embed doesn't load click here.
Alvin Kamara's touchdown run late in the 4th quarter was the nail in the coffin for the Panthers. New Orleans is running a wide zone concept to the strongside. Carolina's linebackers shift with the motion. Davis correctly sets a hard edge, which is exactly what he's supposed to do on zone runs. The defensive line doesn't win at the snap, which puts stress on Kuechly. He gets caught reading the wrong gap and he is left chasing. Bradberry is aligned off the line of scrimmage, but he doesn't read the run quickly enough. He needs to approach the line of scrimmage sooner and execute a “crack/replace” technique to have the run flow outside.
Looking Forward
The pass defense also had a rough day too, but the run defense is expected to be the strong suit. The majority of the explosive runs came when the Panthers were in base defense. Shaq Thompson was moved away from the box, which allowed the Saints to dictate matchups. The Panthers showed commendable effort though, so that's a positive for the long term. They didn't show any quit.
The combination of individual breakdowns, scheme issues, and gap fits caused issues. The Panthers should play more nickel with Captain Munnerlyn moving forward. They have one of the best nickel units in the league. Hopefully this is a learning experience for defensive coordinator Steve Wilks. They have to find solutions because they face another hall of fame coach and quarterback on Sunday.

Now that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is no longer seeking re-election in 2018, the Arizona Senate race is about to get very interesting. When the primaries wrap up next August, we could see the first openly bisexual member of Congress facing off against a woman who has been called an unhinged conspiracy theorist by members of her own party.
Flake's exit means former state Sen. Kelli Ward, the anointed candidate of the anti-establishment right, is now the most high-profile Republican in the race. Breitbart chairman and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has endorsed her, as have conservative commentators Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.
Bannon recently referred to Ward as a “whirlwind” at a campaign rally he hosted, but that is not her most well-known nickname. The Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP-aligned super PAC, released a campaign ad earlier this year that reprised an attack branding her as “chemtrail Kelli Ward.” The spot was referencing a town hall Ward hosted in 2014, during which she fielded a number of questions about a conspiracy theory saying government- or corporate-controlled aircraft regularly disperse mind-controlling pollutants into the atmosphere.
Ward has denied directly supporting those theories, however, and fact-checks say the ad took the town hall event out of context. Still, Ward clearly isn't shy around conspiracy theorists. When she went on Alex Jones' nationally syndicated radio show last year, she appeared to suggest that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) may be trying to kill her. Ward lost to McCain in the 2016 GOP Senate primary.
In July, Ward also attracted criticism for suggesting McCain would die in office after being diagnosed with cancer. In a radio interview, she urged McCain to resign, laying the groundwork for her to be appointed to his Senate seat.
Bloomberg via Getty Images Veterans listen as Kelli Ward speaks during a campaign stop at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 720 in Phoenix on Aug. 11, 2016.
Ward has aligned her campaign with President Donald Trump, expressing support for the president's plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, pull up Obamacare “by the roots” and “drain the swamp” in Washington. But establishment Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fear she's too similar to the unsuccessful class of tea party-affiliated candidates who lost a string of elections in 2010 and 2012. Still, recent surveys had shown Ward polling ahead of Flake by a substantial margin.
On the Democratic side, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) has emerged as the clear front-runner. Sinema made history in 2012 when she became the first openly bisexual person elected to Congress. Months later, she broke ground again by becoming the first member of Congress to describe her religion as “none.” Sinema identifies as religiously “unaffiliated,” and has said she prefers a “secular approach” and is a “student of all cultures in her community.”
In a video announcing her candidacy last month, Sinema called herself “a little bit different than most people in politics.” She recounted being homeless for years while growing up, and described using a combination of hard work and public assistance to change her circumstances.
The divergent profiles of Sinema and Ward would make for a fascinating contrast ― and, perhaps more likely, some disgusting mud-slinging. But who knows? Another challenger could shake up the race before next summer.
There are already other upstart candidates in the race, including Deedra Abboud, a Muslim American attorney from Phoenix who is running as a Democrat and has faced Islamophobic attacks.
1980s horror movie poster logos and typography.
It amazes me how few movies have an identity. While millions of dollars are spent on the marketing campaign of Hollywood movies, their logos or wordmarks are usually much cheaper: $35 (the price of the Trajan ‘movie font.' on MyFonts.com).
Logos/wordmarks like you see above are gradually becoming extinct. They're being replaced by Trajan, which has become the go-to font for horror movie posters. As a result, very few movie identities stand out from the crowd. Typography is hardly ever used anymore to express the theme or atmosphere of a movie (exceptions being Saw (2004) or House of the devil (2009) ).
If your movie is frightening, disgusting or gory, why not communicate that with moviegoers? That's what they did during the 1980s. As a result every movie or franchise had it's own unique identity. All the poster designers needed was a pen and ink. That's even cheaper than $35!
Generational iPhone tests are always so much fun. In one test, released by the YouTube channel EverythingApplePro, the narrator lines up all 15 iPhones from the 2G through the 7+. He compares speed, as well as the volume decibels, camera, touch identification, and heat.
The iPhone 7 is said to be 120 times faster than the original 2G, which came out a whopping nine years ago—that's a lot of progress in less than a decade. Now, according to the video's narrator, "we're at a point where we're seeing diminished return on speed with new phones," which is why he filmed the speed test comparison.
He plugged all the iPhones into the same port hub so that he could turn them all on simultaneously and watch which ones loaded first. The first to turn on was the iPhone 7, but the 7+ came in eighth place (out of 15), right after the 5s. The 4 came in last place.
The narrator also tested the speed with which the camera application would launch, finding that the 7 and 7+ were not the fastest. The cameras themselves, however, on the latest two iPhones are worlds better than those on earlier versions. A side by side comparison of night shots, closeups, and color shows how much more clear, bright, and reliable they were in different settings.
The narrator also compares the decibels on all the different iPhone iterations. Without a headphone jack, the iPhone 7 and 7+ were found to have much greater volume capacity than their predecessors. He also compared the heat emitted by the different phones, finding that the newer ones were overall cooler, but that the larger plus models, in general, emitted more heat.
So while the iPhone 7 and 7+ may not be groundbreaking, when all the incremental change among iPhones is compared cumulatively, it's fun to see how much progress has been made. Even if it's not perfect.
Newcastle United have announced plans for a stunning new state-of-the-art training complex
Newcastle United Football Club have announced plans for a stunning new state-of-the-art training complex as part of a multi-million pound redevelopment of the Club's existing 35-acre training ground site.
The current intention is that work will get underway in May 2015 and when complete in early 2016, the Magpies will occupy one of the finest training facilities of its kind in Europe.
While existing training pitches and a modern indoor training hall will be retained, the Club's current Training Centre building will be demolished and replaced by a much larger, high-tech structure.
It will accommodate newly-designed changing, training, rehabilitation, medical, leisure and catering facilities and will also introduce the latest aquatic technology to the site, with a 20-metre swimming pool, a hydrotherapy and fitness pool and specialist equipment to aid injury prevention and recovery.
The new construction will also create a fitness centre double the size of the Club's existing gymnasium, as well as administrative space, a presentation suite for match analysis and a new media suite.
Newcastle United director of football, Joe Kinnear, said: "This is a hugely exciting development for Newcastle United. We have one of football's great stadiums and we are delighted to now be announcing plans for a training complex which will rival any in Europe.
"Top players and top teams need top training and medical facilities. Our current training ground has served the Club very well but the new complex will give us all of the ingredients that we need to continue maintaining and enhancing the performance of elite footballers.
"It will also be an added attraction when we are looking to recruit players."
The new training complex has been designed to fit within the Club's impressive environmental policy, building on the Magpies' achievement of becoming the world's first carbon neutral football club in 2012.
The new eco-friendly building will be made from cross-laminated timber (CLT) sourced from sustainable forests and will produce its own energy from a combined heat and power (CHP) plant room.
A formal planning application is to be submitted shortly before a tender process begins. For exclusive images, click here.
The Club's official website, www.nufc.co.uk will continue to bring supporters exclusive updates on the project as they happen.

Hello everyone, hope you are all doing well. This has been a very busy week for me but at the moment I am enjoying the weekend a lot. In fact, today I have been around the kitchen cooking (what's new :)) and me and my husband really enjoyed this healthy recipe so I thought it was worth it to share it with you. This is a vegan and vegetarian delicious recipe which requires basic healthy ingredients and it is very simple to make. This vegan meatballs are made with barley, lentils, carrots, leek, tomato, celery and delicious spices, I decided to accompany it with a homemade tomato ketchup sauce. These delicious vegan meatballs are cooked in the oven and not fried so it is definitely a must-try.
Cooking time: 90 minutes
Serves: 4 People
To make this delicious recipe you will need:
120 gr of dried pearl barley
400 gr of lentils (I used a can of lentils in water)
2 medium size carrots
1/3 of a leek
1 stalk of celery
50 gr of peeled plum tomatoes
2 Bay leaves
Paprika
Black pepper
Oregano
Olive oil
Salt
For the tomato sauce:
350 of peeled plum tomato
1 clove of garlic
Oregano
A splash of balsamic vinegar
A pinch of sugar
Salt
1 teaspoon of olive oil
The preparation:
First of all, put the barley on a bowl with cold water to rest for about 40 minutes, this process will soften and help it cook faster.
Cut the leek and the celery into very small pieces, then grate the carrots (as shown in the picture) and place them in a deep sauce pan. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a pinch of salt and then turn the heat to medium low to cook the vegetables. Make sure to stir them as they cook.
When the vegetables are soft and cooked, add the barley, the lentils, the tomatoes, the paprika, black pepper, oregano, the bay leaves and after that add water just to cover the surface of the ingredients, turn the heat to medium-high to cook everything together. Add the water as soon as you notice it evaporates. I added the water three times.
Tip: The reason I added water to just cover the surface is to avoid having that boiled taste in the end of the vegetables, instead I treated it more like a risotto this way all the ingredients flavour will blend very well together.
Please let evaporate as much water as you can,this way the vegan meat-less balls will have a better definite shape.
When you are happy with the taste and the consistency of the ingredients, turn the heat off and let them cool for at least 10 min. Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 8/450F/230C, then with a blender blend about 60% of the mixture and using your hands, shape the vegan meatballs (don't worry if they feel a bit sticky they will assume the specific form as they get cooked in the oven.) I put approximately 8 meatballs (size of an egg) on the tray and cook for about 35-40 minutes or until slighty brown. After cooked leave to cool for about 15 minutes before consuming.
For the sauce, all you need to do is put the tomatoes, the garlic, oregano, black pepper, paprika, balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt and olive oil on a bowl, then blend everything until smooth. After that, on a sauce pan add the sauce and 1/2 glass of water and cook on high heat until it starts thickening. And that's it!
I really hope you will like this very interesting and absolutely delicious recipe which is a different version of the classic lentil meatloaf. You can recreate it for a party as an appetizer ( I am sure no one will miss the meat in eating them), or they are perfect for a yummy pack lunch with some salad.
Thank you again for the support you give to this blog!
See you next recipe!
Enjoy!

Band file claim for $666,000 and express outrage at their music being used 'as an actual weapon against somebody' in the US detention centre
A Canadian electro-industrial band is asking for thousands of dollars in royalties after learning that the US military used their music to torture prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. Skinny Puppy claim they filed a $666,000 (£368,000) bill with America'd defence department.
"We sent them an invoice for our musical services considering they had gone ahead and used our music without our knowledge and used it as an actual weapon against somebody," keyboardist Cevin Key recently told CTV News. "I am not only against the fact they're using our music to inflict damage on somebody else but they are doing it without anybody's permission."
Skinny Puppy first learned about the alleged use of their music from a former Guantánamo Bay guard, who was "affected or offended" by the detention camp's practices. Although the Vancouver-born band originally planned to use their new album cover as an invoice to the Pentagon, they have now received "coaching" and apparently sent an actual physical document to government officials. They are even considering a lawsuit.
"We're not making a point looking for financial gain," Key underlined. But nor is the group entirely surprised that their songs were used as sonic punishment for Gitmo's detainees: "We thought this would end up happening, in a weird way," he admitted in an interview with the Phoenix New Times. "Because we make unsettling music, we can see it being used in a weird way. But it doesn't sit right with us."
Skinny Puppy aren't the only group whose music has reportedly been used to torture terrorist suspects and "enemy combatants" at the United States' base in Cuba. According to earlier reports, interrogators have employed songs by Metallica, Rage Against The Machine, Queen, Eminem, and even David Gray. "It's an issue that no one wants to deal with," Gray said in 2008. "It's shocking that there isn't more of an outcry."
Weapon, Skinny Puppy's 12th studio album, is out now.

On March 20th, the world celebrated International Happiness Day. You missed it? That's too bad. Or maybe, it isn't. It's possible that by missing out on Happiness Day, you might have saved yourself from the popular misstep that many other people in our society have tripped over. That's right, happiness, or the pursuit of happiness as an end goal or a value in your life, just may be the very thing that's causing you (and many others) to feel bad in the first place.
Yes, this is counter-intuitive in our culture. When even the Declaration of Independence encourages you to pursue happiness, the idea that pursuing happiness may be a problem is, well, a problem for most people! It's one of those things that gets your brain tied in knots. But, as Dr. Tania Lombrozo wrote for NPR.org, the problem is the Western conception of happiness and how that drives our pursuit of happiness.
In our society, happiness is an individual ideal. I do things that I enjoy, and then I am happy. I get a new, giant TV for my apartment and I feel good (hence I am happy). I get a raise at work, I am happy. My friends call me to hang out, I am happy. In each of these situations, the emphasis is on what I get, how I benefit, and how something makes me feel. My happiness is about me. That's because culturally, America is an individualistic culture that values independence. That's certainly not a bad thing, but it does impact the way we look at the world, and influences our ideas and understanding of what defines happiness.
This isn't the case everywhere, however. Many Western cultures, like China and Japan, are what psychologists call Collectivist Cultures, where individuals consider themselves first and foremost as part of the fabric of society. In these cultures, happiness is not defined by the individual's feelings, rather it is marked by connection to others in society. And, in these countries, the pursuit of happiness is actually associated with positive outcomes (while in the US it has been associated with increases in depression, loneliness, and feelings of disappointment).
But, perhaps there is a way that we can use this information to help us achieve this fleeting and often elusive ideal of happiness. I'm willing to bet that a number of people who just read that last paragraph had a thought like: “Wait a minute, when I think of being happy, I think of having my friends and family and social connections around me! Perhaps I am more collectivist than I even knew!” If you had that thought, or something similar, then you're in a good place to actually be happy.
Let's attempt something new … let's shift away from having the end goal be happiness. Then, instead of happiness as the goal, let's think about those things that really matter to you (perhaps it is the aforementioned connection to others in society). What if those were the “goal” and the idea of happiness was nothing more than a byproduct that may or may not happen if you worked towards the goal? How would your life change if you weren't invested in the “Pursuit of Happiness” and instead were in the “Pursuit of Things that Matter to You?”
The Pursuit of Things that Matter to You is a never-ending journey that doesn't always bring happiness. I really care about being a thoughtful and caring parent to my children, but that doesn't always make me happy (like when they are sad, I am sad. Or when they are in a bad mood and are crabby, I am often in a bad mood and am crabby myself!). At the same time, when I am pursuing Things that Matter (and happiness isn't the goal or even an expected outcome), I am collecting the ingredients necessary for a life that will yield more happy moments than not.
So, the goal is not to try and feel happy in the moment. The goal is to try and shift our perspective and work towards having more things your life that matter to you, which will make it easier to feel excited, engaged, and even happy in the long term.
We're bad at blogging. We admit it. A friend (tip of the hat to @mttalxndrgrrtt) recently advised us to write more – this is us taking that advice to heart.
The State of the Game posts will be posted weekly and lay out where the game stands, what we're working on, or anything else that's on our mind. Please let us know if you'd like to hear about anything specifically.
Our Current Focus
Users! And more users! We currently have about 400 active players (about 2100 signups). For new users coming in they can often have problems finding a game. We secretly (evil laugh here) changed our algorithm for matchmaking the other day to broaden these criteria a bit – however – it's still a population problem, and one we're working hard to address.
Along these lines, we've found that we don't do a great job of getting people to signup. Once they do however, most people really seem to enjoy things. To address this we are working on:
A trailer showcasing the basic gameplay and tone.
Sound effects to assist with the first impression and polish.
Voice over for the trailer to help establish tone and guide users along the tutorial in a more vibrant fashion.
All of these efforts are largely being done by friends, or other talented people we've managed to snag. This means Ken and I can continue working on features, bugs, customer support, etc. Once these are in place we can push our marketing efforts a little harder – and hopefully find a bigger audience.
What's Upcoming?
Over the past week or so we've been super busy with in-game support, minor bug fixes, and consuming turkey for Canadian thanksgiving. Here are some things that will be deployed in the next week:
Number of cards remaining in your deck is now visible in-game
Holy Water bugs with Hypnotic Watch bugs addressed
Fresh Start has been fixed
Login “remember me” functionality addressed
League promotions / demotions can no longer occur on a loss/win respectively.
Plus a bunch smaller tickets that we'll get done over the next few days. Finally, here are some more interesting higher priority things which may make it in if time permits:
Friends and public player profiles.
Auto-cancellation of quick match when you leave site.
Improved quick match functionality (perhaps a chess-clock like system, with auto end-turn, details pending).
Balance Problems
We get a lot of questions, comments about balance. Here are some common requests that we will likely address soon:
Aggronium is a wee bit too good (currently Aggronium wins ~63% of its games).
Shellinium is wee bit too bad (currently loses 65% of its games).
Party Animal is a little overpowered.
Not sure when/if or how we'll address these – but I thought it would be interesting to list out these common concerns.
More Words!
I wanted to say that so far the game is going really well. People seem to be having a really good time. Ken and I are working our butts off to make the game better. We really appreciate all the feedback, support, and advice everyone has given us. We'll continue to work to try to grow this into something amazing.
If you could help us by telling your friends, giving us a review in the Chrome App Store, or just helping us get the word out – we would love you long time.
More words next wednesday – keep brawling'.
I have to give props to the religious right. When they write a religious freedom bill they cover all the bases and make it even more objectionable than many thought possible.
House Bill 135, the “Government Non-Discrimination Act,” actually gives state and local governments, plus homophobic individuals, the right to discriminate against the state's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered population.
The 64th Wyoming Legislature has been swimming in a sea of bad bills, including ones that would take public lands out of public hands, eliminate gun-free zones, and adopt extreme anti-abortion measures. But HB135 is one of the worst. It's sponsored by Rep. Cheri Steinmetz (R, HD-5, Lingle).
Steinmetz's measure is similar to other “religious freedom” bills Wyoming has previously rejected. There's good reason for people to be worried this session, however, because the House has passed these bills in past sessions and the chamber's number of far-right members has increased. This reality puts a lot of pressure on the Senate to kill these monstrosities. Who knows what could happen this year?
There has been some acceptance of gays and lesbians among conservatives since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages. Perhaps that's because they learned nothing has changed in their own lives just because a gay couple down the street was finally able to legalize their marriage after 25 years together.
Others, though, will never accept same-sex marriage and have been stewing about it for the past two years, plotting to find a way to make their discrimination against it legal. They mistakenly think they've found a way, and so much more, in HB135.
The fundamental principle behind the bill is that people and business owners who have religious beliefs and moral convictions against the LGBT community have the right to legally show their disgust by discriminating against them. In a new twist, the bill would forbid state or local government, or any board, agency, department, or institution from doing anything about it.
Opponents I've talked to are furious about this bill and call it the worst piece of anti-LGBT legislation ever introduced in Wyoming. I agree, because proposals simply to ban same-sex marriages by only recognizing the union of a man and woman generally stopped at that injustice. This bill goes even further.
It's an insidious, dangerous bill. Other states have passed similar legislation, though not as extreme as this one.
Among the most extreme bills
Rose Saxe of the national ACLU, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, described HB135 as “among the most extreme anti-LGBT bills introduced in the nation. She said its impact would be sweeping and it would authorize widespread discrimination by homophobic “religious” government workers.
“Laramie's Non-Discrimination Ordinance would be unenforceable, and potentially even illegal,” Sabrina King, new executive director of the ACLU's Wyoming chapter, wrote in a statement last week. “No other city would be allowed to enact non-discrimination protections. County clerks would be allowed to deny same-sex couples a marriage license, and would be able to do so without consequence.”
King described other ways the law might be used. “A doctor would be able to decline care for the child of a same-sex couple, and could keep her or his license. State contractors or grantees that provide essential social services, such as a homeless shelter or counseling agency, could turn away LGBT people and keep their state funding.”
And this is unbelievable, but it could happen if this bill becomes law: It would be legal if a firefighter refused to aid a same-sex couple! If a firefighter's boss tried to compel the firefighter live up to his or her professional code of conduct and render aid, the firefighter could actually sue the fire department and seek “damages.”
Exactly how do state, local government or other entities know when a person's religious convictions and moral beliefs rise to the level they can discriminate against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgendered individuals and couples at will? Do investigators interview neighbors, co-workers and clergy? Hook the person up to a polygraph machine? Look deep into their eyes to see if they can spot a soul inside?
At its core, this bill is wholly un-American and obviously written by legislators or lobbyists who have no idea what protections are guaranteed by the First Amendment.
The “religious freedom” that supporters of HB135 say they're guaranteed by the Constitution does not mean that one religion has special protections not guaranteed to others. On the contrary, the First Amendment prohibits “the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, ensuring that there is no prohibition on the free exercise of religion.” That means all religions.
What HB135 backers want is for the federal government and all others to recognize that the religious right's beliefs are superior to all others.
Most people would look at the title of this bill, the Government Non-Discrimination Act, and conclude it would protect a person from discrimination — like a person refused service because of their sexual orientation. But what it actually does is protect the rights of the person who has discriminated against a LGBT individual because of their religious belief that only one man and one women can marry.
But if members of the religious right were actually worthy of such protections, the obvious question is how can they justify, under their own belief system, discriminating against others?
Regarding citizens with “religious convictions,” HB135 states that this
protected class of people will be allowed to legally discriminate against the LGBT population and the government cannot punish them by assessing any additional tax, penalty or payment.
And there are more protections: The government and its subdivisions cannot “withhold, reduce, exclude, terminate or otherwise deny any state grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, loan, license, certification, accreditation or employment.”
I've got a real problem with that last one, since we live in a state where it's perfectly legal for an employer to fire a worker who openly displays a wedding photo with his or her same-sex partner.
One group of citizens is fired because of their sexual orientation, while another's religious beliefs are so extreme it's legal for them to openly discriminate against another group? And if the state doesn't let them be so intolerant, they can sue for non-existent damages under this bill.
Opponents in the Equality State can't just assume a majority of legislators will realize how detrimental all aspects of this bill will be to our state. Complacency and disbelief are two of the ways progressives get steamrolled on so many issues.
Twenty-one states have some type of religious freedom laws on their books. Let's make sure Wyoming isn't the 22nd.
Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins is a 2000 American direct-to-video animated action comedy-adventure film that acts as a pilot to the television series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.[1]
Plot [ edit ]
As a framing device, Andy's toys watch a VHS copy of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins.
Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Warp Darkmatter (Diedrich Bader) are searching for three missing Little Green Men (L.G.M.) (Patrick Warburton), a noosphere-dwelling race serving as Star Command's Universe Protection Unit's scientists. They discover the lost L.G.M. in a hidden outpost belonging to Evil Emperor Zurg (Wayne Knight). Buzz and Warp break in and rescue the L.G.M., and a battle breaks out with Zurg's robots while they escape. Zurg triggers the self-destruct mechanism; Warp gets pinned under wreckage and forces Buzz to leave just before the explosion happens, presumably killing Warp.
Blaming himself for Warp's death, Buzz refuses a new partner, but is given a Star Command recruit, Princess Mira Nova (Nicole Sullivan), whom Commander Nebula (Adam Carolla) trains. With the power of "ghosting", Nova is nearly invulnerable. Buzz reiterates his refusal to endanger another partner, despite Nebula's forceful assertion that Buzz must not work alone. Buzz later rescues a shy janitor named Booster (Stephen Furst) from being fired.
In Zurg's fortress, his new second-in-command, Agent Z, is given a robotic arm that becomes a variety of weapons. Zurg learns of a huge orb on the L.G.M. homeworld called the Uni-Mind, responsible for the telepathic link between them; he sends his robots to capture it. The L.G.M. build a robot soldier called XR (Larry Miller), who is offered to Buzz as a partner as he can be repaired after any damage and can learn from him. They get a telepathic message about Zurg's attack. When Buzz and XR arrive on the L.G.M. planet, they are confronted by Agent Z, who destroys XR while the Uni-Mind is stolen by Zurg. Unable to think clearly, the L.G.M. rebuild XR, but with a mind of his own. Commander Nebula decides to launch a full-scale assault on Planet Z, but Mira says a solo ranger could go to stop Zurg with the prototype Alpha-One. Nebula dismisses the idea, deciding to launch the full-scale assault.
Zurg corrupts the Uni-Mind, so he can use it to control minds, while his scientists start making a "Mega-Ray" to use the corrupted Uni-Mind to bend entire populations of people to Zurg's will. Mira steals the Alpha-One prototype spacecraft to fight Zurg. Buzz pursues Mira in his own craft, not realizing Booster and XR are inside it, having entered it to play make-believe. Eventually, Buzz catches Mira and stores Alpha-One in his spaceship's cargo bay; Booster and XR are discovered also. Zurg's Mega-Ray subverts several planets in quick succession before turning it on Star Command. Buzz, Mira, Booster, and XR discover all of the staff have been suborned by Zurg; they flee in Buzz's Star Cruiser. Zurg uses Star Command's entire arsenal, planting a bomb on Buzz's ship. Buzz and the others escape in the Alpha-One just before the bomb detonates, destroying the cruiser. Zurg presumes Buzz dead.
Booster accidentally causes the ship to crash-land on Planet Z. There, Buzz insists on finishing the mission alone and orders the others to leave. Buzz fights Agent Z, but he is shocked when Agent Z removes his helmet, revealing himself as Warp Darkmatter. Taking advantage of Buzz's momentary confusion, Warp knocks him out and delivers him to Zurg. Warp explains that he faked his death at the beginning of the film and was secretly working for Zurg for years as a double agent. When Zurg mocks Buzz, Buzz responds by dictating his "final log entry". Zurg and Warp watch in amusement, but Mira, Booster and XR hear Buzz's surrender and his final entry (which includes a coded plea for help).
Zurg plans to use the Mega-Ray on Buzz, but XR and Booster arrive in time to rescue him as it fires. Booster and Mira destroy Warp's mechanical arm after Booster lands on him. Buzz and Zurg face each other; Zurg thinks he has won, but Buzz and his three friends surround Zurg and pronounce him under arrest. Zurg escapes through a distraction. Booster and XR capture Warp and leap from Zurg's now-exploding tower. Mira uses her "ghosting" power to take Buzz to the core of the Uni-Mind and restore it to normal, freeing the suborned peoples and leaving Zurg momentarily helpless. The unity of the L.G.M. is restored and Warp is arrested.
Buzz, having at last admitted that he cannot work alone, creates a new team called "Team Lightyear" with XR, Mira and Booster (all newly decorated with Star Command's highest commendation). They fly to the galaxy and shout "To infinity and beyond!"

Andy's Room [ edit ]
Production [ edit ]
Set in the fictional universe of the Disney/Pixar film series Toy Story, the film inspired a line of Buzz Lightyear toys. The opening computer-animated sequence was created by Pixar, while the rest of the film was traditionally animated by Walt Disney Animation Japan, Walt Disney Television Animation and Walt Disney Video Premiere.[1] It was the only film spin-off of a Pixar film until 2013's theatrical Cars spin-off film Planes.
Tim Allen reprises his role as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, as do Wallace Shawn, R. Lee Ermey, Jeff Pidgeon, and Joe Ranft as Rex, Sarge, Squeeze Toy Aliens and Wheezy respectively. Woody is voiced by Jim Hanks, the younger brother of his original voice actor Tom Hanks (as Tom was too busy working on Cast Away), and Hamm is voiced by Andrew Stanton instead of John Ratzenberger. Originally, Patrick Warburton, (the TV series voice for Buzz), voiced Buzz for the film, but when it was released to video, his lines were redubbed by Allen. Slinky Dog makes a silent cameo due to Jim Varney's death on February 10, 2000.
When the movie was later edited into three episodes of the television show, the opening "Andy's Room" sequence was removed and Warburton's vocal performance replaced Allen's.

The continuing surge in the price of bitcoin has seen it climb to over $4,000 for the first time since the cryptocurrency was created in January 2009.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the average price of bitcoin across global exchanges today reached a height of $4,225 at 9:07 a.m. UTC, having opened at $3,917. At press time, the price had dropped slightly to $4,162.
The new record follows days in which bitcoin has been setting consecutive all-time highs following a relatively static period when prices sat at around $2,700. That lull indicated a cautious market in the approach to the bitcoin fork that created a new cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, on August 1.
Fears over the split, that some feared would lead to instability, now seem to be allayed, as indicated by the positive price moves since.
The total value of all cryptocurrencies has also set yet another new all-time high, with the combined market capitalization now sitting at over $137 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. That figure is $11 billion more than the previous high noted by CoinDesk just two days ago, when all crypto assets had a value of $126 billion.
While bitcoin has seen an over 10 percent increase in market cap in the past 24 hours, some other cryptocurrencies have seen increases of over 20 percent, including IOTA and neo, and others have even seen increases of around 30 percent, including decent, nexus and binance coin.
Not all cryptocurrencies have faired so well, though, with ethereum showing -4 percent for the last 24 hours, Ripple, -5.5 percent, and bitcoin cash, -8.2.

Story highlights The Iraqi air force killed more than 200 ISIS militants, according to Iraq state TV
U.S. may try to speak directly to Iran about deteriorating Iraq situation, senior U.S. officials say
Dozens of U.S. military personnel arrive at U.S. Embassy, a U.S. official says
Photos appearing online appear to show ISIS fighters executing Iraqi security forces
The Iraqi air force struck back at the militant group ISIS , the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, killing more than 200 militants, Iraqi state TV reported Monday morning. The air raids took place in Saqlawiyah, northwest of Fallujah, according to a graphic run by state TV.
ISIS has been ruthlessly fighting to take control of Iraq and has apparently posted chilling photos on jihadi Internet forums seeming to show the executions of Iraqi security forces.
CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the images purportedly posted by ISIS . CNN is examining the terrain in the images, some of the signage on buildings in several of the pictures and the uniforms of the apparent victims. Those details suggest the photos are real and were taken in Iraq.
A caption on some of the images reads: "apostates heading to their hole of doom."
ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group, wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. The group has had substantial success in Syria battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security forces.
On Friday, a tweet on what was claimed to be an ISIS Twitter account claimed that its members killed at least 1,700 Shiites. CNN was unable to verify the authenticity of the account, and the account appeared to have been taken down Sunday.

In a statement, the U.S. State Department condemned the claim by ISIS, also known as ISIL, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
"The claim by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) that it has massacred 1700 Iraqi Shia air force recruits in Tikrit is horrifying and a true depiction of the bloodlust that these terrorists represent. While we cannot confirm these reports, one of the primary goals of ISIL is to set fear into the hearts of all Iraqis and drive sectarian division among its people," part of the statement read. "Terrorists who can commit such heinous acts are a shared enemy of the United States, Iraq, and the international community. "
The militants' quick advance in Iraq has been helped by many Sunnis who feel that the Shiite-dominated government has marginalized them.
ISIS seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, last week and has threatened to march on Baghdad, Iraq's capital and largest city.
But "Mosul didn't fall," a defiant Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told military leaders in Baghdad in a speech televised Sunday on state TV. "The ones who have fallen are the politicians who have bet against Iraq." The Prime Minister said, "We will not allow anyone to divide the Iraqi people."
Al-Maliki called on his top brass and soldiers to march and fight against ISIS, while criticizing Iraqi politicians conspiring against their homeland and Iraqi soldiers who have refused to continue to fight when confronted by ISIS.
"We will march on every inch, with all our weapons, with all our will and faith, so we can liberate and cleanse every inch of Iraq -- from the southernmost point to the furthest point in the north," he exhorted the military leaders.
Despite al-Maliki's bold statements, ISIS accumulated several victories across Iraq on Sunday.
The northwest Iraqi city of Tal Afar fell to ISIS, according to Iraqi Gen. Mohammed al-Quraishi. Many Tal Afar residents -- ethnic minority Shiite Turkmen -- fled the fighting north toward Iraq's Kurdish region. Tal Afar is in Nineveh province, midway between the country's border with Syria and Mosul, north of Baghdad.
Before Iraqi security forces lost Tal Afar, several mortar rounds landed on a busy area in the town and killed at least seven and wounded 33 people, security officials in Baghdad and Tal Afar told CNN.
Also Sunday, ISIS gained control of two villages in Adhaim, in its first push into Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad.
On top of that, Iraqi security forces and gunmen believed to be ISIS clashed near al-Khalis, about 18 miles from Diyala's capital, Baquba, al-Khalis police officials told CNN. Three mortar rounds landed near a recruitment center opened recently for volunteers to help the Iraqi army fight against ISIS.
Baquba is about 37 miles northeast of Baghdad. Baquba is an ethnically-mixed city, though Sunnis represent a slight majority.
Given Baquba's proximity to Baghdad, if Baquba were to fall, it could give ISIS militants three-pronged access to Baghdad -- from Anbar province to the west, Ninevah and Salahuddin provinces to the north and from Diyala province from the northeast.
Meanwhile, on Sunday, CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon was in the Iraqi Kurdish province of Kirkuk, where last Thursday militants took control of two villages.
She asked the local governor, Dr. Najmaldin Karim, whether the United States should launch airstrikes to help fight back ISIS.
"I think they know how to do it, but blanket bombing is not going to work here," Karim said, explaining that that approach ignores the fact that ISIS is too blended into the civilian population in Kirkuk and innocent people could die. But there should be targeted bombing in both Iraq and Syria, he said.
"I don't think anyone is safe from these people," said Karim.
Partial staff relocation at U.S. Embassy
Between 50 and 100 U.S. Marines and U.S. Army personnel have arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, a U.S. official told CNN on Sunday.
A U.S official acknowledged to CNN that the additional embassy security personnel being added include U.S. Marines who specialize in embassy protection during high-threat conditions.
The U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. American military forces ended their withdrawal from the country in December 2011.
At the time of the U.S. drawdown, Iraq's leadership had agreed that a residual U.S. military presence was desirable, but the talks broke down over the prickly issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops in Iraq.
The Obama administration had said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers. But the Iraqis refused to agree to that, opening up the prospect of American troops being tried in Iraqi courts and subjected to Iraqi punishment.
This week, President Barack Obama continued to consider options with regard to the situation in Iraq but ruled out sending troops into the country.
On Sunday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that some U.S. security personnel will be added to the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other staff members will be temporarily relocated to consular offices in Basra and Irbil and to the Iraq Support Unit in Amman, Jordan.
A "substantial majority of the U.S. Embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place," Psaki said in a statement, and "the Embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission."
Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said that a "small number of Defense Department personnel" are augmenting State Department security assets in Baghdad. Kirby said that the relocation of some embassy personnel is being done with commercial, charter and State Department aircraft flights.
The U.S. military can airlift people if the State Department asks for that, Kirby said.
The State Department is warning U.S. citizens against "all but essential travel to Iraq." The official travel warning says U.S. citizens in Iraq "remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence."
While that continues, Iran has recently entered the fray, according to a senior security official in Baghdad who spoke to CNN on Friday. That official said that in recent days, Iran has sent about 500 Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops to fight alongside Iraqi government security forces in Iraq's Diyala province.
However, Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani , denied reports that some of its elite forces are in Iraq to help bolster al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite.
"If the Iraqi government wants us to help, we will consider it," Rouhani said, according to an English translation of his remarks Saturday in Farsi by state-run Press TV.
But, he said, "so far they have not asked specifically for help," and added that Iran could give strategic guidance if requested.
The Obama administration is exploring possible direct talks with Iran over the deteriorating situation in Iraq, two senior U.S. officials tell CNN.
Both officials ruled out any type of teaming up with Iran because the United States and Iran don't have a lot of common interests -- other than a stable Iraq.
The United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence in Iraq. The Shiite Iranian regime is al-Malaki's closest ally in the region. Additionally the administration is concerned appearing to team up with Iran would both alienate Iraq's Sunni majority and worry Sunni allies of the United States in the region.
The State Department statement said the United States "will do its part to help Iraq move beyond this crisis," and a senior State Department officer told CNN that Kerry spoke to his counterparts from Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to discuss the threat posed by ISIS.
The administration has not yet determined what the mechanism would be for talking to Iran, the senior U.S. officials said.
Ex-U.S. ambassador: Kerry should go to Iraq
On Sunday U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham argued on CNN's "State of the Union" for more intervention in Iraq.
The South Carolina Republican, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy, called Obama "stubborn-headed," "delusional" and "detached" over his decision on how to react to the unfolding crisis.
"Time is running out to turn this around," Graham said. "Get involved with air power. Stop the march toward Baghdad. Deal with Syria. But get a new government (in Iraq) in place as quickly as you can that will bring the Iraqis back together for a counteroffensive."
Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that he thinks Secretary of State John Kerry should fly to Iraq immediately.
"We need the secretary of state out there in Baghdad right now," Crocker said. "We need the President on the phone to the Iraqi leadership because the reality is the Iraqis are not in a position ... they were not in a position when I was there, they are not in a position now, to work out hard compromises on their own."
The United States is the "middleman among Sunni, Shia and Kurds," Crocker said. "Ambassadors can go just so far."
Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University, said he would support "very carefully targeted airstrikes" in conjuction with high-level diplomacy.
"We have got to help the Iraqis come together," Crocker urged, "in a unified fashion to confront a common threat."
The wave of a hand is a simple gesture, often overlooked. Multiply it by 70,000, though, and you can warm the heart of an ailing child, bring a tear to the eye of a nation and create a tradition. Krista Young and Levi Thompson combined to create one such magical moment in Iowa City.
Krista was inspired by images of the new Stead Family Children's Hospital, which overlooks Kinnick Stadium, home of the Iowa Hawkeyes. “It's such a great view of the stadium,” she says. “The patients can see everyone in the stands and wave to them.” So, why not have the fans wave back, she thought on a whim. On a second whim, she shared the first with Levi Thompson, who manages a Facebook page called Hawkeye Heaven.
“I thought it was an awesome idea and decided I would push for it,” Levi says. Throughout the summer, he posted photos of the hospital and the view from the top, with a request for fans to turn and wave between the first and second quarters. By the day of the home opener, he says, his posts had earned more than 2 million views “so I had a good feeling it was going to work.” Krista wasn't quite so sure, especially since the university had not promoted the wave and made no announcement at the end of the first quarter. “I assumed groups here and there might do it.” But she watched “in total amazement” when all 70,000 fans turned toward the hospital, raised their arms and waved to the children.
“The best part is that it was organic,” says Levi, an Air Force veteran. “No one had to tell anyone what to do in the moment.” Levi was besieged with videos from fans waving in the stands and from the families of patients in the hospital as the kids saw the wave, and waved back. “You can hear them saying how amazing it was,” he says. “You can hear in their voices that they were choked up.” He posted them — and choked up voices across the country. “I wouldn't say I was surprised it happened. But I'm surprised at the level it reached,” he says of ESPN, CBS and the Big Ten Network spreading the story.
At this point, though, Krista and Levi had yet to meet. “When I started getting asked about it, I didn't even know her name and didn't know if she wanted her name out there. I had to go back and find out who she was. She said she was glad it worked out, so I started mentioning her.” Both were the special guests in late September of Bruce Herrald, president of the University of Iowa, at the first night game of the season. Levi decided to kick it up a notch by asking fans to turn on their phone flashlights, turn and wave. This time, Krista knew the fans would respond. “You could hear the crowd getting anxious, saying, ‘It's almost time. Get your phone ready.' And then it was gorgeous.” The image again spread beyond Iowa City, across the nation.
Patients call it “a wave of hope” and “life-changing.” “I feel kind of silly getting all this attention because it's a simple idea,” she says. “The fans took hold of it and made it happen.” She's right on one hand: The success of Krista's and Levi's campaign is a testament to the power of social media. But it's also a reminder of the power of that little voice inside each of us, urging us toward a small act of kindness.
Maine's secretary of state Sunday denounced what he characterized as an effort to discourage students at Bates College from voting in Tuesday's election.
Secretary of State Matt Dunlap said a flier that began circulating Sunday on the Bates campus in Lewiston suggesting students would be required to register their motor vehicle and update their driver's license in order to vote was false.
“Your status as a student is a neutral factor in exercising your right to vote,” Dunlap said Sunday night. “If you are residing in a community while matriculated as a student and wish to vote, you can do so.”
Dunlap explained that once individuals consider themselves to be residents of a community, they will eventually need to take steps, such as updating their driver's license or registering their motor vehicle. But he added “there are no statutory triggers that take place that compel you to pay excise taxes immediately on your vehicle in that town.”
The Maine Democratic Party also weighed in on the controversy, referring to the Bates fliers in a news release Sunday evening as an attempt at “voter suppression.”
“The false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote. There is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their driver's licenses in order to vote,” Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said. “In fact, the Secretary of State's Office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a student's legal voting residence and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting.”
The flier, which was discovered Sunday by Bates student Sarah Frankie Sigman at the Commons, Bates' dining hall, said those who choose to register to vote in Lewiston must pay to change their driver's license and re-register their motor vehicle within 30 days – a process the flier's author claims could cost a student “usually hundreds of dollars in total” when the cost of a state motor vehicle inspection is added in.
“Would like to call attention to the 30 plus disgusting signs my friends and I removed from the dining hall and the doors of a dorm this afternoon. If you see any more please take them down and if you see someone putting them up call Bates security,” Sigman wrote on her Facebook page. “You can register at the polls on Nov. 8 in Maine and Lewiston is a make or break district!”
Dunlap explained that voting in the election is entirely separate from registering a car or changing the address on one's driver's license.
“Voter registration is not affected by where you register your car,” Dunlap said in a telephone interview Sunday night. “This flier is pure politics. They're using it to try to scare college kids from voting.”
He said that all a Maine college student who is not from the community where he or she attends school has to do to vote is to register with the local city or town clerk.
In the case of a Bates student, the student would register with the Lewiston city clerk, who in turn would notify the clerk in the student's hometown that he or she had voted, eliminating what Dunlap called double-dipping.
A voting residence fact sheet published by the Maine Secretary of State's Office also lends clarity to the issue. It says college students have the right to register to vote in the municipality in Maine where they attend school.
“You can establish a voting residence at your Maine school address if you have a present intention to remain at that address for the time being, whether that address is a dorm, apartment, house or even a hotel,” the fact sheet says.
Kristen Muszynski, spokeswoman for the Maine Secretary of State's Office, said in an email: “Students can choose to define their residency as either their school address or previous home address, whichever is the one they consider to best fit the definition of residency for their personal situation.”
Bates senior Ali Rabideau, from Natick, Massachusetts, has already voted in this year's presidential election – in Lewiston.
Rabideau lived in Lewiston last summer and considers Bates and the city her home, at least for the time being.
Voter suppression “has been a trend for a while here – people trying to dissuade students from voting in an election. We're pretty frustrated,” said Rabideau, who is co-president of the Bates College Democrats Club.
Jason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said some people have unfairly accused Republicans on social media of being behind the fliers. Savage said that is just not true.
“It makes no sense to accuse us of doing it. It is coming out of left field,” Savage said. “People are throwing daggers at us and we had nothing to do with it.”
Savage said the flier's claims are misleading.
“I don't think anyone has to change their driver's license to vote on Tuesday,” he said.

Our last European away game, in Rome, did not go well, but the Blues have bounced back since with a pair of excellent results, and two clean sheets for Courtois to enjoy too.
Speaking on the eve of our next challenge, in the depths of the Olympic Stadium in Baku where we will take on Qarabag, the goalkeeper noted differences for both teams since we met in September, starting with Chelsea following the defeat in Italy.
‘I think the biggest change was maybe like last season against Arsenal when we lost 3-0 as well,' Courtois said.
‘Maybe we were never fighting inside the game, or our mentality was not on point. We learned again in Rome we have to do it every game and maybe this year not 100 per cent, but 110 or 120 per cent to win those games.
‘Against Manchester United we showed if we have the mentality on point, and we play well, we win, and we win with good football. Against West Brom we had the same focus and will to do those extra metres. We have to continue doing that. I hope Rome was a learning point for everyone, and we continue having this focus throughout the season.'
Courtois then cast his mind back to our 6-0 victory against Qarabag and their subsequent, more impressive results in Europe.
‘The first game was their first in the Champions League. If you go to Chelsea, the champions, and maybe they were a bit [in awe]. We played a very good game as well, but I remember the first half was difficult for us.
‘After that they gave Roma a really tough game here, they drew twice against Atletico, so we know we face a difficult game.
‘They have changed a bit their tactics, they defend better, they have good strikers, and they are fast on the counter. I think they will give us the ball and try to make us make a mistake.
‘We are the favourites to win,' added Courtois. 'Our objective is to qualify tomorrow, so that means we have to win. For us it's important to start very strong, to try to score early to put the pressure on them, and then hopefully we can have a good game and take the three points back to London.'
The Belgian reported the players are staying on English time here, which is four hours behind local time, and that will serve them well not only tomorrow, but also at the weekend when we travel to Anfield. He added he had a ‘good siesta' on the long flight over and is feeling fresh, as was everyone at today's training session at the Bakcell Arena, a smaller venue than the one we will play in tomorrow.

At the turn of the 20th Century, Manchester United were far from the domineering trophy winners which we know today. Known by their founding name, Newton Heath LYR Football Club in the Victorian era, they were playing in the second division of the English football pyramid after only joining the official football league structure in 1892.
Newton Heath had remained in the second division for the majority of the clubs formative years but endured a tough period of financial difficulties during 1902 and 1903. A winding-up order had been set upon the club by then President, William Healey who had claimed he was owed around £242. Newton Heath were grappling with severe debt and still required around £2,700 in order to continue to operate and fulfil their fixtures for the season. By April 1903 four local businessmen had come together and stumped up the cash to save the club from liquidation.
John Henry Davies was named President and subsequently renamed Newton Heath, Manchester United Football Club. United played their first full season under the house-hold brand name which the world knows today in the 1902-1903 campaign.
Despite, being saved from liquidation and rejoining the football league under the new guise of Manchester United, the problems did not dissipate straight away. The Football Association suspended the club secretary (the club secretary was the name for the manager of the team), James West and team captain Harry Stafford for making illegal payments to players.
Ernest Mangnall was instated as club secretary for the start of the 1903-1904 season, much to the surprise of the United fan base. Mangnall was seen as a manager who built his teams around supreme physical fitness and camaraderie and believed that his team should only be given a football once a week. In this aspect, Mangnall personifies the original English coach of the twentieth century, subscribing to the philosophy of physique over technique.
However, Mangnall's methods were to prove very successful during his time at Manchester United. Club President, John Henry Davies was willing to give Mangnall the money to build a side and build he did. Mangnall spent a record transfer fee of £600 on centre-half, Charlie Roberts along with full-back, Tommy Blackstock and half-back, Alex Bell. He also acquired the attacking trio of John Picken, John Peddie and Charlie Sagar in the forthcoming seasons as he built a side to achieve promotion.
The most recognised formation for a team to employ back in the early days of footballs development was the 2-3-5 formation. This would consist of two full-backs playing in front of the goalkeeper which mirrors the modern day central defenders. In front of the defence there would be two half-backs and a centre-half, which in modern terms forms a central midfield three. Finally, there would be five forward players spread out across the attacking line, a left winger, a right winger, two inside forwards and a centre forward.
Tommy Blackstock was amongst Mangnall's first signings when he took over as United's club secretary in 1903. Born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland in 1882 he appeared for a number of clubs in his native country. Beginning his football career at Raith Athletic as a teenager, Blackstock had shown particular promise, blossoming into an impressive full-back and catching the eye of Cowdenbeath. A season with the Miners saw Blackstock continue his development and once again he found himself under the admiring gaze of another club. Leith Athletic recognised young Balckstock's promise where he then spent a further two seasons, showing all of his early promise and becoming a popular player.
Blackstock's performances in Scotland had caught the eye of those across the border in the south and Mangnall brought him to United in 1903. The young Scotsman didn't make any real impression during his initial years at Manchester United, spending most of his time playing in the reserves he made a total of 13 appearances for the first team from 1903 to the end of the 1904-1905 season. However, he was to make his breakthrough to the first team in the following campaign.
Blackstock proved to be one of the stalwart full-backs of the Manchester United side which won promotion to the first division in the 1905-1906 season. Not only did United win promotion, they also conceded only 28 goals, boasting one of the strongest defences in the league, demonstrating their strong defensive work ethic facilitated by Mangnall's focus on the physical condition of his players. Blackstock made 21 appearances during that campaign alongside fellow full-backs, Bob Bonthron and Dick Holden.
The team scored a total of 90 goals that season, finishing as joint top scorers with league winners Bristol City. Picken, Peddie and Sagar scored 54 goals between them as they finished runners-up. United were on the up, boasting a set of ruthless front-men all with prolific goal records and a strong, almost immovable defence. Blackstock, still in his early twenties, seemed to have a long and successful career ahead of him at the heart of Manchester United's defence.
After such a successful season on a personal level and winning promotion to the first division, it was unfortunate the Blackstock found himself out of the side the following season, making only a handful of appearances for the first team and spending most of his time back in the reserve side. It is likely that Blackstock was ousted from the side by new full-back Herbert Burgess who was signed with a host of players from local rivals Manchester City. Funded by John Henry Davies, these included the forward, Sandy Turnbull; inside forward, Jimmy Bannister and the £500 star-forward, Billy Meredith.
The Scotsman, Blackstock, still only 25-years-of-age was left in the reserves to prove his worth to the first team when called upon. He made only three league appearances in that season, a 1-2 victory away at Stoke City, a 2-4 defeat at home to Bury and a 0-0 home draw with Liverpool. He also made an FA Cup appearance in a 2-2 draw away to Portsmouth. However, his season was to be cut short in the most tragic of circumstances.
Blackstock's final match was for the United reserve side against St. Helens Recreation FC in the Manchester suburb of Clayton on 8th April 1907. With only ten minutes of the game played and with no one around him, the Scot headed the football and subsequently collapsed to the ground, laying unconscious on the field of play. He was carried off the pitch and into the dressing room but his state had deteriorated and he was pronounced dead.
The strange circumstances surrounding Blackstock's death were to continue throughout the inquest. The Manchester Evening Courier reported that he had died of ‘natural causes' after the Manchester City Coroner had concluded his inquiry. The Dundee Courier also reported that Doctors had said there were no internal injuries and that there was nothing physically wrong with Blackstock, further adding to the unexplained circumstances surrounding his death and the Evening Telegraph had reported that it seemed that there was “little occasion to place any great strain on the heart.”
Blackstock's death was eerily similar to that of Leeds City centre forward, David Wilson who collapsed and died of heart failure in a match against Barnsley in October 1906. However, as the game against St. Helens had only been under-way for around ten minutes, heart failure seemed an unlikely cause of death.
The Manchester Courier and Lancashire Central Advertiser also reported a similar story, comparing Blackstock's death to Wilson's. However, the papers also stated it had been almost impossible to fully determine the causes of his death and suggested that it may have been a fatal seizure after heading the ball. The official verdict still reads as ‘death by natural causes.'
Blackstock's body was returned to his home-town, Kirkcaldy for the funeral procession which ran from his father's residence to the New Cemetery on 11th April 1907. Many of the local, well-known gentry attended the funeral, along with teammates, club officials, fellow professional players, close friends and family.
His death was both tragic and unfortunate and the treatment of his family after his death only added to the pain already suffered as United had withheld the insurance money that was rightly due to his next -of-kin. However, if football as a whole took any positive out of his untimely passing then it has to be the establishment of the Association Football Players Union (AFPU) which was set-up by several of Blackstock's team-mates in wake of the treatment of his family. Meredith, Roberts, Sagar, Burgess and Turnbull, sparked by the controversy over Blackstock's insurance money, all collaborated to form the AFPU, a forerunner to today's Professional Footballers' Association (PFA).
There was a lot of praise reserved for Blackstock by many of those in the football community at the time. His manager, Ernest Mangnall was shaken by the events and he held particular praise for Blackstock during his time playing professional football for Manchester United, stating that he trained harder than any other player despite spending much of his time in the reserves and he was one of the favourites around the squad.
An obituary by Mr J. J. Bentley, a co-founder of the Football League, in the Evening Standard on 10th April 1907 also spoke highly of Blackstock. Bentley spoke of Blackstock as a cultured individual having experienced life in foreign countries like Australia and also an intelligent young man who could recount the particulars of the Russo-Japanese war which had broken out in 1904.
Bentley also referred to the last game he saw Blackstock play for the United first team against Liverpool. The full-back put in a heroic defensive performance, flinging himself in-front of the Liverpool forwards and putting his body on the line to help his team to capture a 0-0 draw.
The game epitomised Blackstock as a player in a staunch, defensive performance reminiscent to that of the 1905/1906 promotion season which was the highlight of his career.

Have you ever had issues hitting and executing sites on de_inferno? Inferno is a map that the terrorist can use to keep the counter-terrorist side guessing until the last few seconds of a round. Having a good terrorist side is essential for winning games on this map and can make it a lot harder for your opponents to win this counter-terrorist sided map. In today's blog, I'm going to break down basic positions, smokes, and executes that will help you stay dominant and break the counter-terrorist side's economy. It will lead to easier rounds and a better chance of success.
Positioning and executing
When it comes to positioning on the terrorist side of inferno, slowly spreading out and probing the map is usually the best default setup on this map. Taking mid and apartment control will help you assess how aggressive the counter-terrorists are playing and where they are setting up their crossfires and choke points. This is what the beginning of your default should look like:
As you can see here, you will want to split up and probe around the map to gather information. This setup can be powerful, because it will allow you to hit either bombsite relatively quickly once you have identified where the counter-terrorist rotator is. Player 1 will be throwing smokes and flashes up mid, forcing the rotator out of position towards bombsite B. So, the A bombsite will be easier to take. Players 1, 4, and 5 will execute on A. They will take full mid and arch control, cutting off anyone trying to rotate from B. This is the positioning your team will want to take after mid control has been gained.
Once you are successfully in these positions and have full middle control, you still do not have to hit the A bombsite. Having control of these positions will usually force the enemy counter-terrorist team to rotate from the B bombsite. Either coming down banana or through CT spawn, the site you end up hitting usually depends on where you have gotten picks executing this setup. Say, in this scenario, you get to these positions and you realize that two counter-terrorist players are playing really passive on the A bombsite. And, player 3 happens to frag two rotators out of B. Players 4 and 5 will rotate down mid and hit banana with player 3, while player 1 and 2 can wrap on the B bombsite or cut off the A rotators. Since two of the players at bombsite B have already been fragged, you know that there can only be one enemy player at B max. This is what to execute should look like if your lurker gets to rotate frags.
If executed properly, this default setup will be really hard for the counter-terrorist to counter. It's slow and methodical. I would recommend running it until you identify that the counter-terrorist team tries to counter, in which case, hard rotating to the B bombsite should counter any stack they might set up on A if you spot it. Like always, communication is key:
Proper smokes and flashes are key to success when executing
When it comes to smoking off choke points in inferno on terrorist side, there are a lot of smokes that are not very difficult. I will break down the spots that should be smoked when executing as a team onto either site. Here's a image of the map and what spots should be smoked off during a bombsite A take:
The goal of smoking off these positions on the A bombsite is to isolate the defending CT player in the pit. Sometimes even two players might be positioned there and isolated. This will allow you time to clear the bombsite and take after plant positions with crossfires set up to deal with the pit player. When it comes to smoking off the B site, there are two essential spots that should always be smoked — especially when entering the site from banana. Here's another example of what spots should be smoked off, but for the B bombsite:
These smokes are really simple to hit on the B bombsite. Terrorist 4 should also throw a flashbang over into the site. Also, when taking B — if you have thrown your smokes and flashes — you need to commit all 3 players, sometimes 4. Even if your flash banged or you think you might die, trust that your teammates can pick up the trades and win the round.
Practice makes you perfect!
Learning these simple strategies takes time, but at higher ranks, these defaults will become mandatory. Learning these default smokes will also be essential but I'll save that for another blog.
First Look Media — the newly formed media venture from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and Glenn Greenwald — is beginning to take shape, with the first of a series of digital magazine to be launched in "coming weeks," according to Omidyar.
The company announced in a video Monday that the company structure will center around a flagship First Look outlet, backed up by a variety of semi-autonomous digital magazines led by particular journalists as well as a shared infrastructure of researches, fact checkers, data journalists and designers.
Media will take up a major portion of the new venture, but a separate technology company is also being started to provide First Look journalists with the newest tools for creating and distributing content.
"What's not included in the video is specific timing about some of our plans. We'll launch First Look Media's flagship news site later this year. There's a lot to be done between now and then, given we're creating a general interest news site that will cover topics ranging from entertainment and sports to business and the economy," Omidyar wrote in a blog post.
"That said, there's some news that just needs to get out and is too important to wait. In the coming weeks, we'll be launching the first of our digital magazines, publications that have an independent editorial voice and a unique look and feel, led by a visionary and experienced journalist or team of journalists. We'll share more about this soon."
"Rather than embedding technologies in the newsroom, we're building a technology company along side the newsroom," said Eric Bates, who joined First Look in November after leaving his role as executive editor of Rolling Stone. "We're going to be looking at how to build technology that tells stories and distributes new stories in different ways."
While First Look will include investigative journalism — Greenwald is just one of a series of high-profile journalists including Liliana Segura, Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras — the broader collection of media titles will span a variety of topics like entertainment and sports.
"I think that's very much a misperception. I think that's Glenn's work and his work will remain very much in the vain of what it's always been, but that's a piece of what we're doing," Bates said.
Omidyar, a billionaire who made his fortune by founding eBay, has taken on the role of philanthropist and entrepreneur, having started Peer News and the Honolulu Civil Beat. First Look is set to be his most ambitious project yet, having already committed $50 million.
While the structure of First Look has emerged, there is plenty that still needs to be figured out.
"We don't even have job titles at this point," Bates told Mashable. "We're all sort of doing everything."
First Look's flagship media product will launch later this year, Bates confirmed, along with the possibility of the launch of some of the more focused digital magazines.
However the company is not in a particular rush, Bates added.
"It's so rare to get an opportunity not only to build something from the ground up, but to build it without the pressure of producing content on a daily basis," Bates said. "Whatever we have up and running, that day will come soon, in the meantime It's nice to have the breathing room to step back and think about all these issues that you're raising without having to feed the daily beast."
Newcastle Jets Westfield W-League coach Craig Deans has announced five (5) new players for the club's 2015/16 campaign.
Dean has boosted his squad with a mix of familiar faces from the Jets Westfield W-League's previous seasons as well as some fresh faces.
Gema Simon who captained the squad in 2013/14, returns to Newcastle from her time last season with Melbourne Victory, confirming that playing in front of a home crowd was one of the biggest factors in her return.
‘You can't beat playing in front of your family, friends and a Novocastrian crowd here in Newcastle,' Simon said. ‘This was a major factor in my return, along with coming home and being closer to my family, something which I know allows me to play at my best.'
Simon is joined by another former Jet in Adriana Jones, who returns to the Jets after last playing with them in the 2013/14 season. Deans described Jones as another exciting local product, with great versatility and able to play anywhere in the front third.
Simon and Jones will be joined by three new faces to the Jets squad, including former New Zealand international Hannah Bromley, former Sydney FC youngster Chloe Logarzo and Jenna Kingsley, whose previous Westfield W-League clubs have included the Central Coast Mariners and more recently Western Sydney Wanderers.
‘Bromley will be a pivotal defender in the backline,' Deans said of the tall, intimidating Kiwi. ‘She has had 12 international appearances for New Zealand and will bring a wealth of experience to the side.'
‘Logarzo is a dynamic midfielder, who I am looking to to bring some creativity and importantly goals to the side. She has been on the fringe of national selection for some time and I'm hoping that this will be a strong motivator for her to do well with the Jets this season and secure a national spot as a result.'
‘Jenna will also add a lot to the side with her past Westfield W-League experience and she shares a positive and motivated work ethic that melds well with her teammates this season,' Deans concluded.
Although keeping his cards close to his chest, Deans confirmed today that the clubs final signings for the season, two internationals, will be revealed later this week, with his full complement of players making their first public appearance at the new Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility on Saturday for the sides Community Season Launch from 10am to 2pm with players involved in signing sessions and skills sessions for young female players.
BILOXI, M.S. — Donald Trump at a rally Saturday pledged to "veto" any executive action taken by President Barack Obama on gun control, and also blamed the president's administration for the creation of the terror group ISIS.
At the rally, Trump did not mention a terror group's propaganda video distributed Friday that used some of his remarks about Muslims.
The rally, Trump's first in Mississippi, and which drew about 13,000, began just hours after reports that protesters upset over the execution of a Shiite cleric set fire to the Saudi Arabian embassy in Tehran.

"They're burning down the Saudi embassy, you see that? Now, what that is, is Iran wants to take over Saudi Arabia — they always have," Trump said. "They want the oil, OK, they've always wanted that."

Trump has said the U.S. should have seized Iraqi oil fields. He appeared to refer to those statements, Saturday, without naming a country.
"Everyone said, 'Oh, I can't do that, this is a sovereign country," Trump said. "There is no country, they have a bunch of dishonest people, they've created ISIS — Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama." Trump did not elaborate on the ISIS claim.
At Saturday's rally, Trump did not mention a recruitment video from Somali-based terror group al Shabaab that used a clip of the candidate's statements on barring Muslims from entering the U.S.

But Trump did discuss the video with CBS, which published an excerpt of an interview with “Face the Nation” moderator John Dickerson set to air Sunday.
"Look there's a problem. I bring it up," Trump said in the CBS interview. "Other people have called me and they say, 'you have guts to bring it up because, frankly, it's true but nobody wants to get involved. Now people are getting involved."
A member of the crowd at the Saturday's rally, when told of the terror recruitment video, was skeptical. "I don't believe it. I don't believe it at all," Sam Western, 32, of New Orleans, said.
Trump also criticized President Barack Obama's possible upcoming executive actionon gun control, calling it an "assault on the 2nd Amendment." Obama could expand background checks to gun shows, and has expressed his frustration that those on no-fly lists are allowed to buy firearms.
"[Obama] can't do that," Trump said. "I will veto that. I will unsign that so fast, so fast," he said.

Trump also hit a new favorite target of his: President Bill Clinton. Trump attacked him for paid speeches that he described as a conflict of interest with Hillary Clinton's role as Secretary of State.
"Her husband was paid a fortune for speeches paid by people that were doing business with the State Department and paid millions of dollars. It was a big editorial today. Think of it. Folks, that's our system,” Trump said.
As he has done in recent speeches as voting draws near, Trump issued a call to get out and vote.
"We can't take the chance," Trump told the excited crowd, saying that whatever is going on in their lives they must get to a polling place. "Even if your wife says she's leaving you, I don't care. You gotta get out and vote."
Touchpads and trackballs are both viable alternatives to a mouse, allowing users to manipulate an onscreen cursor intuitively and accurately. However, trackballs are a comparatively rare sight on both business and consumer laptop hardware, with the vast majority of manufacturers preferring to go with the touchpad. Looking at the reasons behind the touchpad's dominance of laptop control mechanisms gives a useful insight into the ways that users interact with electronic devices.
Comparison Although both devices are used for the same purpose, the touchpad and trackball differ widely in their use. A trackball can be thought of as an upturned mouse ball with surrounding buttons. You move the pointer on the screen by rotating the ball, and click as you would with a mouse. A touchpad, on the other hand, is a section of the laptop surface which is sensitive to finger movements. You move the onscreen pointer by touching the pad and swiping with your fingers.
Ergonomics One advantage touchpads have over trackballs is their construction. A touchpad consists of a few thin layers of capacitive material, while a trackball uses physical contacts to detect the movement of its ball. As such, touchpads can be made thinner than even small trackballs, and do not protrude from the laptop chassis itself. This makes them especially well suited to ultra-thin laptops such as the MacBook Air and Intel's Ultrabook platform, which are usually designed to save space and reduce weight in every way possible.
Multi-Touch Many touchpads allow for some form of multi-touch or gesture-based input. A multi-touch touchpad is one that can recognize the contact of more than one finger at a time. This allows you to perform fairly complex actions -- such as zooming in or out and scrolling up and down a page -- using nothing but the touchpad, and without having to click on a separate onscreen element. However, the trackball has no equivalent feature, relying on traditional mouse-style commands to operate.
Buttons Although some touchpads do have physical buttons to click, many do not. Actions such as left-clicking and right-clicking are achieved by tapping a specific area of the pad. This increases flexibility, as it allows you to configure the “buttons” on their touchpad to your own personal preferences. For example, one user might prefer a simple left-click and right-click arrangement, while another might elect to have the bottom of the pad act as a “middle mouse button.” Trackballs, on the other hand, always require physical buttons to operate.

The Obama administration is off to a good start on civil liberties when it comes to Guantanamo , reviving some hopes of due process and the possibility that arrest by federal agents will less frequently result in people dangling by their thumbs. President Obama is also making the right noises on medical marijuana . But gun owners are more than a bit concerned that their rights will be ridden over roughshod during the next few years. While there's no sure way of heading off government action, it is possible to evade and sabotage the enforcement of restrictive laws. Specifically, gun owners should continue to acquire and distribute the know-how for making their own guns.
Gun owners' concerns may well be justified; President Barack Obama has a history of hostility to private ownership of firearms and Attorney General Eric Holder went so far as to sign on to former Attorney General Janet Reno's amicus brief (PDF) in the case of D.C. v. Heller, opposing the position that the Supreme Court finally adopted: that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. There are already a couple of long-shot gun control measures circulating in Congress, including H.R. 45, a licensing and registration measure.
But laws are only as good as their enforceability -- a lesson that politicians need to take to heart in a country where 42.4% of the population has smoked illicitly cultivated grass decades after marijuana was outlawed, and where Prohibition was a moonshine-soaked failure. If self-defense-rights activists want to preserve their liberty, they need to continue battling in legislatures and the courts, but they should also take steps to make sure that gun laws are unenforceable -- that bans on firearms are countered by the equivalent of homebrew, moonshine and speakeasies.
This isn't exactly reinventing the wheel. Underground weapons manufacturing is a major business in places as far apart as the Philippines and Pakistan. VBS.tv offers a fascinating video tour of firearms and ammunition manufacturing and sales under remarkably crude conditions in the tribal areas of Pakistan. In the market there, gunsmiths turn out everything from muzzleloaders to hand-crafted Lewis guns and AK-47s in facilities less well-equipped than the average American home workshop.
So, where do you start? Well, you need plans, of course. You could copy an existing firearm, like those Pakistani craftsmen do, or like the World War II-era Polish resistance and pre-independence Israelis did when they churned out vast quantities of Sten guns. Or you could acquire plans purposely created for home manufacturing. Yes, they exist. And one of the better known sources for such plans is Philip A. Luty.
Probably the best endorsement for Luty's designs is that at least one of them works. We know it works because he went to prison in Britain for building a working copy from the design he published in the book, Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun. The book was written as a rejoinder to the British government's restrictive laws regarding firearms, and the powers-that-be didn't appreciate the rebuttal.
The time behind bars seems to have just ticked him off, since Luty, now free, is the proprietor of The Home Gunsmith Website, which offers several free plans for simple, improvised firearms. The site also offers plans for more complicated weapons for sale. And should the authorities get clever and decide to restrict ammunition ... well, Luty now offers a book for sale on how to improvise that, too.
It should be noted that, given Luty's ex-con status and the relatively close scrutiny under which he certainly operates these days, his more-recent designs have probably not been test-fired as diligently as the original. So, caveat emptor.
The point here isn't that setting up underground firearms bazaars is an adequate substitute for living with a government that knows its limits and respects our rights. It's that the means exist for rendering restrictive laws impotent and pointless. Short of turning your basement into a reproduction of the Ayalon Institute, the best use for simple gun plans may be to mail them to members of Congress as evidence that Americans are prepared to short-circuit their most draconian efforts. Imagine how much grief and blood could have been spared if pre-Prohibition legislators had been buried under such a weight of homebrew recipes that they'd conceded the point that a ban on alcoholic beverages was destined to fail.
Well, OK. Such an effort is unlikely to elicit rational thought in the minds of government officials. But it's a low-cost approach that just might have some effect. And the effort would help in developing and distributing effective plans that would ensure the ultimate failure of legal restrictions on the means for self defense.
Besides, it's just pretty nifty to have plans for building your own submachine gun.

Nicky Butt believes Manchester United's famous youth system is pointing in the right direction again.
Just over six months ago the Reds' treble-winning midfielder was appointed as the club's new Head of Academy.
Butt's remit from executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was to oversee a root-and-branch review and overhaul of the department that had developed generations of talent - from Matt Busby's Babes, the core of the 1968 European Cup winning team and Butt's own Class of '92 eras that engineered United most famous campaign in the club's history in 1999.
There were claims that the academy was in a mess and ailing, a criticism Butt vehemently denied on his appointment as Brian McClair's successor last February.
It was, however, recognised that the Old Trafford conveyor belt - and facilities - needed an update.
Half a year on and United's academy is deep into its modernisation.
“We are getting there with the revamp. Slowly but surely,” 41-year-old Butt told M.E.N Sport. "We have a lot of new people now in new roles. That will take time to bed in.
“Around the Aon Complex itself we are generating new pitches, better facilities. We are going in the right direction but it takes time to do such a massive job.
“It is not a sea change because the academy at Man United has done the right thing by players here for a long, long time and we have always got players into the first team and been equally successful getting players careers at other clubs.
“It is not a massive big change of direction but it was a case of steadying the ship. We had just veered off course a little bit but we are pointing back in the right direction.
“To be honest with the great success we have had in getting kids to realise their dreams of becoming professional footballers maybe we had pushed a lot of things to one side because we thought we were doing it right.”
The Premier League's Elite Players Performance Plan (EPPP) means clubs are scrutinised every three years.
The Reds passed the last audit to remain an Category One elite academy.
However, Butt says not everything was correct.
“We had the audit and they flagged up a lot of things,” he said. “Even though we were doing a lot of things right by the players in getting them to the correct end product, you have to have the right tick boxes along the way. Maybe we weren't so great in that.
“But we passed with flying colours which is really good for the club. Now we can get back to doing what we do the best and that is developing players.”
To that end United have appointed a whole raft of new youth coaches to lead their youngsters from the clubs age nine group upwards.

“We have more support staff, more analysts, more psychologists, more sports science guys for all ages. I couldn't tell you how many but I know there isn't as much space in the changing rooms!”
The Reds' scouting network has also undergone a major revamp programme.
“Recruitment of players is a massive juggernaut on its own,” added Butt.
“We were not missing out on countries but in years gone by you maybe had one scout in each country, or two, but the way it is with young players now as soon as a kid does well there are about five or six clubs on him straight away.
“You just need to get yourself in the right position if the new Ronaldo, or the new Marcus Rashford comes along. He could be in Longsight or Buenos Aires or anywhere in the world. You just have to be there ready.
“If you have people around the world who can spot them and find them then you are in the right position. All our worldwide scouts come to Carrington twice a year and it is a big operation.
“I don't think we have ever rested on our laurels. If you don't move on and you stand still then you die. We are kicking on.”

New Arbat was initially included in the Moscow construction development plan in 1935. The idea was to build a road connecting Kremlin and the famous Rublevka area where most of the communist party elite had their country side residencies. They simply needed a modern highway that they could use to travel between Kremlin and their dachas. The original name of the street was Kalinin Prospekt, named after one of the revolution leaders Mikhail Kalinin. The name was changed to Noviy Arbat during the post-soviet period in 1994.
Today New Arbat is one of the busiest streets of Moscow full of cafes and restaurants. It has recently gone through a major renovation. One of its key objectives was to make this central avenue more pedestrian friendly.
The construction works have finally completed in summer of 2017. Some of the major changes include wider sidewalks, improved night lighting and more public areas with benches and swings.
Three architecture bureaus were involved in the project: Topotek 1 from Germany, Strelka Architects and Tsimailo Lyashenko & Partners from Russia. By the way, New Arbat has two sides. Most of the restaurants and cafes are located on the odd side.
One of the things you'll see after starting to walk along the renovated Noviy Arbat is the wooden 150 meters (492 feet) long bench.
It has plenty of space to sit down for anyone. At first they wanted to build it using granite as the construction material. Later they decided to use wood because sitting on a stone bench in winter is not a very good idea…
New Arbat Notable Buildings
Praga Restaurant
Praga restaurant is located in the beginning of Novy Arbat close to the Arbat subway station. The restaurant occupies the whole building that was built in 17th century. During soviet times this was the most expensive restaurant in Moscow. It's main clientele was mostly Russian elite and it was impossible to get a table there. Even if it was more open to general public, not too many people would afford to have a meal there anyways.
Moscow Book Store (Moscow House of Books)
Moscow Book Store on New Arbat was opened in 1967. It occupies the total space of 5,000 square meters (almost 54,000 square feet) that made it the biggest book store in USSR and one of the biggest ones in Europe at that time. Today Moscow Book Store remains to be one of the major book stores in Moscow that holds more than 200,000 books.
By the way in 2015 The Moscow Times named Moscow House of Books among the “Top 5 Bookstores for English Readers“. Every department of this book store has books written in English. The second floor of the famous store has lots of tourist books including travel guides and maps.
Oktyabr Movie Theater
Oktyabr Movie Theater is another notable building located on Novy Arbat. It was constructed in 1967 and named after October Revolution. What's remarkable about this building is it's façade decorated with a huge mosaic image made of natural stone and dedicated to Revolution.
Oktyabr Cinema was renovated in 2005 and became the main movie theater of Russia that typically hosts most of the major premiers. It has 11 halls, that include the main one that can seat up to 1518 guests.
Vesna Department Store
Vesna is a multi-brand department store that hosts most of the high fashion brands that include Chanel, Tom Ford, Jimmy Choo and many others. The building was decorated by the French artist Romain Froquet and has 4 floors: 2 underground and floors 2 above the ground.
New Arbat Hotels
Here are several decent hotel options located in the New Arbat area. The first one is Marriott Novy Arbat Moscow located slightly away from all the shops and restaurants. It is the first hotel in the city managed by Marriott Hotels & Resorts. Marriott Novy Arbat has 234 rooms and all traditional amenities of a typical 5-star hotel. You can reach Moscow City skyscraper district within 10 minutes by car.
The second option worth mentioning is called Lotte Hotel located at the intersection of New Arbat and “Garden Ring” road that goes around the central part of the city. Lotte Hotel features some high class facilities that include gym, Aldo Coppola hair salon and a restaurant managed by a Michelin-starred chef.
There are several more affordable options located closer to the busy part of the famous avenue. Brosko Hotel was opened in summer of 2018, so its very fresh inside. The amenities include a gym, sauna and a small swimming pool.
Novy Arbat Restaurants
There are lots of places to have a meal in the New Arbat area.
Here is a list of some of the restaurants I visit from time to time:
Kitayskie Novosti – a well-known restaurant in Moscow with genuine Chinese cuisine.
Barashka – a restaurant with eastern cuisine.
Obed Bufet – that's actually a buffet that has all kinds of dishes and cuisines. Good value for money!
21 Food Court – a more expensive version of Obed Bufet.
Black Star Burger – fast food chain co owned and promoted by a well-known Russian r&b artist.
Coffeemania – a more upscale restaurant and café chain that has a nice summer verandah on Novy Arbat.
In summer every restaurant opens its summer verandah.
Following one of the adjecent lanes toward Old Arbat street will transform you to the old Moscow Arbat neighborhood.
It's nice to walk around the area and explore real life of the city.
Krauthammer: Dems Getting 'Desperate' With Russia Allegations
Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) wife Jane Sanders has booked top notch lawyers to defend her against allegations of bank fraud.
The FBI launched an investigation into loans Sanders applied for when she was president of Burlington College, alleging that she lied to qualify for them.
A January 2016 complaint filed by Donald Trump's Vermont campaign chair, lawyer Brady Toensing, originally requested the investigation.
The complaint alleged that Mrs. Sanders lied on a 2010 loan application from People's United Bank for $10 million to expand Burlington's campus.

Sanders “successfully and intentionally engaged in a fraudulent scheme to actively conceal and misrepresent material facts from a federal financial institution,” the letter read.
Sanders claimed the institution had $2.6 million in pledges for the loan when it actually only received $676,000 worth of donations from 2010 to 2014.
A second letter in early 2016 spelled more trouble for the Sanders', accusing Bernie of pressuring the bank to accept the loan.
The senator has called the allegations "nonsense."
The unpopular former president of Burlington was eventually forced out by those angry about her mishandling of funds, which caused the school to go bankrupt last year.

Nothing is more important than balancing the budget with the least increase in taxes. The Federal Government should be in such position that it will need issue no securities which increase the public debt after the beginning of the next fiscal year, July 1. That is vital to the still further promotion of employment and agriculture. It gives positive assurance to business and industry that the Government will keep out of the money market and allow industry and agriculture to borrow the monies required for the conduct of business.
Frankly, that bears more than a passing resemblance to quite a bit of the Democrats' rhetoric on the economy, as well. And yet Hoover had an excuse: The economics profession had not yet advanced to the point where it knew what to during a liquidity trap. What's our excuse?

Implementing ObamaCare by Outsourcing Illinois Jobs to India
$71.4 million contract goes to a national leading outsourcing firm
CHICAGO- While everyone debates the policy points of ObamaCare, few understand that billions of dollars in IT contracts are wrapped inside the law. To meet federal mandates, states must upgrade their legacy Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS). These IT contracts are some of the largest awards in state history.
Last week, Illinois Governor Patrick Quinn became national news for circumventing a three year procurement process on up to $190 million in no-bid IT contracts. Now we find that one of the largest bid-contract MMIS awards will outsource state jobs to India.
In June, Illinois Governor Patrick Quinn's administration awarded a ten year $71.4 million staffing contract to Cognizant Technology Solutions. Cognizant ranks in the national top 10 for procuring H-1B visa workers. Evidence shows that the company is staffing operational headquarters in Chennai and Bangalore, India for the Illinois work.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday defended the unexplained sacking of top missile scientist and Defence Research and Development Organisation chief Avinash Chander, 15 months before the end of his tenure in May 2016.
"I believe DRDO should be headed by a younger man," Parrikar said, adding, "I had proposed for his removal and they have agreed to it." "My contention is simple. Such a senior post should not be held by somebody on contract," the Defence Minister said.
Meanwhile, sources in the Prime Minister's Office also denied any "ulterior motive" in Chander's removal and said they acted upon the recommendation of the Defence Ministry, which wanted a new and younger head for the DRDO.
The government on Tuesday evening removed Chander with the Appointments Committee of Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi "approving the termination" of his contract with effect from January 31, an official notification said.
Interestingly, Chander who was Secretary, Defence Research and Development cum Director General, DRDO and Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister, had retired on November 30 last year on attaining 64 years of age and was given a contract for 18 months till May 31 next year.
Analysts believe that the action could have been taken against the backdrop of Modi's comment that the 'laid back' attitude in the DRDO will not be tolerated that he made during a visit to the Bangalore facility last year.
§175, which forbade homosexual conduct in Germany (1872-1994) explicitly referred to men but not to women.
The reason for this is simple (hint: it's misogyny):
Men are real people with a real sexual orientation. Therefore their actions have to be restrained and punished via law.
Women don't have to be addressed specifically because if you don't like lesbians you just beat the shit out of them, force them into marriage, manipulate them emotionally until they fall into a depression or commit suicide, and cure them with rape.
Women who are not attracted to men? Not a thing.

Here are a couple of things I did not say:
- men had it so much better during WW2!!!11! Male privilege!1!!
- women should've been criminalized the same way men have been, because that's how equality works!!!!
.
I said the struggles of gays and the struggles of lesbians are fundamentally different and examining laws is one way to point that out.
It boggles my mind how people can deliberately misinterpret that to either say I'm a misogynist or that I hate gays.

After the execution of Charles I and up to the restoration of Charles II, England was for the first time without a monarch. The period between the two reigns, the interregnum, was an uneasy time during which the country was led by the deeply religious Oliver Cromwell. The Commonwealth was ahead of the times, but ultimately England rejected republicanism, and the restored monarchy survives to this day.

The World Turned Upside Down
Until Charles I overplayed his divine right to rule, few in England had questioned the monarchy. Several kings had been usurped and killed, but it always followed that a new king took the place of the previous one. In the recent past, the conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot had sought to remove James I, but there was no question of the country going without a monarch as they planned to replace him with his young daughter. When Charles I fell foul of his government and the New Model Army, he was tried and executed and his son fled into exile. The Grandees of the New Model Army did not seek a successor for the king but instead decided to change the rules and find a new method of government.
The Grandees were the senior officers of the New Model Army, largely drawn from the landed gentry. Chief amongst them was Oliver Cromwell, Sir Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell's son in law, Henry Ireton. The Grandees set about forcibly removing their opposition in the House of Commons using troops under the command of Colonel Thomas Pride. “Pride's Purge” left a smaller “Rump Parliament”. With control of the Rump Parliament, the Grandees were able to set up the trial of the King and after his execution, create a “Commonwealth and Free State”.
The Rump abolished not just the monarchy but the Privy Council and the House of Lords. In place of the Privy Council, the Rump established the English Council of State which was comprised of selected Members of Parliament. This body held the executive power and the Rump had legislative power. However, there was another power in the country that the Rump could not ultimately control: the Army.
The Army was kept busy in the period following the king's execution. There was a potential for invasion from Scotland, trouble in Ireland, and the threat of a Royalist uprising. Cromwell was occupied fighting the dangers that jeopardized the country, but by 1653 he had neutralized any threats. The Rump had done well in stabilizing the nation, but Cromwell was growing frustrated that the conservative members of the Rump had failed to call an election for a new parliament, preferring to cling on to the power that they had grabbed after the king's death. Cromwell decided to take the law into his own hands.
Cromwell was a member of the landowning gentry, whose military prowess had propelled him to the fore during the Civil Wars. His military reputation was a springboard to political power which was always exercised in accordance with his religious beliefs. He had undergone a religious conversion prior to the war, becoming a fervent yet liberal puritan. It was his strong belief that God had chosen the New Model Army to do His will and had guided them to victory. Once victory was achieved, he felt that he should capitalize by reforming “ungodly” elements in not only England's government and legal systems, but in society in general. Although he was keen to stamp out immorality he also supported what he termed “liberty of conscience” and so was tolerant of a diversity of Protestant groups as long as they did not force their views on others. His tolerance extended so far as to allow the Jews back into England but he was hostile towards Roman Catholics, persecuting them mercilessly in Scotland and Ireland.
On 20 April 1653, Cromwell moved to take power. He dissolved the Rump Parliament with the support of the Army. He was, for a time, a military dictator, ruling through an assembly chosen by Army officers. This assembly was commonly known as the Barebone's Parliament, after one of the members, Praise-God Barebones. The landed gentry ridiculed the assembly, considering it to be made up of the lowborn and puritanical, like the lay preacher Barebones. Formed in July 1653, the Barebones Parliament lasted until December of the same year. It was beset by in-fighting amongst various factions and rapidly became ineffective. Once again, Cromwell stepped in and drew the experiment to a close.
The Grandees next drew up the “Instrument of Government”. This was England's first written constitution and it granted executive power to a Lord Protector. The Lord Protector was to be elected and would hold the position for life. In addition, a parliament was to be called every three years. The Instrument of Government was adopted on 15 December 1653 with Cromwell being sworn in as Lord Protector on the next day.
The first Protectorate Parliament met in September 1654 but Cromwell dissolved it as swiftly as he could under the terms of the Instrument of Government as his proposed reforms did not find sufficient support with the MPs. Cromwell decided to rule through a military government. The country was divided into 11 districts, each governed by a Major-General who reported to Cromwell alone.
The rule of the Major-Generals lasted from August 1655 to January 1657. During this time, England was kept under tight control to prevent uprisings. Popular social gatherings, including cock-fighting, bear baiting and races were banned so as to prevent people meeting to plot against the regime. Similarly, inns were watched and sometimes shut down. Those with royalist sympathies were singled out for fines and the old clergy, both Anglican and Catholic, were banned from working as tutors or chaplains. There was some positive reform, such as allowing servants and apprentices a day off each month, but generally the country disliked the Army extending its influence into civilian life. Cromwell too was uneasy with military rule, but felt it necessary to maintain the peace of the country during troubled times. In September 1656, Cromwell called a second Protectorate Parliament and then withdrew his Major-Generals at the beginning of the following year.
The Parliament soon presented Cromwell with a new problem; they offered him the crown. He did not immediately dismiss the idea, taking six weeks to think it over. Cromwell knew that the country needed a strong ruler, whatever the title. However, he still needed the support of the Army and they were opposed to the monarchy so he turned down the offer. Instead, he was reaffirmed as Lord Protector in a ceremony that was redolent of a royal coronation. The Lord Protector's role and powers were extended and set out in the Humble Petition and Advice, which replaced the Instrument of Government as the constitution.
Cromwell tried to sweep away many of the cherished traditions and pastimes of the English, considering them unholy and immoral. As well as closing the bear and cock pits, theatres were closed and maypoles were cut down. Holy days were no longer allowed to be celebrated as festivals, but had to be quietly observed at church and with fasting. Soldiers patrolled the streets on Christmas Day and confiscated any celebratory meals. No work, even housework or walking anywhere other than to church, was banned on Sundays. Puritans would often inform on their less pious neighbours who would then be fined. As time rolled on, many found the changes unpalatable.
Cromwell died in 1658. His role as Lord Protector was not hereditary but he was allowed to name his successor and he passed his title to his son Richard. Unlike his father, Richard was not a soldier and consequently did not find favour with the Army. Discontent grew as republicans within Parliament started to attack the Protectorate as being too like a monarchy. Richard Cromwell lacked his father's decisiveness and managed neither to reassure the Army nor quash dissent in Parliament. By the spring of 1659, Richard was obliged to relinquish power and an attempt was made to re-establish the Commonwealth. Watching England descend into chaos from Scotland, Cromwell's old friend and comrade General Monck, governor of Scotland, had decided against supporting the ineffectual Richard. Instead, he threw his support behind the exiled King Charles II. Monck marched to London and organized the Convention Parliament which first met on 25 April 1660. An invitation was extended to Charles to return and he arrived in London on his birthday, 29 May.
Parliament declared that Charles had legally been the monarch since his father's execution, so technically there had been no interregnum. Charles continued to erase the memory of the Commonwealth by exhuming Cromwell from Westminster Abbey and having his head struck from the body, whereupon it was put on a spike and displayed for decades as a warning to traitors. The new king also confiscated coins bearing the former Lord Protector's image. All over the country there were people who were similarly keen to forget the past decade as for many it had turned into a gloomy time.
Legacy
Although the Commonwealth did not last, it did demonstrate that a country could operate without a monarch. The idea would reach maturity in the American colonies and later France. The British, however, prefer not to repeat the experience of a republic with the majority of the public still favouring the monarchy.
The freedom of conscience allowed by the Commonwealth saw new religious sects spring up. Many, like the Diggers and the Ranters died out but some, such as the Anabaptists and the Quakers, exist today.
Sites to Visit
There is a statue of Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament. It was erected in 1889 and such was his remaining unpopularity in Ireland that the Irish MPs blocked it being publicly funded.
One of Oliver Cromwell's homes still survives and has been recreated to show how his family would have lived. Oliver Cromwell's House, Ely is open every day except Christmas Day and Boxing Day.
After his head was taken from its spike, Cromwell's head passed through various owners until being buried in 1960 at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. A plaque marks the site.
Cromwell's wax death mask can be seen at the British Museum in London.

No One Bothered Telling James Franco He's In Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes By Mike Reyes Random Article Blend Rise of the Planet of the Apes turned out to be not only a good movie, but a great one, a sequel was pretty much guaranteed - especially since this was 20th Century Fox's second bite at refreshing the Ape apple following the "let's not even talk about it" effort from Tim Burton in 2001. Among those who benefited from the success of the film was its star, James Franco, who almost looked like he was going to torpedo his promising career with the stoner fantasy flop Your Highness in the same year. A lot of his credibility was restored with his portrayal of Dr. Will Rodman, the genius who accidentally brought upon the downfall of mankind. Much like how his character didn't mean to be the bearer of the apocalypse, Mr. Franco also apparently didn't mean to play a cameo role in upcoming sequel,
In the magazine's recently released Summer Preview issue, they mention a "posthumous cameo via video" for Dr. Rodman. When reached for comment by the publication, Mr. Franco had this to say:
"Wait, I have a cameo? I didn't even know that. You know, I don't even think they asked my permission to do that."
This means one of two things: either footage of Franco is going to be recycled from the film, or those of you who thought he was filming
It's a shame that Dr. Rodman had to die, as the writers could have executed an interesting plot twist by having him as the not only the singular human trusted by the apes, but maybe an important member of their society. Armchair speculation aside, this cameo is more than likely a legal repurposing of footage from Rise, much like Back to The Future Part II still had footage of Crispin Glover as George McFly in 1955. When Glover refused to come back and film a futuristic version of his character in a cameo, the producers got creative and hid another actor underage makeup. Just in case this wasn't enough to blur the difference, they also had him flipped upside down and wrote it off as the result of a clumsy accident. Seeing as Dr. Rodman liked to keep video logs of his work, the only clumsy accident they could use to blur the lines of legality are improperly calibrated recording devices. Good luck working that into the dialogue of a developing ape intelligence.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will be in theaters, hopefully without any clumsy accidents, on July 11th.

The skilled attack by Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner on a blond Danish peace activist in a kaffiyeh was spectacular. The senior officer's two agitated arms grasped the M-16 rifle as if it was an indivisible part of his body, and with an instinctive movement that might be expected from someone whose life was being threatened, landed it in the face of the person who dared to look him in the eye.
What luck that the belligerent Viking toppled over, thereby signaling his defeat. A recognized sign in the jungle. The frightened officer let him be. What a shame! Had he continued his assault, this could have been an excellent kill scene for a new series in National Geographic. Perhaps under the title "Annihilation."
On the face of it, this is a political story in which a group of pro-Palestinian peace activists tries to convince an occupying power to behave in decent fashion toward those occupied. But there is nothing political here. When a country behaves as if it is a nature preserve where the species living in it feel they are in danger of extinction, it is a simple anthropological story.
Anyone who wants to visit a gorilla preserve in Uganda, for example, knows what the restrictions are. The visitor must provide a certificate showing that he is not sick, and curious tourists are permitted only to visit in small groups and must leave the preserve in less than 24 hours. Tourists who go to the nature preserves in Tanzania know that it is forbidden to leave their vehicles, to throw food in the direction of the animals or get close to them. Anyone who kills a white polar bear in the snow fields will be brought to trial. There are clear, internationally recognized rules that define which species are threatened and how to preserve them.
Israel is a dangerous preserve and responsible nations should have issued a travel warning for this country long ago, or at least published a detailed guide of what is permitted or forbidden to do here. Which words or sentences induce a warning growl. A kind of dictionary for tourists in which terms such as "fly-in," "flotilla," "Palestinian state," "illegal outposts," "apartheid," "racism," "High Court of Justice," and of course, "occupation" will be underlined in bold red.
The guidebook would explain what is likely to cause Israel to bite and which sites the tourist is advised to avoid; where it is permitted for males and females to stay together and where mixed groups may attract stone-throwing; what response a red kaffiyeh around the neck is likely to evince; and what dangers someone wears red, black and green clothes could face.
This is not an extraordinary recommendation. Someone who wants to visit Somalia, Afghanistan, Algeria, Chechnya or Sudan, or merely to go on a safari, knows what he has to wear and what he cannot say.

A threatened preserve like Israel is not meant for everyone at all times. When it was still a small country defined by a Green Line, it invited the whole world to come and visit. But when it grew fat and expanded its living space, it became more threatened and more frightened, and it has designated in lists drawn up in advance who is forbidden to enter its territory. The lists include not only wanted men who plan to carry out terror attacks, but also activists in human rights organizations, at least one German author and politicians who are not prepared to sing in the choir. The lists also include recommendations about who should not waste their money on airplane tickets - for example, a tourist whose name implies Arab or Muslim origin. It is possible that soon, new and much shorter lists will be issued bearing the names only of those who are permitted to visit the preserve.
This is how Israel is turning itself into an enclave of nationalist fundamentalism in which the covenant between its citizens (the Jewish ones, of course ) is not based on equality or shared values but on the ceaseless marking of its borders with the outside world. This is an enclave which does not feed on a sense of victimization - though that is certainly a national value - but rather on a threat, the impact of which is understood only by denizens of the enclave.
Therefore it is not the one who threatens but rather the one who doubts the existence of the threat who is the real danger. It is not the Palestinians who threaten to establish a state but rather the people who think a Palestinian state is not a threat who violate the borders of the enclave.
This is the kind of person who poses the existential danger so he is the one who gets whacked in the face, no matter if he is a Danish or Israeli citizen.
Multinational metal band DRAGONFORCE will release its new album, "Reaching Into Infinity", on May 19 via earMUSIC on CD, LP and a special-edition CD and DVD. The follow-up to 2014's "Maximum Overload" will mark the band's third full-length studio release with singer Marc Hudson, who joined the group in 2011 following the departure of original frontman ZP Theart (now in SKID ROW).
The bulk of the recording sessions for "Reaching Into Infinity" took place at Fascination Street studios in Örebro, Sweden with producer Jens Bogren, who has previously worked with OPETH, THE DEVIN TOWNSEND PROJECT, AMON AMARTH, KATATONIA, SOILWORK and SYMPHONY X, to name a few. The band also laid down tracks while touring their "Killer Elite" best-of album, utilizing Lamerluser Studios in London, U.K.; Dark Lane Studios in Witney, U.K.; as well as the band's own Evil1 Studios in Charleville-Mézières, France and Shredforce One studio in California.
"We were flying out, playing a festival, then back into the studio, then back out again," explains DRAGONFORCE bassist Frédéric Leclercq, who also handled the majority of songwriting on this album. "It was very intense and very tiring. I obviously played bass but also a lot of rhythm guitar, electric and acoustic, and lost my temper a few times. I think we all did at some point, because we wanted to deliver nothing but the best."
For their seventh studio album, DRAGONFORCE have opened up their sound like never before, capturing the fierce, forlorn and fun with both menace and melody.
"I think we have proven that playing fast was something we were good at, so this time I wanted to bring even more diversity into our music," Frédéric continues. "It's great to challenge ourselves instead of staying in a comfort zone, and I really wanted to experiment with Marc's vocals. I think people are going to be surprised at his brutality."
"Reaching Into Infinity" is DRAGONFORCE's first album to feature Gee Anzalone, the Italian drummer who has laid down an insanely impressive performance to provide the perfect backbone to the DRAGONFORCE sound, which, of course, still boasts the bands trademark crazy-fast solos, courtesy of guitarists Herman Li and Sam Totman.
"The title of the album explains pretty much what we are trying to do with our music," Frédéric concludes. "Today's world is really crazy — there is fear of the future, uncertainty. But the power of music is infinite, and it can give strength and hope to people."
The band will give fans their first taste of the new songs in a live setting at a very exclusive one-off show at Camden Town, London's Black Heart venue, on April 12.
Totman says: "This is going to be insane! We always like to kick things off with some intimate shows and this will be the smallest London show we've done since doing three consecutive weeks at The Barfly back in 2005. It's going to be a wild sweaty party!"
"Reaching Into Infinity" will be available on the following formats:

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 3DMark performance as well as specifications in GPU-Z have just leaked over at Chiphell.
We already know that the GTX 1050 series could feature two graphics card, both using the latest Pascal GP107 GPU. The GTX 1050 Ti will feature the full-fat graphics core while the other will have a cut-down variant. The Ti version is expected to debut in mid-October and could cost around $149.
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Specifications
As per the GTX 1050 Ti GPU-Z shot, the card will feature 768 CUDA cores, 48 TMUs and 32 ROPs. The core clock speed is set at 1318 MHz which can boost up to 1380 MHz clock. This would result in texture fill rate of up to 84 GTexel/s. In terms of memory, the card features 4GB GDDR5 clocked at 7 GHz on a 128-bit bus interface, delivering a total of 112 GB/s bandwidth.
The chip carries a device ID 1C82 which matches with that of the Pascal family that was leaked a few months ago.
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 3DMark Performance
The GTX 1050 Ti 3Dmark scores have also leaked out which show the card will be faster than the GTX 960 at lower cost. Using a Core i7-6700K CPU, the GTX 1050 Ti scored 10,054 points in the 3DMark Performance preset, and 3,867 in the 3DMark Extreme preset. In comparison, the GTX 960 scores around 10,000 points in performance preset and 3,300 points in the extreme preset.
Based on these figures, the GTX 1050 Ti will be a competitive graphics solution at $149. What makes it even more attrative is that the card has a TDP of just 75W which means it won't require extra connectors for power.
What do you think about the GTX 1050 Ti 3DMark 11 performance? Let us know in the comments below.
Garbage collection greatly improves programmer productivity and ensures memory safety. Manual memory management on the other hand often delivers better performance but is typically unsafe and can lead to system crashes or security vulnerabilities. We propose integrating safe manual memory management with garbage collection in the .NET runtime to get the best of both worlds. In our design, programmers can choose between allocating objects in the garbage collected heap or the manual heap. All existing applications run unmodified, and without any performance degradation, using the garbage collected heap. Our programming model for manual memory management is flexible: although objects in the manual heap can have a single owning pointer, we allow deallocation at any program point and concurrent sharing of these objects amongst all the threads in the program. Experimental results from our .NET CoreCLR implementation on real-world applications show substantial performance gains especially in multithreaded scenarios: up to 3x savings in peak working sets and 2x improvements in runtime.
Krom rightly says that Hobbes claimed to show how the commonwealth or state is a human construct based on the rational self-interest of each individual constituting it -- in particular on the overarching motive to preserve his or her own life. The purpose of the present book is to demonstrate the inadequacy of any such approach, on the grounds that it leaves out, and even undermines, crucial factors such as "the role of the virtuous citizen, the philosopher, or the holy soul (as well as the institutions that sustain and cultivate such noble souls) in maintaining political stability" (p.1).
Later in the book, it becomes clear that what Krom means by this is that there are some individuals whose pride makes them value certain things more highly than their own lives, and hence are irrational in Hobbes's terms. In most cases, their pride is a danger to the state, and it must be suppressed. But in other cases, the state would not be viable without such people; and this reveals a contradiction in Hobbes's system, since he holds both that the preservation of the state requires that all citizens are motivated primarily by the fear of death, and that there must be a critical mass of individuals who are not so motivated -- hence 'the limits of reason' in the book's title.
Of course, just about everything we do carries some risk of death -- even something as mundane as crossing the road. What Krom has to do in order to prove that there is a contradiction at the heart of Hobbes's political philosophy is to demonstrate that the commonwealth cannot function unless there are some individuals who are willing to put their lives to at least as much risk as would be the case in a state of nature. In other words, their behaviour within the commonwealth contradicts their sole motive for assenting to and maintaining the social contract.
But first Krom expounds Hobbes's system, in the same order Hobbes himself adopts in Leviathan. In the first four chapters, he starts out with Hobbes's account of how the individual human mind progresses from sensation, to imagination, to thinking, and to reason. He then moves to the creation of the state through the social contract, and discusses the relation between reason and the passions, and the ways in which the state is in danger of dissolution -- particularly the destabilising effect of prideful individuals. Krom's summary is generally very clear and judicious, and I particularly like the way that he stresses the importance of Hobbes's analogy between the state and the human body.
I do, however, have one serious difficulty with his exposition in the first chapter. Hobbes himself distinguishes sharply between 'bodies' in the external world; 'fancies' or 'phantasms', which are images in the mind caused by the motion of bodies and are themselves internal motions; and 'names', which are arbitrary sounds or marks used to refer to phantasms. But Krom causes unnecessary confusion by renaming Hobbes's 'phantasms' as 'physical objects', and 'names' as 'verbal objects'. It is confusing because, although phantasms are indeed motions in the material brain, they are not physical objects in any ordinary sense of the expression. Bodies are physical objects, and phantasms are not. Krom's use of the expression 'physical object' simply does not make sense if it means a phantasm or image rather than a body, and sometimes he reverts to the ordinary meaning of 'physical object'. For example, on page 17, he talks of a tree being a physical object that bears fruit. But if a physical object is an image, it cannot bear fruit -- only a tree as a body can. The only way I can make any sense of this is if Krom is anachronistically interpreting Hobbes as a Kantian. Kant contrasted things in themselves with appearances (and on page 7, Krom equates bodies with 'things themselves'), but held that, thanks to the application of the categories, we can treat appearances as physical objects (his empirical realism). If this is Krom's reading of Hobbes, then he needs to give strong arguments for it.
In chapter five, Krom moves to criticism of Hobbes. Here his point is that, although Hobbes claims to build the commonwealth on the rational self-interest of every individual, it will not be viable without citizens who put moral values above the desire for self-preservation. Krom calls this a species of pride (taking pride in one's moral virtue), which in Hobbes's terms is irrational if it involves risking death. Krom focuses on the example of risking your life for your sovereign or country as a soldier, and claims that the state would collapse in the face of external or internal threats unless people were willing to risk their lives fighting for it. This contradicts Hobbes's central tenet that the ultimate motive of the rational man is to avoid death. But, while Hobbes certainly accepts that some people are indeed altruistic, Krom fails to establish that it is impossible (or that Hobbes believed that it is impossible) for a sovereign to maintain a loyal army without altruism. Obviously it is in a sovereign's interest to act in such a way as to build up a cadre of followers who will voluntarily give up their lives for him. But history is full of examples of dictators who have succeeded militarily with a conscript army motivated by a fear of punishment greater than their fear of death in battle. This is precisely Hobbes's minimalist conception of what is necessary for the preservation of the state, and anything consensual is a desirable but non-essential extra.
Nevertheless, Krom is surely correct that the body politic would barely function if its citizens were motivated solely by the desire to avoid death. But it is not clear that this is Hobbes's position. The fear of death comes in because it is the ultimate reason why individuals get together to form a state: they are more likely to be protected from death, and other evils such as theft, if they submit to the authority of a sovereign. It is also the overriding motive for continuing to obey the sovereign, since mass disobedience would mean civil war and reversion to the state of nature. But far more is needed to ensure the proper functioning of the state, and it is the job of the sovereign to legislate appropriately. Krom seems to assume that, for Hobbes, people will obey laws only when they fear punishment for breaking them. Thus on page 90, he writes: "Hobbes's just man does not stand up to the 'ring of Gyges' thought experiment': given the power of invisibility, Hobbes's just man will procure his own advantage without regard for law or the contracts he has made." But I don't see this in what Hobbes writes. Rather, having committed to the social contract, the just man will honour the contract by obeying the laws ordained by the sovereign, and will do so autonomously, and not just out of fear of punishment. Fear of death is the motive for entering and maintaining the contract in general, but not for abiding by the details. Civil society makes possible the mutual trust that is absent from the state of nature.
In chapter 6, Krom moves to the role of philosophy in maintaining political stability. He distinguishes vain from true philosophy, and summarises Hobbes's explanation of the origin of vain philosophy and how it leads to sedition through the pride of philosophers in thinking that they know better than the sovereign. In explaining the origin of vain philosophy, Krom focuses on the failure of philosophers to define their terms (Leviathan 8), and omits to mention the passage in Leviathan 46 (especially the Latin version), where Hobbes ingeniously diagnoses the ultimate source of vain philosophy as being the verb 'to be' when used as the copula and Greek and Latin. Aristotle assumed that there must be something in reality corresponding to every component of a true proposition. Since there is no material substance or quality corresponding to 'is', he invented the immaterial entity 'being', and hence the whole range of fictitious metaphysical entities integral to vain philosophy. Since it lacks the copula, the Hebrew language is not infected by meaningless abstractions or immaterialism, and the Old Testament contains a purer theology than that of Greek and Latin writers influenced by Aristotle.
As for the positive role of philosophy, it has two branches: natural and civil. Natural philosophy (what we would now call 'science') should be directed towards improving the quality of life, and this excludes metaphysics, which at best can do no more than satisfy the curiosity and pride of metaphysicians. Civil philosophy, on the other hand, is the new science invented by Hobbes, the function of which is to support the sovereign in maintaining the integrity of the state, and improving the life of its citizens. Hobbes went as far as to claim that the doctrines of Leviathan should be taught in the universities. Now, this is all very true of what Hobbes says, but Krom fails to explain how it is inconsistent with Hobbes's account of what it is for humans to be rational. It certainly goes beyond an exclusive concern with preserving one's life, but there is no inconsistency in wanting to improve the quality of life that one has preserved. An inconsistency would arise only if it were necessary for philosophers to risk their lives for their discipline -- but Krom fails to show this, apart from mentioning Bacon's accidentally catching his death of a cold while experimenting with freezing chickens (p.130).
In chapter 7, Krom considers religion. He gives an extensive account of Hobbes's reasons for saying that the sovereign must be the head of the church as well as head of state. The commonwealth cannot stand if there is divided authority, and in a world in which religion is a major issue, it is intolerable for there to be more than one arbiter of religious correctness. Because religious beliefs are held so deeply, the inevitable result of divided authority is civil war, and a reversion to the state of nature.
No individual can have valid grounds for claiming divine inspiration, and the only way of reconciling Christianity with the preservation of the commonwealth is for the sovereign to be the sole authority on how the Bible is to be interpreted. Hobbes's rational man is as concerned about his prospects for immortality as he is about his survival in this life. But all that is required for salvation is to believe that Jesus is the Christ, and to obey the sovereign's interpretation of what follows from this. It would therefore be irrational for him to believe he had a better chance of immortality by preferring his private interpretation of the Bible to that of the divinely appointed sovereign.
The greatest threat to the commonwealth comes from the Roman Catholic Church, which claims a greater authority over people's beliefs and behaviour than that of the secular sovereign. Indeed, it claims universal authority, and not merely over a single jurisdiction, as is the case with the Anglican church. Consequently, it is essential for the preservation of the commonwealth that Roman Catholicism be outlawed, and that all traces of Catholic and pagan philosophy be eliminated from the teachings of divinity schools in the universities.
To turn to the positive side, it is perfectly consistent with Hobbes's account of rational self-interest, that, once the commonwealth has been formed and the sovereign established, teachers and preachers should be required to promulgate the official religion as determined by the sovereign as head of the Anglican church. But Krom started out with the project of showing that divines must be willing to risk their lives in propagating the state religion, otherwise there is no inconsistency with their rational self-interest. However, the nearest he comes to an argument for this is when he discusses Hobbes's concept of charity (pp.168-9). Hobbes does indeed advocate the virtue of mutual charity: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Krom assumes that this implies that everyone (and not merely divines) should be willing to die for the sake of the commonwealth, in contradiction to their motive for setting it up in the first place. But he doesn't give any argument for this, let alone justify the claim he made on page 1 that there must be some holy (but irrational) souls in order to maintain political stability.
In short, Krom's book contains much that is true about Hobbes's political philosophy and theology, but he fails in his narrower purpose of showing that the commonwealth must include people who are willing to set aside their fear of death, and sacrifice their lives.
Sometimes the Spelunky world record hunters seem to speak in another language. They enthuse about eggplants and Udjat Eyes, Hell runs and Olmec, a vocabulary incomprehensible to outsiders.
It's all testament to the depth of a game that has inspired a devout community to try and conquer all its wiles. Leading the charge are the world record hunters, unfathomably dedicated players collaborating and competing to become the best spelunker on the planet.
Spelunky is a procedurally generated platformer that delights in killing you at every opportunity. The aim is to explore its levels that are never the same twice and collect as much loot as possible along the way. One wrong move - activate a trap, tumble into piranha-infested water, rile a shotgun-wielding shopkeeper - will bring a premature end to any promising run. It's this unpredictability that attracted players upon the game's release in 2012, and that has kept them coming back for further punishment.
"I played the arcade version on Xbox [360]. I didn't really take it all that seriously," says prolific Spelunky streamer YamaYamaDingDong, otherwise known as Ryan. "I basically just played it whenever I rage-quit Call of Duty."
The game was subsequently released on PC, and the ability to stream his efforts made Ryan take it more seriously. He's now played for around 1200 hours. "It just kind of happened," says Ryan. "I don't play any other games. Only Spelunky."
YamaYamaDingDong's record stood for less than a week.
The bulk of that playtime has been poured into claiming one of the game's world records. These come in two main variants: the high score record charges players with gathering as much loot as possible in a single life. A fruitful run takes hours and requires expert patience and resource management.
"There's always suspense on a score run," says high score chaser Buddy7heElf, commonly known as John. "You need great luck, but it's kind of exciting entering a new level hoping for it to be filled with gems or resources you may be short on."
The other variant is speedrunning, where the player makes it from beginning to end in as short a time as possible, hoping their efforts aren't thwarted by the game's procedural generation.
Pibonacci is one of the Spelunky community's best-known speedrunners. "I always had a competitive personality in sports," he says. "Once I realised I could compete at the very top, I got a huge adrenaline kick out of [speedrunning]."
Although the goal of each discipline is markedly different, success often relies on the same thing: a favourable seed. The random generation needs to have been sympathetic to their cause. For speedrunning, Pibonacci generally hopes for levels where the door is immediately downwards from the starting point. "A straight down level, without getting into details, takes like seven seconds if done well," he says. "A level's natural path can zigzag from left to right, and you can lose 10 seconds just because of that."
He slips back into Spelunky-speak to explain the criteria for different strands of speedrunning. Most compelling is what's called 'Low%', which dictates that the player uses only their starting resources (bombs and ropes) and collect nothing extra along the way. The world record in this class stands at two minutes and 54 seconds, set by Spelunky speedrunning extraordinaire Latedog. Pibonacci's personal best time is only six seconds shy of this mark. The video evidence seems to show a player operating on pure instinct.
"Remember, you saw the one that worked out!" he says. "But there is a natural path to the exit on every single level. Certain patterns reoccur. For example, if you start on the very right side of a Mines level, and to your left is a snake pit, the exit has to be straight down. That's how the levels are generated."
This is the kind of knowledge that only comes with over a thousand hours of playtime. "There are a lot of other little things you just have to process fast," he says.
The time required for a high score run means this level of improvisation is undesirable. Players will restart over and over to get a favourable seed, which can usually be recognised by the (random) contents of the shop on the second level. "I'm looking for a jetpack, mattock, bombs and Udjat Eye [an item that reveals secrets and gems within the level]," says John. "If you don't get what you're looking for on level 1-2, you start over and repeat the process. Sometimes it takes a few minutes where you get really lucky, other times you can go for hours and get no luck at all."
While a skilled score runner still has to roll with the punches, it's caution that leads to success, a lengthy game of brinkmanship that can be frustrating for cavalier speedrunners. "Even if a speedrun ends pretty late, it's only a few minutes in," says Pibonacci. "On score runs it's a few hours. One random event you may not even be able to control and it's over."
It was no small feat, then, when popular Spelunky streamer Bananasaurus_Rex became the first player to score over $3 million, holding his nerve for seven hours to set the bar at $3,105,850. Ryan immediately set his mind on beating it.
"I was going so hard for it for a couple of months. A few hours every day, resetting and trying to get a good seed," he says. "I knew that I could totally do it because I'd come within $25,000 of Rex's record before."
A little less than two months and many failed attempts later, Ryan found himself neck-and-neck with the record as he neared the end of a run. "It was really down to the wire. People in chat were telling me that I needed this much or that much to beat the record," he says. "There was a lot of confusion, a lot of hype. I was just trying not to die."
He beat the record by just $3975 in a time of just over four hours. "Oh my goodness," he says of finally doing it. "It was just so much work paid off."
Yeti another death.
It didn't last. New on the Spelunky scene, John had riled the community at large by making boastful declarations. "Oh, I knew I would do it no problem," he says. "I came to the community and told everybody I'd get the record within a month. They probably scoffed at me. But it only took a week."
John had already gained attention by seemingly questioning the validity of Bananasaurus_Rex's record run, wherein he had beaten enormous odds to get a plasma cannon, a crucial tool for mining gems, on the first level. "There was a misunderstanding where I said his run seems fishy, as a joke," says John. "I didn't know how popular he was. So I became known as the guy that called him a cheater."
It's a rare instance of friction in a community built on collaboration and friendly competition. "A lot of MMOs and FPSs and stuff, there's a really toxic community because they're all playing against each other," says Ryan. "We're all doing our own thing, and it's like, 'Hey, look what I did, this is cool!' It's everyone together versus the game instead of people versus each other."
So John's swaggering introduction was never going to make him too many friends. "It just got off on the wrong foot, I think," says Ryan tactfully. Most of the community has now reconciled with John, with one notable exception. "He and B-Rex are still not on good terms."
John set a new record of $3,140,850 which, at time of writing, still stands. "I got super lucky a few times, especially getting an altar on 5-3, which allowed me to get an extra $80,000 by bringing the ghost into Yama's throne," he says, slipping into Spelunky-speak.
For some, John's reputation tarnishes the achievement. "People didn't like some guy they label as cocky coming in and beating the record," he says. "I've been told that someone called me scum."
That person was not Ryan. He admits his disappointment at his record being so short-lived, but is glad for a reason to keep playing. "I had my moment of fame. Now there's a new mark to hit. This just motivates me to go for it again," he says. "I just need the right seed."
The idea of a perfect seed seems to be a prevailing dream. The ranks of expert Spelunky players are only growing. For both the high score and speedrun records, will they procedurally generated stars eventually align and offer up the ideal circumstances for an unbeatable run?
"Yes and no. I mean, it's possible," says Ryan. "The score record can almost always be beaten. Almost. I'm excited to see how far we can push it. I think $3.25 million is not unreasonable at all."
John estimates higher. "B-Rex or Yama are capable of beating my record whenever they want. I'm thinking $3.4 or $3.5 million will be reached. When it gets that high, it'll be hopeless to play for a score like that."
Records or no, these players will keep returning to the death-laden caverns of Spelunky, where the thrill of the challenge trumps the end result. After all, you don't play for this long if your heart isn't in it.
"It's way more satisfying to have to actually play a level amazingly well compared to just getting the gift of easy levels, so I'm fine with that [perfect seed] never going to happen," says Pibonacci. Still, for every new player, every reset, every near-miss, the odds of a perfect seed and untouchable record shorten. Pibonacci takes a moment to reconsider.
"Well, obviously I wouldn't mind if it happened to me."
Michael Smith and Jemele Hill discuss if Roger Goodell deserves a contract extension to remain the Commissioner of the NFL. (2:23)
The issues NFL ownership have had regarding commissioner Roger Goodell's extension have been resolved and the deal is "getting papered right now," a source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN.
It could take days or maybe weeks to finalize, but the contract is "getting done," according to the source.
The source confirmed that Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had raised issues about the deal and wanted to open up the search during the process. ESPN previously reported that Jones had argued persistently for months to the committee that other owners believe Goodell makes "way too much money" and demand a pay-cut and a radical change in the formula that compensates the commissioner, as well as other employees of the league office.
"That's what he tried to do," the source said, "but he got shot down."
A conference call on Wednesday of the compensation committee helped seal the deal. The committee consists of six owners: chairman Arthur Blank (Atlanta Falcons); Clark Hunt (Kansas City Chiefs); Robert Kraft (New England Patriots); John Mara (New York Giants); Bob McNair (Houston Texans); and Art Rooney II (Pittsburgh Steelers). The Cowboys' Jones had become an unofficial seventh member of the committee and was on the conference call Wednesday, sources say.
Editor's Picks NFL players want month dedicated to activism A group of four players sent the NFL a memo in August requesting league support and asking for a month to be dedicated to social activism soon after commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly talked to several players regarding their game-day activism efforts.
"It's done from ownership perspective," the source said, adding that the committee "wouldn't approve something that Roger wouldn't agree to."
Goodell's current deal as commissioner expires in 2019. He received $34.1 million in compensation during the 2014 calendar year and $32 million in 2015. That included base salary and bonuses, as well as pension and other deferred payments.
The 2015 filing was the last the league had to disclose, because it has relinquished its tax-exempt status. In the 10 years in which his commissioner salary was disclosed, Goodell averaged more than $21 million per year and made a total of $212.5 million. He became NFL commissioner in 2006.
Revealed: Hillary Clinton's State Department refused to classify Boko Haram as a 'terror group' even after it threatened to 'murder the U.S. ambassador' to Nigeria
Boko Haram vowed in February 2012 to assassinate Ambassador Terence McCulley if the U.S. helped Nigeria with terror-fighting efforts
'We know his house ... We know his vehicle and the time he leaves his house and the time he returns,' the group said in a communique to media
The warning was similar to Ansar al-Shariah's pledge to kill U.S. officials in Benghazi, Libya, three months before the deadly 2012 terror attack there
Despite clear threats, Hillary Clinton's State Department fought efforts to officially designate the mass-murdering Nigerians as a terrorist group
A former State Dept. official said naming new terror groups 'sent the wrong message' about al-Qaeda and its allies as Barack Obama ran for re-election
Boko Haram, the African Islamist terror group whose April kidnapping of nearly 300 young girls has united the civilized world in anger, promised to assassinate U.S. ambassador to Nigeria Terence McCulley in February 2012, vowing to murder him if America signed a terrorism-fighting Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with the government in Abuja.
McCulley, now the U.S. ambassador to the Ivory Coast, was not harmed. But the threat, coming amid a years-long bombing campaign that killed more than 1,400 Nigerian civilians, didn't move then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to fast-track the addition of Boko Haram to the U.S. government's official list of international terrorist groups.
Independent media outlets inside Nigeria first reported on February 9, 2012 that an unnamed Boko Haram leader issued a statement promising that 'we will murder the U.S. Ambassador if the MOU is signed.'
The revelation provides a stark parallel with assassination warnings issued by Islamist groups in Benghazi, Libya in the months before the September 11, 2012 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American personnel.
Scroll down for video
In 2011 and 2012 the Islamist terror group Boko Haram detonated a bomb nearly every day for 15 months, including this December 2011 blast at St. Theresa Catholic Church outside the Nigerian capital Abuja
Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (L) met with Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan (R), Nigerian ambassador to the U.S. Ade Adefuye (2nd L) and Nigerian Foreign Minister Olugbenga Ashiru (2nd R) in Abuja on August 9, 2012, but despite threats to U.S. interests she refused to declare Boko Haram a terrorist group
In June of that year, Ansar al-Shariah – the al-Qaeda-linked group that carried out the Benghazi attack – held a parade, two days of rallies and a press conference in central Benghazi. With dozens of military vehicles and heavy arms on display, the terrorists held what an intelligence analyst later said was 'a team pep rally before the game, only for jihad.'
The Clinton State Department infamously ignored that event, even though the first attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi followed two days later – a bombing at the compound's gate that left a hole big enough for 40 men to walk through.
Later requests for additional armed guards at the Benghazi station also fell on deaf ears. Ansar al-Shariah ultimately returned to finish the job.
A September 2013 report from the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee ominously speculated that McCulley's fate in Nigeria could be the same as Stevens' in Libya.
'The danger that Boko Haram may try a similar assault on diplomatic personnel there, as they [Ansar al-Shariah] did in Libya, is a terrifying possibility.'
Then-U.S. Ambassador Terence McCulley, spoke at a mining and oil-production conference on Feb. 8, 2012, the day before Boko Haram threatened to assassinate him in retaliation for U.S. cooperation with efforts to fight terror in Nigeria
The threat against Ambassador McCulley's life in Nigeria had come three months before the Benghazi parades.
'We have had him under surveillance for a while and if the MOU is signed, we will carry out a premeditated attack on him,' Boko Haram had said in a separate statement, according to Nigerian media.
'We know his house in Maitaima [a northern district of Abuja], We know his vehicle and the time he leaves his house and the time he returns.'
Nigeria's civilian government, the group added at the time, would be making a grave mistake if it joined America in an 'unholy marriage' to fight 'our men.'
The Daily Post Nigeria in Lagos confirmed the report on February 10, 2012, adding that Boko Haram had also threatened 'several suicide attacks on American targets' as part of an 'international jihad.'
It's not clear why the State Department resisted adding Boko Haram to its Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) list for so long.
A former State Department official who served in a legal capacity under Secretary Clinton told MailOnline on Wednesday that one component of the decision was undeniably political.
'Bulking up the FTO list was not what anyone in leadership wanted,' the former official said. 'At some point it became as much about how things looked as what needed to happen.'
The George W. Bush administration added 17 such groups to the FTO list in eight years. Obama's State Department had added 11 by the time he stood for re-election in 2012.
During the election season, the Benghazi attack threatened to simultaneously unravel both of Obama's foreign policy victories: the undoing of al-Qaeda through the death of Osama bin Laden, and the promised stabilization of Libya following the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, both in 2011.
Bringing attention to the expansion of Islamist terror in Nigeria, an important U.S. trading partner, would have counted against Obama as he campaigned to keep his job, according to the former State Department official.
'We all understood, as the State Department does today, that al-Qaeda is far from being defeated,' he said. 'But no one wants to say that in a swing state, right?'
The Memorandum Of Understanding between the U.S. and Nigeria was inked six months later, after Clinton visited Abuja personally on August 9, 2012.
In it the U.S. offered Nigeria's government assistance 'in forensics and post-attack inspections,' according to a Voice of America report, as well as help improving their methods of tracking and arresting militants – but no direct special-forces or other military assistance.
Clinton also proposed to help Nigerian security forces set up an 'intelligence fusion cell' to professionalize the way they shared information, similar to how U.S. military and law enforcement agencies routinely cooperate.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan thanked Clinton in 2012 for America's 'moral support' and 'technical support' during the 2010 elections that brought him to power, but didn't address any American cooperation with his attempt to crack down on Boko Haram.
When Clinton arrived, the group was detonating a bomb nearly every day, racking up a death toll that approached 1,400 – mostly Christians.
But the State Department resisted adding Boko Haram to its list of designated terror groups until John Kerry, Clinton's successor, pulled the trigger in November 2013
That same month, McCulley left his post in Nigeria for the Ivory Coast.
Just another day in Nigeria: Boko Haram destroyed the Gamboru central market on May 5, 2014 in the Ngala district of Borno State in the northeastern region of the country
First lady Michelle Obama launched her bid at 'hashtag diplomacy' after Boko Haram terrorists kidnapped nearly 300 Nigerian girls in April
Clinton fought pressure to regard Boko Haram as a threat to U.S. interests throughout President Barack Obama's first term, as it morphed from a Muslim religious study group in 2002 into a hard-line regional Islamist terror organization by mid-2009.
Its militants bombed the United Nations building in Abuja in 2011, bringing new terror-designation pleas from the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department and more than a dozen members of Congress.
The Clinton State Department did add three Boko Haram leaders – as individuals – to its list of terrorists on June 21, 2012.
In a press briefing that day, then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that 'there is always this question of whether designating individuals within an organization is the most effective strategy or whether the designating the whole organization is the most effective strategy. So we're continuing to look at the question of a broader designation.'
'More broadly,' she added, 'we are working with the government of Nigeria and encouraging it in its dialogue with forces in the north, to promote a unified, multi – pluralistic Nigeria where the rights of all people, no matter their religion, no matter where they live, are protected in its own security efforts, that it examine its tactics, it looks more at policing, and that it begin a real dialogue about some of the roots of the dissatisfaction in the north, which are primarily economic.'
More than a year later, on July 31, 2013, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was asked for an update after Boko Haram killed 45 people in a series of coordinated attacks.
In a May 12, 2014 video released by Boko Haram, a man claiming to be its leader Abubakar Shekau said hundreds of missing Nigerian schoolgirls had converted to Islam and would not be released until the terror group's militants were freed from Nigerian prisons
'Can you comment on why Boko Haram hasn't been designated as a foreign terrorist organization?' a reported asked, according to the briefing transcript.
'I don't have anything for you on that,' Harf replied.
Officially designating a foreign organization as a terror group allows the U.S. to freeze bank assets belonging to the group and its members and add them to no-fly lists. It also permits American law-enforcement agencies to prioritize their resources toward fighting the organizations.
'Boko Haram' is a loose translation of the Hausa-language phrase 'Western education is sinful.'
But that phrase is more of a nickname for the organization whose official moniker is 'Jama'atul Alhul Sunnah Lidda'wati wal Jihad,' or 'people committed to the propagation of the Prophet's teachings and jihad.'
The Obama administration has responded to the group's April kidnappings, and to its threat to sell the captured girls into slavery if a prisoner swap isn't agreed to, with what detractors call 'hashtag diplomacy.'
First lady Michele Obama appeared in a photograph that quickly circled the globe, holding a placard reading '#BringBackOurGirls.'
She followed with a Saturday radio address expressing her outrage over Boko Haram's kidnap spree, but never mentioning its status as a radical Muslim sect, or the Nigeria-wide conflict between northern Muslims and southern Christians that has fed its rise to power.
The U.S. Embassy in Abuja has issued repeated warnings about threats to American citizens in Nigeria, including some after the September 2012 Benghazi attack.
Intelligence analysts told MailOnline that Boko Haram has been behind a long string of kidnappings since 2010, mostly of Westerners, and largely at the direction of al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
Stanley Cup champions Los Angeles Kings visited the White House yesterday. The spirits were high, even though with most of the season gone, the team must be disappointed with their form. They are currently on the outside looking in regarding playoff spots and clearly need to improve to seal a post season berth.
Vancouver Canucks currently hold the last playoff spot in the tough Western Conference. They have a 3-point lead over the Kings and also have played one game less. Having suffered a poor run since Christmas for the second year in a row, the Kings are flirting with disaster.
Last season the team won just 5 of 21 games played since Christmas until the start of February. This year they have lost 11 of 15. 12 months ago they followed the negative run up with a 8-game win streak and there's a desperate need to repeat that feat.
With the Pacific division lacking competitiveness, the Kings still managed to get to the playoffs last season with relative ease. They were comfortably sitting in the last automatic qualifying spot. The story is different this season though. The Canucks and Calgary Flames have leapfrogged the Kings. Also, the fiercely competitive Central division is a worry for every Western Conference side having playoff ambitions. Every team is in playoff contention there with only 8 points between the 4th and last.
The Kings' troubles are mainly down to incredibly poor away form. Only some of the leagues the worst Buffalo Sabres, Edmonton Oilers and Carolina Hurricanes are behind them regarding points picked up from road games. The Kings have just five road wins and only the Sabres have picked up less wins away from home.
Currently the Kings are on a 5-game road trip and whilst they haven't enjoyed traveling this season, they have to get used to it. Starting with their game tonight against the Washington Capitals, the Kings play 20 of their remaining 33 regular season games on the road. In order to make the playoffs, the team clearly has to find a way to start winning games away from STAPLES Center. The sooner, the better.
As members of the Eugene/Kathmandu Sister City Association intensify a local effort to raise money for victims of the devastating earthquake that struck the mountainous Asian nation on Saturday, a Eugene mother worries but remains upbeat.
�We�re really hopeful we�re going to hear from them really soon,� said Jennifer Brazil, a PeaceHealth educator. �I just want to know that she�s safe.�
Brazil�s daughter, Amber Brazil, 21, a University of Oregon student, was hiking in Nepal�s Langtang National Park with good friend Alicia Scroggins, also 21, when the deadly 7.8 magnitude quake hit.
Both women are 2011 graduates of Thurston High School in Springfield.
Nepal�s the worst earthquake in 80 years, with a death toll that�s now over 4,000 and still climbing, has destroyed homes, caused numerous landslides and created a massive food and water shortage.
�It�s devastating,� said Dr. Binaya Rimal, 45, of Springfield, a critical care and pulmonary doctor in Springfield who is from Kathmandu.
His parents and sister still live in the Nepalese capital and all survived, Rimal said.
�For now, they are OK,� he said. �But having water that is safe, and an adequate food supply, is an issue.�
The spread of infections such as cholera and typhoid are a big concern, said Rimal, a member of the Eugene/Kathmandu Sister City Association that is trying to raise money to send for relief efforts.
The association has a goal of raising $100,000, and had collected about $1,200 as of Monday afternoon.
Eugene has four sister cities around the world, the others being Irkutsk, Russia; Jinju, South Korea; and Kakegawa, Japan.
Kathmandu has been a Eugene sister city since 1975, said Dennis Ramsey, president of the Eugene/Kathmandu Sister City Association. The alliance was created when former Eugene Mayor Les Anderson went on a trek to Nepal and decided to introduce himself to the mayor of the nation�s capital, Ramsey said.
Ramsey lived in Kathmandu from 1982 to 1995, working for UNICEF, the United Nation�s Children�s Fund, and owned a home there until 2010. His wife, Rindu, is from Kathmandu.
�Her family is living on the street, basically, because they can�t go back into their home,� Dennis Ramsey said of his wife�s parents, sisters and nephews.
Ramsey is also president of Renewable Energy Development International, a nonprofit organization that provides solar electrical lighting and other renewable energy solutions for public institutions in Nepal.
The 20 or so members of the Eugene/Kathmandu association met Sunday night at the Saraha Nyingma Buddhist Institute in south Eugene, Ramsey said. About half the group�s members are Nepalese, he said.
As soon as we know �who is on the ground, who is able to work,� the association will send the money it has raised, Ramsey said. �Only then will we feel right about where to send our money.�
The biggest needs are food, water and medical care, he said.
Rimal is hoping to go to Nepal next week, if possible, with four other Nepalese-born doctors from Lane and Douglas counties, he said.
�They are running out of space, (operating) rooms, intravenous medications and fluids, antibiotics,� Rimal said.
�Holding out hope�
Amber Brazil left Eugene in January, her mother said, and headed for Thailand, where she was going to finish her UO degree in environmental studies by doing an internship with an elephant rehabilitation sanctuary.
Scroggins, who now lives in Auckland, N.Z., went to Thailand about a month ago to visit Brazil, said Scroggins� sister, Annie Wood of Medford.
The women left on their trek, accompanied by a guide, on April 19 or 20, Jennifer Brazil said.
�We�re holding out hope that we�ll hear from them and that they�re OK,� said Wood, who was in Eugene Monday visiting another sister, Katie Casey.
Amber Brazil sent her father, Casey Brazil, owner of American Mattress in Eugene, a text message before the trek saying that cellphone coverage would be scattered but that they would try to email from a village if they found Internet access, Jennifer Brazil said.
They�ve determined the women were on the fifth day of their trek when the earthquake struck, so they were likely closing in on the village of Briddim, where 90 percent of the homes were destroyed, Jennifer Brazil said.
But she has found nine people via Twitter who were in the same area and are alive, she said. And those people have been notified about Amber and Alicia, Brazil said.
Scroggins is the daughter of Bob and Lisa Scroggins, formerly of Springfield, who now live in Auckland. Bob Scroggins grew up in Springfield and is the former pastor of Wayside Open Bible Chapel, now Life Church at Wayside, in Springfield.

It's a moment you may have missed in the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice trailer: in-between Batman slamming Superman against a wall somehow and one of several large explosions in the three-minute trailer, there are a few frames of that “Nightmare Batman” fighting soldiers wearing the Superman S on their sleeve.
If, like me, your mind wrote that scene off as just being another part of that dream, that's understandable; but when you take a moment and look at it again, especially slowed down, it becomes very clear: those are parademons flying through the background.
Parademons are the foot soldiers of the space tyrant Darkseid – think of them as the orcs in Lord of the Rings, a marginally intelligent, fiercely loyal to their overlord troop that's bred only for war. Seeing them in this trailer, then, is a big deal for a few reasons. Parademons have shown up in many forms in the pages of DC Comics and in animated and video game adaptations since they were first created by Jack Kirby in 1971. The wasp-like flying parademons were featured prominently in Justice League: War, the animated film that launched a new continuity for DC Animation, based primarily on the New 52 relaunch of DC Comics. It's been heavily rumored and speculated that those DC animated movies are being used as a breeding ground of sorts for the new live-action films, so it's not too surprising to see them share a look.
In the scene shown from Batman v Superman, their appearance isn't the only notable factor. What we've speculated so far is that the clip released Monday and the scene here is a dream – but what if it's not a dream so much as a vision of the future? Darkseid, the godly despot, is rumored to be the primary villain for the two-part Justice League film, and given his status as the big bad that assembled them in the New 52 relaunch comics and animated film, he's also the obvious choice. If we're seeing a possible future here, where Darkseid's invasion was successful and he's somehow taken over Superman, that could have major implications for that film. After all – the soldiers aren't fighting the parademons, they're fighting Batman, who seems like the least of the threats in that situation. Whose vision could it be, then? Something Lex Luthor sees through some technological advance? That could lead to him wanting to get rid of Superman ahead of time, so he can't be used as a weapon. Something Wonder Woman sees through a mystical oracle of Greek myth? That could be why she shows up, ready to save the day.
- It used to be dogma that the brain was shut away from the actions of the immune system, shielded from the outside forces of nature. But that's not how it is at all. In fact, thanks to the scientific detective work of Kevin Tracey, MD, it turns out that the brain talks directly to the immune system, sending commands that control the body's inflammatory response to infection and autoimmune diseases. Understanding the intimate relationship is leading to a novel way to treat diseases triggered by a dangerous inflammatory response.
Dr. Tracey, director and chief executive of The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, will be giving the 2007 Stetten Lecture on Wednesday, Oct. 24, at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. His talk - Physiology and Immunology of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway - will highlight the discoveries made in his laboratory and the clinical trials underway to test the theory that stimulation of the vagus nerve could block a rogue inflammatory response and treat a number of diseases, including life-threatening sepsis.
With this new understanding of the vagus nerve's role in regulating inflammation, scientists believe that they can tap into the body's natural healing defenses and calm the sepsis storm before it wipes out its victims. Each year, 750,000 people in the United States develop severe sepsis, and 215,000 will die no matter how hard doctors fight to save them. Sepsis is triggered by the body's own overpowering immune response to a systemic infection, and hospitals are the battlegrounds for these potentially lethal conditions.
The vagus nerve is located in the brainstem and snakes down from the brain to the heart and on through to the abdomen. Dr. Tracey and others are now studying ways of altering the brain's response or targeting the immune system itself as a way to control diseases.
Dr. Tracey is a neurosurgeon who came into research through the back door of the operating room. More than two decades ago, he was treating a young girl whose body had been accidentally scorched by boiling water and she was fighting for her life to overcome sepsis. She didn't make it. Dr. Tracey headed into the laboratory to figure out why the body makes its own cells that can do fatal damage. Dr. Tracey discovered that the vagus nerve speaks directly to the immune system through a neurochemical called acetylcholine. And stimulating the vagus nerve sent commands to the immune system to stop pumping out toxic inflammatory markers. "This was so surprising to us," said Dr. Tracey, who immediately saw the potential to use vagus stimulation as a way to shut off abnormal immune system responses. He calls this network "the inflammatory reflex."
Research is now underway to see whether tweaking the brain's acetylcholine system could be a natural way to control the inflammatory response. Inflammation is key to many diseases - from autoimmune conditions like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis to Alzheimer's, where scientists have identified a strong inflammatory component.
Dr. Tracey has presented his work to the Dalai Lama, who has shown a great interest in the neurosciences and the mind-body connection. He has also written a book called "Fatal Sequence," about the double-edge sword of the immune system.

About The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research
Last Thursday, I had the opportunity to learn some cooking tips from one of the best: Sacramento's own favorite Uncle Buck. Uncle Buck is known for making delicious, healthy, and consistENTly medicated edibles, from butter to cookies to…trail mix! He'll be giving these free classes at Magnolia Wellness for the next few Thursdays, and if you're anywhere in the neighborhood and have a medical recommendation, I recommend that you join in the fun!
So, since I was mostly gazing in awe while Uncle Buck whipped up some terrific appetizers, all I was able to do during class was taken some quick notes. And afterwards…but that's another story. So anyway…here are the notes I can still read:
When making butter, Uncle Buck uses flour sacks (that he buys at Smart & Final) to squeeze out the leaves. This insures that every trace of vegetation is gone. I think he said he makes 24 pounds of butter at a time! THC/CBD extraction is done at 225°.
Medication is important, but this is food, and it's nothing without taste. Uncle Buck mixes olive oil and soybean oil for cooking, and uses a maximum of 150° to 200° when extracting THC/CBD from the cannabis.
The large fan leaves, especially, generally have more CBDs than flowers in typical strains. Fresh raw leaves are great to cook with, especially with basil and other herbs.
Apples! Uncle Buck likes to add green apples occasionally for extra flavor, but red apples when baking.
The basic ratio he uses when cooking is one ounce of cannabis to one pound of butter or oil.
Uncle Buck's butter is the best, but when you're making a butter-heavy dish, the taste of weed would be evident. He proved his great taste, making a bread dip from 3 ounces of cannabutter and 4 ounces of regular butter. I dipped two pieces of bread into this mixture and couldn't taste anything weedy at all.
But the stars of the evening were the stuffed mushrooms. Nothing fancy, just regular mushrooms sauteed in Uncle Buck's cannabutter and then stuffed with chopped vegetables and a few cannabis leaves that themselves were sauteed in cannabutter. They were amazing. More than amazing…? Yes. They tasted like any similar mushroom dish in a top restaurant. You couldn't detect any taste of marijuana whatsoever.
And after all the problems I've had overdosing accidentally on edibles, I tried to be careful! I asked what a full dose of the mushrooms would entail, and he said “Three.” So I only ate two (even though they were delicious) along with the bread. Then later in the class…much later…after I had asked him about the mushroom dose and also about the butter dose…I suddenly realized…
Uncle Buck's dose size was about eight times as large as the one I use!
Well…the class was just about over, and Uncle Buck was letting the people in the class take home the leftovers (!), so I decided to drive straight home. Like, before anything happened. Which it did when I got there. But as I said, that's another story.
I certainly don't blame Uncle Buck, but my wife is writing him a note for the next class, saying that “Old Hippie is not allowed to eat in class ever again”.
And now, after all these years, I can say that I have finally — and even legally — tripped on mushrooms.
President Obama's own signature education initiative, Race to the Top, similarly used federal money to leverage change that many Republicans had long endorsed — charter schools and teacher evaluations that tied effectiveness in the classroom to tenure.
But now, the quest to sharply shrink government that all the Republican candidates embrace, driven by the fervor of the Tea Party, has brought a sweeping anti-federal government stance to the fore on education, as in many other areas.
The question is whether states and local districts, without Washington's various carrots and sticks, will continue to raise academic standards and give equal opportunity to traditionally ignored student populations.
“People want government money, they want higher standards, they want greater accountability,” said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group, who was an education official in the Reagan administration. “None of those things in most places comes from local control.”
So far, the candidates have not been specific about what a drastically reduced federal role would look like. Education has not become a major issue, and when candidates do address it, they tend to paint the Education Department with the same broad brush used to criticize Mr. Obama for what they see as government overreach on health care, Wall Street reform and the environment.
Tom Luna, the elected superintendent of schools in Idaho, said Washington's oversight of education is different from health care or environmental regulations. The Education Department dispenses a large share of its billions of dollars to states and local districts on the condition that they uphold two pillars of national law — that students who are economically disadvantaged and students who are disabled get extra classroom enrichment.

“If you're a conservative Republican like I consider myself,” said Mr. Luna, who is also president-elect of the Council of Chief State School Officers, “there has to be accountability for how those dollars are spent. We can't send them to schools or states with no accountability.”

The change in Republican perspective is most noticeable with Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry, who earlier in their political careers supported No Child Left Behind. That 2002 law required states to show yearly progress in the number of students who were proficient in English and math, although it allowed states to measure proficiency in their own ways. Mr. Perry participated in a news conference heralding federal officials' approval of the Texas plan for putting the law in place, providing $400 million for the state.
But today he complains of “unfunded mandates” in federal education laws that require Texas, he says, to spend more to meet the rules than it receives in federal dollars. He was one of four governors who refused to compete in Race to the Top, a grant contest that he called “a federal takeover of public schools.”

Margaret Spellings, the education secretary in the latter years of the Bush administration, said that before No Child Left Behind, when federal laws had few strings attached, many states showed little progress raising student achievement, especially for poor and minority students. “We tried that for 40 years,” she said. “The results were far from stellar.”
For his part, Mr. Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, which has long had the nation's top public schools, at first resisted the education law, but he came to embrace it. More recently, he has praised Mr. Obama's education secretary, Arne Duncan, for promoting “school choice” and tying teacher evaluations to student test scores.
But Mr. Romney is clearly feeling the hot breath of Tea Party anti-federalism. In a debate last month, when Mr. Perry accused him of being a Race to the Top fan, Mr. Romney responded, “I don't support any particular program that he's describing.” In fact, Mr. Romney had praised Race to the Top the day before.
Closing the Education Department has long been a talking point of some Republicans, though it was ignored in practice. As a presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan campaigned to close it in 1980, the year it was created. But he found no Congressional takers and, as president, ended up expanding its budget and ambitions.
It is unclear whether the current field of candidates favors not just shrinking a Washington bureaucracy, but also eliminating the department's entire $68 billion budget. Most funds support broadly popular programs: classroom enrichment for poor students, local aid for students with disabilities and Pell grants for low-income college students, often the first in their families to go to college.
Presumably not many of the Republican candidates want to zero out all this money. One who appears to be Mrs. Bachmann, who promises “the mother of all repeal bills” to undo education laws dating from the Great Society.
“Over a three-year period,” she explained in August at a rally in South Carolina, “I'd take the money we send to schools and write to superintendents, ‘No more requirements you have to deal with, but over three years you won't have any money.' ”
For now, conservative crowds are applauding.
But that argument risks rattling independent and suburban voters in the general election, when Mr. Obama is sure to champion a strong federal role in lifting student achievement and ensuring fairness.

“You can imagine,” said Frederick M. Hess, director of education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, “the Republican candidate is saying, ‘Not only do I want to end the Education Department as a bureaucratic monster, but I want to defund programs for needy kids or special-needs kids,' or ‘I want to let states spend those dollars on other kids.' That's a very difficult debate for the Republican candidate.”
It is midday on the Inner West and South Line and three pigeons have just boarded the train. Not accidentally trapped on board by closing doors but three travelling purposefully together. It seems the pigeons just fancied a Sunday excursion.
Three stops later, having evidently reached their destination at Central, they hop down the steps and they're gone in a flap. No time for tapping on or tapping off.

Photographer Grant Turner, who put the picture on his Newtown PIX photo blog, said the birds did not appear lost or stressed.
‘‘As we approached Central I picked up my bag and they hopped down the stairs and stood waiting patiently to get off like everyone else,'' he said.
Right after it happened, Israel's ambassador to the United States described Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's “insult” to Vice President Joe Biden as the worst crisis to hit relations between the two countries in three decades. A week later, the blowup had largely blown over. Both sides realized what they usually realize when irritated with each other, which is that it serves the interests of neither to quarrel in public. Netanyahu, who is no fool, would be a big one if he antagonized his country's most powerful ally, especially while calling for a posse to hunt down Iran's nuclear program. President Obama, who was already unpopular in Israel, needs Jewish support to win re-election. All parties regret expressing their true feelings.
But even as the incident of the Mistimed Zoning Announcement fades, it points to an ongoing shift with large political implications in both countries. Relations haven't ruptured, but Israel and its historic allies in the Democratic Party have drifted away from each other. Simply stated, the instinctive solidarity that American liberals, many of them Jews, have long felt with Israel is on the decline. The frustration vented by various members of the Obama administration over Netanyahu's intransigence is an illustration of this fissure, not the cause of it. The more everyone says that nothing's changed in the relationship, the more you know it has.
If you want numbers, various polls document the disenchantment. Shmuel Rosner, an astute Israeli journalist who blogs for the Jerusalem Post and writes for Slate pays a lot of attention to the partisan gap in support for Israel. It has jumped dramatically of late, with 80 percent of Republicans expressing favorable view of Israel, according to Gallup, as compared with only 53 percent of Democrats. One recent study found that only 54 percent of Jews under 35 who aren't Orthodox are “comfortable with the idea of a Jewish state” (as compared to more than 80 percent of those over 65). Among younger Jews, only 20 percent rated as “highly attached” to Israel in another poll. If you want examples of the shift in sentiment, read just about any Jewish columnist for a major newspaper. Thomas Friedman of the New York Times spent last week arguing that Biden under-reacted to Israel's announcement about the new housing units in East Jerusalem, comparing Israel's policies to drunken driving. Richard Cohen of the Washington Post is writing a book arguing that the founding of Israel was a well-intentioned mistake.
One might well fill a book with all the possible explanations for rising liberal, and in particular Jewish liberal, qualms about Israel. But the blame has to start with Israel's occupation of Arab lands and its settlements policy. Israel never meant to take over the West Bank and Gaza—it got stuck with them after the 1967 war. But decades of harsh occupation have made dispossessed Palestinians, the majority of whom have long favored a two-state solution, the sympathetic victims in the conflict. Revisionist Zionism—the Biblically based claim that Israel has a right to the territories—has wrought tremendous damage to the Israel's moral standing. Encouraging religious and political extremists to settle in those territories set a wedge between Israel and its liberal supporters, who see annexation as both impractical and immoral.
But if the stupidity of the settlements is obvious to most American Jews, it is not to the majority of Israelis, who have chosen a prime minister who represents the rejection of a two-state solution. At the same time, American liberals have recoiled from the pattern of miscalculation and inhumanity—there is no other word for it—in Israel's attempts to protect itself from Hezbollah and Hamas. Last week, I saw the journalist Lawrence Wright perform a moving and disturbing monologue entitled “The Human Scale,” based on his time reporting in Gaza. Whether or not one accepts the judgment of the Goldstone Report that Israel's bombing and reinvasion of the strip involved war crimes, Wright's piece (at New York's Public Theater this weekend) is a persuasive case that it constituted a wildly disproportionate response. Like the second invasion of Lebanon in 2006, the reoccupation was immensely destructive and counterproductive, sowing new seeds of hatred that will bloom for generations.
Barring a breakthrough in the peace process or a change in the Israeli government, I'd predict the drift to continue, with Likud-Republican-religious-AIPAC supporters settling into one camp and Kadima-Democratic-secular- J-Street supporters coalescing into another. It's hard to see this as good news for either Israel or Democrats. American liberals are an external part of Israel's conscience, and when it disdains them, it becomes a harder and more isolated place. The support that Israel has gained from millenarian American conservatives is no substitute, in part because such allies aren't persuasive global advocates for Israel.
For Democrats, the fracturing of Jewish support, which is crucial both in terms of money and swing votes in a few key states, hardly bodes well. Those who undertook the “great schlep“- to Florida to convince their grandparents to vote for Obama may be getting an earful from them now. Obama won nearly 80 percent of the Jewish vote in 2008. I doubt he will get as much of it in 2012.

A vulnerability in a multimedia framework present on Version 12.04.5 of Ubuntu can be exploited by sound files meant to be played on the venerable Nintendo Entertainment System, according to security researcher Chris Evans.
The vulnerability is the result of a flaw in an audio decoder called libgstnsf.so, which allows gstreamer Version 0.10 to play the NSF files that the NES uses for music. NSF files, when played, use the host system's hardware to create a virtualized version of the NES' old 6502 processor and sound hardware in real time.
+ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Cool Yule Tools 2016: Digital disruption at Santa's Workshop + Android deems Instagram worthy of its presence
What the exploit does, in essence, is taken advantage of the way NES cartridges used to handle switching between certain memory registers to run code on an unsuspecting Linux user's desktop. (The sample exploit Evans provides uses the vulnerability to run Xcalc.)
“This exploit works against what I would consider the ‘default' install,” he wrote in a blog post. “During Ubuntu install, there's a question along the lines of ‘hey, do you want mp3s to work?' and of course the correct answer is ‘yes.' Various extra packages are then installed including gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad. This package includes libgstnsf.so.”
Evans suggests that the exploit could theoretically be distributed via email attachment, drive-by download targeting Google Chrome, or by USB, though it's unlikely to become a widespread threat.
It is, as Evans makes clear, not a particularly serious zero-day. The flaw appears to only exist in Ubuntu 12.04.5, which is an older (though still supported) version of the popular Linux distro. The fix is as simple as removing libgstnsf.so, which doesn't even result in a loss of functionality, since there's another decoder that can play NSF music from the NES.
What's more, exploit code requires an attacker to program in the arcane 6502 language designed for the NES processor, relying on the way the virtualized 6502 processor translates this code to deliver malicious instructions.

A Washington DC federal court judge has ordered the State Department to turn over Hillary Clinton's emails that immediately followed the terrorist attack in Benghazi to the conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch.
As RT reports, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson reviewed the documents and rejected the government's contention that the records had been properly withheld under FOIA exemption.
The “Defendant contends that it properly withheld eight identical paragraphs in two different emails, which were summaries of calls between the President of the United States and the Presidents of Libya and Egypt in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack,” wrote Judge Jackson in her memorandum opinion on March 20.
The State Department argued the summaries were meant to provide information to senior officials to be used in their decision making on how to respond to a national security crisis.
Plaintiffs argued the subject line of the email “Quick Summary of POTUS Calls to Presidents of Libya and Egypt,” and the FYSA annotation, a common acronym for ‘For Your Situational Awareness' “refute any suggestion of careful analysis, deliberation or judgment.
“The Court finds that the two records, even if just barely pre-decisional, are not deliberative,” and “the Court finds that the misconduct exception cannot be evoked in this FOIA action…and defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted in part and denied in part… Defendant is instructed to produce documents C05739592 and CO5739595 to plaintiff,” wrote Judge Jackson.
Judicial Watch hopes the emails will reveal what Obama and Clinton knew following the attack.
“Does President Trump know his State and Justice Departments are still trying to provide cover for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?” said said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement “An extraordinary court ruling that could result in key answers about the Benghazi outrage is being opposed by the Trump administration. This may well be an example of the ‘deep state' trying to get away with a cover up – if so then the Trump administration must put a stop to it.”
Perhaps it “does make a difference” after all…

Middlesbrough FC transfer target Marten de Roon is expected to jet into the UK for a medical this week, the Gazette understands.
The 25-year-old Dutch midfielder currently plays for Atalanta but the Italian Serie A club have accepted a €14m bid from Boro .
De Roon is believed to be one of Aitor Karanka's main summer transfer targets and is set to visit Rockliffe Park to complete the deal in the next 48 hours.
If Boro do get their man - and until a contract has been signed, nothing can be guaranteed – it will be something of a coup.
De Roon is rated as one of the best young defensive midfielders to have emerged in Europe over the last couple of years and is capable of playing at an extremely high intensity.
He's wanted by Serie A giants Napoli, among others, but after initial talks with Boro he wants to come to the Premier League.
De Roon, who represented Holland at Under-19 level, started his career with Sparta Rotterdam before joining Heerenveen four years ago.

Last summer he signed for Bergamo-based Atalanta, where he was a first team regular.
Boro have apparently been scouting him intensively for the past year and are hopeful of getting the deal over the line.
His arrival would give Karanka formidable options in the defensive midfield zone with Adam Clayton, Grant Leadbitter and Adam Forshaw all hoping to feature there next season.
Representatives from diverse communities on the front lines of climate change march at the front of the People Climate March in New York City in 2014.
This past weekend, I had the honor and challenge of presenting at the Fifth Annual Climate Conference of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). For the past three years, UCS has been proud to be one of the sponsors of this summit at Dillard University, in New Orleans, and we're looking forward to continuing to support it in years to come.
For me personally, this year's event took an important turn when a Howard University student stood up and posed a good, hard question: How does your whiteness inform your work on climate change?
An honor…
It's an honor to speak to the HBCU Climate Conference.
Its co-conveners are environmental justice luminaries, people you feel lucky to have met. Dr. Beverly Wright of Dillard University is founder and director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and a larger-than-life EJ scholar and voice. Dr. Robert Bullard of Texas Southern University is considered the father of environmental justice.
The conference's speakers leave an imprint. Friday's keynote speech, for example, was delivered by Reverend Lennox Yearwood, leader of the Hip Hop Caucus, a star in the climate movement, and a source of inspiration since I first heard him speak back in February, 2013 at the DC rally against the Keystone Pipeline. (I was so happy, I told him, when he tweeted one of my blog posts earlier this year…)
And its participants—the students, experts and activists gathered—were energized as they discussed both their studies and their activism. As Dr. Bullard described the buses of HBCU students that would be heading north to DC for the April 29th People's Climate March, I was inspired and hopeful for the climate movement taking shape.
And a challenge
And it was a challenge for two simple reasons.
First,“green groups” have historically had a poor reputation in this community. In addition to being overwhelmingly white, groups such as the Sierra Club, the National Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, and UCS, among others, gained that reputation over many decades by, at best, not obviously caring about environmental justice concerns, and at worst, diverting attention from those concerns and exploiting them when advantageous.
Indeed, in his keynote address, Reverend Yearwood elicited strong, even angry agreement from the audience when he railed against these groups that, in essence, have not cared about them.
Second, I'm white. One of the many things that means is that the privileges I wear around—for much of my life, many of them unwittingly—are perfectly obvious in this setting. And it doesn't really matter if I try to check my “invisible backpack” at the conference door; everyone knows I leave with it and that this sets me, maybe irrevocably, apart from the mostly African-American attendees. And that, if I'm totally honest, makes me uncomfortable.
Most participants at the HBCU gathering have had to become familiar with being one of just a few people of color in the crowd. The same isn't true for most white folks; I get to be comfortable most anywhere I go.
As Reverend Yearwood spoke, however, I felt my whiteness more and more acutely. In his narrative, as a member of the environmental community I wasn't necessarily the enemy of those gathered, but nor was I a friend. As African-American children grew up in the shadow of coal-fired power plants, breathing unhealthy air and developing childhood asthma, environmentalists from the big green groups showed up, he lamented, only when it was in their interest—e.g., as part of an effort to shut down a particular power plant.
As he spoke, I started scratching out and scribbling over my original opening remarks. I couldn't, I realized, launch straight into our shared cause and mutual enemies in the climate fight. Before I could do anything close, I needed to make clear that at UCS we get it, or at least we're really trying to; we're here at this conference as part of ongoing efforts to right some past wrongs, and to support the growth and strength of the environmental justice movement on its own terms and turf.

An excellent question
I was on an all-white panel. I gave my talk. The audience seemed engaged and people lined up to ask questions. The young woman from Howard University prefaced hers by saying “at Howard, we learn to ask the hard questions.” And she did.
Her question—how does my whiteness inform my work on climate change—was kind of the elephant in the room, she said. The whole conference was about how the participants' blackness informed their work. What about my whiteness?
Indeed. Oddly, it was something of a relief to get this question. I had no immediate idea what to say. So I started with where I come from; with the fact that I grew up within half a mile of a coal-fired power plant; that I developed asthma as a child. I guess I was trying to say that what Rev. Yearwood was describing isn't completely foreign to me. Or that my whiteness might mask relatable things about me or connote some privileges that I didn't in fact have. I suppose I was just trying to humanize myself and be seen.
My parents were activists, I went on; my dad was a social justice organizer when I was small. Of the many issues we would talk about, the many things wrong in the world, climate change is the one I was drawn to. It felt like the mother of all problems; how could I not work on it?
After this, I said, is where my whiteness probably comes most into play.
I have worked on climate change for nearly 20 years. And for much of that time, I was troubled by, but didn't engage with environmental justice issues in an active way. What would play in my head was something like: I'm a person who's working hard on an important issue, I'm in the battle, trying to keep my head above water, and that's enough. It's not the only issue, I would say, but it's a big one, and my work over here will have to do. I didn't have to engage in environmental justice, personally, because my privileges sheltered me from most EJ concerns. And I didn't engage in it professionally because, where I worked, we had different top priorities.
To change everything, we need everyone
What I've since come to see is this: that's not how we win, any of us. There's not my piece of the battle and your piece of the battle. There's just the battle.
At this moment, here in 2017, many of us are losing our piece of the battle. And if we don't join forces to win it, we're all lost. And if we don't come to the table with openness and willingness to engage with each other's concerns, we won't join forces.
I didn't say this at the time, but I was reminded of the Peoples Climate March in New York City, back in 2014, where the motto was “to change everything, we need everyone.”And truly, it felt like everyone was there that day, marching down 6th Avenue. And as we looked around, we could feel it: this is what America looks like; this is how we change the world.
And outside of those high-profile times when we come together as a movement, we at UCS have a role to play as scientists and as allies.
Quite simply, ensuring that the concern of the Union of Concerned Scientists extends to equity and environmental justice and that, in that spirit, we show up and contribute more—that is just the right thing to do.
Good climate allies: May we know them, may we be them
It's just the past few years that I've come to see this clearly. It's a journey and I'm still on it. But I understand now that we can't be satisfied chipping away at our issues. We've got to look up, see the concerns of our allies, and find ways to show up for them.
Speakers had just a minute or so to respond, and so I left it there.
There's more to it, of course. Like the fact that my whiteness afforded me the luxury of being out in nature a lot and, through this, delivered me to the problem of climate change through a very certain door—a different door than some in the EJ community.
Or the fact that, in this battle, some of us face much greater risks than others—the low-income neighborhood that doesn't get rebuilt after a storm, the indigenous community whose ways of life are breaking down under climate stress, the urban residents who struggle to cope as heat waves worsen. For now, folks like me are sheltered from much of this. So folks like me need to recognize that, while what we bring to the table is valuable, others are the very face of climate change.
The movement we're seeing take shape in response to climate change is growing, necessarily, to be about more than climate change. It's also about climate justice and jobs and social equity and human rights. And it's only because each of those additional concerns found a place at the table that, today, we have the climate movement that we so desperately need.
I'm hanging my hopes on this movement.
I may always be one of its more privileged members. I aim to always be a fierce and hard-working one and, increasingly, a good ally.
I'll be at the March for Climate, Jobs, and Justice in Washington, DC, on April 29. There the Peoples Climate Movement will be in the streets in all its many-faceted glory (and I do mean glory; if you haven't marched, join UCS and others and experience for yourself). And I'll march like I work each day: for a stable climate, for my kids, and in solidarity with the millions of folks with whom I share this common, essential cause.
If I see the Howard student there, I will thank her for sparking the good conversations I've had since.
And to our blog readers, please ask UCS tough questions on these issues going forward and help hold us accountable. We won't always have a ready answer. But we will always try to do what's right to win this fight.

As new Medicare rules kick in, some 2,200 hospitals nationwide are facing financial penalties for 30-day readmission rates for myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and pneumonia. Medicare payments will be lowered by as much as 1%.
Investigators at the Skeptical Scalpel Institute for Evidence-Based Outcomes and Advanced Research (SSIEBOAR, catchy acronym, don't you think?) have come up with a plan that is certain to lower readmission rates across the board. Some have said the idea should be patented, but the institute is not-for-profit and thus is willing to share.
The solution is quite simple — let the patients die. Yes, death reduces readmission rates for all diseases, not just MI, CHF and pneumonia.
Oh, there may be some resistance and relatives of the patients may complain, but at least Medicare will be satisfied and after all, isn't that why we became doctors?
Another outcome measure, hospital length of stay, is also positively impacted by death. For example, if the average length of stay for a patient with a heart attack is 4 days, a patient who dies on hospital day #2 would lower the hospital's average. Death also results in fewer resources being utilized, which saves the hospital money for patients whose reimbursement is based on the DRG.
I confess. I'm not serious, and the idea is not original.
There are many issues. In most cases, as length of stay is ratcheted down, readmission rates will rise. One way to reduce readmissions is to keep patients in the hospital longer. And what about the things the hospitals and doctors can't control? A recent study found that only 63% of Medicaid patients with diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia actually took their medications regularly.
So what is the solution?
Assessing quality of care in hospitals is a difficult task. People like me have complained about focusing on processes such as the Surgical Care Improvement Project because adherence to process measures does not always correlate with good outcomes. (See previous blog article here.) However, processes are much easier to track than outcomes.
The problem with outcome measures is that experts can't agree on which ones to measure. Even something as seemingly straightforward as death can actually be complex. A 2010 paper in the British Medical Journal on this subject was reviewed in a blog, which pointed out the difficulties with death as a benchmark. This holds true even when death is adjusted for risk.
Readmission rates are also controlled by physicians, not hospitals. Even concurrent review of readmissions by hospital utilization staffs has not been effective in reducing these numbers.
There is another factor. Here's an anecdote that might help you understand the problem: An elderly woman was admitted for congestive heart failure. After a few days of intense medical care, she was discharged. She was readmitted for CHF three days later. When interviewed during her history and physical exam, she admitted that she 1) did not take any of her prescribed medications at home, 2) continued to smoke cigarettes and 3) did not follow her cardiac diet.
Is it really fair to penalize hospitals for readmissions, many of which cannot be prevented?

An attorney for Deputy Clerk Brian Mason said Friday afternoon that Rowan County clerk Kim Davis removed her name from the county's marriage license forms, which may disobey a federal judge's order, the Associated Press reported.
According to court documents, Mason told his lawyer Davis confiscated all original forms upon her arrival back at work on Sept. 14, and provided a replacement that deleted her name and all mentions of the county.
This was Davis' first week back on the job after being jailed five days for continually refusing to follow federal law and issue marriage licenses to LGBT couples.
Davis' office began issuing license to gay couples while she was jailed, and Mason vowed to continue issuing them even if Davis attempted to interfere.
Davis' attorneys have long asked for accommodation that would allow the clerk to perform her duties without violating her personal beliefs, and asked a federal judge to remove Davis' name from the licenses.

Read the fulfiling, via BuzzFeed's Chris Geidner:
Abou Diaby looks set to put his injury nightmare behind him as the Marseille midfielder revealed on Wednesday that he has 'never been so close to a return' to first-team duty.
The Frenchman left Arsenal in the summer after making only a single appearance in his final season at the club following a series of injury struggles.
After failing to earn a new contract under Arsene Wenger he joined Marseille in July 2015 but has failed to make a first-team appearance so far after suffering a fresh setback in November.
Abou Diaby revealed on Wednesday that he is finally close to ending his injury nightmare at Marseille
The former Arsenal midfielder has not made an appearance in professional football since September 2014
The former French international insisted in a press-conference that he has 'never been so close' to a return
But now the former France international insists he is ready to make his long-awaited bow in a Marseille shirt as he looks to get his stuttering career back on track.
'I have never been so close to a return. I feel good,' Diaby said at a press conference on Wednesday.
'At the moment, all of the lights are green for me. I am ready to play.
'My last match was in September 2014. For three years I have been toiling. It is time to put it behind me. I need to rediscover passion and enjoyment. I am lucky to be able to play football at the highest level.'
Diaby joined Marseille in July 2015 after his Arsenal ran out and he could play this Friday against Rennes
Diaby made his final appearance for Arsenal in a Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton in September 2014
The 29-year-old last played professional football in September 2014, when he started in Arsenal's Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton.
He played 67 minutes that night before being replaced by Santi Cazorla, but that was to be the extent of his contributions for the rest of last season.
His Marseille debut could arrive on Friday night with Rennes visiting the Stade Velodrome, or on April 2 against Bastia after the international break.
The Frenchman joined Arsenal from Auxerre in 2006 and made 180 appearances for the club in nine years
Diaby heads a winning goal against Liverpool in January 2010, one of 19 goals he scored for Arsene Wenger
DIABY AT ARSENAL 2005-6: 16 GAMES, 1 GOAL 2006-7: 18 GAMES, 1 GOAL 2007-8: 28 GAMES, 4 GOALS 2008-9: 36 GAMES, 4 GOALS 2009-10: 40 GAMES, 7 GOALS 2010-11: 20 GAMES, 2 GOALS 2011-12: 5 GAMES, 0 GOALS 2012-13: 15 GAMES, 0 GOALS 2013-14: 1 GAME, 0 GOALS 2014-15: 1 GAME, 0 GOALS
With France hosting this summer's European Championship, Diaby has not given up hope of representing his country again, though he concedes he is unlikely to make Didier Deschamps' final squad.
'To be back in the French shirt one day would be a great thing,' he added. 'But I am not thinking about that at the moment.'
Diaby spoke about his decision to move back to his homeland last summer, and believes he is receiving better medical attention now at his new club.
He said: 'I spent nine years in England, I wanted to change my environment and I think that it helped me for my return.
'The medical methods are different at Arsenal and Marseille. What is essential is that the method works. I could not find better medical help than here at Marseille.'
Where to Stream: Girlboss
More Options
Girlboss does a lot of things right when it comes to the Netflix series based on Sophia Amoruso's clothes flipping brilliance in 2006. It's funny, it's got a strong message of female ambition, and it makes for a great binge. But what it really nails, so, so hard, is the night of Thursday May 18, 2006.
After Sophia (Britt Robertson) drops a wedding dress off at the cleaners and races against the clock to get it into the hands of a very particular bride, she joins her pals on the couch to watch the season three finale of The O.C.. They stare on wide-eyed as Ryan (Ben McKenzie) carries a limp Marissa (Mischa Barton), a memorable wink back to the season one trip to Tijuana, away from a car as it blows up after a run-in with the evil Volchok (Cam Gigandet) in “The Graduates”, when Sophia suddenly gets up to take a phone call. This girl is ALL business, so much so, that she walks away from the scene where Ryan tries to shake Marissa back to life!
To be fair, Sophia does state that Seth (Adam Brody) and Summer (Rachel Bilson) are “way more interesting” and looks forward to them hugging “Peter Eyebrows” (Peter Gallagher) and then jumps up to talk shop. Annie (Ellie Reed) can't take her eyes off the screen, while her boyfriend Dax (Alphonso McAuley), asks out loud, “What's wrong with Melissa?” Annie is holding out hope, dropping a Chrismukkah reference as the nerves build.
“Oh shit, she's dead?” Shane (Johnny Simmons) gets out in between bites, and the ever clueless Dax dares to ask if “That Melissa chick important?” Fighting back tears, Annie accurately explains, “She's not just a character on a show, ok? She's also really pretty.” She then has the unfortunate job of telling Sophia that “those monsters killed her,” and Sophia has to grapple with the fact that she just missed “the most significant TV event of our lifetime” due to a work call.
“I hope this means they make Taylor Townsend (Autumn Reeser) a regular next year, “ Shane weighs in, with Annie angrily asking, “Who the fuck likes Taylor Townsend?” This exchange remains hilarious because that is indeed what they did, turning Taylor from an annoying classmate to an incredibly likable core crew member. Her relationship with Ryan can be pointed to as one of the high points of the show's final season.
But let's examine why Girlboss captured such an important pop culture moment so perfectly. Did they browse through our journals from that fateful May night for accuracy? Because they really did it justice. In May of 2006, many young people were indeed gathered around their TVs taking in this season finale. DVR and Tivo existed, but it's unlikely that the bartender and band manager roomies would be splurging for that technology just yet. Sophia took a call and missed it all. No rewinding, no clip on YouTube just yet. And the worst part? The next day it's all anyone could about. It's the first thing out of her pal Nathan's (Cole Escola) mouth, explaining how he “literally just stopped crying” and how his mother already created a Save Marissa petition online.
These were the exact conversations we were having that week: who these characters were, why they were important, and what would it mean for the world if they were no longer part of our favorite TV show? Could they actually be getting rid of the pretty girl from this popular show!? For Sophia, missing a moment like that was a bummer, yes. For anyone else who didn't have their mind on starting a business, and only that, it would've been devastating. But there was no pop culture moment, even Marissa Cooper's super sad passing, that could get in the way of what was truly important to Sophia, and that was being on top of her game when it came to being an entrepreneur. Peter Eyebrows would be proud.

Police investigation is still underway and a report will be sent to coroner
believe the images may have helped explain what went wrong
Friends of a British backpacker who drowned during a diving trip on the Great Barrier Reef claim staff deleted photos that were taken shortly before the doomed young woman left the boat.
Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time.
Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances.
While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted.
The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it.
British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays
'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail.
'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she's dead.'
Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year.
She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning.
Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted.
'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote.
The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted.
Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell
The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned

'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read.
'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.'
Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life.
'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed.
'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued.
This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia
Ms Farrell (not pictured) was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays
When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted.
Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation.
Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs.
'I don't want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We're heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail.
The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death.
Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell's mother Caron, said at the time: ‘The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends.
‘At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help.
‘They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.'
The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell's death are fully understood.
Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there.
She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17.
Screw a La Croix, Parisians just need to step into a park these days to get that sweet, sparkling fix.
The Paris city government has announced they will install a sparkling water fountain in each of the city's 20 neighborhoods. The new fountain initiative looks to keep those dwelling in the city hydrated and cut down on plastic water bottle waste, according to the New York Post.
The fountains, known as Fontaine Pétillante, will dispense carbonated tap water. Eight of them have been wetting whistles since 2010, but 12 more are being installed with the first recently going in near Canal Saint-Martin.
When that first fountain was installed in 2010, head of the Paris water board Anne Le Strat said people always told her they'd drink more water if it was carbonated. “Now they've got no excuse not to,” she told the French magazine 20 Minutes at the time.
That's right. They have sparkling water fountains here. #Paris #sparklingwaterfountain A post shared by Raine Gmoser (@raineyrowan) on Jul 2, 2015 at 2:46pm PDT
A CityLab reporter went and tracked a sparkling French fountain down and was more than pleased with the liquid results. The water was “utterly delicious.” Feargus O'Sullivan went on to say the water was, “Cool but not icy, it's extremely fizzy, with a really fine prickle of bubble mousse that was almost like the mouth-scratchingly effervescent Vichy mineral water older French people drink for vague reasons of health.”
So, just a bit different than the stuff outside an American public restroom.

Britain exiting the EU would be a nightmare for the NWO. Today they showed us how far they will go to prevent a potential “Brexit”. All the way, whatever it takes. They have now turned things into a “hot war”, pitting the will of the people, against the crush of power. Today's psyop was as easy as it was obvious. But if British people are still feisty—even waking up to their EU shackles, this little victory by the EU/NWO might be Pyrrhic. The whole Brexit war has planted the will of the people against the perpetuation of power shackles over the people.
What happened today transcends any false flag aimed at disarming Americans, such as the latest false flag psyop in Orlando.
How Power Works
A professional psyop is rather like planting a garden. Put the seeds in, watch them grow. The garden is the minds of the public. So if Power plants the right seeds, they can grow more power. As you sow so shall you reap.
Today they sowed their usual Satanic seeds in a sinister row. If the British people do not fall for this, we might see a row for the ages! Riots, martial law, blood flood in the streets.
The patsy syndrome is getting so worn out. Here's a recent narrative of today's British psyop—which is wicked in so many ways, but simple as seeds sown in the public mind:
Tommy Mair, new poster boy for anyone favoring Brexit, shouted repeatedly, while stabbing, shooting and kicking MP Jo Cox (new poster girl for “Bremain”), “Britain First!”
So, Jo Cox has been murdered in front of many witnesses—a full daylight public extravaganza! Her Labor Party fought for Bremain!
Back to Tommy Mair (not to be confused with Tony Blair {nice psyop touch there}) has become the face of anyone favoring BREXIT!
Jo Cox has become the face of anyone favoring BREMAIN!
We have in Tommy…well, as Chris Menahan for InformationLiberation
so wisely wrote:
“These are the dirty tricks the establishment will pull not to lose power.
The killer of Jo Cox was reportedly known to be mentally ill and taking meds; those who knew him said he was apolitical, and at least one witnesses was quoted as saying the killer shouted “Britain First” says he said nothing of the sort.
Nonetheless, the media and pro-EU politicians are running with the “Britain First assassinates anti-Brexit politician” narrative….”
The poster-boy patsy.
And, the poster girl for Bremain.
Remember, every picture tells a story.
Don't miss part two, tomorrow….
Sims 4: University Life
Sims 4: Pets
A lot of fans want "Sims 4 pets" if you go into any Sims 4 related discussing group or in any fan pages and ask the players. Pets would really be a very good addition to the game as we've seen in the past games. Also similar to owning a store and restaurant in Sims 4, EA could add a new feature to run your own Pet shop in the world. They could add in new careers such as Pet Detective(Ace Ventura, anyone?), Animal Rights Advocate among others. They could also add in new skill set such as Animal Whisperer, and others that I think of at the moment.
EA could really blow our minds by adding a whole new kinds of pets and a pet room stuff in the expansion. Another cool idea would be being able to pet wild animals in Sims 4. Only time will tell.
Sims 4: Supernatural
I know that EA has already released the Vampire Game Pack that let us do some Vampire related stuff and new objects in the game but it'd be really cool if they released a lot more supernatural characters in the game like in Sims 3 such as Werewolves, Fairy, Witches, Zombies, etc.
Similar to the ideas that I've mentioned, they could add new careers such as Witch Hunters, or something like these in the game. They could also add in new supernatural characters that would be the result of two different kinds of supernaturals "woohoo-ing".
Sims 4: Generations
A lot of time or everytime when I'm playing the Sims, I always disable auto ageing cause auto ageing just feels so fast to me. Also, I never really liked the idea of going old of a sudden after the adult stage in the game. The developers could really add in tons of new life stages in the game, ok! not tons of life stages but add some more into the mix. They could also let us select some traits for our Sims after they reach a new life stage.
Sims 4: Seasons
Just like the previous games, Sims 4: Seasons could have new seasons that'll change accordingly in all the worlds in Sims 4. I have a strong feeling that they're gonna create different worlds for different seasons which would kinda suck. They could also add some new clothes and objects in the game.
Snowboarding like in Sims 3 could be introduced again too.
Sims 4: World Adventures
As the name suggests, this expansion could be really great and BIG as it'd probably add a lot of new worlds into the game. Not only that, it'd also add more clothes and objects into the game. They could also add in a new career (Travel Blogger maybe) and traits (different languages) and host of other skill set into the game.
Sims 4: Future Living
In this expansion, they could add a lot of items and clothing that will be related into the future. I'm thinking of cool new electronic gadgets being added into the game and flying cars,etc. They could also add new tools in build mode that would help us create a lot of cool looking futuristic homes.
Sims 4: Cars Expansion
A lot of Sims 4 players are demanding Cars to be put into the game. This feature used to be a regular in the previous games, but for some reason EA decided to ditch it. Probably to earn some cash by releasing another DLC that add cars. This expansion could do just that and add some cars into the game. They could add a lot of other vehicles in the game and new careers such as race car driver, pilot, etc.
Sims 4: Castaway
Sims 2 Castaway was the first SIms game that I had played. It had a story oriented gameplay along with free play option. Similar to Sims 2: Castaway, they could add in the story oriented expansion pack in Sims 4. They could do it in a haunted house or an island.
Sims 4: World Creator and Terrain Editor
Not really an expansion but EA could add these new features into the game in the updates. Being able to create simple world in the game could really add a lot of fun in the game and be a really fun experience for the players. And with the terrain editor, builders in the game could build really cool houses in the game.
What are some expansion packs and features that you'd like to see in Sims 4. Lets us know in the comments below and we shall add it in the list above. Peace oot.
It's almost 3 years after Sims 4 was released back in 2014. Up until writing this piece, 3 expansion packs have been released for the game so far. Sims 3 had a lot of expansion packs and EA has promised us a whole lot of expansion packs for Sims 4 as well.In this post, we shall look at 10 expansion packs we really need in Sims 4 ASAP.Almost everybody loved the university expansion in Sims 2 and Sims 3 and a lot of fans are eagerly waiting for this expansion pack to arrive. I still remember playing Sims 2: University Life back in the day almost all the time. It wa the only expansion pack that I actually played when I had Sims 2. The expansion could add a new university world like they did in Sims 3 or add 3 different universities like we saw in Sims 2. This expansion pack could also add feature to build your own university or a small elementary school or highschool in our world. Sims in the university could have a feature to do part time job and join various clubs and what not in this expansion. Fans in the Sims 4 community have already built a College Mod and it'd be great so see an official expansion from EA soon.
This woman has lost her head. Well, to be accurate, her head has lost her body and she is in desperate need of a new one. Real scientists have enjoyed only limited success in performing head transplants on dogs and monkeys, but fortunately she doesn't live in the real world. She's in the scifi universe, where she can find plenty of cranial transplant technicians able to equip her with brand-new body. In fact, we've got a whole list of places she can go to get them. Nazi conspiracies, two-headed buddy comedies, and spoilers ahead.

Gorilla-Man of the Headmen: Dr. Arthur Nagan is a skilled surgeon who experimented with transplanting gorilla organs into humans. But the gorillas took their revenge, transplanting Nagan's head onto a gorilla's body. As a member of the villainous team the Headmen, he continued to use his surgical skills, transplanting Chondu the Mystic's brain into Nighthawk's body. The Head (1959): Also known by its German title Die Nackte und der Satan, The Head features both a disembodied head and a pair of head transplants. Professor Abel, who is dying of a heart condition, has developed the miraculous Serum Z, which can keep disembodied heads alive indefinitely. When Abel's willing body donor dies in the middle of the operation, his lab assistant, the nefarious Dr. Ood, uses the serum to keep Abel's now-disembodied head alive. Ood is in love with the beautiful but hunchbacked nurse Irene Sanders, and wants Abel's help in transplanting her head on a stripper's body. Unfortunately for Ood, it all goes to pot when Irene falls for the murdered stripper's boyfriend and Ood finds himself on the operating table.
The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962): Dr. Bill Cortner is a successful mad scientist who already has a mutant creature to his name. When his fiancée Jan is decapitated in a car accident, Cortner manages to get her head back to his lab in time to keep it alive. Like Ood, his plan is to commit murder to procure a new body for his beloved. But Jan doesn't want a new body; she just wants to die.
The Day They Put Humpty Together Again by Margaret Jones (1968): Jones' book explores the possible consequences of radical surgery on personal identity. After doctors perform the first head transplant, the recipient suffers a severe identity crisis. Is he the person he was? Is he the person whose body he possesses? Or is he someone else entirely? The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant (1971): This is one of two bizarre tales of mismatched heads occupying the same body to come out of the 70s. After a homicidal maniac breaks into a scientist's home, kills the caretaker, and is himself mortally wounded, the scientist inexplicably decides to transplant the killer's head onto the body of the dead caretaker's mentally challenged son. Predictably, it's the maniac who asserts control over their shared body and they begin terrorizing the countryside.
The Thing with Two Heads (1972): This second double-header moves into the territory of buddy comedy. A wealthy white racist tries to cheat death by having his head transplanted onto a healthy body. But after going under the knife, he wakes to find himself sharing shoulders with Jack Moss, a black death row inmate. The two end up on the run, with Jack hoping to find the evidence that will clear his name.
The Thing with Two Heads has frequently been cited as one of the worst movies of all time. But, on the plus side, it features a young Rick Baker as a two-headed gorilla and inspired a classic moment of Simpsons goodness:

Professor Dowell's Testament (1984): After murdering the body of his lab partner, Professor Dowell, Professor Kern continues to keep Dowell's disembodied head alive in his office. The head continues its previous research, the revival of human organs, and Kern takes the credit for Dowell's disembodied breakthroughs. But when a young woman's head ends up on the body of Dowell's son's girlfriend, Dowell is compelled to reveal himself and the nature of Kern's crimes. Professor Dowell's Head the original novel by Alexander Beliaev, was inspired by real-life scientist Sergei Bryukhonenko, who famously developed a method of keeping a severed dog's head alive.

We're still easily on time to start the Anarchy and Onslaught leagues at 6pm PST Friday (1pm NZ Time Saturday) as previously mentioned.
Additional 0.11.0 patch notes:
The Energy Shield display on the life orb is now a lot larger if you have a lot of Energy shields.
New vendor recipes have been added.
Monster life has been increased in early levels and decreased in later levels.
Skeleton elemental projectile spells have been reduced in all difficulties (beyond the general monster rebalance).
A consequence of the item allocation changes is that if you're playing alone, the labels of valuable items that drop will appear for a few seconds even if you're not currently showing the item labels.
We've added some experimental code that triggers a local position resync if you are stunned while desynced by more than around 2 metres. The goal of this change is to catch the situations where you are pinned by monsters on the server without being able to see them on the client. This is a low-impact change that should prevent some avoidable character deaths.
Please spread the word to your friends about the new leagues! Given the number of people that have played the game since January, we're keen to break some server records over the weekend :D Please note that the above time is a day later than the Wednesday (NZ Time) that we previously mentioned. While I feel we could deploy at the original time, we're going to allocate an extra day of testing to make sure that everything works properly before we unleash it. I'm sorry about the wait, but we believe the extra day will pay off massively.We're still easily on time to start the Anarchy and Onslaught leagues at 6pm PST Friday (1pm NZ Time Saturday) as previously mentioned.Please spread the word to your friends about the new leagues!

When President Barack Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act into law in December, he gushed about Antonio Martin, the eighth-grader who had introduced him. “He's taking advanced classes to get a head start on high school credits. He plays the violin. He plays sports. He volunteers. He owns one share of stock in Tesla. So he's clearly going places. I'd invest in him if I could,” the President told the press corps.
These days “investable” is high praise for a 13-year-old, and Antonio was in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building as a poster child for the latest round of federal education reform. But there's a central contradiction in American education rhetoric between the universalism and the outstanding example: How can every student be exceptional?
The name of George W. Bush's 2001 No Child Left Behind Act was roundly panned in liberal circles as another egregious example of the administration's doublespeak — John Kerry called it “one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky.” The law's plan was to raise every student to adequate performance in testable subjects and create a floor for American education. It didn't work out that way (unsurprisingly), but the law's framing stuck. After all, no politician wants to run on leaving some children behind to ignorance and menial employment.
As a name, “Every Student Succeeds” ups the ante on “No Child Left Behind.” Adequacy is by definition a low standard, and being merely satisfactory doesn't necessarily lead to better life outcomes than inadequacy. If public schools are preparing some students to succeed (and they had better be), then the schools must set up all students to succeed, or at least provide them the opportunity. “We want to make sure that through this piece of legislation, with our hard work, with our focus, with our discipline, with our passion, with our commitment, that every kid is given the same opportunities that Antonio is getting,” Obama said.
The President says he's talking about opportunities, but he's also talking about outcomes. It's one thing to want all kids to have access to advanced classes, music instruction, sports teams and volunteer work. It's another to expect them to take advantage of all of them at the same time. President Obama described Antonio as “doing his part” with his full load of curricular and extracurricular activities, but every student can't be prepared for college: There just aren't enough seats. Because admission is limited and competitive, only the top two-thirds or so can be, by definition, prepared for higher education. No matter how hard they work, how brilliant they are, the lowest-scoring cohort will be labeled unprepared and accused of not “doing their part.”
Today marks the 10th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's death at age 93. The excerpt below, from The President's Speech by C. Edwin Vilade, a book that tells the stories behind some of the most memorable presidential addresses in American history, tells the story behind Reagan's most famous speech: his “Address on East-West Relations” delivered in Berlin in 1987 that contained the line, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”
An indelible image of Ronald Reagan is him standing near the Brandenburg Gate within sight of the infamous Berlin Wall and almost shouting, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” It is great theater, but ironically, the immortal words almost did not make it into the speech at all. Only Reagan's rhetorical instincts, and the arguments of his speechwriter, preserved them for history.
Reagan saw some hope for increased freedom within the Soviet bloc, including Berlin, and decided to visit West Berlin in 1987 after an economic summit meeting in Italy. He set his speech at the historic Brandenburg Gate, which had been kept closed since the city was divided. He wanted a speech that would be as memorable as Kennedy's “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech.
Speechwriter Peter Robinson was assigned to produce a draft. He was told only that the president would speak at the Berlin Wall, there would be a large crowd, and he “probably ought to talk about foreign policy.” Not content to sift through State Department white papers and country briefings, Robinson left for Berlin.
In his book, How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life, Robinson recalls that the ranking diplomat mainly advised him on what not to say—particularly warning him against bashing the Soviets, or mentioning the Wall. Germans had gotten used to it, he said, and any statement about the Wall would be in bad taste. The diplomat instead broached several pedestrian ideas such as increasing air routes to Berlin and turning Berlin into a conference center.
That night, Robinson says, he accepted a dinner invitation among ordinary Germans. When he asked if fellow guests had “gotten used to” the Wall, one said he would never get used to it because he hadn't seen his sister, who lived on the other side of the wall, for twenty years. His hostess erupted that if Gorbachev was serious about peace he would “tear down this wall.” When Robinson returned to Washington, and after many revisions, he put the phrase in the speech.
While Robinson claims that he originated the line, others have different recollections. Richard Allen, a White House national security adviser, remembers a 1978 trip to Berlin when he was an aide to then-Governor Reagan. Standing near the Wall, Reagan said, “We've got to find a way to knock this thing down.” Aides recall him occasionally mentioning that he would like to see the wall come down during staff meetings years before the Berlin speech. Reagan himself does little to clarify the origin. In his autobiography, he quotes the “tear down” passages, but merely says that he “felt strongly” about them, not that he or anyone else originated them.
Regardless of who thought of it or wrote it first, the line almost didn't make it into the speech. White House and State Department foreign policy experts were determined to take every opportunity to further improve relations with the Soviets. They would never agree to high-profile saber-rattling by the president within sight of the Berlin Wall. Robinson and his fellow speechwriters knew this, and pulled a fast one to keep the phrase in the speech.
Reagan was to give nine speeches on his European trip, and they bundled the Berlin draft among them, delivering them to the foreign policy reviewers late in the week. The writers knew the policy wonks would not have time to read the whole stack and remove the offending language before their regular Monday morning speechwriting meeting with Reagan.
At the meeting, Reagan remarked that he liked the phrase, and the speechwriters were exultant. With his backing, “tear down this wall” stood a good chance of staying in. The opposition continued, though. Colin Powell, then on the National Security Council, repeatedly tried to have it excised because it might insult the Soviets and cool relations. Chief of Staff Howard Baker thought it should be dropped because it was “unpresidential.” The attempts to remove it continued even after the President left on the European trip. But the speechwriters stood firm, pointing out that Reagan wanted the line in.
Watch Reagan deliver the famous line:
Story highlights An aid convoy brought food and medicine to the Syrian town of Madaya 10 days ago, but people are still starving
Activists say up to 10 people have died from malnutrition since the delivery; more than 20 died before it arrived
Experts have repeatedly warned that residents will continue to starve unless consistent aid is allowed in to the town
The video in this story is difficult to watch, but CNN believes it is important that people see it. We have verified the images in it were shot recently in the town of Madaya, but cannot independently confirm the medical issues of those featured in it
(CNN) The world's attention may have moved on, and the aid convoys driven away, but in besieged Madaya, now caught in the bitterly cold grip of ice and snow, people are still starving.
Ten days since the last aid convoy brought emergency relief to the rebel-held Syrian town, which remains surrounded by pro-government forces, activists have smuggled out video they shot, showing the continuing suffering of emaciated adults and children trapped there.
Aid workers say up to 10 people have died from the effects of long-term malnutrition since the last convoy arrived in Madaya; more than 20 died before the aid was delivered , they say. Experts have repeatedly warned that the people of Madaya will continue to starve unless consistent medical and food aid is allowed in.
A doctor in the town's makeshift hospital, in the basement of a house, said that one woman named Lama Issa died Monday from acute malnutrition, after not responding to treatment with intravenous drips; a man was also said to have died. CNN cannot independently confirm their deaths.
JUST WATCHED The forgotten people of Madaya Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The forgotten people of Madaya 01:49
One of the videos CNN was able to verify shows a man, Fawaz Saeef Aldin, 50, almost unconscious, his stomach concave from longstanding malnutrition. Lamar, his 9-month-old granddaughter is next to him, her face skeletal.

Mark Zuckerberg said today that he will be taking two months off when his first daughter is born.
"Priscilla and I are starting to get ready for our daughter's arrival," the Facebook founder said, referring to his wife, Priscilla Chan, in a post on his Facebook page.
"We've also been thinking about how we're going to take time off during the first months of her life. This is a very personal decision, and I've decided to take 2 months of paternity leave when our daughter arrives."
This news is, of course, great for Zuckerberg and his family. We wish them the best. But this is a big deal for the rest of us, too. Zuckerberg is perhaps the most prominent chief executive of a major public tech company to take this much time off following the birth of his child. That's important, because executives set the tone for a company (and, in some ways, the country) when it comes to balancing work and family.
Like some other major tech companies, Facebook already offers new parents a parental leave plan considered very generous by US standards. New parents at Facebook can take four paid months off. They receive benefits such as $4,000 for each child born or adopted. As we've written before, however, employees may feel reluctant to take advantage of such plans if their companies don't have a culture that encourages taking time off. And company culture typically comes from the top.
"Every day things are getting a little more real for us, and we're excited to start this next stage in our lives," Zuckerberg wrote. Let's hope more companies will offer new parents more leave, and that dads will be able to follow his lead.
President-elect Trump will be getting a new limousine in a couple of weeks, but it won't be the first time he's had a stretch Cadillac.
In the 1980s, the then-NJ casino magnate worked with Cadillac and Dillinger-Gaines Coachbuilders to develop two “Trump” limousines that he planned to use to shuttle VIPs around.
The Trump Golden Series and Trump Executive Series both were rolling offices fitted with all of the high-tech features of the day, including VCRs, Fax Machines and paper shredders. Car phones, too.
Trump described the Golden Series as the “most opulent stretch limousine ever made” and the Executive Series as a “slightly less lavish” take on the same design. He planned on buying 50 of the cars, but only two prototypes were made in 1988 and the order for the rest never happened. He did by one of them for his father, though.
And soon it could be yours!
According to an article in the New York Post, the two limos are now owned by an anonymous collector in the United Kingdom who is considering auctioning them off, given the results of the recent election.
Photos of what appears to be the Executive Series today indicates that it is well-worn, but in good condition. The last time the Golden Series was listed for sale on the internet, when it was still in the United States, it had 22,000 miles on it and the asking price was $80,000, but efforts to reach the previous owner for more information have been unsuccessful.
Unfortunately, the chance that Trump himself will buy one and turn it into the next presidential state car are unlikely as work on an updated “Beast” is well underway, with the armored limo expected to make its debut on Inauguration Day.
LOWELL, MASS. (WHDH) - New Hampshire is a political battleground. An independent state that may end up going both ways, Democratic and Republican, on Election Day.
Hillary Clinton is tightening her grip on the Granite State. In our exclusive 7News/UMass Lowell poll, she has 45 percent of likely voters; six percent more than Donald Trump, at 39. Gary Johnson gets nine; Jill Stein, two. Just four percent are still undecided.
While neither Clinton not Trump is well-liked, more than 50 percent of voters view them both unfavorably, Clinton is considered far more qualified to be president, with 61 percent saying she has the necessary qualificiations to be president. Thirty-four percent, much less, say he does.
“Trump is seen as temperamentally unfit and unqualified by large majorities of voters, and he still only trails by six,” said UMass Lowell pollster Dr. Joshua Dyck. “The Democrats in this election nominated a bad candidate and the Republicans went and nominated a worse candidate. And our data shows that.”
But don't blame Trump's standing on just his infamous bus tape. He was already losing support when it became public.
“Republican voters who left Trump left him before this tape came out,” said Dyck. “Only seven percent of Republicans in our survey say that that tape affected their vote.”
In the New Hampshire Senate race, Kelly Ayotte has a precarious lead with 45 percent, one point ahead of Maggie Hassan's support from 44 percent of likely voters.
As the race nears its end, Ayotte is running away from Trump as quickly as she can, now saying she won't vote for him because of his comments about women.
“Trump is only getting 77 percent support among Republicans, he's jumped the shark and the down-ballot Republicans are just trying to hang on,” said Dyck.
For many years, no one won the presidency without winning the New Hampshire primary. But not this year. So the road to the White House won't go through New Hampshire but the road to controlling the U.S. Senate will.

Politics is a full-contact sport, but it's not OK to hit below the belt. Ben Carson, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio spent last week blaming frontrunner Sen. Ted Cruz for a problem that originated from Team Carson's own disorganization—even after media records and Iowa exit poll data cleared Cruz. Before you vote in your primary, you deserve the truth.
“You don't have to be a politician to tell the truth,” Carson quipped in a recent debate. No, you don't. So let's start telling the truth. Unless you're now a politician.
Carson finished 4th in the February 1 Iowa caucus. Cruz finished 1st, followed by Trump and Rubio respectively. Carson claims he was cheated out of votes because reports circulated—minutes before the caucuses began—that he was dropping out.
Carson's mismanagement of his campaign communication led CNN to report on TV (video here) and on Twitter that he was dropping out of the race. The Rubio and Cruz campaigns re-shared this news.
Rubio denied doing so on Fox News: “You'll never hear about me making up rumors that someone is dropping out in order to try to get votes.” But investigative journalist Jennifer Burke showed that Team Rubio did disseminate the CNN report, perhaps even more aggressively than Team Cruz. Rubio persisted in blaming Cruz for an activity that his own campaign partook in last week in New Hampshire: “Obviously, we've all seen the reports of the rumors that he spread about Ben Carson.”
Here's an excerpt of the CNN TV report:
CNN'S DANA BASH: “Our Chris Moody is breaking this news, that Ben Carson is gonna go back to Florida, to his home…regardless of how he does… He's going to go there for several days. And then afterwards, he's not gonna go to New Hampshire. He's not gonna go to South Carolina, he's going to go to Washington D.C… [for] the National Prayer Breakfast … where he got himself on the political map. …Very unusual!”
CNN'S JAKE TAPPER: "Plus, he's already announced that he's going to be coming out and speaking at 9:15 local, 10:15 Eastern, no matter whether or not we know the results, because he wants to get home…"
BASH: "Look, if you want to be President of the United States, you don't go home to Florida. …That's the end of the story."
CNN didn't do its homework in its haste to “break” a story. Instead, CNN led viewers to believe that a vote for Carson was a wasted vote. The bigger problem, however, is Carson's response.
NUMBERS DON'T LIE
Given that the CNN story broke minutes before official voting, it had little impact. We know this by analyzing the official 2016 Iowa caucus exit numbers. If you click the link and scroll to the section titled “When did you finally decide whom to support in today's caucus?” you'll find these key facts:
Rubio: If anyone benefited from the last-minute report that Carson was dropping out, it was Rubio, who leads the top four Republican candidates with the number of voters who decided to vote for him “just today.”
Cruz: He has the highest number of voters who said they decided “a week” or “a month” priorto the Iowa caucus to vote for him. So, a bulk of Cruz voters came to the caucus knowing that Cruz was their guy. They were uninfluenced by last minute news reports.
Overall: Trump and Cruz have the highest number of voters who said they decided “more than a month” before the caucus to vote for their candidates. Rubio was far behind in this regard and Carson has the fewest number of voters in this category.
Translation: if anyone benefited from indecisive last minute voters, it was Rubio! Cruz and Trump's voters already had their minds made up.
Cruz personally visited all 99 Iowa counties. His hard work paid off. Cruz has the highest number of voters (36%) who answered “Yes” to the question: “Did anyone personally contact you about coming out today to support your candidate?” Guess who has the fewest? Carson (10%).
Cruz braved the snow and humbly appeared before small crowds in quaint rural towns. Carson didn't have a solid ground game. Even on the day of the caucus, he was counting down the seconds until he could jet home to sunny Florida.
WILL CARSON PRAY FOR CNN?
Carson said he would “pray” for Trump after Trump deliberately questioned his mental stability. But I guess he's not praying for CNN, or Cruz, after this mistake.
“I don't want a person that's got pathological disease,” Trump said about Carson. “If you're pathological—there's no cure for that, folks. There's no cure for that.” Trump said that on purpose. Trump also intentionally stood before a huge crowd of Iowa voters and moved his belt buckle around while mocking and discrediting Carson's childhood story of failing to stab a friend because of the friend's belt buckle. Oddly, Carson never blamed his downward spiral from first place in Iowa—months ago—to fourth today on Trump's purposeful slander.
Which is worse, a mistake or intentional slander? Carson acts like the mistake is worse.
Instead of praying for CNN, Carson urged the media to crucify Cruz. He demanded an apology from Cruz and told him to fire his staffers. Cruz, out of total graciousness, made the mistake of apologizing to Carson. Carson responded like a petulant child and continued to tweet all last week about “dirty tricks.”
But Cruz wouldn't let an ABC reporter bully him with the ‘dirty tricks' line: “Is it a dirty trick to pass on your news stories? You're in the business. Would you think it was if I'm forwarding an ABC story or just a dirty trick to pass on CNN stories?”Boom.
“THE MOST DECENT MAN”
Ben Carson has a reputation for being honorable. I personally have admired him for years, using my columns to lavish praise upon his work as a surgeon and politician. I even dedicated a portion of my book to laud his healthcare reform plan. So, I'm heartbroken and disappointed by his recent behavior.
The stakes are too high to let Carson's claim of being cheated in Iowa go unchecked. We will lose the White House in 2016 to a socialist (Bernie) or a woman who treats confidential emails like cotton candy (Hillary) if we run a weak candidate. Last week, Carson fired over 50 of his staffers. His campaign had no traction going into Iowa. So why is he selfishly spreading rumors about the strongest Republicancandidate? Attention? Book sales? A TV gig? Who knows.
WORDS CAN NEVER HURT ME
Donald Trump immediately took advantage of Carson's claims and demanded a “new election.” His sidekick, Sarah Palin, piped up on Facebook about “dirty tricks.” Cruz pushed back, saying: “It seems his reaction to everything is to throw a fit, and I understand that Donald finds it very hard to lose. But at the end of the day, the people of Iowa spoke.”
Trump curled up with his proverbial security blanket and quickly changed his tune from mean to docile. (It's dangerous to bully a strong man. You're liable to get hurt.) Within hours, Trump was telling talk radio host Hugh Hewitt that he has “always liked” Cruz and would consider Cruz for his VP. What a pivot!
A doctor. A businessman/reality-television star. Carson and Trump revel in their “outsider” status. Trump insists that he is pure as snow—incapable of being influenced by lobbies—because he “self-finances.” Carson reminds us that he is “not a politician”—even as he runs for president.
The presidential race is the Super Bowl of politics. Just as it would be unsportsmanlike for the losing football team to falsely accuse the winner of cheating to hide its own lack of preparation, it is very unsportsmanlike for Carson, Trump and Rubio to call Cruz a cheat to mask their own weak ground games in Iowa.
Now you know the rest of the story. Ben Carson is now a politician. Share the truth. The stakes are high.
Not too long ago, a local chamber of commerce in New Jersey held a networking event. The mixer was purely business-focused, all meeting and greeting and wheeling and dealing. Business cards were swapped, email addresses were exchanged. But one guy was looking to make a different kind of deal.
The next day, one event attendee, a surgeon, sent a mass email to many of the new people — maybe about 30 or so, all openly cc'd — he'd met the night before. As it turns out, this guy wasn't networking with people to gin up business, even though that was the entire point of the event. This man is on a mission: he's looking for a matchmaker, and if the dates go well, he's willing to pay in cash or free Botox.
What follows is better suited for Patti Stanger than a chamber of commerce networking event, but don't let that stop you, Doc.
dear fellow networking event attendees,
i was very late to last night's event, so i only got to meet a small fraction of you guys (i tried to hurry, but you really can't hurry up surgery!)
sorry about this mass email, but it's more efficient on my end. i'm also kind of a “semi-professional networker” with 10,000 people in my gmail contacts list, 1,000 friends on my various FB accts (even though i don't use FB myself), 1,000 followers on Twitter, and Google will “auto populate” my name, so perhaps some of you “beginning” networkers will learn some tips of how i'm always trying to create a “win-win” (this skill set was stressed a lot when i got my MBA from NYU)
my situation is somewhat unusual in that i am the #1 surgeon of my type in the northeastern US by volume, and have performed nearly 20,000 procedures over the last 15 years, so i really don't need additional income (which is the unusual part). i'm actually so successful that most of the reason i attend networking events these days is for personal networking, not business networking–i'm trying to meet the right woman to fall in love with, marry, and start a family with (i'm single, never married, and really want kids before i'm old!)
i've hired some professional matchmakers over the years, with OK results (eg i've dated 2 of the matches for 6 months each, which is pretty good). the services vary enormously in quality and price (with an imperfect correlation). for example, doing the math (ie taking their fee and dividing by the number of introductions they made), i've paid between $100 and $1,000 per introduction (which is worth it to me, even on the high end, since i have an unusual time/$ preference, ie have more $ than time)
clearly, i'm still trying to meet the right woman the “normal way” like out at events, or through dating websites (which is, shall i say, “normal-ish”). however, i do strongly feel that having as many sources as possible only increases the potential candidate pool, and increases my chances of meeting the right person (hence my offer to you)
so if you (or any of your friends) like playing matchmaker, please read my preferences/parameters below and try to help me out.
please send me the parameters and picture of the potential setup, so i can say if i'm interested, before you start introducing us (otherwise it's kind of awkward then saying that i'm not interested). if interested, i'm offering the following “thank-you gifts” for your kind help:
first date set up: $100 cash
second date (with either same person, indicating a better match, or a 2nd person): +$200 or free latisse worth $300
third date (again can be w same person): + $300 or free botox worth $500
4th date (w same or diff person): + $400 or free Juvederm injections worth $900
5th date (same conditions): + 500 cash or 1 eye free LASEK worth $2000:)
this is what i am in general looking for.
These are my Hard (Objective) Dating Parameters which are NOT Flexible:
(this means I am only willing to pay for introductions if ALL these criteria are met)
(if you want to set me up w someone missing 1 of these criteria, I may accept, but will not pay for that)
Age 27-35 (ideally 28-34) No kids, wants kids in the next 1-2 years College graduate, doesn't have to be a great school, but needs to have finished the degree Skinny (i.e. dress size 0-2, if you don't know what that means (many men don't) it means very skinny) Caucasian (not black, not Hispanic, not Asian) Healthy lifestyle (defined as no smoking, no drugs, good diet, no hard drinking,
These are things that I would ideally prefer, but don't require (i.e. I am flexible about these criteria)
Christian (any denomination is fine, I'm Catholic but not very religious, prefer any religion over none, must be religiously tolerant, will not be compatible with someone who thinks everyone else is damned) Graduate degree or very good undergraduate school (more compatible since I went to 3 Ivy League schools i.e. Dartmouth, Columbia & Harvard, as well as Emory and my MBA from NYU) Spent significant time in another country other than the US (either born somewhere else or lived out of the US for a total of 6 months or more, not on a vacation, doing something like school or work) Spent significant time (>1 yr) living in a city of 1 million or more (so can live in NYC if moves here) Likes animals and pets, particularly dogs (because I plan to have a dog for the rest of my life)
These are the Soft (Objective) Criteria I require, but are difficult to match (because they're qualitative)
This article is about the rancor. You may be looking for other individuals named Tosh. This article is about. You may be looking for
Tosh was the herd-mother of a rancor tribe that belonged to the Singing Mountain Clan on Dathomir. According to a New Republic Intelligence report, Tosh was the largest and oldest rancor ever cataloged. She was the mother of Dhum and Ichor, who was killed in battle against the Nightsisters.
Tosh was very capable on the battlefield, aiding the Singing Mountain Clan using varied primitive weapons. In one instance, after seeing an Imperial walker murder her daughter Ichor, she went on a rampage, completely smashing several walkers and then stomping on a Nightsister who threatened Luke Skywalker. She was capable of scaling steep cliffs and crossing large crevasses effectively while carrying both passengers and heavy cargo.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan has said that Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul will likely cameo in the forthcoming spinoff Better Call Saul.
AMC announced in September that Breaking Bad character Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) will be the focus of a new comedy prequel.
Gilligan has now confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Better Call Saul will be a one-hour comedy, and will retain Breaking Bad's unique visual style.
"We're both [Gilligan and producer Peter Gould] one-hour drama guys. So we figured, 'Why not shoot Saul in the same way?'" he explained.
"Let's shoot it in Albuquerque, let's get as much of the crew back together as possible, and let's do it the way we did it before so that it will be of a piece with that pre-existing fictional universe that we had so much fun creating."
Gilligan - who plans to take part in the writing for season one with producer Gould - added that Cranston and Paul have already expressed excitement at making appearances in the prequel.
"Personally, I'd have a hard time resisting putting all these guys in for a cameo or two every now and then," he declared.

Better Call Saul is projected to air sometime in the autumn of 2014.
Odenkirk recently said that he knows very little about the storyline of Better Call Saul thus far.
Breaking Bad recently came to an end in September to record ratings.
Breaking Bad - all five seasonsBreaking Bad: All Five Seasons
I am still confused.
I have the 'Complete Collection' in Bender's Head that carries Seasons 1-4 and the four direct-to-dvd movies, and Volumes 6 and 7.
I think I'm missing the episodes on Volume 5, but can't determine if Volume 5 and Season 5 are the same.
I wish they'd stick to one nomenclature to avoid confusion.
I'd like to see a list of Seasons and Volumes, side by side for comparison so I don't waste money on duplicates.

The American animated science fiction sitcom Futurama, created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company, aired on Fox from March 28, 1999 to August 2003; Cartoon Network's Adult Swim aired reruns of the show from 2003 through 2007. Following a commitment from 20th Century Fox Television to produce four straight-to-DVD Futurama films, Comedy Central announced in June 2006 that they were resurrecting the show and would air the films as new Futurama episodes (reconfiguring each film into four episodes) after each film's DVD release.[1][2] Comedy Central began airing Futurama reruns in January 2008 and broadcast the first film in March 2008.[3] Following the four films (considered the fifth season of the show), Comedy Central has broadcast a sixth season of twenty-six episodes, split over 2010 and 2011.[4] A seventh season was announced in March 2011 and debuted in the summer of 2012.[5]
As of August 29, 2012, Futurama has broadcast 127 episodes, concluding the first half of the seventh season. The series is currently on hiatus and will return in mid-2013.[6]
The original 72-episode run of Futurama was produced as four seasons; Fox broadcast the episodes out of the intended order, resulting in five aired seasons.
On April 22, 2013, Comedy Central cancelled Futurama, announcing a series finale date of September 4, 2013.[7]

Other than that, I love the series and am disappointed that they are, again, being cancelled (by Comedy Central this time). I hope they can return to TV soon. I also hope they do what they did the last time, and release new episodes as direct-to-dvd movies.
I hate it when the Networks cancel a popular show, just because 'ratings' are down.
I would love to see Comedy Central FLOODED with requests to keep Futurama. Maybe with enough fan mail, they'll reconsider their folly and bring Futurama back. Also, enough complaints to the FCC will help to inform them that this show is in the public interest and should be reinstated...
At the very least, I hope Matt and David chose to make direct to DVD movies in the interim...
MANESAR: Maruti Suzuki 's General Manager Human Resources was burned to death in the violence in its car plant here allegedly triggered by workers yesterday for which 91 workers were arrested.A tense calm prevailed today as the plant was shut following large scale arson in which Awanish Kumar Dev , general manager (human resource), was burnt beyond recognition while 100 others were injured. Kumar's body was identified by his family today and the company alleged that the violence was an orchestrated act of mob, which has implications beyond one company or region.91 employees, who were arrested, were produced before a local magistrate who remanded them to 14 days judicial custody. They have been accused of various charges including rioting with weapons, murder, attempt to murder, unlawful assembly, assault and trespass. The violence in which several executives, managers and supervisors were attacked and office facilities, security office and fire safety section gutted arose out of an alleged casteist remarks by an official against a worker.The worker allegedly beat him up following which he was suspended and that triggered the large scale violence. Haryana government and police pledged to take stringent action against those responsible for violence.Maruti Suzuki said the violence is a negative negative trigger for existing companies and regions across the country as also for prospective investors and job seekers. The firm, which witnessed strikes on three occasions last year, has already announced plans to set up a new plant in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore, a move which was interpreted as coming against the backdrop of violence in the region.Gurgaon, an industrial hub neighbouring the national capital, was the scene of large scale violence by workers and outside forces at the Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India's unit and subsequent strikes in other units.Terming violence at the Maruti Suzuki plant as "tragic and unfortunate", commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma on Thursday said such incidents will not shake confidence of the industry."It is a tragic and unfortunate incident. It should have never happened. The state government acted promptly last night itself," Sharma told reporters in Chandigarh."I do not see that one incident would shake industry's confidence," he said, adding the state government is capable of handling the situation and protecting the industry and investments.Labour unrest has been erupting in the area frequently. Maruti had witnessed troubles on three occasions in the last one year causing a total production loss of about Rs 2,300 crore.With Maruti Suzuki India's share price tanking close to 9 per cent today, its investor wealth eroded by Rs 3,183 crore in the stock market.
*EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – *Roger Lewis Jr. this week received a promotion he didn't request.
The Giants had five wide receivers in uniform last week against the Los Angeles Chargers. Four of them suffered injuries, three of them ending their seasons. The only wideout standing at the end of the game was Lewis, a second-year pro who made the team last season as a rookie free agent from Bowling Green. When the Giants face the Broncos in Denver on Sunday night, Lewis, who has played all of 18 career games, will be the team's most experienced receiver.
“He goes from being the fourth or fifth guy, young guy, now he is the elder statesman,” offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan said. “He's a versatile player. He's a guy that has made plays for us. Had a heck of a play the other day. He's smart and, of course, the versatility is something that we'll be relying upon to be able to move him around and help the other guys as well.”
Lewis said his new responsibility will not alter his approach.
“I prepare every week like a number one receiver,” he said. “I prepare and go hard every practice, and I'm not going to change anything, I'm just going to go out and do what I've been doing since I was five years old.”
As Sullivan noted, he did it last week, when his one reception was a nifty 29-yard touchdown on the left side of the end zone. This season, he has eight catches for 102 yards. His career totals are 15 catches for 199 yards, and three scores.
“It felt great, with the touchdown catch,” Lewis said. “But it's over with, and I want to win. We lost that game and I want to get a win. I'm itching for a win right now.”
As is everybody on the team. While everyone on the team is confident they can earn their first victory this week, the question the football public is asking is, “Can the Giants win with their young and untested cast of wide receivers?”
Odell Beckham, Jr. (ankle), Brandon Marshall (ankle) and Dwayne Harris (foot) underwent surgery this week and are out for the season. Sterling Shepard also injured his ankle and has not practiced this week.
“It's kind of different (in practice), because I was able to talk to those guys on the field,” Lewis said. “But now I've got to talk to them off the field, and call them and stuff like that. It's kind of different. But I'm growing up and I'm ready to take the challenge.”
Lewis was asked what he thought about the Broncos' cornerbacks watching him on tape, instead of Beckham and Marshall.
“It's pretty interesting, but at the end of the day, I knew one day this would happen,” he said. “One day someone will be looking at film and trying to figure out what I'm doing. So it's not a surprise.”
Share. And speaks about potential DLC and sequels. And speaks about potential DLC and sequels.

The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann has spoken about the upcoming movie, a potential sequel, and what DLC remains.
Talking to IGN during last night's BAFTA Game Awards 2014, at which The Last of Us picked up five awards, Druckmann began by clarifying the upcoming The Last of Us movie will be an adaptation of the game, though how it'll be realised is unclear.
Exit Theatre Mode
"It's an adaptation of the story of The Last of Us," he confirmed. "As far as where we go and how we make it fit into a film, how it takes into account the unique properties of film... We're not sure yet. We're only just scratching the surface."
Druckmann went on to confirm that we should expect another piece of multiplayer DLC to arrive shortly, which will be the third that counts as part of the Season Pass. Following this, we asked if the rumoured Last of Us sequel had progressed beyond the brainstorming stage, but it appears Naughty Dog has no plans to rush anything.
"We don't know yet," Druckmann said. "We're still trying to figure it out. We're brainstorming some stuff, so we'll see where that goes."
Exit Theatre Mode
We previously heard rumours that a sequel to The Last of Us was already in development, though it seems nothing solid has been decided.
Last week, Troy Baker, the man responsible for bringing Joel to life in The Last of Us, revealed he'd be interested in reprising his role for the movie if asked, and urged fans to trust in Druckmann's vision. He's equally interested in returning for a sequel, should Joel once again feature.

The size limit of an app package submitted through iTunes Connect has increased from 2 GB to 4 GB, so you can include more media in your submission and provide a more complete, rich user experience upon installation. Please keep in mind that this change does not affect the cellular network delivery size limit of 100 MB.
Apple today announced that it is increasing the maximum app size from 2GB to 4GB, letting developers release apps that are up to 4GB in size. The extended limits will likely be useful for high-quality game titles that need the extra space to introduce improved graphical effects or longer playtimes.Apple's 2GB size limit has been in place since the App Store first launched, so today's new 4GB limit marks the first-ever size increase. The 2GB size limitation has prevented some games from being available on the App Store, such as Final Fantasy VII. In 2013, Square Enix producer Takashi Tokita said that a version of Final Fantasy VII was "years away" due to the 2GB iOS app size limit Over the last several years, as iPhone and iPad displays have improved in quality, developers have needed to increase the size of app assets to create content suitable for Retina screens. The new 4GB limit will give developers more freedom when it comes to content creation and it also paves the way for higher-resolution displays that may require even larger apps.Though the maximum app size has increased to 4GB, Apple is still enforcing the 100MB over-the-air download limit introduced in 2013.
Seems Bill Clinton got mad at Ken Bone, the last questioner at the debate who asked each candidate what they can say positive about their opponent. Either Bill Clinton didn't approve of that question from Ken Bone, or Clinton was mad that Ken Bone's name sounded too much like “can bone,” something Bill Clinton still does, dicking bimbos. Bill Clinton not only appeared angry at Ken Bone, but it also appeared that he had to be held back from going after Mr. Bone.
Bill Clinton gets angry at Ken Bone
We'll never know what triggered Clinton to get so angry with Ken Bone. The media will never try and find out. For his part, Ken Bone seemed calm, cool and collected. He didn't get rattled by Bill Clinton's screaming and fingering pointing. I don't think Ken Bone's question was all that bad. What triggered Bill Clinton here?
The media is of course in love with Ken Bone now. Basically, instead of admitting Trump won the debate and Hillary Clinton getting crushed, they are claiming Mr. Bone won the debate. Maybe that's what trigger dicking bimbos Bill Clinton. Maybe in his aids looking like body, he thinks Hillary Clinton won or something. I mean look at Ken Bone. Does he really look like he could have said anything to offend anyone? Including rapist Bill Clinton?
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies on Capitol Hill Tuesday on the fiscal year 2018 budget. (Susan Walsh/AP)
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said Tuesday that all schools, including private schools, receiving federal dollars must abide by federal law, but she dodged specific questions about whether she would protect students who were subjected to discrimination based on their religion or sexual orientation.
“Let me be clear: Schools that receive federal funds must follow federal law,” DeVos said. “Period.”
At issue is the president's fiscal 2018 budget request, which includes an array of school choice proposals – $1 billion boost to Title I'm funding for school districts that allow students to use the money at the public school of their choice, $168 million increase for charter schools, and $250 million for a new federal private school voucher program.
DeVos said during the Senate Appropriations Committee's hearing on the administration budget that the proposed voucher program is hypothetical and could take any form. But its underlying purpose, as outlined in language in the budget itself, is to allow students to use federal dollars to attend private schools – including a private religious schools.
The majority of the roughly 450,000 students currently enrolled in private schools through a private school choice program are enrolled in a religious school. But most federal civil rights laws, including Title IX and the Americans with Disabilities Act, provide accommodations for religious organizations so that they are allowed to adhere to their tenets despite running afoul of federal law.
The secretary made waves during her first round testifying on the budget before the House Appropriations Committee last month when she refused to commit to withholding federal funding from private schools that discriminate against students based on sexual orientation or religion.
Her response at the time – that such decisions should be left to states – elicited widespread condemnation from Democrats and civil rights groups.
Democrats on the committee pressed DeVos a number of times Tuesday to clarify her position, and each time she referred back to her assertion that “schools that receive federal funds must follow federal law” – a mantra she repeated dozens of times.
Notably, there are no federal civil rights statutes that explicitly protect LBGT students. The Obama administration sought to change that by, for example, issuing guidance that ensured transgender students have access to a bathroom that matches the gender with which they identify.
DeVos' first major action as secretary was to withdraw that guidance.
“In areas where the law is unsettled, this department is not going to be issuing decrees," DeVos said. “Congress and the Supreme Court have to decide that and settle.”
In one particularly testy exchange, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., charged that DeVos was refusing to answer a question about whether she would allow schools to discriminate on the basis of religion or sexual orientation.
“What you said earlier didn't help us,” he said. “It is an area of unsettled law, but what I think you said is that where it is unsettled such discrimination will continue to be allowed under your program. If that is incorrect, please correct it for the record.”
When DeVos repeated her comments about how schools receiving federal dollars will be held to federal law, Merkley shouted: “I think that it's important for the public to know, today, the secretary of education, before this committee, refused to affirm she would put forward a program that would ban discrimination based on LGBTQ status of students or would ban discrimination based on religion.”
“That's not what I said,” DeVos replied. “Discrimination in any form is wrong.”
Virally-Induced Toxic Allergy Syndrome, most commonly known by the acronym VITAS, is an illness caused by a highly-lethal, highly-communicable airborne virus. Two strains of VITAS rampaged across the world in the first quarter of the 21st century, killing billions from initial exposure and subsequent secondary infections. In many ways, VITAS set the stage for the fall of the old powers and the rise of the new powers prior to the coming of the Sixth World.
Symptoms and Treatment Edit
VITAS becomes evident 12 hours after initial exposure. Following incubation, initial symptoms include fever, chills, and vomiting. If unchecked, VITAS progresses into anaphylactic shock, with an increase in histamine levels causing bronchospasms and vasodilation. Most deaths occur from bronchoconstriction, leading to suffocation.
Average individuals who are exposed to any strain of VITAS have the following approximate statistical likelihood of surviving, presuming drug therapies are on hand:
Humans, elves: 1:216.
Orks: 1:72.
Trolls, dwarfs: 1:36.
Humans and elves have a very high chance of being dead within 12 hours following initial exposure, due to the increased likelihood of succumbing immediately to the induced allergy. Orks and trolls, with their more robust constitutions, are much more likely to survive the initial onset of symptoms, as are dwarves with their innate resistance to toxins and pathogens.
A variety of treatments are available. Tetracycline was initially used against VITAS-1, these treatments gave way to more modern antivirals such as Zeta-Interferon, and have some effect at hindering the virus by interfering with viral reproduction. Subsequent strains are becoming more resistant to antiviral therapy, however. Antihistamines provide some relief to the symptoms.
Magical treatment greatly increases the chance of survival. It is believed to have been another factor in Amerind populations remaining unscathed from the disease. There is also evidence that native folk medicines helped stave off the infection in Africa.
Historical Impact Edit
Although there have been rumors and conspiracy theories that a viral-form biological weapon with similar vectors and symptoms was being developed at a research lab in Christmas Valley, Oregon (now currently owned by TIC in Tir Tairngire), the first recorded cases of VITAS occurred in 2010 in New Delhi, India and would soon spread to all corners of the world.
Over the next two years, the VITAS pandemic killed off approximately a quarter of the world's population (based off 2002 projections of world population growth, approx. two billion dead). Asia, then North America and Europe were the first to be hit. The most extreme response to VITAS was the "Terror Time" in Mexico City, in which the self-proclaimed Citizen's Action Committees burned down most of the city to prevent infection. A similar incident occurred in Calcutta, India, resulting in the entire city being rebuilt. The Native American internment centers would be spared from the VITAS outbreak, ironically, since their populations were isolated.
In 2011, VITAS hit the African continent, where forty percent of the VITAS worldwide death toll took place. Three-quarters of the population were infected before the World Health Organization and other international organizations could step in, and even when medical supplies where provided, local governments withheld vaccinations from large portions of the populace in order to either sell to the highest bidder or just make sure the people they wanted to survive did so.
In the end, the death toll from primary infection would stand at 750 million in sub-Saharan Africa, over 30 million on the coasts of West Africa, and the island nation of Madagascar would be almost depopulated, with 10 million dead out of 14 million, or over 70% of the nation's population.
Strain II, during the 2020s, did another number on the world, again doing the most damage in developing countries. This strain killed another 10% of the world's population—nine hundred million (900,000,000) people.
Despite many places in the industrialized nations having the therapies on-hand, practically in-hand at the time of infection and onset, VITAS still hacked a swath through the developed world.

The largest city in Saskatchewan, Canada has built its first power plant in over 100 years.
Saskatoon is now home to a $1.5 million Landfill gas to energy facility that will not only be profitable for the city, but has been designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 45,000 tons and generate enough electricity to power 1,300 homes.
During the next 20 years, the city anticipates it will earn over a million dollars every year in revenue from the plant.
Saskatoon expects that from selling power produced by the waste to energy facility to SaskPower, it will make $1.3 million in profits annually. The city's mayor, Don Atchison said “We are really looking at cost-saving measures that will have a benefit to the city in a financial sense as opposed to just doing things for the sake of being green.”
Mayor Atchinson also commented that the amount of annual revenue that is expected is an estimated “three-quarters of a point off property taxes”, which makes it rather significant. He went on to say that the Saskatoon is managing to turn a profit back to city residents and saving C02 at the same time. In addition, the Landfill Gas Collection System is likely to lower odors at the landfill and assist in air quality improvement.
It takes two facilities working in combination to generate energy from Saskatoon's landfill gas.
Jeff Jorgenson, Saskatoon transport and utilities manager explained that essentially how the clean energy project works is the facility takes methane gas from the landfill, cleans it, dewaters it and, once this process is complete, the gas is pumped over to the power production site where it fuels a motor that spins turbines and generates energy.
According to Jorgenson, this waste-to-energy project has been in development for more than six years and it was built over the course of the last two and half years. The facility cost around $15 million. Joint funding of the project was provided by the City of Saskatoon and the federal government.
The mayor stated that the landfill gas project is only one of many green projects that Saskatoon has in the works. The city is also intending to grow its recycling and compost programs and use LED lighting.
Someone over at Microsoft might be in some pretty hot water as their entire E3 press conference may just have been spoiled.
A leaked image posted on NeoGAF forums has revealed an image with a number of familiar game logos and list of games that will apparently feature on the Xbox One at Microsoft E3 press conference next week.
According to the leaked list, here are the games we'll be seeing next week at E3:
Halo 5
Killer Instinct
Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty Land
Forza Motorsport 5
Quantum Break
Halo: Spartan Assault
Ryse
Fable IV
Crackdown 3
Fortnite
Dead Rising 3
Call of Duty: Ghosts
Battlefield 4
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Dying Light
Prey 2
Homefront 2
Beyond Good & Evil 2
Mirror's Edge 2
Rainbow 6: Patriots
Brother in Arms: Furious Four
League of Legends
That is of course assuming that the leak is genuine, but the internet being the internet it's highly likely that the image and listing is fake. It is unknown where the origin of the leaked photo come from (big surprise).
However there might be some truth it, with the listing of “Fable IV” as Lionhead has recently announced opening of the new Fable Forums.
But again, take this with a huge grain of salt and don't believe everything you see on the Internet.
All will be known next week at Microsoft's official E3 press conference on June 10.
Male relatives of sex offenders five times more likely to commit similar crimes, and 40% of risk is genetic, study suggests
Brothers of men convicted of sexual offences are five times more likely than average to commit the same types of crimes, scientists have found.
The study suggests that genetic factors are largely responsible for the effect and that environmental factors, such as sons learning from fathers, have only a minor influence. The authors urged authorities to consider interventions for the male relatives of sexual offenders, including counselling on appropriate sexual behaviour or even offering medications designed to lower sex drive.
Niklas Långström, professor of psychiatric epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and lead author, said: “This does not imply that sons or brothers of sex offenders inevitably become offenders too. But although sex crime convictions are relatively few overall, our study shows that the family risk increase is substantial.”
There is no evidence for a “sex offending gene”, he added. Instead, a constellation of genes linked to factors such as impulse control, intelligence and sexual appetite are likely to influence the risk of a person committing an offence.
The study is the first major investigation of the genetic basis of sexual crime - a subject that had proved too challenging for previous survey-based research. “It's pretty sensitive to ask about these things, so we tried to use officially available data” said Prof Långström.
The scientists used the records of 21,566 men convicted of sexual offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. Around 2.5% of brothers or fathers of convicted sex offenders were themselves convicted of sexual offences, compared to an offending rate of about 0.5% of men in the general population. The authors looked at both rape and child sexual offences and found similar patterns for both.
About 40% of sexual offending risk is explained by genetic factors, a statistical analysis found, and about 2% of the risk was attributed to environmental factors shared between siblings, such as parental attitudes, neighbourhood and education. Unique environmental factors, such as head injuries, peer group influence and social experiences, are likely to account for the remaining differences in risk between people.
The authors make the case for targeting interventions at the male relatives of sex offenders. “We're not saying you should lock up the brothers,” said Seena Fazel, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Oxford and co-author. “It may well be that something extra can be offered to these high risk families in terms of teaching about boundary setting, relationship skills, conflict management.”
However, they acknowledge that the issue would have to be handled with extreme sensitivity and said it was too early to say whether pharmacological interventions would ever be helpful.
“Obviously one has to be careful about not ostracising people,” said Långström. “It's important that it does not become a public thing, where not only has your father committed a sexual offence, but you're forced to attend mandatory courses.”
The idea that sexual offending tends to be clustered in families is not new, but typically has been put down to a “cycle of abuse” - an idea that has probably been given too much weight, the authors argue. Instead, they say, the effect is mostly explained by genetics.
To demonstrate this, they considered the case of maternal half-brothers (typically brought up in the same family home) and paternal half-brothers (who normally live with different mothers). If environmental factors were largely responsible, a much higher risk would be expected in maternal half-brothers whose siblings had committed crimes. But both groups were roughly twice as likely to offend if their half-sibling had previously committed a sexual offence. The link was also about half as strong as for full siblings, again supporting the idea that genetic factors were more powerful.
Dr Rajan Darjee, a consultant forensic psychiatrist in Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said: “Genes influence brain development, and brain functioning underpins psychological functioning, so it should not be surprising to find that genetic factors play a role in sexual offending.”
That genes play a role does not mean that a person is “less responsible” or that crimes are inevitable, he added. “It just emphasises that genes are an important part of a complicated jigsaw.”
A spokesman for the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers, said: “The possibility of carefully targeted interventions and support for families in which the relative risks are higher is an exciting prospect for a committed professional community.”
The risk was found to be slightly higher for brothers (fives times the average) compared to fathers (four times), which could simply reflect brothers being closer in age and therefore more likely to both offend during the study period.
“People don't commit sex offences from zero until they die. You have windows of risk,” said Långström.
The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court has directed the district administration to pay compensation with interest to two victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Justice SC Sharma passed the order on August 17 while hearing the petitions filed by Surjeet Singh (67) and Sharan Singh (68).
Advocate Himanshu Joshi, the petitioners' lawyer, told reporters on Thursday that Surjeet Singh's timber shop was burnt down and Sharan Singh's liquor shop was looted during the anti-Sikh riots in the city in 1984 following the killing of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. The district administration had denied them compensation because their names were not on the official list of victims.
On the basis of records submitted by the petitioners, the high court declared both as riot-affected persons and directed the district Collector to give them compensation for the loss of property with 8.5% annual interest from 1984.
The HC also imposed a total cost of Rs 50,000 on the state government, to be paid to the petitioners, and asked the Collector to file a compliance report within 90 days. If the order was not complied with, the court will initiate contempt proceedings, the judge said.
Who doesn't love summer macaroni salad? My boyfriend's mother makes the most amazing macaroni salad. It's so good that I would eat it for lunch and dinner. My only complaint was that it was made with white pasta and mayonnaise. I took her original recipe and developed my own summer vegan macaroni salad recipe to make this loveable dish just a bit healthier. By replacing white pasta with whole pasta, mayonnaise for vegenaise, and increasing the amount of celery in this dish, you'll find that this macaroni salad has become healthier and just as delicious, if not more delicious!
Makes 10 servings
Each serving one cup
Summer Macaroni Salad Recipe
Here's what you'll need:
1 pound of whole wheat macaroni pasta (NOTE: To make sure this recipe is vegan, you need to get EGGLESS pasta. Most whole grain pastas are made with the flour and water (instead of eggs) but make sure you double-check the ingredient list!)
Half a jar of soy free vegenaise
3 pieces of celery
1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion
2 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons of all purpose seasoning
2 teaspoons of pickle juice
Start by setting up a pot on your stove over high heat with water in it for your pasta. When that boils toss in your pasta. When your pasta is ready, drain and set aside to cool.
NOTE: You should make the pasta ahead of time because it needs to cool before you can mix in all the other ingredients. I usually make the pasta either the night before or the morning of so that the macaroni salad will be ready to eat by lunch or dinner time.
Now let's assume your pasta is cool. Put your pasta in a large bowl. Then take about half of the jar of soy free vegenaise and add that into your pasta. Using a spatula, gently mix up the pasta with the vegenaise. The pasta will absorb some of this up quite quickly. (The first time I experimented making this I used a whole jar of vegenaise – DISASTER. The pasta became very oily and gross. Half of the jar turns out to be the perfect amount. If after making this and letting it sit in the fridge, you still think it needs some more vegenaise, add sparingly!)
Now set that aside and do some of the prep work. Cut a small piece of a yellow onion and chop it finely. You only need enough to fill a 1/4 cup.
Even if you love onion, like I do, too much onion can really ruin this dish. The onion is so strong tasting that it can override the other flavors. I found 1/4 cup is the most you can use without losing any of the other flavors.
Take two garlic cloves and chop them finely, like you did with the onion.
Then wash three celery stalks and also chop them finely. Toss the onion, garlic and the celery into the bowl of pasta and vegenaise.
Add two tablespoons of all purpose seasoning. I used organic all purpose seasoning from Whole Foods. It was a mix of organic onion, black pepper, garlic, parsley, celery seed, tomato powder, basil, thyme, oregano, sage and coriander. You can choose to substitute this with your favorite herbs instead. Also add in two teaspoons of pickle juice. This sounds like a weird thing to add but it actually sweetens and helps to enhance the other flavors.
Mix this all up and you're all set! This vegan macaroni salad tastes best when it's had a little time to set and all the flavors have mixed. Because of that, I usually put it in the fridge for a couple hours before devouring. I've found making this in the morning is a great option because then you can make sure it's ready for your lunch or dinner!

Philips is exiting the consumer electronics industry — according to The Wall Street Journal, the company has announced the sale of its audio, video, multimedia, and accessories divisions to Japanese company Funai for just over $200 million in cash as well as a brand license fee. While Philips was once seen as an innovator, and helped create the DVD and Blu-ray standards, the company has since proven incapable of transitioning to the world of internet media to compete with the likes of Samsung, Apple, LG, and Sony. Even Philips' CEO admitted as much: "Since we have online entertainment, people do not buy Blu-ray and DVD players anymore," Chief Executive Frans van Houten told the WSJ.
While the company has already sold off its consumer electronics business to Funai, it doesn't mean the Philips brand will disappear overnight — the BBC reports that the transfer of Philips' video business won't take place until 2017. As for what's next for Philips, the company will continue to focus on its medical business as well as its burgeoning LED lighting and control systems, the latter of which has given Philips a few less conventional consumer-facing products.
Update: A Philips spokesperson confirmed what the BBC said — the Philips brand isn't going away. Its arrangement with Funai is essentially a licensing agreement. Funai will work with the Philips team in Hong Kong, and the company still plans to launch everything it showed off at CES this year. It also said that there will be future product announcements over the summer, at next year's CES, and beyond that. While the business structure may be changing, the brand itself will still be around for the near future, at the very least.
Update 6pm: A group of Nobel Peace Prize winners have urged mediation in the political deadlock between Spain and Catalonia.
The comments come in a letter on the eve of a Catalan parliamentary meeting in which separatist leaders want to press ahead with secession for the northeastern region.
Nobel Peace laureate Jody Williams, a campaigner against landmines, said the letter has so far been signed by seven more winners, including Mairead Maguire, Rigoberta Menchu and Shirin Ebadi.
The letter says "no side is free of errors" in this process but calls for "mediation and negotiations toward a peaceful resolution of the current stand-off".
Ms Williams said the letter would be posted later on Monday on the Nobel Women's Initiative website.

Earlier: Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy warned that Spain will not be divided by a declaration of independence from Catalonia and said the government is ready to respond to any such attempt.
Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont plans to address the region's parliament on Tuesday evening to debate the current political situation.
Separatist politicians said there will be a declaration of independence for the northeastern region of 7.5 million during that session, although some ruling coalition politicians say the move could be simply "symbolic."
Still, Mr Rajoy was being as explicit as possible in warning on Monday that the national government in Madrid would not stand for such a declaration.
"Spain will not be divided and the national unity will be preserved. We will do everything that legislation allows us to ensure this," Mr Rajoy told the German newspaper Die Welt.
"We will prevent this independence from taking place."
Secession-minded authorities in Catalonia have vowed to break away from Spain after claiming victory in a disputed independence referendum earlier this month.
The October 1 vote has been followed by mass protests of Catalans angered by police violence as authorities tried to stop the vote and, more recently, by others in Catalonia and Madrid urging the unity of Spain.
Yet politicians supporting Mr Puigdemont's minority government and civil society groups backing independence say they will not accept anything less than a full declaration of independence.
"Credibility and dignity suggest making the declaration of independence tomorrow," Jordi Sanchez, the head of the civil group National Catalonia Assembly, said on Monday.
A politician with the Catalan CUP party said the far-left separatists will not accept anything short of a declaration of secession.
"It's very clear to me that those who I represent won't accept any other scenario," Benet Salellas said during an interview at the regional parliament.
Mr Puigdemont has not clarified what his intentions are.
Mr Rajoy's deputy, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, also warned that Spain would act decisively if there was any independence declaration.
"If they declare independence, there will be decisions to restore the law and democracy," she said on Monday during a radio interview.
She called for members of the Catalan government "who still respect democracy and freedom to refrain from jumping into the void."
Catalonia's top judicial official, meanwhile, ordered additional Spanish police protection for the headquarters of the regional judiciary.
The regional Mossos d'Esquadra police force, whose hierarchy reports to the Catalan government, had been in charge until now of guarding the palace in central Barcelona that hosts the judiciary.
But the High Judiciary in Catalonia says its president, Jesus Barrientos, has asked the chief of the National Police force in the region to join in the protection of the building.
The statement says a declaration of independence, even if illegal under Spanish laws, could trigger the suspension of the judiciary and the ousting of its president.

Monsanto Awarded ONE BILLION Dollars Due To Patent Infringement For A Product That Was Never On The Market
from the roundup-ready dept
The damages theory was interesting. Since the accused product was not yet on the market, Monsanto did not seek any lost profit. Rather, Monsanto demanded a reasonable royalty for the research-use made by the defendants. Monsanto argued that the use of Monsanto's invention in DuPont's labs and Pioneer's test fields gave those companies an "improper head start" in making the GM seeds. The judge and jury agreed – if those companies wanted to build upon the invention then they should have first obtained a license. In the pharmaceutical world, 35 U.S.C. § 271(e) offers a research exemption for this type of activity. However, that exception does not apply here because of the low level of regulation over genetically modified food-products. The patent is set to expire in 2014. The patentee's right-to-exclusive-research supported by this case means that the 2014 date offers a starting-date for follow-on competitive research. Any actual products building directly upon the patented invention will arrive on the market sometime later.
We've had plenty of stories over the years of Monsanto's incredibly aggressive stance when it comes to its "Roundup Ready" patents. The company has now been awarded $1 billion from Dupont for infringing on one of these patents. Now, here's a case where we're talking about competing companies, so perhaps no big deal, right? Except there's one tidbit here that makes this interesting: Dupont. So the "damages" to Monsanto would seem to be minimal... except in a court of law apparently. According to Patently-O:Got that? Normally, companies can build on top of others' products as patents are set to expire, so they're ready to launch once the patent has expired. But, in this case, even trying to build new offerings in a lab for use later is apparently an insane billion dollar issue. Even worse, it means that any real competition, which will create more market-reasonable prices, gets significantly delayed as no one can prepare for when the patent expires.

(Newser) – A Nevada man whose family was nearly killed weeks ago by bombs set off by a former colleague has no idea why he was a target, the AP reports. "I don't have a clue what Glenn Jones was up to," Joshua Cluff says. "Do you know why crazy people do crazy things before they do them?" In a phone interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Cluff, 36, said that Jones never threatened him when they worked together as nurses at a hospital in Caliente. He could not recall Jones ever saying a harsh word. Authorities say Jones drove to Cluff's home on July 13. He then detonated bombs inside Cluff's home and in a rental car in front of the house. Cluff's wife and two daughters had fled their home moments earlier. A third daughter and Cluff weren't there.
A search of Jones' motorhome turned up what authorities characterized as a bomb-making lab. According to documents, Jones had bomb diagrams and notes intimating a planned July 4 terror attack against an unidentified US Bureau of Land Management facility. Jones had written in journals that someone named Josh had ordered and funded the construction of the explosive device that would be used. Those notes prompted FBI agents to question Cluff and his wife and search their home. He has since been cleared. "My family is freaking broken now," Cluff says. Jones shot himself in the head during the bombing attack. His body was blown up. (Read more bombing stories.)
In March of 2015, the label Monstercat's regular podcast appeared to fall victim to a hack, as regular programming was interrupted by a teaser for a video from an artist named Karma Fields. "Build the Cities" featured vocalists from in-demand Estonian singer Kerli and remarkable visuals courtesy of Raven Kwok. "Every time I run the system, it will produce a different visual outcome due to randomness of the initial parameters," Kwok explained to Billboard Dance at the time. "So the music video itself is an organized yet unpredicted outcome."
Monstercat Introduces New Artist Karma Fields Via Twitch Takeover: Exclusive
As for Karma Fields: the production was later revealed to be the work of advanced artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the A.I. released its debut album, New Age | Dark Age, which featured more alluring visuals and collaborations with Talib Kweli, C.C. Sheffield, and Juliette Lewis. The deluxe edition of the record, out earlier this month, included classical versions of several songs — along with sheet music for those curious to play the music themselves — and a free BitTorrent bundle containing all the music is forthcoming.
The next step for Karma Fields is to take the show on the road. In order to do so, the producer constructed a 20' by 19' foot hexagonal structure that will show live visuals — again the work of Kwok — which will react to the music. Check out a preview of the set-up below before Karma Fields' NYC show at Webster Hall on April 29. Tickets are available here.
Billboard Dance caught up with Karma Fields to discuss the goals of the project and the transition to live performance. Read excerpts from the conversation below.
Why did you pick Monstercat as the label to team up with?
Honestly I think Monstercat is the future of the music industry. Looking at all the other majors, or even the sub-labels of the majors, they're just kind of gated and they have a system. They run people through, and people have to have the same sound. Monstercat is an open format that's open to change, so I think I saw them as something that's different and unique.
Why do a visual with every song?
The project from day one has been a full audio visual experience. I found Raven's work to be the visual equivalent of my music, where you're using a computer to make stuff that's very organic and human. Through imperfections and things that are unpredictable, if you look at the visuals or the audio, it feels like it's real even though it's made by a computer. The relationship between me and Raven is really natural that way.
Exclusive Premiere: Monstercat Introduces New Artist Karma Fields Via Twitch Takeover
And that's a larger goal for you — to illustrate the blurry line between human and computer?
Exactly. The first album was definitely more the computer side. As I go, the second album I plan to be more human through more audio recordings, different samples, real musicians. It's gonna slowly be an evolution over the years the albums come out.
How did you encounter Raven's work?
I found his Vimeo account end of 2014. He was still in school getting his Masters. I reached out to him, sent him the music, and he hopped on board. We both understood what we were trying to do, and we both saw potential in it.
You have several vocalists on the album — was there any worry from your perspective that the human presence would take the focus off the artificial intelligence component?
Initially that might have been. But it worked out how I hoped where they brought a more human element to it. It's always a collaboration: you work with this singer, they brought what they did, you brought what you did.
Was it easy to get them on board with this sort of unusual collaboration — working with an AI?
It wasn't really a problem. I found the people that I thought were unique and doing something a little different, whether they had been around for a while or were newer. Like with Raven, I sent a bunch of music and visuals, like, here's what we can do, let's make it work. Every time, they were on a board with it.
So the Hex video gives a taste of the live aspect of this project?
That's exactly the live set-up. We're planning our shows now. I'm gonna do a showcase with Monstercat pretty soon; next year we're gonna do a full tour. It's a real simple set-up I designed — it can travel well, it's easy to transport and everything. We plan to take it on the road everywhere we can. All year, Raven and I have been working on the live show, from modeling it to finding the right materials and the visuals and how to perform it. Like all of Raven's work, the visual is based on the music — the visual runs through the music, and reacts to it.

Is that the first A.I. tour that you know of?
I think people have done similar models — if you look at Gorillaz maybe. They put the art form first and don't really stray from that. That's all you need: your music videos, and the feeling of the project is converted into live. Music vs., "pay attention to me." When you're at the show, you're like, I know this — this video is an alteration on the "Build The Cities" music video.
You also put out some classical sheet music with the deluxe edition of your album — what was the thinking behind that?
I thought people would really enjoy it. There are a lot of acoustic covers I see — people playing some basic four chords on the piano and singing on top. But [I wanted] to do it in a bigger way and show that the scope of the project is not about just dance music. The feeling is more important than the genre.
We actually had some of the most downloads of any link I put up with that sheet music. Thousands of people downloaded it in the first day, which I thought was really interesting and a little unexpected. At first I thought it would be a small, passionate group of people. How many people can play songs? I think even people who didn't know how to play piano, wanted to learn how to play piano because of it. Or at least fumble their way through it.
Then you're also releasing a BitTorrent bundle of the music for free?
The way I see it is, people buying music now is very much supporting the artist. If it comes out on iTunes, they know that they can stream it on Spotify or steal it if they wanted to do. But I think people appreciate having the artists chart and financially supporting them. But then there are millions of people that don't do that. If they're not gonna do that, might as well reach out to them. The people who pay still get a head start. You can't stop the internet. You might as well embrace it.
Former Barcelona player Alexis Sanchez declared in a court in the Catalan city on Monday via a video link, where he admitted to tax fraud of nearly one million euros while in Spain during 2012 and 2013.
According to Europa Press, in his declaration from London which lasted a couple of minutes, the Arsenal forward recognised two crimes against the Treasury to a total value of 983,443 euros.
The same report adds that the Chilean international has already returned that money and it is likely, therefore, than an agreement will be reached for Alexis to avoid having to go to trial.
In that scenario, the player's defence team and the Treasury must come to an agreement regarding what size fine should be dished out for the delay in paying the taxes and possibly on the length of a prison sentence, which in any case would be short and therefore suspended.
In the complaint that initiated the judicial process against Alexis which was filed by the Tax Agency, prosecutor Miguel Angel Perez de Gregorio argued that the 28-year-old evaded payment of tax from his image rights via a company based in Malta.
Lausanne, SWITZERLAND - Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating ‘ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected ‘presence' in the room.
Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body.
“Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else,” said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL).
Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body.
The scientists then conducted an experiment to ‘trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects.
Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the ‘ghostly' feeling.
“We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment,” said Blanke.
The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up “sensorimotor” brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances.
The study, published in Current Biology, said that “simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia”.
Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations.
“We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients.”
Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab.
“A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state.”

This is the forty-fourth in a series of posts that report on the state of the parties as measured by opinion polls. By pooling together all the available polling evidence we can reduce the impact of random variation that each individual survey inevitably produces.
Most of the short term advances and setbacks in party polling fortunes are nothing more than random noise; the underlying trends – in which we are interested and which best assess the parties' standings – are relatively stable and little influenced by day-to-day events. [1]
Politics has returned with a vengeance after a brief festive cease-fire. All the parties have moved into campaign mode. News schedules are now daily filled with briefings and the wearying trench warfare of spin. What have the voters made of it all?
Our last report tracked polling up to the beginning of December, so the latest estimates from the Polling Observatory cover two months: December and January.
Labour and the Tories
So far, there is little evidence of any decisive impact on the overall balance of power. Labour support has been stable for the past two months – our February 1st estimate of 32.2 per cent is exactly the same as our estimate for December 1st.
There has been a great deal written in the media about an alleged slump in Labour fortunes, but this story seems to be behind the curve. Labour did lose substantial support in the early autumn, but they have been stable since.
Our February 1st estimate for Labour, of 32.2 per cent, is exactly the same as our estimate for December 1st.
Given that much of the autumn fall in Labour support seems to be concentrated in Scotland, where the recent wave of constituency polls by Lord Ashcroft has confirmed a massive swing from Labour to the SNP, it is possible that overall support for Ed Miliband's party has not declined at all in England and Wales in the past year.
Conservative support has picked up a bit over the past two months, but most of the gain merely recovered the ground lost in November. We now have them at 31.2 per cent, one point behind Labour, and still stuck in the 30 to 32 per cent band where they have been marooned for almost three years. The Tories will hope that their positive economic message, and David Cameron's sizeable ratings advantage over Ed Miliband, will start to deliver as the election approaches, but as yet we see little sign of this.
Ukip and the Lib Dems
Ukip received less attention over the winter than they enjoyed during their vintage autumn, crowned by two by-election victories. This may explain the slight dip in their poll ratings, down 0.7 points to 15.5 per cent. Both of the main parties will hope that Farage's insurgents will be squeezed in a more sustained way as election day approaches, but there is no evidence of this yet – 15.5 per cent remains above the highest ratings the party received before 2014.
The Liberal Democrats slid once again over the past two months – down 0.5 per cent to 8.0 per cent, a record low on our revised methodology. The party's famed constituency organisations will be vital as its national brand shows no sign of recovering.
The Greens
The other big political story of the past two months has been the ‘Green surge', with support for the self-declared environmentalists soaring, particularly among disaffected younger voters, and pushing the Liberal Democrats into fifth in some polls.
The narrative of a Green “surge” seems to be about selective analysis of the most favourable polls.
This month we have for the first time added estimates for the Greens. Our systematic inspection of the polling evidence does not support the narrative of a “surge” concentrated in the past few months, which seems to be the result of selective analysis of the most favourable polls.
Instead, we find that support for the Greens has been steadily increasing for about a year, and – at 6.3 per cent – is now more than double the level recorded at the beginning of 2014.
As so often in this turbulent election cycle, the true impact of the Greens' rise is hard to gauge at present – while there is a sustained and genuine shift towards them, it is concentrated among the segment of the electorate (under 25s) that is least likely to vote, and also most likely to be adversely affected by new voter registration rules.
It is becoming ever more important to consider May 2015 at the constituency level.
The Greens' organisation is also relatively weak, and so there remain doubts about whether the party has the capacity to mobilise and turn out its new support base. Despite the conventional wisdom that the Greens are hurting Labour, it is striking that the rise in Green support over the past few months has much more closely mirrored the (continued) decline in Liberal Democrat support.
With the four party politics of 2014 now giving way to five or six party politics, it is becoming ever more important to consider May 2015 at the constituency level. We have been working hard on developing our constituency level prediction model over the past couple of months, and we will very shortly unveil our seat level forecasts for the election. These will then be updated regularly along here on May2015.

Today is a landmark day for Americans' privacy: you can finally make a telephone call in the United States without the NSA automatically keeping a record of who you called, when, and for how long. It's been more than a decade since that was the case. Now the only question is: will it last?
After the Senate voted down an extension of the Section 215 of the Patriot Act in a rare Sunday evening session, the dreaded law authorizing the mass surveillance of Americans expired at the first stroke of midnight and, with that stroke, one of the NSA's most controversial and invasive surveillance program exposed by Edward Snowden was reportedly shut down. But what powers the NSA will have by the end of the week – the details of which is still up in the air and changing by the hour – is anyone's guess.
Facing no other choice, the Senate also voted on Sunday night to move forward on the USA Freedom Act, the compromise-of-a-compromise NSA reform bill that will bring portions of the Patriot Act back from the dead, but will nonetheless permanently make end the NSA's bulk records program as we know it ... at least, it will if it remains as it's written now.
A huge victory on mass surveillance for Snowden – and it's not over yet | Ewen MacAskill Read more
But Senators could now add amendments to the bill in an attempt to weaken its reforms out of existence, an opportunity that, due to procedural hurdles, they would not have had if they had passed it anytime in the last week. This normally would be a great opportunity to strengthen the bill's many shortcomings – but given Senator majority leader Mitch McConnell's unquestioning loyalty to intelligence agencies who have repeatedly misled the public about their authority and their abuse of it, and the power he wields to force the vast majority of his party to vote along with him, anything could happen.
The rhetoric about the NSA in the last week from surveillance state supporters has been so dishonest, it's bordered on farcical, so there's not much hope that its defenders won't simply plant an 11th-hour knife in the back of NSA reformers despite their apparently new-found willingness to pass the USA Freedom Act.
The baseless fear-mongering by the Obama administration has been virtually indistinguishable from Dick Cheney's old tricks, but it hit a new low on Sunday when CIA director John Brennan told CBS's Face the Nation with a straight face that terrorists had “watched very carefully” what has happened in the Senate debate and were “looking for the seams to operate within.” Really? The terrorists have been binge-watching C-Span to see if the government will need to follow a slightly altered legal process to track their phone calls (which the government will get no matter what anyways)?
At the same time, surveillance supporters have been screaming from the rooftops that this phone program is “keeping us safe” despite ample evidence showing that's plainly not true. They refuse to acknowledge that the NSA itself has admitted the program has not stopped a single attack in its existence, and that the Justice Department confirmed the underlying law has been never been vital as well. Charlie Savage explained on Monday in the New York Times that the government will be able to obtain virtually all the information they received with Section 215 through many other laws.
Then there are those who claim that the NSA – that magnificent benevolent keeper of all our personal secrets – never has (and would never dream!) of abusing its great power. It's by far the biggest misnomer about the whole debate; of course the NSA's gigantic phone database has been abused. You can just ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court itself: in 2011, Judge Bates wrote that the privacy rules and restrictions placed on the agency by the court were “so frequently and systematically violated that it can fairly be said that this critical element of the overall … regime has never functioned effectively.” But yeah, other than that, no abuse at all.
This week, Congress will decide the future of NSA surveillance, and if you want your representatives to permanently restrict the NSA you have to tell them. But in the meantime, let's all take a moment to appreciate that – at least for today – our constitutionally-guaranteed privacy isn't being automatically going to be violated no matter who we choose to call.
Maharashtra Governor and Mumbai University Chancellor CH Vidyasagar Rao on Tuesday removed Sanjay Deshmukh as the vice-chancellor of the institution following the fiasco that the university faced over the delayed announcement of examination results due to a flawed digital assessment process.
The removal of Deshmukh puts to rest the impending demands of the vice-chancellor's resignation from different quarters following the uncertainty that thousands of students had to face due to the extremely delayed announcement of results this year.
The Raj Bhavan released a press statement saying "Today, the Governor and Chancellor of University of Mumbai CH Vidyasagar Rao, in exercise of the powers conferred upon him under Section 11(14)(e) of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 removed Dr Sanjay Deshmukh from the office of the Vice-Chancellor, University of Mumbai for his gross negligence and failure in implementing the On-Screen Marking system, to declare the results of examinations held in Summer-2017 within the time limit prescribed in the Act and for his failure to comply with the directions issued by the Chancellor from time to time, regarding early declaration of results."
After the long delay in declaring results of over four lakh Mumbai University students, the call for the resignation of Deshmukh had gained momentum slowly. On 26 September, Rao had cracked the whip and sought Deshmukh's resignation, failing which he could face dismissal, The Times of India had reported.
The vice-chancellor had also violated Section 11 (14) and 89 of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act as he did not submit a report to the chancellor, stating his failure to announce results before the deadline. Instead, he applied for leave "for personal reasons" on 9 August. Rao then appointed Shivaji University vice-chancellor Devanand Shinde as acting vice-chancellor of Mumbai University with immediate effect.
Deshmukh had also not taken into consideration the staff crunch in the university. Since 1985, the number of colleges affiliated to the university has gone up to 748. The staff, even the non-teaching staff, is inadequate to handle the increasing workload.
Even though Rao had asked Deshmukh to resign, sources revealed that the dominant opinion among Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Higher Technical Education Minister Vinod Tawde who met in September to decide the vice-chancellor's fate, was that sacking Deshmukh won't be good either for Mumbai University, the vice-chancellor or the mangroves that 52-year-old Deshmukh has been researching on for years now.
"The state government needs Deshmukh's knowledge and expertise in the field," sources at Rajbhavan and the Mantralaya had confirmed.

After NBC News reported ICE plans to round up 8400 illegal aliens — gang members and criminals — late Thursday, the agency issued a statement saying it had canceled them due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
What is more likely is, because NBC tipped off the illegals with their report, ICE had to cancel the operation. NBC News should be charged with obstruction of justice if this is the case.
President Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security had planned nationwide raids to target 8,400 illegal immigrants – criminals – later this month but then canceled them, according to three law enforcement officials and an internal document that described the plan as “the largest operation of its kind in the history” of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“Operational plans are subject to change based on a variety of factors,” ICE spokesman Sarah Rodriguez said in a statement. “There is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned at this time. The priority in the affected areas should remain focused on life-saving and life-sustaining activities.”
The raids were scheduled over five days beginning Sept. 17 and deemed “Operation Mega,” according to an internal document.
NBC also reported deep into their article [emphasis mine]: ICE had been planning the operation internally since mid-August and had instructed officers in the field to target adults deemed to be gang members or perpetrators of serious crimes, said one of the officials. Other undocumented immigrants not suspected of crimes may have been swept up in the raids as “collateral,” the official said.
NBC and their leftist friends want to keep criminals and gang members in this country.

New Work on Dwarf Planet 2007 OR10
Although we always think of Kepler — and its successor mission K2 — as an exoplanet observatory, the spacecraft has also been put to work on objects much closer to home. Enter 2007 OR10, a dwarf planet that is currently about twice as distant from the Sun as Pluto. The Kepler instrument is, of course, fine-tuned for spotting the minute variations in light caused when a planet passes in front of a distant star. But that makes it an excellent tool for studying 2007 OR10, whose dim light and red color have proved difficult to parse by other instruments.
Kepler, though, is not alone in this work. What we see is a useful collaboration between it and the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory. Using archival data from the latter, researchers have been able to measure both the fraction of starlight absorbed and later re-radiated as heat (via Herschel) as well as the fraction of starlight reflected from 2007 OR10 via Kepler. K2, sensitive to minute changes in brightness, was able to show that the object is one of the slowest rotating objects in the Solar System, taking about 45 hours to complete a revolution.

Coupled with the Herschel data in the infrared, we've now established a more accurate measurement of 2007 OR10's diameter than Herschel could provide on its own. The dwarf planet has a diameter of 1535 kilometers, some 250 kilometers greater than previously thought. That makes the surface darker as well, given that the same amount of light is being reflected by a larger object. The paper on this work discusses what this implies about the surface:
The red color of 2007 OR10 is likely to be due to the [retention] of methane, as it was proposed by Brown, Burgasser & Fraser (2011). In Fig. 1 in Brown, Burgasser & Fraser (2011), 2007 OR10 is nearly placed on the retention lines of CH 4 , CO and N 2 . The larger diameter derived in our paper places this dwarf planet further inside the volatile retaining domain, making the explanation of the observed spectrum more feasible.
The newly determined larger size of the dwarf planet, then, makes it more likely that the object can retain these volatile ices than if it had been smaller. The size, in fact, makes 2007 OR10 the third largest dwarf planet known after Pluto and Eris, just ahead of Makemake.
Image: New K2 results peg 2007 OR10 as the largest unnamed body in our solar system and the third largest of the current roster of about half a dozen dwarf planets. The dwarf planet Haumea has an oblong shape that is wider on its long axis than 2007 OR10, but its overall volume is smaller. Credits: Konkoly Observatory/András Pál, Hungarian Astronomical Association/Iván Éder, NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI.
This isn't the first time K2 has been involved with objects within the Solar System. Its previous targets have included the objects (278361) 2007 JJ 43 , 2002 GV 31 and Neptune's moon Nereid. Now, at 2007 OR10, we're seeing variations in rotational brightness that are intriguing for their suggestion of variations in surface albedo. Here I can't help recalling New Horizons and the way we went from faint indications of surface features during the long approach, to the close-up clarification of numerous kinds of terrain. How long will it be before we can repeat that feat with another outer system object like this one?

The ninth-ranked and sixth-seeded Stanford women's volleyball team meets a familiar opponent in top-ranked and second-seeded Minnesota in the NCAA national semifinals on Thursday at Columbus, Ohio.
No. 1 seed Nebraska (31-2) and No. 4 seed Texas (26-4) play in the other semifinal, with the winners meeting in the national championship match on Saturday.
The Cardinal (25-7) met the Golden Gophers (29-4) early in the season, handing them a four-set loss at Maples Pavilion.
A lot has happened since then, of course, with the maturation of the freshmen class at the top of the list.
Minnesota, which defeated No. 15 seed Missouri and No. 10 seed UCLA at home last week to reach its second straight Final Four, has improved as well.
The Gophers, which lost one set this postseason, are making their 21st NCAA tournament appearance and fifth in the national semifinals.
Minnesota is hitting .293 on the season and averaging 1.11 aces and 2.68 blocks per set.
The Gophers are led by Big Ten Player of the Year Sarah Wilhite (4.20 kps/2.57 dps) and Big Ten Setter of the Year Samantha Seliger-Swenson (11.60 aps).
Stanford is 7-0 all-time against Minnesota. The last time the Cardinal and Gophers met in NCAA Tournament action was a Stanford sweep in the Lexington Regional semifinals on Dec. 13, 2013. Stanford is 2-0 in NCAA postseason matches against Minnesota.
Stanford advanced to the national semifinals by eliminating 16th-ranked Florida State in four sets and upsetting No. 3 Wisconsin on its home court after being down two sets.
Fifth-year senior Inky Ajanaku took over for the Cardinal, hitting .484 and averaging 4.11 kills and 1.67 blocks per set en route to being named the MVP of the Madison Regional.
Freshmen Kathryn Plummer (3.00 kps/2.11 dps) and Morgan Hentz (6.33 dps) were also named to the all-regional team.
In August, the Canadian Seed Trade Association (CSTA) launched a new web database to help everyone in the seed sector easily access information about plant breeders' rights protection for new crop varieties.
The database is a joint initiative of CSTA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Variety Registration Office (VRO) and the Plant Breeders Rights Office (PBRO). It will combine data from the Database of Varieties Registered in Canada (accessed from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency website) and the PBRO in one location. The database will include information on agricultural varieties, versus horticultural or ornamental varieties.

Brought in by demand
The new database was developed this spring as a response to requests from seed sector stakeholders — seed growers, producers, grain handlers and retailers, seed treaters and cleaners — for easier access to variety registration and plant breeders' rights information on crop varieties.
“It came together out of necessity,” says Anthony Parker, commissioner of the PBRO. “Those in the value chain wanted information about the status of varieties. CSTA offered to take a monthly data dump from the PBRO. They synthesized that information and created an easy tool for those interested in varieties that have variety registration and also those that have PBR protection.”
Previously, users had to separately search the PBRO and VRO websites for relevant information about varieties. Now, users will be able to search the new database by crop kind, variety name, and the type of PBR protection.
“All the information that we provide is publically available on both websites — the PBRO and the VRO — but CSTA has packed it into an easier format,” says Parker.
UPOV 91

The landscape of the Canadian seed industry is changing under the Agricultural Growth Act, which became law on February 27. This Act included a significant update to Canada's Plant Breeders Rights Act (PBRA). As part of the new PBRA, Canada subscribes to the newest convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, UPOV 91.
Since the Act became law, the number of new applications for agricultural crops has significantly increased, says Crosby Devitt, executive director of CSTA.
“Just prior to the introduction of the Bill, the PBRO received approximately 80 new agricultural varieties per year,” says Devitt. “This past year, as the legislation moved through the last stages of Parliament and came into force, the PBRO received applications for 148 new agriculture varieties. This trend is only expected to continue.”
Devitt says the new PBR legislation has brought opportunities for investment and new varieties for producers.
“However, with opportunity comes obligation,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that timely and important information is available to CSTA members, farmers, and everyone across the value chain.”

CSTA has been leading an outreach campaign to update stakeholders on the changes to Plant Breeders' Rights in Canada. “We have been working with the Partners in Innovation, a group of 20 diverse farm organizations and value chain groups from across Canada, our members, and other partners to get the word out as widely as possible,” says Devitt.
Parker says Canada's adoption of UPOV '91 makes it especially key for stakeholders to have easy access to information about their rights and obligations. “Varieties that were granted protection until UPOV '78 continue to live out that law until they have expired or been surrendered. Everything that was pending in the system will be under UPOV '91.”
In the database, the type of PBR protection for each variety is indicated by the certification marks “UPOV 1978” or “UPOV 1991.” Devitt urges anyone interested in the system to visit the database at cdnseed.org.
CPS' per-pupil funding could be cut by almost 40%
Chicago Public Schools CEO Forrest Claypool told some principals Tuesday to expect school budget cuts of up to 30 percent. | Sun-Times file photo
Chicago Public Schools told some principals Tuesday to expect total school budget cuts of between 20 percent and 30 percent as the district plans for “the worst.”
The broke district, which has been begging Springfield all year for financial help, plans to chop its own per-pupil contribution by nearly 40 percent, according to proposed budgets given to 15 elementary and high schools.
The district says principals have to “plan for the worst — higher class sizes, loss of enrichment activities, and layoffs of teachers and support staff” while waiting for the General Assembly to take action on proposed pension help or revising the state's funding formula, spokeswoman Emily Bittner said.
On average, schools will feel a budget cut of 26 percent once they receive their state and federal funding, she said. The base per-pupil rate will drop from $4,088 to $2,495 if the proposed budget becomes final. It includes an equivalent cut for charters, too, she said.
Leaders from 15 “example schools” were invited to a meeting with CEO Forrest Claypool, chief education officer Janice Jackson and others, Bittner said.
Some cried when they saw the numbers today, according to one attendee.
“This cannot be real. It can't be real,” said D'Andre Weaver, who learned that his South Side school of about 900 kids, Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy, is going to lose about $520,000. That's a little more than $1 out of $4 previously allocated to the test-in school at 250 E. 111th St. and equals at least five or six staff positions.
“You can't do a lot” to mitigate that, he told the Chicago Sun-Times. “You're going to have to cut people, and it's going to impact the classroom. There's no way around that.”
Weaver ticked off some of the cuts CPS schools already underwent during the past school year, which started with a $480 million budget gap: Summer and then midyear layoffs; schools instructed to hoard their cash; three unpaid furlough days.
“I don't think they're BS-ing,” he said of CPS. “Now I'm like, ‘We're getting on a bus, we're going to wear a shirt, we're going to do all we can. . . . These are our amazing people, and we can't function without them.' ”
Claypool had been warning of 20 percent cuts based on CPS' predicted shortfall of about $1 billion next year. Last week several principals said such large reductions will surely lead to staff layoffs and larger class sizes — as well as principals and parents looking for other places to work and to send their children.
CPS says it has been collecting ideas from principals to soften the blow as much as possible, and it plans to help school leaders schedule their teachers as efficiently as possible and coordinate sharing some staff members, too. Meanwhile, it's urging parents and schools to pressure state legislators into acting.
A bill championing major changes to the school funding formula — endorsed by both the district and the Chicago Teachers Union — has passed the Senate. And a bipartisan working group also has been considering ideas to better fund poor schools statewide too. Legislators are in session through May 31.
Weaver said he is now looking into organizing his school community to lobby for better funding.
The Board of Education must approve a final budget before Aug. 31, according to state law.

Old Safe Reveals Historical Relics Of Women's Suffrage Group

Started in 1888 by suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony, the National Council of Women of the United States still exists today in a small office near the United Nations.
On the organization's 125th anniversary, it teamed up with the University of Rochester to open an old safe painted with the words "Woman Suffrage Party." No one knew what was in the safe or when it had last been opened.
On the website of the University of Rochester's Susan B. Anthony Center, people were speculating all week about what might be in the safe. Would it be lists of secret members? Organizing strategies and protest plans? Or perhaps the original copy of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote? Perhaps love letters, perhaps photographs?
Perhaps nothing, and that's exactly what safe cracker Elaad Israeli said. Most times when he opens safes there's not much, just "rubber bands, paper clips [and] pens."
Israeli worked the combination lock while people crowded into a tiny room. "I don't want to sound rude, but I really need quiet to be able to concentrate," he said.
Suddenly, he was done, and Mary Singletary, the president of the National Council of Women, pulled open the safe to reveal a cache of items.
First there was a change purse filled with coins from France, Mexico and various other countries. There was also a box with a Smithsonian replica of the gavel originally used by Susan B. Anthony, as well as an envelope with a 1999 stamp that revealed the safe had been opened within the past 14 years.
The safe also held medals, a silver broach, a wooden stamp, a corporate seal, a paper of incorporation dating back to 1931. Other documents included federal tax exemption papers from 1957 and an IRS letter from 1940. They didn't open the documents and letters because archivists suggested they handle them with care and many may later be digitized.
Perhaps the loveliest items were six small panels, replicas of huge wall murals of women that were commissioned for the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. Catherine Cerulli, the director of the Susan B. Anthony Center, pointed out that one woman is clearly a Red Cross worker.
"They're historical pictures of women, women caring for others," she says. "Perhaps these are historical figures."
Why was the safe not opened for a long time? Singletary said the hundreds of dollars needed to hire a locksmith was just too much for an organization struggling to survive with multiple projects.
"I had to make a choice of raising money for my programs or raising money to pay this gentleman," she said.
She chose the programs until the University of Rochester joined the effort. One thing they also found was a candy box filled with keys, one going to a storage room in the basement. So who knows, there may be more discoveries.
The horrendous attacks on Paris have an eerie resemblance to the events of Sept. 11, 2001, in that they seem to have caught everyone off guard.
Until perhaps Friday, the main perception among Western intelligence agencies and Washington policymakers has been that Islamic State poses “no immediate threat” to the United States or the West.
“Unlike Al Qaeda, ISIS is more interested in establishing a Caliphate and not so interested in attacking the West,” a retired CIA officer explained during a closed meeting at one of Washington's think tanks. He was echoing a common sentiment, and insisted that “Al Qaeda remains the main threat.” Even U.S. President Barack Obama recently said with confidence that Islamic State was being “contained.”
But we cannot forget that Islamic State came to the world stage barely over a year ago, when it took Mosul and subsequently one third of Iraq as well as one third of Syria in a matter of weeks. Some of the terror group's major advances on the ground took mere hours, advances that Obama later said will take years to roll back.
I remember covering the war at that time from Damascus, Syria, and later from Beirut, where I kept in constant communication via the Internet with the Syrian rebels and civilians who had suddenly found themselves under Islamic State rule in the eastern Syrian province of Deir al Zor. During those first few days, many went underground, not sure what to do about their new, brutal occupier, who proceeded to slaughter more than 700 men from the Arab Sunni Muslim tribe of Shueitat because the tribe did not pledge allegiance to Islamic State. The militant group commanded all men of fighting age in Deir Al Zor to report to Islamic State checkpoints, surrender weapons, and either pledge allegiance to Islamic State or leave the territory immediately.
“We never thought the West would allow a group like ISIS to expand, but now I know that we have been played. We have been extremely stupid,” one anti-Islamic State rebel told me on condition of anonymity to protect his family. He sounded embittered by what he called a shocking and swift victory for the group, and he spoke to me from his car, which he said he had parked just outside an Internet cafe to piggy-back on the Wi-Fi signal without anyone hearing our conversation. He said Islamic State had setup checkpoints everywhere.
“The only thing that makes sense to us is that the world wants to dump all its trash here,” he said, referring to the Islamic State jihadists, whom he said were mainly non-Syrian, but other Arab nationals, Chechens, and Westerners. “And then the West will come and bomb them all. This must be the strategy because nothing else makes any sense.”
Conspiracy theories aside, there is some truth to the idea that some countries, as naive and misguided as they have been, privately sighed relief to see their own Islamist nationals travel to Islamist territory to meet their fate.
“It's better than having them stay in our country,” one Western diplomat told me on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “Statistically, a newly arrived jihadist to ISIS territory is killed within weeks, so good riddance.” He added that all the West had to worry about were the “lone-wolf attacks” inspired by Islamic State.
Unfortunately, the Paris attacks have disproved this theory, and it is time to shed other falsely comforting illusions as well.
Namely, let us not forget that some of the United States' staunchest allies have been, and remain, responsible for facilitating the arrival of money, material, and jihadists into Islamic State territory, not to mention providing the ideological guidance for the terror group. They have been doing so in the hopes of toppling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Jihadists have crossed the borders of Jordan and Turkey into Syria, seemingly at will. Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not stopped their private citizens from sending money to various Islamist brigades, including Islamic State. They also give airtime to the muftis who provide ideological guidance to Islamic State, religious scholars who condone sectarian killing, gruesome beheadings, and sexual slavery on theological grounds.
It has been too convenient a falsity also for the West to believe that Syria's war is Syria's problem, or at least someone else's problem, when so many world players are already involved in the war there, either directly or by proxy.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had strong words at the ongoing Vienna talks on Syria, attended by foreign ministers of some 20 nations. Standing next to his Russian counterpart, Kerry called the Paris attacks “the most vile, horrendous, outrageous, unacceptable acts on the planet.” But he added that they “encouraged us today to do even harder work to make progress and to help resolve the crises that we face.”
Peace and order in Syria are a long way off — Syrians are not even represented in Vienna — but if world players resolve to ensure that the Paris attacks become the nail in Islamic State's coffin, then at least the Phoenix is already rising from the ashes.

You Don't Own Other People
Laws against peaceful, consensual activity always seem to be in the news. Dianne Feinstein takes a hardline stance against marijuana law reform. Raids on raw milk distributors are a regular occurrence. Every little while a story breaks about another “family values” politician soliciting a prostitute who turns out to be an undercover cop.
A sizable share of people in the criminal justice system is made up of those who ran afoul of some law commanding “Touch not, taste not, handle not.”
If you support such laws, there is no ground on which you can consistently do so without believing that other people are your property, or are your inferiors and subject to your command.
You may argue that “society” collectively decides what to permit and not to permit, based on some vision of the “common good.” But remember those high school civics texts with the stuff about government exercising only powers delegated by the governed, government's function being to protect the rights of the individual, and all that? Well, you can't delegate a power you don't have. And government can't protect a right, on your behalf, that you don't possess as an individual.
So you can't delegate to government the power to tell other people what foods or drugs to ingest, or whom to have sex with, unless you, as an individual, already have the right to boss other people around. You as an individual, or acting together with any number of other individuals, cannot delegate to government the power to boss people around against their will in regard to peaceful and consensual actions, unless you own them. “Society” has a right to criminalize peaceful, voluntary behavior only if each individual is the property of society as a whole.
Roderick Long of the Molinari Institute (the parent body of Center for a Stateless Society) describes it as a simple matter of equality. If other people are your equals in dignity, authority, and self-determination, you don't have the right to tell them what to do. You can't boss another person around about their food or drug habits, or their sexual practices, unless they're your subordinate in some sense. You've probably seen a kid tell some bossy stranger, or remember telling someone yourself years ago, “You're not my daddy!” Exactly.
We anarchists don't believe other people are our property. We don't believe we have the authority to tell other people what to eat, drink, smoke, or whom to have sex with. We're not their bosses. We don't own them. And we have no right to act through government to do things we have no legitimate authority to do as individuals. In other words, we anarchists actually believe the things the authors of your civics texts claimed to believe.
The big difference is, we're consistent about it. We judge all groupings of individuals, even groupings that claim to represent a majority of people in a community and call themselves a “government,” by the same moral principles that govern individuals. The legitimate powers an individual possesses — the right to life, liberty and property, and the consequent power to defend those rights without harm to innocents — can be exercised cooperatively by any number of individuals in concert.
But even if they comprise a majority of people in a community, they have no rightful authority to bind those who did not freely join their cooperative venture. No group, including a group made up of a majority of individuals in a community, has any powers or rights beyond those already possessed by its individual members. Individuals cannot delegate any powers to a government that they do not possess as individuals.
Like any other association, a government exists for the ends of its members, and has no authority over anyone outside it. The state has no aura of majesty, and exercises no divine power. Like any other human association, it has only those legitimate powers which individual human beings can rightfully grant it in the first place.
If you, as an individual, go to your neighbor's house and order him to stop smoking dope or parking his car on the lawn, and shove him around or take him prisoner for refusing to comply, you're nothing but a thug. Your neighbor has the right to tell you to mind your own business and leave him alone, and to resist your aggression if necessary. If you and a large number of other people in the community do the same thing to your neighbor, under cover of a so-called “government,” you're still just thugs — plain and simple. And your neighbor has just as much right to tell you all to mind your own business, or to resist if necessary.
As an individual, or as a member of a group of individuals — no matter how large — you don't own other people.
If there's one dependable lesson to be learned from E3 every year, it's that consumerism is good. And that's no better demonstrated than by this ludicrous Assassin's Creed: Origins edition. Tidily dubbed the Dawn of the Creed Collector's Case – Legendary Edition, it'll set you back $800 (or $1,250 in Australia).
Rather amusingly, this pack doesn't get you absolutely everything offered in the bajillion (ie, five) other special editions of the game, but crucially, it does get you a 73cm figurine in resin (it's in resin, you see). The game is there of course, as is a season pass, a physical world map, and an eagle skull amulet, which is nice.
The full rundown of what's in it can be perused over here. Or you could watch this video. Scroll to the bottom for an image showing everything in the edition.
A Post Of Sorts
Christopher Pitt Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 22, 2015
Recently I've been watching an excellent video series on Algorithms and Data Structures. I tried implementing a few of the algorithms in JavaScript, and discovered something interesting…
Bubble Sort
First, let's look at a simple (and terrible) algorithm. It's called Bubble Sort. Bubble sort is often taught as a “first algorithm”. It's not very efficient but it's easy to implement.
Bubble Sort performs multiple passes over a list of items, and compares each item with the next. If the item on the left is bigger it swaps both items. This can be seen in a number of steps:
var items = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4];
// Pass 1
//
// Step 1: compare 1 and 3, no swap
// Step 2: compare 3 and 2, swap
// Step 3: compare 3 and 5, no swap
// Step 4: compare 5 and 4, swap
//
// Pass 2
//
// Step 1: compare 1 and 2, no swap
// Step 2: compare 2 and 3, no swap
// Step 3: compare 3 and 4, no swap
//
// Pass 3
//
// Step 1: compare 1 and 2, no swap
// Step 2: compare 2 and 3, no swap
//
// Pass 4
//
// Step 1: compare 1 and 2, no swap
Bubble Sort works out how many steps it would take to sort the most jumbled list (the worst case). For a list of n items, the number of passes required is:
(n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + (n - 4)...0
This equates [roughly] to O(n²) complexity.
If you're unfamiliar with this notation (as I was) then watch a few of the videos in that playlist.
This means we can expect the following growth of work against input:
1 unit of input → about 1 unit of work + set-up
2 units of input → about 4 units of work + set-up
3 units of input → about 9 units of work + set-up
4 units of input → about 16 units of work + set-up
It's important to notice that we're estimating units of work. O(n²) doesn't take into account set-up work. We're ignoring constants because, at high volumes of input (high n) the constants don't contribute meaningfully to the amount of work that needs to be done.
Merge Sort
Then, let's look at a complex (and beautiful) algorithm. It's called Merge sort. Merge sort recursively splits a list of items until the list of items it has to sort are 1 or 2 in length. We get 1 when we're recursively halving the input list, where the input list has an odd length.
After recursively splitting the input list, we combine each small(er) half until we've combined all the halves into one list. We can see this in a number of steps:
var items = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4];
// Step 1: split [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] → [1, 3, 2] and [5, 4]
// Step 2: split [1, 3, 2] → [1, 3] and [2]
// Step 3: sort [1, 3] and [2] → [1, 3] and [2]
// Step 4: sort [5, 4] → [4, 5]
// Step 5: join [1, 3] and [2] → [1, 2, 3]
// Step 6: join [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5] → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Merge sort removes the problem of sorting lists of items of length greater than 2 by reducing the length of lists to 2 or 1, sorting and combining. It's more efficient than Bubble sort, reducing the theoretical complexity from O(n²) to O(nlogn). The growth of input against work looks like this:
1 unit of input → set-up
2 units of input → about 0.6 units of work + set-up
3 units of input → about 1.4 units of work + set-up
4 units of input → about 2.4 units of work + set-up
Again, just estimates. We're not fussed about exact measurement because what matters is growth of work vs. growth of input.
I'm only interested in the worst case of these algorithms. For Bubble Sort that means O(n²) and for Merge Sort that means O(nlogn).
Implementations
So I implemented Bubble Sort and Merge Sort, in JavaScript:
function bubble(data) {
var length = data.length;
while (length) {
for (var i = 1; i < length; i++) {
var prev = data[i - 1];
var next = data[i];
if (prev > next) {
data[i] = prev;
data[i - 1] = next;
}
}
length--;
}
return data;
}
function merge(data) {
var length = data.length;
if (length === 1) {
return [data[0]];
}
if (length === 2) {
if (data[0] > data[1]) {
return [data[1], data[0]];
}
return [data[0], data[1]];
}
var first = merge(data.slice(0, Math.ceil(length / 2)));
var second = merge(data.slice(first.length));
var result = [];
while (first.length && second.length) {
if (first[0] > second[0]) {
result.push(second.shift());
} else {
result.push(first.shift());
}
}
return result.concat(first, second);
}
Having described both algorithms; you should have a pretty good understanding of how these methods work. Sure there's some interesting array-based mechanics in merge(), but nothing fundamentally different to how Merge Sort works.
We can run these through benchmarks, to see how they perform against each other. In fact, that's what I did. And I discovered something strange:
My implementations are definitely not as efficient as they could be. What's interesting, though, is that native sorting is much faster on Firefox 37.* than on Chrome 42.*. I had a feeling that this could be the result of function call overhead in recursive implementations of the sorting algorithms these browsers use, so I ran another benchmark:
It seems that the cost of calling functions, recursively, inside my Merge Sort implementation (and Chrome's native sorting algorithm) is significant enough that Bubble Sort is the most efficient for smaller sets. The same could be said for Safari 8.*, if the overhead graph is anything to go by.
Conclusion
A common theme of algorithm design is to ignore constants which don't meaningfully contribute to the amount of work, as the size of input grows. This is an example of constants (function call overhead) impacting the work so significantly that reasonable samples of work (sorting less than 100 items) are more efficiently done by O(n²). As long as the implementations avoid recursive function calls.
And perhaps…
if (chrome) {
var native = Array.prototype.sort;
Array.prototype.sort = function(data) {
if (data.length > 100) {
return native.call(data);
}
return bubble(data);
}
}
I'm by no means an algorist. Please feel free to point out my errors (in a constructive manner) and I'll make the necessary corrections. Leave a comment here, or find me on Twitter.
Edit
Mbrubeck points out that calling Array.prototype.sort without a custom comparison function will cause the elements to be converted to strings. I went back to the previous benchmarks and added in a comparison function.
This greatly improves the speed at which Chrome sorts these lists. Still nowhere near the level of Firefox, but enough to beat Bubble Sort. I guess this means I should be adding custom sorting functions all the time.
Should Chrome be converting elements to strings, as the default behaviour?
Militia fighters move through Baiji as Asaib al Haq's flag flies in the background.
Iraqi troops and several Iranian-supported Shiite militias have entered Baiji and are vying for control of the central Iraqi city with the Islamic State. Baiji has changed hands twice since the Islamic State launched its invasion of central and northern Iraq in June 2014.
Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias launched a counteroffensive to regain control of Baiji and the nearby oil refinery several weeks ago. Iraqi forces must retake the area if the government plans on wresting Mosul from the Islamic State.
A US official speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that “Iraqi forces control no more than half of the city.”
A member of the Salahaddin Provincial Council said that Iraqi forces are surrounding the city. The official went on to express concern over the role of the Shiite militias, as well as a possible direct Iranian role in the offensive. The official said that Iranian military missile batteries are located near the city. Additionally, the official confirmed, via US intelligence, that the Iraqi forces and the militias have progressed from the south of the city but are being slowed down by Islamic State snipers and improvised explosive devices.
Al Jazeera Arabic has reported that Iraqi forces are in control of the southern portion of the city and are advancing to the eastern and western portions. The Qatari news agency also reported that fighting is still continuing at the Baiji oil refinery outside of the city. US Central Command (CENTCOM) has announced that three airstrikes have taken place in Baiji within the last 24 hours. The airstrikes, according to CENTCOM, struck two tactical units and destroyed four structures.
The Shiite militias of Asaib al Haq (League of the Righteous) and Kata'ib Imam Ali (Imam Ali Brigade) have published several videos of their roles in the fighting at Baiji. In one video seen below, the white flag of Asaib al Haq can be seen flying in several locations within the city. Other videos from Kata'ib Imam Ali show fighting, as well as militiamen celebrating in Baiji. Other Iranian-backed militias, including Kata'ib Jund al Imam, Saraya al Khorasani, and Kata'ib Saeed al Shuhada, have publicized their involvement on Facebook or have been reported to be involved in the battle.
The Islamic State made significant gains at the Baiji refinery last month after a renewed offensive. The jihadist group was able to take control of several sub-refineries, as well as the northern and southern portion of the refinery. Al Jazeera has reported that the fighting at the refinery has “improved” but did not go into detail of what percentage the Iraqi forces have been able to take back. Last month, it was estimated that the Islamic State controlled more than 80 percent of the refinery. Much of the infrastructure is said to have been destroyed in the fighting. [See LWJ report, Fighting at Iraq's Baiji oil refinery is ‘flowing in the wrong direction'.]
Iraqi forces have previously gained control of Baiji, only to lose it again to the Islamic State. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias took Baiji from the Islamic State in mid-December 2014, but troops pulled out within a week after the jihadist group surrounded the city and cut off supply lines. Iraqi troops withdrew to the refinery, leaving local police and tribal militias besieged by the jihadists. [See LWJ report, Islamic State retakes Baiji after Iraqi forces withdraw.]
The current offensive to take back Baiji began after Iraqi troops and Shiite militias were able to recapture the nearby city of Tikrit earlier this year. Several Shiite militias, including Asaib al Haq and Kata'ib Imam Ali, played a vital role in capturing the city. The US initially said that it would not support the operation with airstrikes due to the participation of the militias and Iranian forces, but later reversed course. [See LWJ reports, Shiite militias, Iraqi troops enter central Tikrit, US continues airstrikes in Tikrit despite involvement of Iranian-backed Shiite militias, and US begins airstrikes against Islamic State in Tikrit, supports Shiite militias.]
The fighting also comes after the Islamic State took over the city of Ramadi in Iraq's Anbar province. Several Shiite militias, including the Hezbollah Brigades, a US-designated terrorist organization, are leading the fight to retake the provincial capital and surrounding areas.
The use of Shiite militias in Sunni Anbar is likely to stoke sectarian tensions in the province, and may aid the Islamic State's recruiting efforts. The militias are seen by many Sunnis as agents of Iran, who seek to oppress them. [See LWJ report, Iranian-backed militias lead Iraqi counteroffensive to retake Ramadi.]

Apple has officially issued a statement regarding the iPhone 6 bending controversy saying the issue is rare during real world use and that it's only received complaints from 9 customers (via CNBC). Apple adds, according to the reports, that the “new iPhones feature steel/titanium inserts to reinforce stress locations and use the strongest glass in the industry.” Apple also commented that bending is “extremely rare” during normal use and that it performs a number of strength and durability tests (as you'd expect) before it ships new devices (via WSJ):
Since going on sale Friday, Apple said only nine customers have contacted the company about a bent iPhone 6 Plus—the larger and more expensive of its two new iPhones. Apple said both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus passed a series of tests meant to check the products' strength and durability to withstand every day, real-life use.
The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac
The controversy over whether or not the new iPhone 6 models are less durable than previous generations or other smartphones picked up mainstream media attention after videos of users bending the device appeared online. Other videos quickly appeared online showing the device compared to phones from competitors and previous generation iPhones. Competitors have also taken advantage of the situation this week with LG, BlackBerry, and others mocking the bending controversy while promoting their own devices.
In Wired's iPhone 6 Plus review, Mat Honan described his 5.5-inch iPhone model as being bent:
Like a lot of people, I have a bent iPhone 6 Plus. It's almost imperceptible, but it's there: a slight warp right at the buttons on the side. Put the phone screen down on a table, and it wobbles. I haven't purposefully bent it and I don't recall sitting on it (but I probably have). So why is this one bending? I have a theory: It might have something to do with it being both very thin and very big and made of aluminum. The Samsung Galaxy Note3 is big, but it's also 4 mm thicker than the iPhone 6 Plus and doesn't have an aluminum back that, when bent, stays bent. You don't hear about big Android phones bending because they are either too thick, or made out of plastic. That's my theory, anyway.
Below is Apple's full statement on the issue via Financial Times:
Jon Rettinger of TechnoBuffalo has published a video of himself explaining that he's switched from the iPhone to Windows Phone, and the HTC Titan is now his main handset. One of the main features he loves about the platform (and the device in this case) is the size of the live tiles and content on the massive 4.7" screen. Rettinger's main concern with making the switch (as is with every potential buyer) is the choice of apps on the Marketplace, but goes onto state that every app he required was actually present in the catalogue, or an equivalent available.
Overall he's impressed. What's more is that when Rettinger shows his Titan to other people when out and about, there's generally a positive response, but he notes that the biggest flaw of the system that could be turning away a lot of folk is the attached "Windows" brand. Let's not forget that Microsoft is in a reforming stage, if you will. Closing up, he has no regrets in switching and doesn't look back at the iPhone 4S. Take that Siri.

I guess the competition in Group E just got more interesting. Piton de la Fournaise, located on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, had its first eruption (see above) since 2010. The eruption is behaving as most do at the shield volcano over the Reunion hotspot, with fast moving lava flows over the barren terrain. You can see some video of the eruption, showing the fissure and the branching lava flows heading down slope (see below). The lavas at Piton de la Fournaise are lower viscosity than you find at similar eruptions at another hotspot volcano, Kilauea. That's because the lava is more alkaline, where the addition of Na, K and Ca into the magma keeps it from forming chains of silica as easily. This means the viscosity remains lower for longer and producing those fast moving pahoehoe flows. Luckily this eruption is in a very remote part of the volcano, so there is little-to-no threat from the flows, unlike the eruption in 2007.
Lava flows from the June 21, 2014 eruption of Piton de la Fournaise. LIinfo.re (video capture)
The eruption itself started in the early morning hours on June 21 from the southeastern side of the main summit crater. There had been 10 days of precursory signs that an eruption was in the works, with higher gas emissions and seismicity, along with a red glow in the area very recently. Unfortunately this current eruption is not occurring in view of any of the webcams pointed at the volcano.
Have you ever found yourself envious of all those races runners participate in, but are unwilling to actually run? Then Philadelphia (which, it should be noted, is the 14th-fattest city in the U.S.) has just the event for you.
On February 6, the Philly 0.0 Instant Gratification Run will charge participants $35 to literally step from a start line over a finish line. The men's and women's winners are chosen by lottery, and event participants are given all the schwag that runners at races usually get, like a t-shirt and post-race food. The entry bib is your proof of admittance to the after -party.
Don't have the energy to get to leave your house? The Philly 0.0 also has a $28 "Virtual Participant" category. I assume your shirt is mailed to you so you can show all your friends proof of the non-race you didn't even go to.
"Race" director Todd Strauss told Philly.com the inspiration for the event came from the desire to throw a running-themed party during a time of year when few races are offered. (He did not explain why he didn't just throw a race.) "It is all about having fun and keeping the spirit of the race," he said as his city continues to grow more obese by the minute.

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa is unprecedented in many ways, including the high proportion of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers who have been infected, warns the World Health Organization. Despite all precautions possible, more than 240 health care workers have developed the disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, and more than 120 have died. Simply put, they conclude, the current outbreak is different. The loss of so many doctors and nurses has made it difficult for WHO to secure support from sufficient numbers of foreign medical staff. Even WHO admits, if doctors and nurses are getting infected, what chance does the general public have?
Full WHO Statement:
The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa is unprecedented in many ways, including the high proportion of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers who have been infected.
To date, more than 240 health care workers have developed the disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, and more than 120 have died.
Ebola has taken the lives of prominent doctors in Sierra Leone and Liberia, depriving these countries not only of experienced and dedicated medical care but also of inspiring national heroes.
Several factors help explain the high proportion of infected medical staff. These factors include shortages of personal protective equipment or its improper use, far too few medical staff for such a large outbreak, and the compassion that causes medical staff to work in isolation wards far beyond the number of hours recommended as safe.
In the past, some Ebola outbreaks became visible only after transmission was amplified in a health care setting and doctors and nurses fell ill. However, once the Ebola virus was identified and proper protective measures were put in place, cases among medical staff dropped dramatically.
Moreover, many of the most recent Ebola outbreaks have occurred in remote areas, in a part of Africa that is more familiar with this disease, and with chains of transmission that were easier to track and break.
The current outbreak is different. Capital cities as well as remote rural areas are affected, vastly increasing opportunities for undiagnosed cases to have contact with hospital staff. Neither doctors nor the public are familiar with the disease. Intense fear rules entire villages and cities.
Several infectious diseases endemic in the region, like malaria, typhoid fever, and Lassa fever, mimic the initial symptoms of Ebola virus disease. Patients infected with these diseases will often need emergency care. Their doctors and nurses may see no reason to suspect Ebola and see no need to take protective measures.
Some documented infections have occurred when unprotected doctors rushed to aid a waiting patient who was visibly very ill. This is the first instinct of most doctors and nurses: aid the ailing.
In many cases, medical staff are at risk because no protective equipment is available – not even gloves and face masks. Even in dedicated Ebola wards, personal protective equipment is often scarce or not being properly used.
Training in proper use in absolutely essential, as are strict procedures for infection prevention and control.
In addition, personal protective equipment is hot and cumbersome, especially in a tropical climate, and this severely limits the time that doctors and nurses can work in an isolation ward. Some doctors work beyond their physical limits, trying to save lives in 12-hour shifts, every day of the week. Staff who are exhausted are more prone to make mistakes.
All personal protective equipment despatched or approved by WHO meets the appropriate international safety standards.
The heavy toll on health care workers in this outbreak has a number of consequences that further impede control efforts.
It depletes one of the most vital assets during the control of any outbreak. WHO estimates that, in the three hardest-hit countries, only one to two doctors are available to treat 100,000 people, and these doctors are heavily concentrated in urban areas.
It can lead to the closing of health facilities, especially when staff refuse to come to work, fearing for their lives. When hospitals close, other common and urgent medical needs, such as safe childbirth and treatment for malaria, are neglected.
The fact that so many medical staff have developed the disease increases the level of anxiety: if doctors and nurses are getting infected, what chance does the general public have? In some areas, hospitals are regarded as incubators of infection and are shunned by patients with any kind of ailment, again reducing access to general health care.
The loss of so many doctors and nurses has made it difficult for WHO to secure support from sufficient numbers of foreign medical staff.
The African Union has launched an urgent initiative to recruit more health care workers from among its members.

Have no fear though... Ebola infection is low-risk...

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – The House intelligence committee says it may opt to subpoena the Justice Department if it does not provide possible evidence that President Donald Trump was wiretapped during the election.
The committee set Monday as the deadline for getting the information, but the Justice Department says it needs more time.
The committee now says it wants the information in hand before March 20th when it holds its first public hearing on its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
A spokesman for committee chairman Devin Nunes of California, Jack Langer, says the committee might subpoena the information if the Justice Department fails to answer its questions.

Scientific accolades don't get much bigger. Percy Bridgman, an American physicist active during the first half of the 20th century, has just had one-third of the planet named after him, although it's a chunk of Earth that we will probably never see.
Earth's lower mantle is largely composed of magnesium iron silicate, in the form of a mineral with a perovskite crystal structure. Given that the lower mantle is about 2000 kilometres thick, this mineral makes up 38 per cent of Earth's entire volume, so it is easily our planet's most common mineral.
It is surprisingly rare at Earth's surface, though. So rare, in fact, that geologists have struggled to find a natural sample. And the rulebook is strict: a mineral can't be formally named with no natural sample to describe it.

Now, Oliver Tschauner at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas and his colleagues have finally discovered a sample that meets the criteria, meaning the mineral is nameless no longer. It will now be known as bridgmanite.
Crucial sample
“I would like to give professor Tschauner and his colleagues my congratulations,” says Masaaki Miyahara at Hiroshima University in Japan, one of the many geologists who have previously hunted for the crucial sample. Finally, he says, we can complete the naming of the mineral.
The bridgmanite that Tschauner and his colleagues found doesn't come from Earth's interior, though. It actually arrived on Earth in 1879, buried within a meteorite that slammed into Australia. The Tenham meteorite experienced temperatures of 2000°C and pressures of 24 gigapascals during its journey through the solar system – extreme enough to replicate conditions deep inside the Earth and allow bridgmanite to form.
The mineral should have broken down as the space rock returned to ambient temperature and pressure. The fact that it didn't imply that the drop in temperature and pressure must have been extremely rapid, essentially “freezing” the bridgmanite in place before it could decay. Today it exists in certain regions of the meteorite as “crystallites” between 40 and 200 nanometres long, says Tschauner.
It's important to be able to name bridgmanite finally, he says, but having natural samples of the mineral are significant for another reason. They can now be chemically analysed to reveal some of the trace elements that can naturally slot into bridgmanite's crystal structure – which will help refine models of how the deep mantle behaves.
Mantle deep
For too long, says Tschauner, geologists and physicists have relied on a crude reductionist approach to understanding conditions deep inside the Earth. Because we know so little about the deep mantle, theoretical models usually only consider the abundant elements – magnesium, silicon and oxygen – that we know must be present. “You can't just ignore the rest – it doesn't work,” says Tschauner.
For instance, earlier this year Graham Pearson at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and his colleagues discovered samples of ringwoodite, another mantle mineral, in diamond from deep within the mantle. The minor elements locked inside the ringwoodite provided good evidence for a massive “ocean” of water within Earth's interior. Without the actual sample, we wouldn't have known about the ocean.
Pearson says discovering the first natural samples of bridgmanite in a meteorite is important. “But it's not the same as finding the mineral in a terrestrial sample,” he cautions. “Just as ringwoodite had been found for the first time in nature in a meteorite, its identification did not foretell the importance of water in the deep Earth.”
In other words, the search for bridgmanite from Earth's mantle will continue, and there is no knowing what secrets it might reveal about Earth's interior.
And who was Percy Bridgman? A Nobel laureate, Bridgman is sometimes called the father of high-pressure experiments. “His advances are what led to the ability to synthesise and study deep Earth materials,” says Thomas Sharp at Arizona State University in Tempe. “He made mineral physics possible.”

Peter MacKay has taken his government's victims-first law-and-order policy to its logical, absurdist, conclusion. MacKay now aspires to eliminate the victim.
The government of Justice Minister Peter MacKay aims to "off-ramp" sex trade workers with its new prostitution bill. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo ) A sex trade worker is pictured in Vancouver last month. In Justice Minister Peter MacKay's world, prostitution in this country is a black-and-white reality of predators and perverts versus victims, writes Tim Harper. ( JONATHAN HAYWARD / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )
Laudatory as that aspiration may be, it only highlights the weaknesses in his prostitution bill which is under the microscope this week in Ottawa. In MacKay's world, prostitution in this country is a two-sided, black-and-white reality, predators and perverts versus victims. All prostitutes, in this world, are vulnerable and victims and there is no such thing as a mature, fully functioning adult who has decided that she (or he) wants to earn money in this manner.
Article Continued Below
So the justice minister, with the backing of Calgary police Chief Rick Hanson and others, believes one day Canada can abolish prostitution, a quixotic quest that mixes legitimate concern for young victims on our streets today with the reality that this business will always be with us in one form or another. While MacKay and the Conservative government is right to try to get the victims out of their plight — the minister wants to “off-ramp” them, the police chief wants to “extract” them — the rights of women to safely work in this profession seem to be getting short shrift during the first two days of hearings in Ottawa on the government's Bill C-36. It was also a midsummer forum for unsubstantiated statistics and absolute overstatements without support. Certainly, there is no arguing sex workers — even that term has been shot down as misusing the term “work” — have not been victimized through intimidation, coercion and threats. Time and again MPs were reminded that no little girl decides to grow up to be a prostitute.
They heard survivors of the sex trade speak of being raped, beaten, held against their will, burned with cigarettes, having guns pulled on them and missing friends who have been killed. MacKay has anted up $20 million over five years for his off-ramp strategy, a figure even Hanson knows is miserly and would provide a city of Calgary's size with about $125,000 annually.

“If there is a commitment to deal with this in an adequate way then we have to adequately fund it,” Hanson says. Adequate, says Hanson, is prohibition. Until this utopian day arrives, women are still working our streets in an inherently dangerous profession who have a Charter right to their safety and security. Emily Symons of POWER — Prostitutes of Ottawa, Work, Educate and Resist — neatly explained to MPs how C-36, which criminalizes the purchase, but largely not the sale of sex, endangers sex workers in the capital. Clients fearful of arrest will no longer negotiate in well-lit, populated areas where prostitutes can properly screen them, she said. Instead, negotiations will be rushed, in darker, empty spaces, will likely reduce the number of clients forcing women into longer hours with less bargaining power to turn down potentially dangerous clients, even push away “safe” known clients who may no longer be comfortable in an area in which they are known. A smaller pool of clients just means harder, longer, more dangerous hours for women who need to pay the rent and buy groceries. Under this bill, Symons says, those who want out of the trade have all the human rights, at the expense of those who wish to stay in the trade. “Imposing morality at the cost of human lives is not acceptable,” said Robyn Maynard of the Montreal-based Stella, l'amie de Maimie. But that argument is dismissed by Daphne Nissani of Toronto's Free Them, who argues that johns were always ashamed to show their face and the only difference is that under this bill, they “might drive a little faster.” The real victory, Nissani said in an interview, is that the Conservatives are changing views on underage, vulnerable girls who have been forced into the sex trade. Canadians now begin to see them what for what they are — victims, not “whores” or criminals, she says. Perhaps the greatest disconnect here is the pocket change MacKay is offering to help young victims escape an unchosen life. One can't help but wonder where we would be today if more funds had been made available by successive governments on aboriginal education, job training, affordable housing, domestic abuse prevention, drug and alcohol intervention or rape crisis centres. What if social assistance really did pay the rent and feed the kids? Would there be as many vulnerable girls and women needing this off-ramp today? If proper money had been spent previously, $20 million today might have looked a lot better. Tim Harper is a national affairs writer.

A sharp-eyed photographer spotted the 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S test mule on the streets near the company's test center at the Nürburgring and took several spy shots.
Design Updates
The next-generation 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S will receive improved aerodynamic elements, revised front bumper with wider intake, more aggressive diffuser with two pairs of all-new exhaust tips. You can check all the updates in the photos below.
Engine, Specs, Performance
These are only speculations. Certain rumors claim that the 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S could be powered by Ford-sourced 5.9L V-12 engine producing no less than 592 horsepower, and it will be paired with an 8-speed automatic gearbox. If this turns out to be true, then this supercar will be able to reach the speed of 60 miles per hour in less than 4 seconds.
The 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S is said to hit the market in 2017, most likely by the end of year. There is also a word about the hybrid variant that will use Formula One technology. This one will supposedly be released by 2019, but we are still not sure if it is a truth or not.

A commenter named “tpeach” recently asked the following:
My question is, what would have happened if the Fed hadn't cut rates between Dec 07 and Apr 08? What would have happened to the base and velocity if the fed kept the rate stable while the Wicksellian or market rate plummetted during that time? Would the base shrink? If so, what are the mechanics behind that process? Also, how can the fed adjust the rate without changing the base? And why didn't velocity drop when they cut rates during this time?
I wasn't able to provide much of an answer. Here I'd like to explain why.
At first glance, the obvious counterfactual would seem to be a smaller monetary base and a higher path of interest rates. But that is a very fragile equilibrium, which could easily spiral off in one direction or another. For instance, suppose the Fed had reduced the monetary base in late 2007 in order to prevent any fall in the fed funds rate. What might have happened next? One possibility is that the economy would have gone into a deep depression in early 2008. Most likely, the Fed would have responded to that deep depression with a big rate cut and a big increase in the monetary base. Thus in this case the counterfactual path of the base would have been a bit lower in late 2007, and much higher in early 2008. Indeed what I just described is roughly what did happen between early and late 2008—I am simply contemplating that scenario playing out 6 months earlier.
Monetary equilibrium often has “knife edge” qualities. Imagine climbing along a mountain ridge with steep drop-offs on both sides. If you are not at the peak of the ridge, you have the option of walking a bit further up the slope. But if you go too far, you risk plunging down the other side. Monetary economics is kind of like that. Small changes are often “Keynesian” in character, meaning slightly tighter money means slightly higher nominal interest rates. But larger changes can easily be “Neo-Fisherian” in character, meaning tighter money leads to lower nominal interest rates. And it's not just a question of more or less tight money, it's more about expectations regarding the future path of policy.
Yip Cloud recently pointed me to the latest in his excellent series of interviews of macroeconomists, this one of Atif Mian:
Some people have the 5-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), others have the 7-year ARMs. Let's say that the mortgages started in 2005. When 2010 comes, in the middle of the slowdown, those with the 5-year ARMs would get the interest rate reduction because the mortgages reset to a lower rate automatically. They get this reduction in the interest rate that the Fed was trying to pass through to the individual households. But those individuals who have a 7-year ARMs still have to wait for 2 additional years before they get a lower interest rate. By taking advantage of this kind of variation in the cross-section, they can actually show the impact of the reduction in interest rate for the 5-year ARMs owners, by comparing them to the 7-years ARMs owners who didn't receive the same reduction in interest rate just because they have a different kind of financial contract. What they've shown with this kind of analysis is that a reduction interest rate is actually beneficial. It actually allows the lenders to boost their spending and improves local economic outcome, in terms of employment and aggregate demand. That's just one example that actually shows monetary policy can be effective. At the same time, that same work also shows why the monetary policy was ineffective. If you think about it, you need to be able to pass through the action of the Fed to the ultimate households. However, if people are struck in the 30-year fixed rate mortgages, they would not be able to take advantage of this lower interest rate environment. As a result, monetary policy is not able to pass through to the ultimate households. It is going to be constrained in the effectiveness. That's a very important insight that has come about because of this kind of work that I emphasized. That's a very interesting and useful development. If people have borrowing capacity and willing to borrow, the same monetary policy shock can have more impact on the real economy. When you lower interest rate, for people who are prone to borrow more, they can borrow aggressively against a lower interest rate and that boosts the economy. But if the same individuals have already borrowed a lot in the down-cycle, you can lower the interest rate but those individuals are underwater. They can't borrow any more. Then the same reduction in interest rate is not going to have much of an impact on the macroeconomy. This kind of logic also suggests that monetary policy itself is going to be insufficient in dealing with the downturn. You need to focus on something that Sufi and I have to try to emphasize in our book.
I can't emphasize enough that (as Friedman, Bernanke and Mishkin pointed out) changes in interest rates are not the same as changes in the stance of monetary policy, for standard “never reason from a price change” reasons. Thus it's not possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of monetary policy by looking at the impact of changes in interest rates. To take the most obvious reductio ad absurdum example, a Mexican currency reform exchanging 100 old pesos for one new peso will immediately reduce the price level by 99%, without any significant change in interest rates.

The court filing is a legal notice that the teen's parents, Maureen and Stephen Eng, plan to sue the city for more than $10 million.
City Education Department spokeswoman Margie Feinberg confirmed an investigation is underway and Sayar has been removed from the classroom.
"We are proceeding with charges seeking her termination," she added.
The SCI report says the allegations also have been forwarded to the Brooklyn District Attorney.
Sayar lives in a Park Slope apartment with her lawyer husband and their baby daughter. She has worked in city schools for 12 years and earns $78,885 a year. She couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday.
James Madison has had its share of forbidden affairs.
Spanish teacher Alini Brito and French instructor Cindy Mauro were the teachers busted in a 2009 after-hours rendezvous.
That same year, social studies teacher Allison Musacchio was under investigation for an inappropriate relationship with a male student.
The probe into Musacchio was closed because the teen was of legal age and had left the school.
Citywide, at least seven Education Department employees have been arrested for sex crimes this year, prompting Mayor Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott to push for legislation that would allow school districts — not arbitrators — to fire workers involved in sexual misconduct.

Warning: The above video contains scenes some may find distressing.
An air raid has hit a children's hospital in Syria's rebel-held east Aleppo, forcing medical staff to evacuate patients, including several newborn babies still in incubators.
The moment of the attack on Friday was captured by an Al Jazeera crew, including journalist Amro Halabi, who was reporting on survivors of previous Syrian and Russian bombing raids on rebel-held parts of the city.
Halabi was filming a man and his two children, who were suffered breathing problems from an earlier attack, when the room suddenly went dark immediately after a loud explosion.
Nurses and other medical staff were seen scrambling through the blackness, trying to rush the patients out of the badly damaged hospital as children cried out for help.
In another room, nurses grabbed babies from damaged incubators, with one staff member using a cloth to protect a visibly undernourished child before trying to console a weeping colleague, who was also carrying a newborn.
The nurses later moved the babies to another room, putting them on the floor next to each other and covering them with blankets. At least one of the infants still had medical tubes attached.
Staff told Al Jazeera that all of the babies survived the attack.
READ MORE: In east Aleppo, there is no way out
The city of Aleppo, once Syria's commercial centre, has been divided since 2012, with the eastern half largely in rebel hands and the western half largely controlled by government forces.
More than 250,000 civilians are still trapped in the east, which is under near constant aerial bombardment, with dwindling food supplies and extremely limited medical care.
Hospitals hide underground
Earlier, it was reported that at least 49 people were killed in east Aleppo in a bombardment that started late on Thursday, according to witnesses and activists. Friday was the fourth day of renewed bombing raids by Syrian government jets.
The onslaught began as Syria's ally Russia announced its own offensive on the rebel-controlled Idlib province in the country's north and Homs province in the centre.
Since then, more than 100 people have been killed across the north of the country.
A hospital in another Aleppo neighbourhood was also bombed on Thursday night, media reports said.
Only four of seven hospitals are still operating in the district, according to Adham Sahloul, of the Syrian American Medical Society, which supports health facilities in Aleppo.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists in the country to monitor the war, said dozens of air raids, artillery attacks and barrel bombs hit 18 different neighbourhoods of eastern Aleppo.
Government bombs targeted neighbourhoods with medical facilities, including the children's hospital and a nearby clinic that has one of the few remaining intensive care units in the east of the city, the Observatory said.
Many hospitals and clinics in the besieged area have moved their operations underground after months of relentless bombardment.
The World Health Organization said it recorded 126 attacks on health facilities in 2016, a common tactic over the five years of a war that is estimated to have killed more than 400,000 people.
The Russian and Syrian governments deny deliberately targeting hospitals.
My late father was born early enough to remember mail-order catalogues offering THC capsules to people who were having trouble sleeping or eating.
It worked, obviously. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the active ingredient in cannabis, and while the term "the munchies" didn't exist in rural Ontario during the first two decades of the 20th century, that's what the catalogues were selling. That, and a nice buzz.
Anyway, Dad said it was elderly people, farmers worn out by a life of hard labour, who used the capsules, and no one connected the drug to murder, insanity, death or the rape of white women by members of other races.
Then, in 1923, Canada lost its mind, bought the murder, rape and insanity thing, and criminalized cannabis, and for the next 93 years — to this very day — has persecuted heaven knows how many people, ruining lives, ending careers, denying comfort to the ill, and actually sending people to the horror of prison, all for something most smart people knew all along is a piddling, victimless act.
Lives ruined
Of course, most victims of this were young people, who are more easily caught than adults with private homes. Or minorities, because they're shaken down far more often by police.
And the stinking hypocrisy was that plenty of politicians, including prime ministers, and plenty of police, and plenty of judges had, at one time or another, smoked a joint themselves, but remained willing to continue wrecking other people's lives for doing the same thing.
Few had the courage to speak out.
Twenty years or so ago, doing a documentary on cannabis, I spoke to a man who, as a university law student in 1979, had persuaded the Joe Clark government to propose decriminalization in the speech from the throne. (When I asked Clark many years later what happened to that initiative, he answered: "Ronald Reagan happened.")
Prime Minister Joe Clark mentioned the possibility of decriminalizing marijuana back in 1979. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)
But would that former law student talk on the record? Umm, no. Because, you see, he'd become a Crown attorney, and although he assured me his views had not changed, the police wouldn't appreciate them.
I also called a judge (later to become a much more senior and famous judge) who, in her student days, had advocated for reform of marijuana laws. Would she speak? Please don't mention me, she said.
Ditto a federal public servant who'd once headed the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in 1979. He was just plain scared by 1993; he hung up on me.
I even approached former justice minister Kim Campbell, running for prime minister at the time, to ask if she'd ever smoked pot. Yes, she said haughtily, but if you understand the law, Mr. Macdonald, you'll know I never violated it, because I never possessed the drug. It was passed to me. (The Mounties instantly disagreed with her legal opinion.)
During the 1993 campaign, Prime Minister Kim Campbell admitted she'd smoked marijuana before. (Tom Hanson/Canadian Press)
It was a variation on Bill Clinton's not inhaling. Ridiculous, almost cowardly. Or Barack Obama, who admitted cocaine use in a memoir, then oversaw national crackdowns on pot.
Which brings us to Justin Trudeau. Let's be clear here: He openly acknowledged having used cannabis, and decided not just to decriminalize it, but to outright legalize it.
Good for Justin Trudeau. That took guts. That's called courageous leadership.
Conservatives, of course, will screech about this, until they shut up and accept it, the way they've given up fighting gay marriage.
But the weird thing is that legalization of marijuana is, strictly speaking, a conservative idea. Conservatives are, or are supposed to be, laissez-faire.
It's liberals who desperately want to use government to protect people from themselves.
Disclosure here: I enthusiastically smoked cannabis for years, until I stopped. It weirds me out now, and I can't handle it. It never made me want to try heroin, though, or rape anybody, or steal to get my pot fix. I am 100 per cent sure alcohol and tobacco, the single most preventable cause of cancer, did me far more damage. Let the government outlaw tobacco if it's so concerned about public health.
Big money
We are still in bizzaro world, by the way. We're supposed to be so much more progressive than the Americans, and yet hundreds of millions of Americans live in states where possession of cannabis is completely legal, or an offence that merits nothing more than a traffic ticket. At the same time, the Americans will bar a Canadian from the U.S. for life for admitting ever having smoked dope, and may continue to do so, especially under their bizarro-world new president.
And don't forget, there's a hell of a lot of money at stake here. Police, who have for decades inflated their budgets by busting kids for pot during the "war on drugs," are no doubt having urgent discussions with their political masters about keeping those budgets intact.
Police raids on marijuana dispensaries made plenty of headlines in Canada this year. (Judy Trinh/CBC)
And of course other public servants are licking their chops at the prospect of enlarging their departments.
The Liquor Control Board of Ontario is already waving its hand around anxiously. The recommendation of the federal task force that marijuana be sold in a separate facility from alcohol is even better; new LCBOs (MCBOs?) can be built, and all sorts more staff hired, thereby grossly inflating the price of a joint. It's the Canadian way.
No doubt some LCBO executives are already planning glossy monthly magazines suggesting pairings of Thai-stick or Maui Wowee with a nice leg of lamb or a risotto. The governments that sent people to prison for pot will be promoting it. Shamelessness always pays.

You can bet a month's pay that conservative corporate Canada is already planning to elbow aside the funky little shops selling things like "purple kush" and the "edibles" bakeries, the sort that operate in Colorado and Washington. We don't want to be having too much fun.
Here's something else you can count on: tax, and lots of it. This week's task force recommendations even proposed taxing more potent pot more heavily. For everyone's safety, of course.
Nothing ever really changes.
Oh, and one other thing: once legalization happens, anybody with a marijuana-related criminal record should be pardoned.

The former La Masia star has spoken out in defence of his two team-mates after allegations of a troubled relationship between the forwards surfaced
Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara has spoken about the alleged bust-up between Lionel Messi and David Villa , denying the two were at odds with each other.Following a breakdown in attack during the Blaugrana's 2-0 victory over Granada, Messi lost his temper and appeared angry at his fellow forward for not providing a better pass in the box.Villa responded to the reigning Ballon d'Or winner unkindly and the two then argued on the pitch for a few seconds, leading to reports that the pair are not getting along at the Catalan club.However, Thiago has played down speculation that there is any serious disagreement, and has instead explained that emotional arguments are just a normal part of the game.
“It is normal in football for that to happen, it was just a discussion,” the 21-year-old told reporters after the match.
“It shows the ambition of the players to keep growing. Everyone wants to improve and it is very normal. We're playing football and sometimes we are under pressure."
The Brazilian-born Spaniard also cited the volume levels at Camp Nou as part of why the players looked so riled when talking to each other.
“There are 90,000 people in Camp Nou and you're playing football, you have to shout.”
Barcelona are presently in first place in La Liga, one win away from matching their best start in team history if they can make it six wins out of six against Sevilla on Saturday, September 29.

"You're done fucked up, asshole. This here's our road. You gotta pay up." —Craig to Abraham Ford as he holds him up at gun point[src]
The Marauders are a small band of antagonistic survivors that serve as the main antagonists of Volume 10: What We Become for a short time.
Contents show]
Pre-Apocalypse
Nothing is known about the bandits before the apocalypse began. They may have been either friends or brothers (due to similar appearances).
Post-Apocalypse
After the apocalypse began, the trio likely formed up and began their criminal spree. Later, as Rick Grimes, Abraham Ford, and Carl Grimes sought shelter under a highway overpass, the trio ambushed Abraham, who was on guard, and began eyeing Carl. As Rick fought one of the bandits, with Abraham at gunpoint, one of the bandits attempted to rape Carl; this would mark an end to the group. As this happened Rick fatally bit the the neck of the Marauder that he was fighting, and Abraham shot the other at close range in the head. The last member of the bandits, in fear, surrendered and begged for his life as he attempted to flee, but was cut down as Rick chased him down and mauled the bandit with his own knife.

LA PORTE, Texas - One local firefighter walked on a treadmill for 24 hours straight to raise money for children of fallen firefighters and first responders in Texas.
Tony Constanzo, a La Porte Firefighter, spent 24 hours in heavy gear this weekend, walking for a good cause.
"October is Fire Prevention Month, so that's the reason for this time of year for us, Footsteps for the Fallen, to honor our fallen." said Constanzo. "Every October I try to do something out of normal."
The 32-year veteran walked on a treadmill at the La Porte Recreation and Fitness Center from 12 p.m. Friday until noon on Saturday.
The first treadmill Constanzo started on burned out after 16 and a half hours, so he finished the walk on a second one.
Last year, he walked 439 miles in 11 days for the same cause.
Solidarity poured in through social media and when Constanzo needed a bathroom break, employees at the gym paused the clock until he could jump back on the treadmill.
Constanzo runs a non-profit called Footsteps for the Fallen. Donations cover scholarships for the children of fallen firefighters and EMS first responders.
After the long walk, Constanzo finally took a seat and enjoyed a good meal, a Whataburger with cheese.
The file is a basic tool, but it would be a mistake to call it simple. Files come in a variety of shapes, cuts, and coarseness depending on the job they're designed to do.
Whether you're sharpening tools or cleaning up rough edges, choosing the right file starts with knowing the basics.
CUT
Most files come in 4 basic cuts: smooth, second, bastard (originally called a “Barsted” file, after its English inventor), and coarse. The cut describes the size of the teeth, with smooth cut being the smallest, and coarse cut being the largest. Large teeth will leave behind a rough surface, while small teeth will leave a smooth surface.
TOOTH PROFILE
File teeth also come in single cut and double cut varieties. Single cut files have one set of parallel teeth, while double cut files have a second set of parallel teeth at an angle to the first set. Single cut files are typically used for sharpening tools and finishing operations, while the more aggressive double cut files are used for rapid material removal and rough shaping of material.
SHAPE
The shape of the file used should be similar to the profile of the cut being made. For example, you might use a flat file to smooth flat edges, and a round file to taper the inside edge of a drilled hole. Common file shapes include flat, triangle, half round, round, and square.
STRAIGHT-FILING
The first and most basic filing technique is called straight-filing, and involves pushing the file lengthwise across the work, making contact only on the forward stroke.
Straight-filing is typically used to rapidly remove material.
DRAW-FILING
If a smooth surface is what you're aiming for, then it's best to use the draw-filing technique.
In draw-filing, the file is held on both ends and is pulled and pushed across the material crosswise.
CLEANING
Inevitably, your file will become clogged with material, and won't work as well. One way to prevent material from sticking is to scrape a piece of chalk across the file before using it. To remove the bits of material stuck between the teeth, you can clean your file by using a tool called a file card, which you scrape across the file in the direction of the teeth.
A new trailer for Fox's anticipated Batman prequel, Gotham, is debuting during Tuesday's MLB All-Star Game.
Set to Aloe Blacc's "Ticking Bomb," the gritty, stylized 45-second teaser that The Hollywood Reporter exclusively debuts focuses on a young Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie) as he finds himself deeply intertwined with the growing dissension in Gotham City.

"This is my city. I've come back because I care what's happening to it. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who cares. This town is at a tipping point: crime, corruption, ooze on every corner. Someone needs to take a stand against it all — and that is where we come in," Jim says in voiceover as glimpses of younger versions of Batman characters like Oswald Cobblepott/Penguin (Robin Lord Taylor), Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) and Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith).
Sean Pertwee (Alfred), Erin Richards (Barbara Kean), Donal Logue (Harvey Bullock) and David Mazouz (Bruce Wayne) also star. Bruno Heller serves as showrunner/executive producer.

Nature makes you happy. I don't need to tell you that. Neither does science, but studies confirm that time in nature reduces stress levels and cultivates a general sense of wellbeing.
But what is less understood is what happens if you walk a little further down the trail. Lingering longer and oftentimes alone in wild places, you may find yourself stumbling into a grove of grief; deep, unexpected and potentially disorientating.
I first discovered the grove during an immersion year of bush living five years ago.
The first few months were pure joy. A lifelong flirtation with nature was finally given the time and space to turn into a full-blown affair. Just like the early throes of love, I wanted nothing more than to spend all my time with this more-than-human lover -- to explore every inch of her skin, know all the secrets of her elements, the nuances of both her midday and midnight moods. I steeped myself in nature's embrace, even my dreams filled with wild creatures. She was in my hair, the pores of my skin, under my fingernails. I fell head over heels.

It was during the depths of my winter hermitude when the grief first bubbled up. While some of it I recognised as old personal stuff surfacing, the majority I couldn't account for. It didn't feel so much like 'mine' but arising through me, a product of this process of slowing down, of listening and observing, of opening my senses. The deeper I reconnected, the more the grief seemed to stir, equal in measure to the continuing joy of the unfolding relationship.
Back living between four walls after the year, the grief was palpable in a recognisable form -- the mourning of a lost lover. The ache of losing a mother. It has softened over time but at times arises sharp and cutting, especially when I return to the city from a stint away.
Like with any difficult emotion it was easy to think that I had taken a wrong turn and should try and retrace my steps. But I knew there are no dead ends in nature, only doorways to be stepped through into some new landscape to be explored with curiosity.

I talked to my friend Matt, who, for the past few years had been studying a nature connection program. He too found himself unwittingly set upon by what he described as "ancestral grief" that "started coming up in a massive way."
Luckily there are guides who have navigated the terrain we found ourselves in.
Master tracker and bird language guru Jon Young (who is touring Australia for the first time this month), speaks of hitting a 'wall of grief' almost as a rite-of-passage when in the process of reconnecting to nature.
"As we reawaken empathy with the smallest living things and strengthen our ropes of connection with our neighbors, the pain of generational disconnection from each other and nature arises."
Instead of pushing it away, Young encourages his students to welcome grief as an 'ally' that will help 'awaken our unique gifts'.
"For thousands of years, ancient wisdom traditions have developed practices to tend to the grief and fear that can hold us back from healing ourselves, our relationships with other people and our children, and our relationship with nature."
"Through these practices, grief becomes an ally."
Activist and scholar Joanna Macy has been guiding people into 'grief' rituals in order to reinvigorate their social change work.
"Our experience of pain for the world springs from our interconnectedness with all beings, from which also arises our powers to act on their behalf."
In her simply named 'Work that Reconnects,' grief is the glue to heal the illusion of separation between us and the rest of the web of life.

Francis Weller, author of new release Entering the Healing Ground: Grief, Ritual and the Soul of the World concurs, writing:
"Through our ability to acknowledge the layers of loss, we can truly discover our capacity to respond, to protect and restore what has been damaged."
....
After finishing the first draft of this blog at my usual café in Brunswick, I wandered into the wholefoods store. The woman behind the counter recognised my face from an event on Facebook. Without any knowledge of the subject of my thoughts, she proceeded to tell me about the four years she spent living in the desert on an Aboriginal community. "I was heartbroken when I came back," she said, her eyes filling with tears.
....
We only grieve what we love, and love is what guides us to acts of the greatest service. I now understand the grief to be the earth's reminder, a seed in my pocket, a lover's memento left deliberately in order to keep the thread alive, to not let me forget, to keep me on the trail and sniffing.
When we don't know what is being asked of us, perhaps this is where to start. To do, as Thich Nhat Hanh suggested, when asked what is the most important thing to do for the world, and simply "listen to the sounds of the earth crying."
After existing for more than a thousand years, the Mayan city of Tikal collapsed in the ninth century. At about the same time, halfway around the world, the city of Angkor was being founded. It would be the grand capital of the Khmer kingdom for six centuries before itself being abandoned.
The only contemporary account we have of Angkor is from a Chinese diplomat, Zhou Daguan, who arrived in 1296 and stayed almost a year. He tells us that the new temple of Bayon (all stone in what remains now, but still spectacular) had a gold tower, eight gold Buddhas, and a golden bridge flanked by gold lions leading to it. He writes of grand royal processions and firework displays, of a society with many slaves, open-air marketplaces with women vendors, and houses built of bamboo and thatch.
Angkor, the most extensive urban settlement of pre-industrial times, is now an archaeological park in northwestern Cambodia. Buses and trishaws ferry tourists between the ruins of some of the largest and most elaborate Hindu and Buddhist temples ever built. Some are only heaps of laterite blocks, but many are still astonishing: the towering lotus buds of Angkor Wat, the haunting Ta Prohm, in the clutches of time and strangler figs. Only recently have we begun to piece together how this and other ancient cities thrived and declined – their stories offer some intriguing lessons for cities today.

The true scale of Angkor as an urban settlement began to be confirmed around 20 years ago. The size and number of its temples turned out to be matched by the extent of the city around them. It was spread out over around 1,000 square kilometres – composed of temple complexes, large residential clusters and paddy fields irrigated by a canny network of reservoirs, canals, ponds and embankments. At Angkor's peak, in the 12th and 13th centuries, some three quarters of a million people lived there.
Angkor – a name thought to be derived from “nagara”, the Sanskrit for “city” – was a low-density urban settlement, its population spread out owing to agricultural land being part of the city. This was a pattern of urbanism found in several ancient metropolises, including the Mayan cities of central America, and Sri Lankan cities such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
These cities all went into decline relatively soon after attaining their prime. Angkor was flourishing in the late 13th century when Zhou Daguan visited; a little over a century later, it was all but abandoned. Researchers are beginning to see similarities in how these ancient low-density cities failed – and this is of particular interest today because, even as our cities grow in extent and population, their densities are falling.
“Almost all cities are dropping to extremely low density,” says Roland Fletcher, professor of theoretical and world archaeology at the University of Sydney. “For example, the middle of New York may be very crowded, but Greater New York is a vast, sprawling landscape with huge amounts of open land which are never out of sight of buildings.”
A similar pattern repeats with Greater Shanghai, Greater Tokyo, and the larger American and European agglomerations. The phenomenon of urban sprawl has largely been seen as a consequence of industrialised urbanisation: the availability of cars, outrageous real estate prices close to city centres, suburban aspirations of the middle class. But as Fletcher points out, there is nothing new about low-density cities.
He recalls delivering a talk in 1996 about pre-industrial cities at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. Someone asked him at the end of his talk if he'd seen radar imagery of Angkor taken from the space shuttle Endeavour. Fletcher had the image within a week, and the first thing he noticed was something that had been speculated to exist – “this whacking great canal coming down from the north”. The area with the temples proved to be just the centre of Angkor: “There were lines and patches and tanks and features all over the place. The immediate revelation was that this place was huge.”

Fletcher went to Cambodia in 1998 where he met Christophe Pottier of the École Française d'Extrême-Orient, riding around on a motorcyle to map Angkor. When Pottier pulled out his maps, says Fletcher, “If you didn't know what it was, you'd think it was a Mayan city.”
The pair teamed up to form the Greater Angkor Project, a Cambodian-French-Australian initiative that aimed to produce a detailed map of greater Angkor and investigate the reasons for its demise. They used high-altitude remote sensing technology to find urban forms concealed by forest cover, and conducted surveys and ground excavations.
There had long been a debate about what led to the decline of Angkor and the southward move of the Khmer seat of power. Proposed explanations included the strain on theocratic rule of Hindu-Buddhist jostling; attacks by Thai armies; and changes brought about by maritime trade. But the Greater Angkor Project added a significant new possibility: extreme climate instability. Analysis of tree rings in neighbouring Vietnam showed long periods of droughts followed by periods of unusually wet monsoons in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The upheaval caused by flooding during mega-monsoons is clearly visible in remote sensing images produced by the project: erosion channels show rapidly moving water breaching a dam, crashing into the wall of a reservoir, then tearing away the edge of a residential area, flowing at a high level through housing, and later damaging a bridge. Perhaps the scenes in Angkor were not very different from those seen in recent years in New Orleans or Fukushima.
Sand accumulated in Angkor's canals, and parts of the water network were cut off from each other. Damage to an old, complex water management system meant the city became less resilient in intervening periods of drought. Angkor, with its large population and broken infrastructure, would have found it hard to sustain itself.
The pattern of urbanism at Angkor was hardly unique: the Mayan cities that Pottier's maps of Angkor reminded Fletcher of have long been recognised as low-density agrarian settlements. The lack of the wheel and the absence of draught animals meant that large quantities of food could not be transported, and cities had to be largely self-sufficient, growing maize, varieties of beans, squash, manioc and other staples of the region.
The city of Tikal, in present-day Guatemala, was one of the most important of these Mayan centres. In what is called its Late Classic Period, around 600 AD, there was a flowering of art and architecture: large plazas, palaces, pyramid temples, sculpture and painted ceramics (of the many structures still found in Tikal, a 65-metre high pyramid is one of the tallest man-made structures in all pre-Columbian America). Conservative estimates put the city's population at around 45,000 during this period; the city extended over 160 square kilometres. Then, in the middle of the ninth century, Tikal collapsed.
Just how a large population was sustained, and then came undone, in the middle of a rainforest has been reconstructed in recent inter-disciplinary work by a team of researchers from Mexico, Guatemala and the United States. David L Lentz, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cincinnati, says: “We now have empirical data to tell you what the landscape looked like.”

Originally, the area of Tikal was around 70% upland tropical rainforest, and the rest swampy wetland. An extended family would build their houses in a cluster, with cultivable land attached. In all, the people of Tikal cleared around two-thirds of the rainforest to create their monuments and homes, and to fuel their fires. “In many ways they were managing the forest very effectively,” says Lentz. “But they weren't aware that cutting down a forest reduces the amount of precipitation in the region. Then suddenly a horrible drought comes along, and they can't figure out why they can't supplicate their gods adequately to prevent it.”
It didn't help that Tikal's water management system had become increasingly reliant on collecting rainwater in reservoirs, at the cost of groundwater. “As Tikal grew and grew,” Lentz says, “they created all these pavements around the city, from which they'd divert water to the reservoirs. But this cut off the recharge capacity of the springs. When there was no longer any rainfall to fill up their reservoirs, the springs had dried up too.”
For centuries, the Maya at Tikal had been erecting stelae – upright stone slabs with hieroglyphs and depictions of gods and rulers. The last one is dated 869. Soon after, there are signs of what might today be called urban decay, with palaces being occupied by squatters. Charred, gnawed human bones from this late period suggest desperate times. Then, the city went quiet.
Tikal's over-use of forested land ended up exacerbating the drought in the ninth century, and their construction compromised the city's back-up source of water. Both are familiar refrains from analyses of cities today. “They did at least two things that changed their environment in significant ways,” Lentz says. “This ultimately led to their demise. In the big picture, Tikal serves as an excellent model of us today, because we're following the same trajectory.”
Tikal had a population explosion in the seventh century and continued to adapt. “But they ran all of the resilience out of the landscape. Then, when the rains didn't come, they had no way to respond and the whole thing collapsed.”
Lentz draws a comparison with a neighbouring city called El Zotz, which had a smaller population, which didn't modify its landscape as drastically, and was thus able to survive the drought that felled Tikal.

In the ancient world, low-density cities were prone to episodes of collapse. But back then, only a minuscule fraction of the world's population lived in cities. According to Fletcher: “It's now generally reckoned that 50% of humankind lives in cities, a lot of which are relatively low density. In less than 200 years we've created a physical situation for millions and millions of human beings that has never existed before. It's completely unprecedented. We should probably take a fairly hard look at it.”
Tikal, Angkor and Anuradhapura (which foundered in the 10th century after thriving for more than a millennium) were very different cities in their geography, environment and social and political functioning. But, Fletcher points out, they all had operational similarities: extensive land clearance, sprawling low-density settlement patterns, massive infrastructure – all of which are attributes of modern cities. The extended infrastructure of Angkor and Tikal proved vulnerable to a changing climate, something else that may be upon us.
“Whatever the cause of climate change, we're in it,” says Fletcher. “And this fluctuation is getting serious.” He points out that events like the flooding of New Orleans have resonances with Angkor: “Both cities had developed a fantastic method of managing water. But if the impact that comes is outside the parameters of the system, you're in trouble.”
California continued its long-standing tradition for forward-thinking privacy laws today when Governor Jerry Brown signed a sweeping law protecting digital privacy rights.
The landmark Electronic Communications Privacy Act bars any state law enforcement agency or other investigative entity from compelling a business to turn over any metadata or digital communications—including emails, texts, documents stored in the cloud—without a warrant. It also requires a warrant to track the location of electronic devices like mobile phones, or to search them.
The legislation, which easily passed the Legislature last month, is the most comprehensive in the country, says the ACLU.
“This is a landmark win for digital privacy and all Californians,” Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of California, said in a statment. “We hope this is a model for the rest of the nation in protecting our digital privacy rights.”
Five other states have warrant protection for content, and nine others have warrant protection for GPS location tracking. But California is the first to enact a comprehensive law protecting location data, content, metadata and device searches, Ozer told WIRED.
"This is really a comprehensive update for the modern digital age," she said.
State senators Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) and Joel Anderson (R-Alpine) wrote the legislation earlier this year to give digital data the same kinds of protection that non-digital communications have.
"For what logical reason should a handwritten letter stored in a desk drawer enjoy more protection from warrantless government surveillance than an email sent to a colleague or a text message to a loved one?" Leno said earlier this year. "This is nonsensical and violates the right to liberty and privacy that every Californian expects under the constitution."
The bill enjoyed widespread support among civil libertarians like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation as well as tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Dropbox, LinkedIn, and Twitter, which have headquarters in California. It also had huge bipartisan support among state lawmakers.
"For too long, California's digital privacy laws have been stuck in the Dark Ages, leaving our personal emails, text messages, photos and smartphones increasingly vulnerable to warrantless searches," Leno said in a statement today. "That ends today with the Governor's signature of CalECPA, a carefully crafted law that protects personal information of all Californians. The bill also ensures that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to continue to fight crime in the digital age."
The law applies only to California law enforcement entities; law enforcement agencies in other states would be compelled by the laws in their jurisdictions, which is why Ozer and others say it's important to get similar comprehensive laws passed elsewhere.
The law places California not only at the forefront of protecting digital privacy among states, it outpaces even the federal government, where such efforts have stalled.
Civil libertarians and others have long lobbied federal lawmakers to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to offer such protection nationwide. An amendment to that law has been wending through Capitol Hill, where it has 300 co-sponsors. But the proposal is less comprehensive than the law Brown signed, and would merely focus on digital content. Currently, the federal ECPA requires a warrant for stored content that is newer than 180 days; the amendment would extend the warrant requirement to all digital content regardless of age.
California has long led the way in privacy protection. Voters amended the state constitution in the 1970s to provide explicit privacy rights far more robust than those guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. But while the state amendment ensured a right to privacy for all Californians, lawmakers couldn't envision the technological advances that would come in the decades to follow. The law that Brown signed today closes surveillance loopholes left by that amendment and "codifies what was intended by that privacy right," Ozer says.
"We certainly hope that this bill is a clarion call [for the federal amendment]," she told WIRED. "This is not only a comprehensive update for all Californians, but hopefully is a model for making sure that all Americans have this kind of digital privacy protection."
Krush Groove is a 1985 American film by Warner Bros. that was written by Ralph Farquhar and directed by Michael Schultz (who also produced the movie, along with George Jackson and Doug McHenry). This film is based on the early days of Def Jam Recordings and up-and-coming record producer Russell Simmons (renamed Russell Walker in the film), portrayed by Blair Underwood in his feature film debut. Simmons was the film's co-producer and story consultant; he also had a cameo in the film as a club owner named Crocket.
Plot [ edit ]
Russell Walker has signed all of the hottest acts to his Krush Groove record label, including Run-D.M.C., Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde (Alonzo Brown), and Kurtis Blow. Rick Rubin produces their records. When Run-D.M.C. has a hit record and Russell doesn't have the money to press records, he borrows money from a street hustler. At the same time, Russell and his brother Run are both competing for the heart of R&B singer-percussionist Sheila E. Also appearing in the film are LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, New Edition, The Fat Boys and some of their songs, as well as others from Chaka Khan, Debbie Harry, and the Gap Band. Members of the R&B group Full Force also make a cameo in the film as bodyguards.
Cast [ edit ]
The following appeared as themselves, except where noted:
Chris Rock appeared uncredited as a man standing next to phone during the fight in the club. Kara Vallow appeared uncredited as a Hip Hop Dancer. Coati Mundi was seen as a record shop owner.
Differences between the film and reality [ edit ]
Krush Groove is based on the inception of the Def Jam Recordings label and the hardships that artists Run-D.M.C. and Russell Simmons faced to become successful. Simmons began his career trying to get his company Rush Management up and running. However, in the movie, he is shown as already being teamed up with producer Rick Rubin to form Def Jam, referred to as Krush Groove Records in the film. In reality, the label was started by Rubin in 1984 in his college dorm at New York University.[3] The movie starts off with Run-D.M.C. and Kurtis Blow, known as the King of Rap, as two of the first artists to sign with the label, with both Blow and Run-D.M.C. as artists, songwriters, and record producers.
The beginning of the movie opens with Run-D.M.C. in the studio performing "King of Rock" for Simmons, Rubin, and Blow. However, the group was not always involved in the Def Jam scene as shown in the movie, and Rubin was not the producer of "King of Rock." Run and DMC had to persuade both Simmons and their original producer and bass player, Larry Smith, to give them a chance to record a demo. With the lyrics that Smith had once bought off of Run for $100, the group's first demo, "It's Like That," was created.
Larry Smith was the producer of Run-D.M.C.'s first two albums, despite them being credited to Rick Rubin, who produced the group's third album, Raising Hell.[4] However, in the movie, Larry Smith's role as producer is not portrayed at all.
Later on, the team was joined by its first popular teen sensation, LL Cool J, who plays a very small role in the movie at the age of 17. Playing himself, LL Cool J is discovered through his piece "I Can't Live without My Radio," which is performed at an audition in front of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Jam Master Jay, DMC and Rubin in The latter apartment. In reality, LL Cool J was discovered in Rubin's apartment but not through an audition. While going through a box of demos, Beastie Boy Ad-Rock stumbled across LL's demo tape.[5] With this, he produced a beat and co-wrote "I Need a Beat" with LL and Rubin, which launched both of their careers, which allowed the Def Jam label to take off.[6] The song "I Can't Live without My Radio" was made for the movie as a way for LL Cool J to star in it. However, this song was also one of the hit songs on his debut album Radio.[7]
Other artists that were a part of the Rush Management roster, but did not have a major role in the film, include the Beastie Boys, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, and Whodini. Characters that were not part of Rush Management but greatly contributed to the new scene were the Fat Boys, Sheila E, and New Edition.
The Fat Boys were the first group to showcase a human beat box while rhyming.[8] In the movie, the group originally referred to itself as the Disco Three. It was not until a scene in an Italian buffet, where the three boys took the phrase all you can eat to the next level by eating everything. When the group realized that they were really fat, they decided to give themselves the name Fat Boys. In reality, the name Fat Boys was suggested by the group's manager when he received a $350 hotel bill for extra breakfast ordered by the group on their European tour.[9] As portrayed in the movie, the group was discovered through the Coca-Cola and Tin Pan Apple hip-hop contest at Radio City Music Hall, where the trio won the grand prize—a recording contract—but had entered the contest to win the second-place prize, a stereo set.[8] The group perform their songs "Don't You Dog Me," "All You Can Eat," "Fat Boys," and "Pump it Up."
Throughout the movie, Sheila E. and Russell Simmons are romantically involved, which discouraged Run, who was always interested in her. In reality, Run did not like the concept of being disloyal to his brother, and the romance between and Sheila was made up.[10] Sheila E. made it into the film simply because they wanted a love interest, like in most films, and she recorded for Warner Bros. Records, the sister company of the film's distributor.[10] In the movie. Sheila plays herself, a drummer and percussionist, in which she performs her songs "Holly Rock" and "A Love Bizarre". In addition, all of the money issues that Russell Simmons faced in funding the label by borrowing from loan sharks and friends is also false.[10]
The movie was not made the way the artists desired, but with all the talent of that time and most of the members of the Def Jam and Rush Management family. The purpose of the movie, according to Russell Simmons, was to showcase the array of young talent emerging from New York's black music scene and depict its vibrancy.[11]
Production [ edit ]
Krush Groove was filmed in the Bronx, New York (including at least one scene in the Marble Hill projects). Among the locations where the movie was shot was the famous Disco Fever, a popular club during the embryonic stages of hip hop that, by the time of the film, had fallen on some hard times. Disco Fever owner Sal Abbatiello expected the movie not only to turn the spotlight on the burgeoning hip-hop movement but also to "bring attention [back] to the club" and so agreed to have scenes shot there. Unfortunately, the attention surrounding the filming brought the scrutiny of the local authorities, who shut the club down for good on the last day of shooting for not having all the proper licenses and permits. There was also a scene shot in Shepard Hall of the historic City College of New York.
During an interview to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the film, Russell Simmons reflected on the legacy of Krush Groove and its position in hip-hop culture history. The film, Simmons said, is still recognizable not only for having brought together so many Def Jam stars at the time, but for also introducing new talent, such as LL Cool J. Cool J was so persistent during filming, showing up to shooting locations and performing freestyles, that producers ended up putting him in the final cut. This backdoor auditioning process became a staple of the production.
The movie was released on DVD in 2003. Among the special extras included on the DVD are commentary from Underwood, Schultz, and The Source magazine Senior Editor Brett Johnson, a theatrical trailer for the movie, and the Krush Groove All-Stars video "Krush Groovin'."
Reception [ edit ]
The movie had a mixed reception.[12][13]
When the film was in release, fights broke out at some screenings.[14]
Other references [ edit ]
Krush Groove is referenced in the movie Dogma (1999) as being the subject of a bet between the two fallen angels, Bartleby and Loki, on whether it was going to be a bigger movie than E.T. (1982).
Soundtrack [ edit ]

Biomass is one of the most suitable alternative energy sources for Indonesia because of the large amount of agricultural residue the country produces, a scientist says.
Herri Susanto from the Bandung Institute of Technology, recently granted a Tanoto Foundation award for his research on biomass fuel, said biomass-based energy is cheap to produce and environmentally friendly.
“Biomass will save [us from] oil consumption. And, biomass is widely available in the country,” Herri told The Jakarta Post on Friday.
Biomass has gained global favor due to its low investment and maintenance costs, he said.
In three years of research beginning in 2007, Herri improved biomass gasification technology that produces electricity, fuel and heat.
Herri developed a catalytic cracking technology in order to minimize biomass tar levels, making biomass a more environment...
DAVAO CITY – Communist leader Jose Maria Sison has said attacks against government forces will continue for as long as President Aquino is in power.
Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer (by Facebook chat) that they found no reason now to make peace with the outgoing administration.

“There is no reason to have peace with the rotten Aquino regime,” Sison said.
Suspected members of the New People's Army (NPA) ambushed government forces in Negros Occidental on Saturday, killing at least one soldier with several others wounded.
On Sunday, suspected NPA rebels stormed the police station and municipal hall of Governor Generoso in Davao Oriental, wounding a policeman and abducting the town's police chief.
Sison explained that the recent NPA attacks were meant to defend communities and their forces from continuing attacks by government forces.
The communist leader said that while incoming President Rodrigo Duterte has been offering peace and a solution to the conflict, Mr. Aquino has opted to pursue government attacks.
“The people and the revolutionary forces are being attacked by enemy operations under Oplan Bayanihan. Aquino has not stopped these enemy operations,” Sison said.
Human rights groups claimed that Oplan Bayanihan, the counterinsurgency program of Mr. Aquino, has led to human rights abuses in the communities, including the deaths and massive displacements of indigenous peoples.
Sison said that in the absence of a ceasefire agreement, NPA offensives would continue.
“There is yet no peace agreement, not even an interim ceasefire agreement. We are still working hard to prepare the ground for formal peace talks. Duterte is not even seated yet,” Sison said.

Asked how fast the CPP could order the NPA to observe the ceasefire, Sison said the most crucial question right now would be to hasten the resumption of the formal talks and make an interim ceasefire agreement.
“It is pertinent to demand quick compliance only when there is already a ceasefire agreement,” Sison said.
Duterte said that the ongoing conflict has already caused too much damage not just to the military and the rebels but also to civilians. The incoming President said he would offer a ceasefire upon assuming office.
Duterte is also planning to release all political prisoners, including communist leaders, either through pardon or general amnesty. SFM/rga

Short-eared Owls, the open-country hunters
We got a break in the rain in the Seattle area on Friday. There were blue skies with few clouds which gave way to some wonderful rays from the sun. This gave us an opportunity to enjoy the local wildlife. We had been waiting on a good day to go view the Short-eared Owls of Leque Island. League Island Unit also known as Eide road, is located west of Stanwood between Port Susan and the Skagit bays. This is one of our favorite places to see these Owls. Short-eared Owls are easier to view and photograph than a lot of other owls because they are active during the day. They can be especially active at dawn and dusk.We arrived around eleven in the morning and stayed until just before the sun was setting, which is around five in the afternoon in the Pacific Northwest during fall/winter.
The owls gave excellent opportunities to view them as they were hunting the fields. Their hunting technique is to fly low over open areas chasing prey. Their flight has been described as a buoyant, floppy wingbeat, that makes them look like a giant moth. The owls started off moderately active and pick up later in the afternoon. While watching the owls fly around and hunt we also got a chance to witness a lot of vocalizations and wing clapping. This was the first time for me seeing the wing clapping. Wing clapping is part of the Short-eared owl's dramatic in flight courtship display.
Short-eared owls are open country hunters and are widely distributed throughout the world. It is a medium sized owl, with a mottled brown plumage with barred tail and wings. They have large eyes and big heads with whitish disks of plumage surrounding the eyes almost mask like. As their name implies their ear tufts are short. So short that they may or may not be visible. They have acute hearing which they use to hunt small mammals and birds. We did not see the owls with any prey in their talons, however we did see the owl take to the ground several times and land on snags and tree branches. To see more photos of the Short-eared owls taken on this day please check out the gallery Short-eared Owls,the open-country hunter.

Share. More on the future of the classic FPS next Thursday. More on the future of the classic FPS next Thursday.
The future of Unreal Tournament will be revealed next week, according to Epic.
A tweet from Mark Rein, vice president and co-founder of Epic Games, reads: "I love #UnrealTournament - So excited about the comeback! More next week!" Rein confirmed the news again, saying "Yes UT coming back!" when a fan asked for clarification.
Paul Meegan, vice president of product development at Epic, followed Rein's tweet with information on when we'll know more: "UE4 Dev Community + Epic. The future of Unreal Tournament. Tune in to Twitch.tv/UnrealEngine Thursday at 2pm ET."
This news comes as quite a surprise, as just last month, Epic founder Tim Sweeney said “We're not [planning on] shipping an Unreal Tournament game. We have a lot of nostalgia for the game but we're actually not developing anything in the Unreal game universe at all at the moment."
The last game in the series, Unreal Tournament 3, released over six years ago on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.

Louisville coach Rick Pitino expects guard Kevin Ware to be in uniform when the Cardinals open their season Nov. 9 against Charleston.
"He'll suit up for the first game," Pitino said. "Whether he gets in or not, we'll see."
Ware, who suffered an open fracture to his right leg during Louisville's Elite Eight game against Duke in March, was cleared to play last week and is working toward getting into game shape. Pitino expects that to happen in the next two weeks and anticipates Ware joining the team for full practice Nov. 1.
Ware, who has been concentrating on individual instruction and shooting, has been slowed this past week by a case of pinkeye, forcing him out of practice.
"He's taking it slow," Pitino said. "People want to see him on the court healthy. We want to see him flourishing."
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently announced a series of fee increases for immigration applications and petitions. One of those increases applies to petitions for nonimmigrant workers, which are required for musicians, artists, actors, athletes, and others who travel to the United States to work. On December 23, the fee for Form I-129, the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, will go from $325 USD per act to $460 USD per act, a 42% increase. An artist's crew (tour managers, roadies, etc) must also pay a separate fee of the same amount.
The Canadian Federation of Musicians (CFM) has responded to the increase, as Billboard reports: “A fee surge of this kind adds an additional and unacceptable financial burden on our members,” said executive director Liana White.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that the increase from $325 USD to $460 USD was per person. In fact, it is per act as a whole, no matter how many people that comprises. A separate fee, which will increase the same amount, also applies to the crew, again regardless of the number of people.

When I started to plan my trip to Argentina for my trek, I thought maybe I'd arrive a couple of days early and do something other than eat and walk in Buenos Aires. Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with those things! Those are indeed very noble activities in my book in that great city. But I was looking to just do something different. I looked at one-day or half-day tours, and I looked at museums and other similar attractions. One thing caught my eye due to my eternal wanderlust: Uruguay was just across the river and it would be really easy to cross by boat.
I was aware of Montevideo and Punta del Este. The latter seemed to require an overnight. Montevideo seemed a tad boring but I thought, “why not? it's the capital?” And then I ran into Colonia del Sacramento (or simply, “Colonia”). I had never heard of this place. Quick research led me to find out it was listed in “1,000 Places to See before You Die” so I had to learn more.
Funny how history runs its course…
Colonia del Sacramento was established by the Portuguese across the river from another small town called Buenos Aires in the late 17th century. The town was part of a ping-pong match in terms of who ruled it: Spain, Portugal, Spain, Portugal, …, Brazil, and then independent Uruguay. Must have been exhausting! The modern town's old quarter is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has a population of roughly 25,000 folks.
Getting to Colonia del Sacramento
Certainly one can get there by road from Montevideo but, if you are in Buenos Aires, the Buquebus ferry leaving from Puerto Madero is quite efficient and convenient. There are fast ferries that make the crossing in one hour (the river, at that point, is really no longer a river but the sea meeting the river) and slow-poke boats that make the crossing in three hours. Needless to say, three hours on a boat when I can do it in one was a no-brainer…. The one hour ferry was at 8:30 AM so that was a bit of a sacrifice since there was a line or two to make at the port… But it was the right choice. On the way back, since we wanted to have dinner in Buenos Aires, we took the ferry that arrived around 6 PM. One thing to mind is that there IS a time zone difference between Uruguay and Argentina (crazy).
Oh, and another thing to mind is that you MUST bring with you the reciprocity fee receipt for Argentina (if you are a U.S. citizen)… When you leave Uruguay, right at the port in Colonia, you will go through BOTH Uruguayan and Argentine immigration officers. When you get to the Argentine officer, if you do not have it, you are in a for a nervous wait to see what the officer will do with you. No, it did not happen to me, but it happened to a friend. Note: the other friend hanging with her volunteered to the officer “Oh, I don't have mine either” – lol! Somehow, the officer did not care about her but did about the other one.
The town – ruins
The thing to see in Colonia is the old quarter. When you exit the very modern port facility, you go out of the port and go on that same street uphill and, eventually, you will hit the main street where you will make a left and walk for like five minutes before you hit the old quarter. (There is a tourism info office outside the main building of the port but I did not go in.)
The old buildings have been beautifully kept up or maintained and the quarter is easy to walk around in. The old quarter is in a peninsula so you can't go too far without hitting the water except in one direction (as you can see in the map above). The old quarter has ruins of fortifications from those centuries when the European powers were trying to take control of the river. You can also see parts of the foundation of the former Portuguese governor's house and ruins of the old convent. Most of these ruins are, one could say, ruins of ruins but, nevertheless, they help understand how the town was set up and defended.
The town – buildings and structures
There old church, the Basilica del Sagrado Sacramento (Basilica of the Sacred Sacrament) was heavily restored starting in the 1950s. It is simple in its design and decor.
The town is clearly oriented to visitors from Uruguay and abroad with many cafés, restaurants, gifts shops, and art shops.
But the best this charming town offers is just the simple yet beautiful architecture of the streets in or near its old quarter. A peaceful setting graced by history and architecture!
Lunch time in Colonia!
Of course, we stopped at a local restaurant for lunch where I enjoyed an incredible pasta dish and we all enjoyed trying Uruguayan red wine – an unexpected treat (later followed by a cup of Freddos ice cream!)

Uncover Menopause and Osteoporosis – Women's Health By Divynen By
Have you read about menopause and osteoporosis lately? You really should.
A condition that a woman should be very much concerned about and one that could usually occur shortly after menopause is osteoporosis. However, to alleviate her concern about this condition, she needs to know that there are various steps that she can take.
Osteoporosis, which is simply bone loss, is an aging process that affects both men and women as they get older but women are the ones that are more susceptible to it. A woman's bone density is far less than that of a man, so this allows the bone much more time to age. The loss of bone mass in a woman starts at approximately the age of forty. After the woman has gone through her menopause, and before the loss of bone mass can return to its normal age-related rate, she has to go through an acceleration period of five to seven years.
Aging is a greater factor in bone loss than the lack of estrogen. Actually, if you are underweight, are a smoker, or taking medications, you are at a greater risk to suffer from osteoporosis. Because exercise increases bone mass. It is important that you exercise regularly. Women who have osteoporosis can lose some height and have tiny fractures. They are also very vulnerable to fractures of the hip. To help you prevent the loss of bone mass, it is very important to take the necessary steps, such as eating a proper diet, exercising, and taking the right vitamins. To start with, your doctor will want to know how much bone loss has occurred, so he will advice you to take a bone density test.
The spine is usually the first area to experience the loss of bone mass. So it is very important that your bone density test includes an x-ray scan which can measure the bone density of your lumber spine. If you notice that you are losing some height every year, then, it might not be necessary for you to take a special scan to identify your bone loss. But if you have begun to experience menopausal symptoms or are already going through menopause, then, it is very important that you take the bone density test now.
After you have taken your test, and it shows that your bone loss is not significant, you may not need to do anything, but you should remember that it is very important to keep your bones healthy and strong. So you should have follow-up tests done to keep track of any bone loss. But if the test shows that the rate of your bone loss is significant, you may want to actively start to take measures to prevent osteoporosis.
There are certain measures you can take to help you strengthen your bones which includes a combination of lifestyle changes and dietary measures for example, you should stop smoking, you should exercise for thirty minutes a day for three or four days a week, you should have a nutritional diet which includes enough calcium and vitamin D supplement. You should be sure to take extra care to avoid any falls as this could result in a fracture.
Osteoporosis can attack anybody at anytime. So you must take all necessary measures to prevent it, and if you do have it, then, do all that you can to keep it under control.
So now you know some about menopause and osteoporosis.
Construction delays at Tim Hortons field have cost the CFL, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the city millions of potential U.S. viewers in a lucrative television deal.
A Ticats home game on July 31 was originally scheduled to broadcast on ESPN — but it has been bumped to an online-only screening on ESPN3, CBC Hamilton has learned.
“Originally, this game was scheduled to be on ESPN to showcase Hamilton's new stadium,” said CFL spokesperson Jamie Dykstra. “But since the game has been moved to Ron Joyce Stadium, it will now be carried on ESPN's live multi-screen sports network, ESPN3.”
“ESPN will explore opportunities to feature Hamilton's new stadium on one of its linear TV networks later on in the season.”
The new $140-million stadium was due to be finished by July 26, which is the first Tiger-Cats home game. But earlier this month, officials revealed it wouldn't be done by the July 26 or 31 home games, and might not even be done before the Labour Day classic.
Moved to online platform
A spot on the main ESPN network would have given the team and the city the opportunity to showcase football and the new stadium to a massive U.S. audience. For example, ESPN's flagship news show SportsCenter averages up to 115 million viewers a month.
ESPN 3 is part of the WatchESPN platform that showcases live events online like World Cup global qualifiers, Premier League soccer, high school football, NCAA college football and KHL hockey.
Tiger-Cats CEO Scott Mitchell told CBC Hamilton that the move isn't a big deal "in the bigger picture."
"There will be plenty of opportunities to get ESPN down at Tim Hortons field," Mitchell said.
The deal is part of a five-year agreement between the CFL and the U.S. broadcaster, Mitchell says, which will help expand the CFL's brand stateside. But for right now, he's more concerned with Canadian brands like TSN, who broadcasts the CFL in Canada.
"We're a Canadian league and our main business is here in Canada," he said.
Still work to be done
There's still lots of work that needs to be done at the stadium. Crews still need to finish mechanical and electrical work, field drainage and every public elevator.
Infrastructure Ontario (IO) released a list of eight items that still need to be done, like sprinkler systems and handrails, installing some seats and "all mechanical and electrical work," the agency said in an email.
The heating and cooling systems also aren't finished. Much millwork remains, as does some of the stadium's lighting.
Pan Am subcommittee chair Lloyd Ferguson says the stadium construction delay "is what it is."
"It's completely out of our control."

With a screwdriver, some superglue, and roughly 10 minutes, just about anyone can turn the popular Square Reader into a skimming device that steals customer's credit card information, according to a group of researchers.
Ever since its debut in 2009, Square's mobile credit card processing device has become extremely popular by offering a cheap and easy-to-use alternative to traditional point of sale systems. Square's readers have become a common sight at small mom-and-pop businesses or for retailers that can't afford or don't want to buy a traditional point of sale system to accept credit card payments.
But new research conducted over the last year by three recently graduated students at Boston University could serve as a cautionary tale for consumers as well as companies selling mobile point of sale systems such as the Square Reader.
These systems pose uncharted security challenges, according to the researchers, because in order to achieve their low cost and size, manufacturers have to make compromises, including using lower quality components and relying on direct interactions with smartphones by design, which potentially allows merchants to use other apps when swiping the credit card.
"That could potentially be a recipe for disaster," John Moore, one of the three security researchers, told Motherboard in a phone interview.
This is an "a quick, easy, and cheap way to make a credit card skimmer."
Moore, along with fellow researchers and former classmates Alexandrea Mellen and Artem Losev, studied Square Readers over the last year and found a series of potential attacks that a malicious merchant could use to scam his or her customers.
The most concerning of their findings is the fact that it's possible to turn a current, the latest generation Square Reader into a device that steals customers credit card information. The three researchers found a way to physically tamper with the device and disable the encryption that normally protects the credit card data being transmitted to the smartphone. (The researchers will show exactly how they did during a talk on Wednesday at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas.)
Once you know what you're doing, this is an "a quick, easy, and cheap way to make a credit card skimmer," Mellen said, adding that the tampered, unencrypted, device "will still look exactly like the Square Reader."

Square counters that the tampered device won't work with the Square app. But Mellen noted that it can be also used as a generic skimmer.
Moreover, the researchers also found that even with a regular, non-altered, encrypted reader, a malicious merchant can log the credit card swipes on his or her smartphone and play them back later to make fraudulent transactions. Mellen, Moore and Losev said they have devised a method to easily record the signal created by the credit card when its magnetic strip gets swiped through the Square Reader, and later play it back through the Square app to charge the card again.
The researchers created a custom app that makes this trivial to do, but they told me that it's possible to do even without the app. (Moore and Mellen told me they still haven't decided whether they will release their app.)
"I can take that signal and convert it using a decoder freely available online, and then I have your credit card information," Mellen told Motherboard.
Their custom app, which they called "Swordphish," essentially automates that process, taking the recorded signal, storing it away, and decoding it into credit card information, the researchers said.
"I can take that signal and convert it using a decoder freely available online, and then I have your credit card information."
A malicious merchant could use their method to scam customers by first swiping their credit cards to record the signal. (In 2013, another researcher showed how much data it's possible to see from a credit card swipe through a Square Reader.) At that point, the merchant could just pretend the first swipe didn't go through and swipe it again using the Square app. To the customers, everything went as planned, but if the merchant is using the altered Square Reader, he or she now has the name and number of the credit card.
But even without the tampered reader, the merchant can still use the recorded encrypted audio signal to make other payments in the future through Square, according to the researchers.
Regarding the software vulnerability that theoretically allows malicious merchants to playback recorded swipes, Square admitted that it's possible, but dismissed this as an actual bug in their response to the researchers.
"We do not see it as a security risk," a Square employee wrote in the bug report, published on the bug bounty service HackerOne, which Square uses to interact and reward independent security researchers. "In particular, it is not possible to process a stored swipe more than once."
Moreover, the company claims that they are tracking delayed, out-of-order swipes as a sign of potential fraud, "so we'd probably notice if you started throwing too many of these into our system," a Square employee told Moore in December of last year.
"We do not see it as a security risk."
The researchers said that they also found this type of scam was possible with the older models of Square Reader, which did not include encryption. Until May, according to an archived version of its site, Square claimed that "all previous readers continue to be secure," (the page containing that claim appears to have since been removed).
By reporting this issue to Square in December, the researchers prompted the company to recently stopped supporting its older readers. A Square spokesperson said that as of July 22, the old unencrypted readers "no longer work," and thanked the researchers, who "encouraged us to speed up our deprecation plans." (The company also paid them $500 for reporting this issue.)
When it came to tampering with the Square Reader and turning it into a credit card skimmer, the company claimed that's not an issue, because if somebody breaks the device the way the researchers did, it will stop working with the Square app.
This response was "very frustrating" to the researchers, according to Mellen, because when they reported their method of altering the Square Reader to the company, Square dismissed it.
In fact even if the tampered reader won't work with the Square app anymore, it can still be used to scam customers. For example, a seller could just pretend the swipe worked and let the customer go, or pretend it didn't go through and ask the customer to swipe again using a backup Square Reader, Mellen told me in an email.
In any case, the three researchers want customers to be aware of potential risks and not blindly trust these technologies.
"Just because now we are able to process credit cards using our smartphones, it doesn't mean that everything it's just as secure as it has been in the past," Moore said. "And it doesn't mean that the technology has gotten to a point where they don't need to worry about their personal information or stop watching their accounts for fraudulent charges."
This story has been updated to add Mellen's comments on how a malicious merchant can still scam customers using an altered Square Reader.
Girls and a Boy in Halloween Costumes Run From Their House
Any girl dressing up as, say, Mr. Potato Head or any boy donning a Lady Gaga outfit (a rather easy gender-bending costume choice) this Halloween were left out in the cold at one recent party in Utah.
One affiliate of the famously conservative Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints circulated a flier in a Sandy, Utah neighborhood inviting costumed kids to their Halloween party. But on the holiday where usually anything goes, there were a couple of surprising restrictions at this Mormon party. “Please no masks or cross-gender dressing,” the flyer read.
(LIST: 8 Costumes to Avoid This Year)
The church ward hosted the party Tuesday at their local church. But certainly some local children were left out by the invitation, which implied that their choice of costume was somehow inappropriate. One neighborhood resident, who isn't part of the Mormon church, said she was “appalled” by the invite. Raquel Smith said the flyer sent a message that was “fear-mongering and hate driven,” by forbidding kids the option to choose any costume they want. Smith admits she was ashamed of the community.
But LDS Bishop Dennis Toone, presider over the church ward hosting the party, claimed it's written in the Latter-day Saints' doctrine to forbid both masks and cross-dressing. But this claim was denied by LDS Church spokesman Scott Trotter who told the Salt-Lake Tribune, ” The flier does not represent church policy.” Indeed, the church's handbook discourages masks because of security concerns, but the Tribune notes they found nothing about gender-bending costumes.
But all costume commotion aside, it seems to us that even the party was a watered-down version of Halloween. They group hosted a so-called “trunk-or-treat” event, where kids don costumes in a parking lot and collect candy from every car. Sounds like the least scary version of Halloween we can imagine – and what is this holiday without a little fear of the unknown?
Though we wonder if girls dressed as Justin Bieber would have passed muster.

Neymar Jr. is a well-oiled marketing machine. Not only is the Brazilian footballer a Nike brand icon, but you can also find him on the cover of video games like Pro Evolution Soccer 2016. However, because traditional commercials simply aren't enough anymore, the sportswear giant is trying something different to promote its Hypervenom Phantom II soccer boots: VR. The Nike virtual reality experience, introduced this week, lets people step into none other than Neymar's shoes. You can feel what it's like to have defenders flying toward your feet, dribble the ball and, of course, score a goal -- all things the Brazil and Barcelona player is familiar with. To get the full effect in VR, you'll need to have a Google Cardboard headset, though the video can also be enjoyed using YouTube's 360-degree feature.
Queensland has no plans to expunge the record of people found guilty of homosexual acts under historic laws - despite New South Wales and Victoria moving forward with pardons - because it doesn't consider it a priority.
A 2012 Federal Senate inquiry found all state and territory governments should examine ways to expunge convictions under laws which existed in Queensland until 1991 and made consensual homosexual acts illegal.

The Victorian government brought the issue back into the spotlight when it moved to quash the convictions of men found guilty under laws it repealed in 1980.
Both the New South Wales government and its opposition have vowed to support a private member's bill which will see that state follow suit.
It was enough to make the milk in their cappuccinos curdle.
Customers at a coffee shop in the U.K. learned they could get a free drink if they liked its Facebook page. They reacted with bemusement when baristas handed them drinks with data like their names, ages, jobs and living addresses written on the cups.
That information was gleaned by not-for-profit Cifas, which filmed their reactions with hidden cameras.
Granted, not every coffee shop's Facebook page has a small army of data experts combing the internet while a barista steams some milk.
But the message is clear: many people's personal information — probably more than they realize — is online and searchable by anyone from nosy neighbours to co-workers to identity fraudsters.
Apps aren't really free
Anita M. McGahan a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, says the video is a good reminder of how much personal information we give out in order to use social media and other modern apps.
"In exchange for all these quote-unquote free services, such as the ability to stay in contact with our friends on Facebook, that freedom isn't really free," she told CBC News. "What you're paying with is information about your identity."

Ann Cavoukian, executive director of Ryerson University's privacy and Big Data Institute and former Ontario information and privacy commissioner, often talks to students in middle or high school about how best to control the flow of information on their most commonly used apps.
"They're clueless that the information they provide online may lead people back to their physical homes," she says of young digital natives.
But once they're armed with the right knowledge, "they know exactly what to do. They know how to protect their data better than I do."
Facebook's Help Center has a comprehensive guide to the privacy options available to users. You might want to keep it bookmarked for an occasional refresher. (Facebook)
"I think people should regularly, at least a few times a year, take a look at all the permissions, and all the privacy settings that they have in all of these apps, and think about whether they're comfortable with them," privacy and tech lawyer David Fraser told CBC News.
He specifically mentions Twitter's ability to tag users in other people's tweets or photos, as well as tagging a tweet's location, using a smartphone's location capabilities to share where you sent a tweet. Both can be turned off.
"We live in a busy world and a busy society, but it's really to their benefit, a couple of times a year, to set aside half an hour and think about these sorts of things." he advises.
Facebook privacy settings: Here's where to start
On desktop computers, Facebook users can take a privacy checkup by clicking on the small padlock icon on the top right of their screen. It'll ask you some basic questions about your profile, including who can see your posts (Friends? Anyone in the public? Only you?). It also asks who can contact you. For instance, you can restrict future friend requests to friends of your friends.
If you want more nuanced control of your privacy settings, however, you'll have to click on the small triangle right next to the padlock. It's the menu that also includes links to creating groups, ads or simply logging out of Facebook.
Click on settings, and take a look at the privacy link on the left side of the menu for an expanded version of the privacy checkup menus.
Facebook users can try the privacy checkup to choose who sees your posts and which third-party apps have access to your profile, but you'll need to go deeper into the menus for full control. (Facebook)
There are separate settings to configure who sees posts you make in the future, as well as "past posts" or anything you've posted before the last time you tinkered with these settings.
You can also toggle whether your Facebook profile can be found by outside search engines. Turn this option off and no one will be able to find embarrassing photos with a simple Google search.
Facebook'sHelp Center also includes a section on privacy basics, with a pretty extensive guide to all the privacy settings available to a user. Think of it as an instruction manual for Facebook's basic functions. It doesn't hurt to keep it bookmarked.
When in doubt, just don't post it
For all of the settings, tutorials and app functions users can tinker with, however, there's no avoiding the fact that once something's out there on the internet, it's very hard to make it disappear forever.
For tech columnist Peter Nowak, safer is better than sorry. That comes with posting photos, status updates about where you are, and common profile data like your birthday and hometown.
"I think your default setting when using these services is don't trust them at all," warns Nowak. "You can't really trust Facebook or other social media companies to guard your information. You need to have common sense and be careful about what you put out there in the first place."

Kratom Nation has recently launched their inaugural product, the Kratom. Kratom is a completely natural product that has a number of different effects. One of these effects, and one that has not been discussed much yet, is that it also encourages weight loss. Kratom Nation wants to highlight this effect in order to help people shed unwanted pounds.
"Kratom as a natural product has been around for some time," says a representative from Kratom Nation. "People have used it for years as a pain reliever and sedative, as well as to increase their energy levels. New research has shown that it is also beneficial in terms of losing weight."
Kratom Nation had started to conduct pieces of independent research into Kratom effects and they encourage anyone who has used the product and has experienced weight loss to come forward. They believe that Kratom is a far more effective product than Garcinia Cambogia, for instance, which is widely accepted as being an effective weight loss aid even though it has not been scientifically researched. Their goal is to make sure that Kratom is properly studied so that effects can be enhanced as well.
The company offers a number of different strains of Kratom and they have received various reviews on the effects of each of them. "Although one of the more mild strains of kratom, the effects offered by Premium Bali kratom are more useful than they are recreational," says one reviewer. "What that means is that this strain is good for an energy boost, a positive attitude and some light painkilling properties."
Kratom Nation, with website at kratomnation.com, is also keen to dispel the myth that Kratom is a drug that people use to get high. Kratom does indeed have a stimulant effect, giving people more energy, but it is certainly not a recreational drug. Furthermore, it is believed that it is the very fact that it provides more energy that could be conducive to weight loss. The company is keen to continue their research studies and hopes that people will come forward to discuss the effects they have noticed.

The blind shark (Brachaelurus waddi) is one of two species of carpet sharks in the family Brachaeluridae, along with the bluegrey carpetshark (Brachaelurus colcloughi). Found along the coast of eastern Australia, this nocturnal, bottom-dwelling species is common in rocky areas and seagrass beds from the intertidal zone to a depth of 140 m (460 ft). It often roams in tidal pools where it may be trapped by the receding tide, and can survive for an extended period out of water. The blind shark is not actually blind; its common name came from its habit of closing its eyes when taken out of the water.
Maturing at under 62–66 cm (24–26 in) long, the blind shark has a stocky, grayish to brownish body with white flecks and darker bands that fade with age. Its head is wide, flattened, and blunt, with small eyes on top and a pair of long barbels underneath. It has large pectoral fins, two nearly equal-sized dorsal fins placed far back on the body, and an anal fin placed close to the caudal fin. The blind shark feeds primarily on small invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous with females bearing litters of 7–8 pups in the summer. This small shark adapts readily to being kept in captivity. It is not valued by either commercial or recreational fishers, and its hardiness means that incidentally caught individuals are likely to be returned to the water alive. In the absence of substantial threats to its population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as of The Least Concern.
Taxonomy and phylogeny [ edit ]
German naturalists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider originally described the blind shark as Squalus waddi, in their 1801 Systema Ichthyologiae. However, there is uncertainty over whether their account was referring to this species or the brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum), as it was based on a painting by John Latham that could not be located by subsequent authors. In 1907, James Douglas Ogilby coined the genus Brachaelurus for this species, from the Greek brachys meaning "short", and ailouros meaning "cat".[3] In 1973, Leonard Compagno placed it and the bluegrey carpetshark in their own family.[4] This shark may also be referred to as the brown catshark or dusky dogfish.[5]
Various phylogenetic studies, based on morphology, have concluded that the blind shark lineage represents the sister taxon to the wobbegongs.[6] Blind shark fossils have been found in Late Cretaceous period (99.6–65.5 Ma) deposits from Europe, as well as in Pliocene epoch (5.3–2.6 Ma) deposits from Chile and Peru. A number of other Brachaelurus species are also known from the fossil record.[1]
Distribution and habitat [ edit ]
The blind shark favors rocky habitats.
The range of the blind shark is restricted to the eastern coast of Australia, from Mooloolaba in southern Queensland to Jervis Bay in New South Wales; past reports from off Western Australia and Northern Territory appear to be misidentifications of the brownbanded bamboo shark.[2] The blind shark is a bottom-dwelling species that generally inhabits the continental shelf from the intertidal zone, including tidal pools barely deep enough to cover its body, to a depth of 73 m (240 ft), though it has been recorded as deep as 140 m (460 ft).[4][5] Preferred habitats are rocky areas and adjacent seagrass beds; juveniles are common in high-energy surge zones.[2] In Nelson Bay, this shark has been observed lying in the open atop sponges.[7]
Description [ edit ]
The blind shark has a stocky body and a wide, somewhat flattened head with a blunt snout. The small, oval eyes are situated high on the head and have strong ridges underneath; the oval spiracles are positioned behind and below and have obvious raised rims. The nostrils are placed almost at the tip of the snout and have long, tapering barbels in front and well-developed skin flaps and grooves around the incurrent openings. A pair of obvious grooves connect the nostrils to the small, almost transverse mouth. There are 32–34 upper tooth rows and 21–29 lower tooth rows; each tooth has an upright, awl-shaped central cusp and a pair of lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fifth pair close to the fourth.[4][8]
The pectoral fins are large and broad, with rounded margins. The two dorsal fins are roughly equal in size and have rounded apices and angular free rear tips; the first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are rounded and almost as large as the pectoral fins. The anal fin is less than half the size of the dorsal fins and is positioned very close to the base of the long, low caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises about a quarter of the total length, with no ventral lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are large, giving the skin a rough texture.[4][8] This species is light to dark brown above, often with white flecks, and lighter below. Juveniles also have dark bands over the body and tail, which fade with age.[9] The blind shark can reach a length of 0.9–1.2 m (3.0–3.9 ft), though most are much smaller.[4]

Contrary to its common name, the blind shark has "perfectly adequate" vision.[10] It was so named by anglers because it retracts its eyeballs and shuts its thick lower eyelids when removed from the water.[4] This species can live for up to 18 hours out of water, allowing it to survive being stranded by the outgoing tide.[9] The blind shark is secretive and sluggish during the day, with adults usually hiding in caves or under ledges and juveniles inside crevices, though it will take food given the opportunity. At night, it moves out over reefs and seagrass meadows to forage for small invertebrates (including crabs, shrimp, cephalopods, and sea anemones) and bony fishes. Prey items are captured via suction.[2][4]

The blind shark is aplacental viviparous with a possibly annual reproductive cycle.[2] Females give birth to 7–8 pups during the summer; newborns measure 15–18 cm (5.9–7.1 in) long. Sexual maturity is attained at under a length of 62 cm (24 in) for males, and 66 cm (26 in) for females.[4] It has lived to 20 years old in captivity.[10] A known parasite of this shark is an undescribed species of tapeworm in the genus Carpobothrium.[11]
Human interactions [ edit ]
The blind shark is basically harmless to humans, though it can bite if provoked and is difficult to remove, owing to its strong jaws and powerful suction.[8][9] There are cases of blind sharks biting and holding onto divers' wetsuits even after they surfaced, and could only be removed by prying open the sharks' jaws.[7] This species is one of the few sharks considered suitable for private aquaria, as it is hardy, grows to a small size, and has sedentary habits, though its nocturnal, reclusive nature make it difficult to observe. The blind shark has even been induced to breed in captivity, with the Sydney Aquarium having successfully maintained a breeding colony.[10]
Commercial fisheries do not target or utilize the blind shark, as its flesh has a strong ammonia-like taste that is not easily removed. It is caught incidentally by prawn trawl and other fisheries off Queensland and New South Wales, though post-discard survival may be high due to its ability to tolerate being out of water. Small numbers of blind sharks are caught by recreational fishers, who regard them as a nuisance because its small mouth and strong jaws make removing lodged hooks difficult. It is generally too small to be susceptible to shark nets used to protect beaches. The impact of collection for the aquarium trade on this shark is unknown but not thought to be severe.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the blind shark under Least Concern, as it remains abundant and the various pressures on its population do not seem to pose significant threats. Its range overlaps a number of current and proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).[2]

TREZOR Shop Priority Pricing Explained
SatoshiLabs Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 12, 2017
Dear TREZOR Community,
While it pains us to do so, today, we were forced to increase the priority surcharge, due to the continually growing demand for our products. The interest in Bitcoin is surging, along with its price, which translates into greater sales for us too. Unlike Bitcoin, however, which does not have a physical barrier that would stop it from growing in value, our hardware production has hit manufacturing limitations, which are unfortunately not scalable in the short run.
Our next strategy is motivated by our intention always to have a limited stock available in our TREZOR Shop, ensuring those who need the device will still be able to purchase it. To do so, we had to act. We cannot influence the supply anymore, due to its inelasticity; hence we can only affect our sales by adjusting the price. Regrettably, we will have to alter the price until it matches the demand we can supply.
This change, however, does not mean that you need to purchase a TREZOR with the priority charge at a higher price. If you can afford to wait, you can pay the standard MSRP, and we will ship the device to you at a later date, in February 2018.
We are deeply sorry we have not been able to predict this development earlier and had to engage these emergency measures during the last days of 2017. We hope that you will be able to understand our decision.
Thank you,
TREZOR Team
Farmers often douse their fields in herbicides to clear the area of weeds. But scientists have found that bees depend heavily on these weeds for food, suggesting that farmers should consider conserving these pesky plants.
We need bees to pollinate crops and flowers. But bee populations have been crashing, probably due to a combination of disease, pesticide exposure, and other factors. Bees living in agricultural areas might also suffer from food scarcity, but “to the best of our knowledge, no study has ever considered both pollen and nectar diet for bees in farmland landscapes,” researchers write in Ecological Applications.
The team monitored apiaries in a 450-square-kilometer area in France, where cereal, corn, rapeseed, and sunflower crops grew. From 2008 to 2012, the scientists set up 50 hives spread over 10 locations each year. They installed pollen traps at the hives and measured the amount of nectar in some hives as well. Then the team analyzed the samples to figure out which plants the bees had visited.
The most common sources of nectar were crop plants, and bees collected the most nectar in April-May and July-August, when the rapeseed and sunflowers bloomed. But bees canvassed a wider variety of plants for pollen, visiting more than 200 species. During the two-month period between crop flowerings, as much as 40 percent of their food came from weeds such as red poppies.
Weeds could be a key part of the bees' diet because many species are available, and they continue to flower when crop plants do not. Weed pollen can help bees weather a tough period when the number of bees in the hives has peaked but food is scarce, the authors suggest. By using less herbicide, farmers could help maintain weed populations — and support the bees as well. — Roberta Kwok | 27 November 2014

Of course we love our mom & pops, and our favorite burger joints around the country are pretty much all independently owned, but there are certain times in life—overnight layovers, hungover Sunday mornings, all-day shopping trips at the outlets—that the only options around are the chains. Chain Reaction is here to help you decide when to go for the burger, and when you're better off sticking with the chicken fingers.
Hamburger Mary's 8288 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90046 (map); 323-654-3800; 10 other locations in the US; visit hamburgermarys.com for list
The Schtick: A premium burger chain with gay-friendly atmosphere
The Burger: The namesake Mary Burger is a half-pound patty that takes its cues from the fast food classic
Setting: Let's call it "Drag Queen Chic"
Want Fries with That? Nope; fresh-cut, but over-seasoned spuds
Prices: Mary Burger (w/cheese and fries), $11.24
You might imagine that a gay-themed burger franchise is a relatively new addition to the American restaurant scene, but the small (though nationwide) chain called Hamburger Mary's was actually started back in 1972. Where was their first outlet? You guessed it, San Francisco.
The restaurant chain has eleven locations across the country and can lay claim to being "the ONLY national franchise actively marketing to the gay community." They market themselves as a family-friendly restaurant and bar, but the fun is geared toward the adults with themed drinks and the like. The menu and convivial atmosphere is certainly enough to win over the kids should you bring them by.
Hamburger Mary's won't let you down with its friendly service and commitment to good times (drag shows and legendary bingo nights abound), but the burgers are another matter. Are they bad? Not by a long shot, but they have room for improvement.
It's worth noting that Mary's, while chock full of their own creations is, at its heart, a customizable burger spot. You choose your patty from grain-fed chuck, grass-fed chuck, Kobe, ostrich, salmon, turkey, ahi tuna, buffalo, chicken breast, or vegan. The bun isn't up for as much discussion as Mary's seems set on using a full-size King's Hawaiian classic sweet burger bun.
I ordered the Mary Burger, the most classic of their many burger offerings. It comes topped with lettuce, tomato, and pickle, along with A Thousand Island dressing for good measure. I added American cheese to the eight-ounce grain-fed chuck patty.
Mary's will bring your burger out medium unless you specify otherwise, so I made sure to get my medium-rare preference. It arrived somewhere between the two, but I'd say it was cooked pretty close to perfection for my tastes. The grill marks on the patty were evident and there was some char in the flavor, but I could have used a little more crunch in the crust. Along with that was a noticeable under-salting. Instead I got a whiff of a seasoning blend that seemed better suited to a steak.
The toppings were all fresh and actually enjoyable (even the tomato!), and even more pleasing was the patty's hefty juiciness. The King's Hawaiian bun had one of the most pliant and pleasing textures of any commercial bun I've come across, but the downside was its signature sweetness. Although I can usually enjoy that sugary note, on the Mary Burger I found it a bit cloying when added to the sweetness of the Thousand Island. That said, the texture was spot on.
The fresh-cut fries had a great potato flavor that, sadly, was overwhelmed by the heaps of seasoning that covered them. If you're in the mood for fries, I'd suggest asking them to hold the seasoning.
On balance, Hamburger Mary's makes a solid burger. The ingredients are fresh and the meat is properly handled on the grill, yet somehow they just fall short of coming together for burger greatness. Would I go for just the burger? Probably not, but then again, that's not all Mary's is selling. They're selling a gay-friendly, good time spot that makes some solid food. On all those counts they succeed. And considering the state in which Mary's was born is still figuring out our nation's promise of equality, this is one time when I have no problem supporting a fair burger.

It's hard to put my finger on the exact moment the idea for the Apex Book of World SF series first crystallised, but the seeds for it were sown long before. I grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, and even as a child I was drawn to fantastical works, many translated from Europe: not just Tove Jansson's Moomins, but Janusz Korczak, Michael Ende, Astrid Lindgren, Erich Kästner and many others, alongside the numerous translations from the English.
Even then, I was drawn to seek out homegrown Hebrew fantasy, too: my favourite being Eli Sagi's mid-60s trilogy of science fiction novels, the Adventures of Captain Yuno, in which a pair of children, Yuno and Vena, travel throughout a solar system teeming with mysterious alien life (charmingly illustrated by the prolific artist M. Aryeh). When I wanted to write a high school dissertation on Israeli science fiction, I contacted the foremost translator of the genre, who dissuaded me rather bluntly with the words: “There isn't any.”

It always stuck with me, that line. Even then, I didn't think it was true. Perhaps he had meant that what there was, was not much good. Or perhaps he meant that it simply was not American enough. I changed the topic I was going to write on, but my interest remained.
The first time I went backpacking, at 17, through east and then western Europe, I sought out obscure works of local SF: I still own the two Nemira anthologies, for instance, published on thin rice paper in 1994 and 1995 in Romania, or strange works of fantasy published by a still-Soviet imprint in Moscow.
But I think one defining moment was a visit to China back in the turn of the millennium: I had been so warmly welcomed by the science fiction community there that I felt almost duty-bound to repay the favor in some way, and I could only best do that, I thought, by helping Chinese SF be published abroad. This did not happen immediately, of course... and for a long time seemed likely never to happen at all.

In 2005, a single issue of a magazine called Internova came out in Germany. It was edited by three German fans, and I became involved relatively early on, also helping bring in several other contributors. It was the first time that a magazine dedicated to international speculative fiction was launched in decades (there had been a short-lived attempt by Fred Pohl in the 1960s) – but more importantly, it was the first time such an endeavour was undertaken by people from outside of the dominant Anglophone sphere.
Internova was not without problems. It was a slick paperback production, but it was hard to get hold of. E-books were still not a very common option and distribution made it difficult for anyone to find. In addition, the committee style structure didn't allow for quick decision-making. Internova was an inspiration, an eye-opening experience that such things were even possible, but it did not last beyond its first issue (it did re-emerge as a website later on, though).
What Internova couldn't do, I thought (with a mixture of naïve optimism and not a little hubris!) a single person might achieve. The idea for a sort of “best of” anthology, selecting stories for reprint from a wide variety of venues, seemed possible – if only anyone could be convinced to do such a strange thing. I had been working with Jason Sizemore at Apex for some time then, and ended up pitching him the idea, my entire pitch consisting of the words “It won't sell anything or make you any money but it's worth doing anyway!”
Advertisement
Jason, to my surprise, agreed. Suddenly, my daydream was on its way to becoming a reality.
I was already keeping my eye out on any international story being published, though back in 2008, when I was putting the first volume together, it was far harder to find material!
One of the things I was most proud of was being able to publish two Chinese science fiction stories in that very first volume, thus fulfilling my promise to myself. Back then, people like Ken Liu and John Chu were not yet doing the sterling work of translation they are doing now, and the stories I received were merely rough draft translations done by the authors themselves. I ended up doing the translation edits myself – a difficult job when one doesn't speak the original language! But the stories – “The Wheel of Samsara” by Han Song, and “Wizard World” by Yang Ping, were finally done, and the authors were happy with my efforts. Only recently, I received a permission request for “The Wheel of Samsara” to be taught in a UK university course.
Advertisement
I also ended up translating one story – Nir Yaniv's “Cinderers” – myself, from the original Hebrew, and another of his, “Benjamin Schneider's Little Greys”, for the subsequent special World SF issue of Apex Magazine which I edited. This second story remains one of my favourite of his.
Quality was an aim of the anthology from the start. I was lucky enough to publish two World Fantasy Award winners – Thai author S.P. Somtow, and Serbian Zoran Živković—and in some cases, I drew on my own travels and collecting. I came across Tunku Halim's stories while in Malaysia, where they were successfully published, and was delighted when I was able to publish one. Then, of course, there was Aliette de Bodard, quickly making a name for herself, a fellow non-Anglophone in the strange waters of SF short story publishing, who has since gone on to multiple awards and novels.
It's hard to describe what an odd creature that first volume was. Things change rapidly, as much as they stay the same. Back in 2008, print-only submissions were still a barrier to many international writers. Electronic magazines were still considered lowlier than their print counterparts, though this was rapidly changing. My intention with the series was to focus on the now, to offer a snapshot in real-time, as it were, of core genre from outside the US/UK block. As such, it fascinates me to see how it changed in the years that followed.

The Apex Book of World SF came out in 2009 and, to our considerable surprise, did well enough that Jason was happy to let me do another. Volume 2 was longer, bigger, and with 26 short stories, up ten from the previous volume. I still drew on contacts and obscure sources, but could see more international fiction being slowly published in the new e-zines coming up. Keeping an eye on talent, I think, is easy: Lauren Beukes was clearly going places, and won the Clarke Award shortly after graciously agreeing to be in Volume 2, and Nnedi Okorafor went on to win a well deserved World Fantasy Award, and was clearly a major talent in the making. Another of the contributors, Silvia Moreno-Garcia, has recently published her well-received debut novel, and signed a further 2-book deal with a major publisher. I expect we'll hear a lot more about her, too.
For me, I was able to source Latin American and African writers sorely missing in volume 1, and to features new authors and new countries. (I should note that the series has two basic rules. We do not publish the same authors twice, and we will publish up to two authors from one country in a single volume. This is designed to allow for both flexibility and diversity and best serves the series in its function as a showcase. In addition, any form of speculative fiction is welcomed, including science fiction, fantasy, horror and any of their many sub-genres).
Advertisement
Alongside Volume 1, I had also begun the World SF Blog, initially a promotional outlet that very quickly outgrew its original purpose. In its four years it published hundreds of articles, links, interviews and discussions on every aspect of international SF, and itself began to publish fiction. By the time it had ended, in 2013, it had won a British Science Fiction Association Award for non-fiction, as well as a special Kitschie. People prominently involved with the blog included Charles Tan, a massive supporter of the entire project, who took on the task of producing much of the original non-fiction content of the site, and fiction editors Debbie Moorhouse and then Sarah Newton.
Alongside the blog and the anthologies, we also began the World SF Travel Fund, to allow international writers to travel to the World Fantasy Convention on part of full funding.
By Volume 3, I was able, ironically, to draw on the blog itself for some of the stories! Volume 3 truly showed the dominance of women writers in the field today, and as for the Chinese writers I continued to publish, I was now able to feature professional translations by Ken Liu. However, at this point, I had reached my goal: I had somehow, however unlikely it seemed, managed to produce and publish three volumes of international speculative fiction in 6 years. I watched the number of writers virtually explode; the rise of online publications such as Clarkesworld and, later, Tor.com, who made a conscious effort to publish global works, as well as translations; the death, finally, of the dreaded print-only submission as even the last of the print magazines at last adopted electronic submissions, removing one great big barrier to publication; and the rise of new, specialized anthologies such as Afro SF and Breaking the Bow, which highlighted original fiction from Africa and India, respectively.

The world was, slowly, changing. But I had one dream left.
My secret goal had always been to reach the three volume milestone. But what I wanted to do then was to see the series continue under other hands. Diversity, after all, is as much a function of who gets to make the choices, and it seemed to me only natural for a series such as this that it could only continue to be relevant if I myself stepped back from it: if it had new editors who could offer a new perspective. This would have likely remained a dream, had not the supremely talented Mahvesh Murad stepped into the ring with all the swagger and naïve optimism I myself must have possessed back with Volume 1. Smart, knowledgeable and incredibly well-read, she took to the task with enthusiasm, even as I began to chuck story after story and anthology after collection at her. Her debut anthology, The Apex Book of World SF 4, contains 28 stories from some 25 countries, and includes the first Pakistani winner of a Stoker Award, the first Dutch winner of a Hugo, and many, I suspect, of the future rising stars of speculative fiction.

When I look back on it all, I wonder how it ever happened. But the truth is, we were there all along. The future of science fiction is dependent on its global nature, on its international authors, who each bring their own unique visions and experience, their own background and culture, and their shared love of the fantastical to their work. From Uganda to Bangladesh, from Mexico to France, from Israel to the Philippines, science fiction is alive and kicking, a vibrant new generation of writers changing the face of the genre one story at a time.
I think that's something worth celebrating.
BTCC, an international cryptocurrency exchange with headquarters in China, has announced it has ceased all domestic trading activities.
On its website, BTCC now states that all local trading in yuan and cryptocurrencies has been officially suspended as of midday, September 30, Beijing time. The exchange stopped accepting deposits on September 27, with China-based users being advised to withdraw their funds from the exchange before the end of October.
In a tweet accompanying the closure, BTCC claims to have had the longest known lifespan for a cryptocurrency exchange, having operated for a “world record” of 2,305 days.
The closure of the exchange's China-facing trading operations comes following a statement from financial regulators on September 4, which banned developers and entrepreneurs from launching token sales (or ICOs) within the country. Exchanges in the country have since “voluntarily” decided to cease trading activities, though regulatory pressure is widely believed to have been the catalyst.
BTCC will continue to operate trading services outside China, and has also confirmed that its mining pool will continue to operate normally. Other major cryptocurrency exchanges in the country – including Yunbi, Huobi and OKCoin – are expected to cease trading by the end of October.
Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BTCC.

We have a mixed bag of news for readers today! Let's get right to it.
Based on the observations of this local, it appears that Game of Thrones is now filming season five around the Mournes. The show has filmed in the Mournes several times over the past few years, most notably when Daenerys enters Vaes Dothrak in season 1, and last year's scene when Arya and the Hound encounter a Riverlands farmer and his young daughter.
Game Of Thrones fan? They'll be filming in the Mournes tomorrow if you want to catch a glimpse. pic.twitter.com/5bWpUtJ862 — Paul Wyatt (@PaulWyatt94) August 12, 2014
In other Game of Thrones news:
Titanic Quarter has been granted approval for their plans to extend their Belfast studios. TQ is home to Paint Hall, where Game of Thrones films much of every season. The £14m studio expansion was proposed last year, and will almost double the existing space. The BBC reports that Game of Thrones is causing the demand for additional space in the city. They also note that the expansion will have some environmentally-friendly technology including roof-mounted solar panels.
In discussing Diana Rigg‘s stage work in No Turn Unstoned at Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the actress talks Game of Thrones, and there's indication that we'll see Olenna Tyrell in the fifth season. The Festival writer notes when sharing the dame's love of gaming on breaks, “Once the Fringe is behind her, she'll be heading to Dubrovnik for more filming, as well as passing on some crucial down-time skills to her younger co-stars.” Rigg caps off the interview by saying, “I'm really grateful for Game of Thrones. It's something wonderful to happen to an actress of my age and Dubrovnik is astonishingly beautiful.“ No Turn Unstoned runs through August 23rd.

Every year in December, North Hills resident Brian Welch receives a batch of holidays cards from strangers thanking him for bringing a bit of joy to the neighborhood.
“Thank you for another year of smiles to lighten up our hectic world,” one reads.
While the well-wishers may not know Welch personally, they can't miss his handiwork: a 12-foot-high ivy hedge trimmed in the shape of a giant poodle.
The ivy poodle, which Welch calls Fido, resides at the corner of Hayvenhurst Avenue and Plummer Street next to Bull Creek. Around the holidays, it transforms into a reindeer—donning a red nose, antlers and multi-colored Christmas lights.
“This year we added more lights so it really pops,” said Welch.
Welch began trimming the poodle over 30 years ago when an ivy bush started to grow up a telephone pole and next to his home. The poodle quickly became something of a local celebrity. It's been the subject of numerous newspaper stories, internet blogs and even a TV bit for the Discovery Channel.
Welch, 74, is a retired contractor who moved to the Los Angeles area from England when he was 21. He had originally planned to open a hairdressing salon in Santa Monica after completing barber college in England. But the plan fell through when Welch's business partner went back to the U.K. because his girlfriend decided she didn't like living in California.
He later moved to North Hills to raise his family. His two sons Mark, 36, and Andrew, 32, help him decorate the poodle for the holidays. About five years ago they added the reindeer decorations, fashioning the antlers out of Styrofoam and canvas material.
“We turn him into a reindeer instead of dog,” said Welch. “He's a dog with an identity crisis!”
In 1987, Welch received a notice from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ordering him to take down the decorations and remove the hedge. He ignored the warning and said he hasn't heard from the utility since.
“It's not my property,” he said. “It's on city property, they can come and cut it down.”
Welch said he plans to keep trimming and decorating the poodle for as long as the telephone pole can handle the weight.
This year, he hopes the decorations give comfort to families affected by the local wildfires.
“Just putting a smile on people's faces, that's the whole idea,” he said.
ATLANTA - Georgians who returned to the polls in several races that required runoffs because no candidate won more than half the vote in the May 24 primaries were hard of incumbents.
The last World War II veteran serving in the Georgia Legislature, Rep. John Yates, lost to a GOP challenger for a Griffin, Georgia.. So did Republican state Rep. Tom Dickson, a Dalton GOPer who fell to a conservative rival. And long-serving Democratic state Rep. Darryl Jordan of Riverdale was given the boot.
The misery for incumbents extended to another office-holder, state Sen. Mike Crane, who was soundly defeated by former West Point Mayor Drew Ferguson in the race for a U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Lynn Westmoreland.
All but a handful of incumbents secured their seats during the Georgia primary two months ago, including one candidate facing a DUI charge and another who praised the Ku Klux Klan. Tuesday's contests were low-turnout affairs dominated by candidates who could convince the same voters who backed them in May to turn out again.
In Southeast Georgia, the only runoff races were in Brantley, Camden and Glynn counties.
Glynn County
Superior Court (Republican): Ronald Adams 54%, Samuel Tostensen 46%
Coroner (Republican): Jo Chapman 45%, Mark Neu 55%
Commissioner District 2 (Republican): J. Peter Murphy 59%, Dale Provenzano 41%
Camden County
Board of Education District 5: Mark Giddens 59%, Ronnie Wise 42%
Brantley County
Sheriff (Republican): Len Davis 61%, Robert Thomas 39%
Coroner (Republican): Wyatt Blount 53%, Richard Rowell 47%
Commission Post 3 (Republican): Randy Davison 71%, Michael Edgy 29%
The Georgia Secretary of State's office said about 20 percent of registered voters turned out for the primary two months ago.

Two little noticed but important events took place in the US last week.
First, the Supreme Court of the US began hearings in a case filed by a baker from Colorado, Jack Phillips, who had refused in 2012 to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple citing his religious beliefs.
Second, the Senate passed a tax Bill with a tag provision that rescinds the (Lyndon) Johnson Amendment which has prohibited religious and charitable institutions (501 c(3) organizations in US tax statute) from making tax-deductible political contributions. The Johnson amendment promulgated in 1954 implied a clear separation of church and state.
In different ways, both cases tackle the issue of the separation of religion and state. The case of Masterpiece Cakeshop (Phillips's bakery) against the State of Colorado Civil Rights Commission pits the right of equality (granted to the same-sex couple under the declaration of US independence and by the 14th Amendment) against the right to freedom of expression (the First Amendment says “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof").
The revocation of the Johnson amendment effectively means that the evangelical right in the US will now have congressional approval (and tax exemption) for political involvement.
For more than 200 years since the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, the separation of church and state has been a core belief anchoring the development of liberal democracies. In the US, the phrase itself was first used by Thomas Jefferson in the context of building a wall between church and state and its importance to the First Amendment. That core belief was strengthened at various times but most recently during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.
In the US and elsewhere, we may be beginning a period where the Westphalian notion of nation-state sovereignty gets stronger but the separation between church (or temple or mosque) and state gets weaker. It is time to speak with one voice in favour of clear and effective separation.
Geographically and metaphorically, the US is quite distant from India. Given a different history and a divergent state of economic and political evolution, societal angst in India is reserved for markedly different things than in the US. And yet, we have already begun to see that the separation of temple and state granted under the Indian Constitution has begun to change. The 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution enacted in 1976 inserted the word “secular" in the Preamble. The relationship between religion and state has not otherwise been defined anywhere in the Constitution but is implicitly guaranteed throughout. Equality is guaranteed by the fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution that ensures, among other things, a right to equality, right to freedom of speech and expression, right to religious freedom and an important right to constitutional remedies.
The recent case of Hadiya Jahan née Akhila Ashokan should have been a slam- dunk case of an adult woman having the constitutionally protected right to religious freedom as an adult. Instead, first the Kerala high court and then the Supreme Court muddied the waters and pronounced a decidedly panchayati and paternalistic verdict by ordering her to continue her studies.
Further complicating the matter, the Supreme Court did not opine on the annulment of Hadiya's marriage ordered by the Kerala high court. The very institution required to protect Hadiya's right to constitutional remedies ended up violating it. The only hope is that the Supreme Court sees the error of its ways when it pronounces on the deferred issue of the annulled marriage and rectifies the argument.
This was a case of implementation falling short of the constitutionally guaranteed right to equality. However, in matters of personal law, the Indian code itself is unequal, with the applicable law based on an individual's religion. Hindus, Sikhs and Christians fall under common law. Muslims are covered under a Sharia- inspired personal law. There are a plethora of Acts that govern marriage, divorce, maintenance and succession, such as the Hindu Marriage Act (1955), the Indian Succession Act (1925), the Special Marriage Act (1954), the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act (1939) and so on. Some political observers will argue that the consolidation of all these acts under a Uniform Civil Code being considered now is inspired by the political philosophy of the ruling party. Be that as it may, the Constitution should never have had an embedded inequality based on religion. That inequality was cemented by the shameful reversal of a Supreme Court order in the Shah Bano case in 1985 by the then Rajiv Gandhi government pandering to an orthodoxy of Muslim men.
The prevailing wind around the world is to insert religion into matters of state in the so-called national interest. This is a dangerous streak which will complicate the functioning of liberal democracies and deny the very freedoms that our democracies were designed to protect.
There may be temples and mosques at every street corner, but they must stay separate from state.
P.S: “Religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together," said James Madison. Jesus in the Synoptic Gospel says, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

Man kills pup inside washing machine, posts photos on Facebook
Hong Kong police have been asked to investigate after photos showing a puppy in a running washing machine surfaced on Facebook with the words “The fastest way to take a shower: immerse it, rinse and drain, done. Clean and easy” in simplified Chinese.
The photos prompted a public outcry, with netizens writing in to know if the dog had been killed.
The dog owner, shown on his Facebook account as Jacky Lo, replied that the animal died during a second wash.
When told he could get three years in prison and a HK$200,000 (US$25,800) fine for the brutal killing, he said he does not care.
“Not to talk about dogs and cats, killing several people is not a problem [sic],” he wrote.
Several netizens alerted the police by e-mail and a spokesperson for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said they are closely following the case.
“We could see from the photos that the washing machine is running” with the dog inside, the SPCA spokeswoman was quoted as saying by Apple Daily on Friday.
The photos were first uploaded on Aug. 12 but were not made public until Friday morning.
In 17 hours, the post had been shared 4,000 times.
Lo is said to be a Guangdong-born, Hong Kong-based man and reportedly works as a golf coach in Shenzhen. He recently moved to Hong Kong and often commutes across the border.
A Hong Kong netizen posted a Facebook link to Lo's personal information including his car license numbers and home address, drawing a taunt from Lo.
“Great, you are so fast. Let me give you a ‘like',” Lo wrote back.
Lo said he works in Shun Tak Fraternal Association Leung Kao Kui College but the school headmaster denied any such employee, according to Apple Daily.
The man has posted photos of himself with luxury cars including a Maserati and a Lamborghini, in a luxury apartment and on a yacht.

On Thursday afternoon, a radicalized Muslim US Army officer shouting, “Allahu akbar!” (“God is great!”) committed the worst act of terror on American soil since 9/11. And no one wants to call it an act of terror or associate it with Islam.
What cowards we are. Political correctness killed those patriotic Americans at Fort Hood as surely as the Islamist gunman did. And the media treat it like a case of nondenominational shoplifting.
This was a terrorist act. When an extremist plans and executes a murderous plot against our unarmed soldiers to protest our efforts to counter Islamist fanatics, it's an act of terror. Period.
When the terrorist posts anti-American hate speech on the Web; apparently praises suicide bombers and uses his own name; loudly criticizes US policies; argues (as a psychiatrist, no less) with his military patients over the worth of their sacrifices; refuses, in the name of Islam, to be photographed with female colleagues; lists his nationality as “Palestinian” in a Muslim spouse-matching program and parades around central Texas in a fundamentalist playsuit — well, it only seems fair to call this terrorist an “Islamist terrorist.”
But the president won't. Despite his promise to get to all the facts. Because there's no such thing as “Islamist terrorism” in ObamaWorld.
And the Army won't. Because its senior leaders are so sick with political correctness that pandering to America haters is safer than calling terrorism “terrorism.”
And the media won't. Because they have more interest in the shooter than in our troops — despite their crocodile tears.
Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan planned this terrorist attack and executed it in cold blood. The resulting massacre was the first tragedy. The second was that he wasn't killed on the spot.
Hasan survived. Now the rest of us will have to foot his massive medical bills. Activist lawyers will get involved, claiming “harassment” drove him temporarily insane. There'll be no end of trial delays. At best, taxpayer dollars will fund his prison lifestyle for decades to come, since our politically correct Army leadership wouldn't dare pursue or carry out the death penalty.
Maj. Hasan will be a hero to Islamist terrorists abroad and their sympathizers here. While US Muslim organizations decry his acts publicly, Hasan will be praised privately. And he'll have the last laugh.
But Hasan isn't the sole guilty party. The US Army's unforgivable political correctness is also to blame for the casualties at Fort Hood.
Given the myriad warning signs, it's appalling that no action was taken against a man apparently known to praise suicide bombers and openly damn US policy. But no officer in his chain of command, either at Walter Reed Army Medical Center or at Fort Hood, had the guts to take meaningful action against a dysfunctional soldier and an incompetent doctor.
Had Hasan been a Lutheran or a Methodist, he would've been gone with the simoom. But officers fear charges of discrimination when faced with misconduct among protected minorities.
Now 12 soldiers and a security guard lie dead. At least 38 people were wounded, 28 of them seriously. If heads don't roll in this maggot's chain of command, the Army will have shamed itself beyond moral redemption.
There's another important issue, too. How could the Army allow an obviously incompetent and dysfunctional psychiatrist to treat our troubled soldiers returning from war? An Islamist wacko is counseled for arguing with veterans who've been assigned to his care? And he's not removed from duty? What planet does the Army live on?
For the first time since I joined the Army in 1976, I'm ashamed of its dereliction of duty. The chain of command protected a budding terrorist who was waving one red flag after another. Because it was safer for careers than doing something about him.
Get ready for the apologias. We've already heard from the terrorist's family that “he's a good American.” In their world, maybe he is.
But when do we, the American public, knock off the PC nonsense?
A disgruntled Muslim soldier murdered his officers way back in 2003, in Kuwait, on the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Recently? An American mullah shoots it out with the feds in Detroit. A Muslim fanatic attacks an Arkansas recruiting station. A Muslim media owner, after playing the peace card, beheads his wife. A Muslim father runs over his daughter because she's becoming too Westernized.
Muslim terrorist wannabes are busted again and again. And we're assured that “Islam's a religion of peace.”
I guarantee you that the Obama administration's nonresponse to the Fort Hood attack will mock the memory of our dead.

BROCKTON – Authorities are appealing to the public to help find the driver who struck and killed a Brockton pedestrian as he crossed Belmont Street on Sunday night.
The victim was Carl Yancey, 31, of Brockton. Yancey was a long-time employee of Shaw's on Belmont Street and friends and family said he was a larger-than-life personality with a big heart.
Brockton police Sgt. Mark Celia said city and state police are investigating the fatal accident.
“They're actively looking for a hit-and-run suspect,” Celia said.
The accident occurred about 9:30 p.m. Sunday at Belmont and West streets, near the 7-Eleven at 662 Belmont St. Police received a 911 call alerting them to the accident.
Yancey was taken to Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, where he was pronounced dead.
Yancey's sneakers were seen on the street pavement as investigators combed the area for evidence Sunday night. The State Police Accident Reconstruction Unit responded to investigate.
Police are reviewing surveillance videos from nearby businesses to try to identify the vehicle that fled the scene.
Police had no vehicle description on Sunday night, but asked the public to be on the lookout for a vehicle with extensive front-end damage.
Celia urged anyone with in formation to call detectives at 508-941-0234.

Classes have resumed at York University after two students suffered non-life threatening injuries in a shooting at the school's north-west campus.
Toronto police said the shooting took place in one of the school's food court areas just before 11 p.m. Thursday night.
Const. Victor Kwong said that one woman was shot in the leg and another woman was hit by shrapnel. Both victims were taken to hospital.
Police said they don't think there were any intended targets. They believe the incident may have occurred by accident, when a young man with a gun was running through the area, CTV Toronto's Tamara Cherry reported from the scene.
Officers are now looking for a male suspect who was seen fleeing the area on foot.
The shooting prompted a lockdown on the university campus, located at 4700 Keele St. The lockdown was lifted just before 1 a.m.
The university's president and vice-chancellor, Mamdouh Shoukri, said his thoughts were with the two victims, who he identified as students.
"Our immediate focus is on supporting the two students and their families, and in providing counselling support for York community members," Shoukri said in a statement released Friday. "Senior university representatives have been with the victims at the hospital, and I am appreciative to hear that both are receiving the treatment they need."
He said the school is co-operating with police in the investigation and has taken measures to enhance campus safety. These include increasing security patrols and using the Toronto Police Service in the patrols.
But the shooting has shocked some York students.
Esther Klein said no one should be carrying a gun on campus.
"I don't even know why he would be holding a gun and have that in his possession. That's absolutely not acceptable in the first place," Klein told CTV Toronto.
But another male student said he wasn't surprised to hear of the shooting. He said the incident is just one of a number of crimes that have taken place at York.
"Armed robbery, assault, sexual assault … now there's a shooting," he said.
Klein said that on average she receives a couple of alerts a week from the school about crime on campus.
"This morning my mom was telling me how she just doesn't understand how I could be going to a university like that," she said.
Anyone who witnessed the shooting or who has any information about the case is asked to contact police at 416-808-3100. Tips can be left anonymously at Crime Stoppers at 416-222-8477 or online at www.222tips.com.
With a report from CTV Toronto's Tamara Cherry
By Paul Tomkins.
Earlier in the summer, TTT, as part of a new era of open communications between the club and its fans, was invited to ask Liverpool's principal owner, John Henry, some questions.
Recently I felt the time was right to submit a series of questions, which were devised by contributors to this site.
As part of FSG's wider self-sustainability drive for LFC and in line with the FFP regulations, do such aims mean that in the coming transfer windows starting with this one, all wage and transfer expenditure needs to be self-generated?
The mandate of financial fair play in Europe is for clubs to live within their means. Recently I was told that half of the clubs in the top divisions within Europe are losing money and 20% are in straits of varying degrees. It's up to LFC to invest properly in players going forward so that the club can not only be sustainable but a powerhouse. This club should be able to significantly increase its revenues.
Without UEFA publishing sanctioning guidelines as yet for clubs who breach the FFP regulations, it appears there will be a raft of sanctions for clubs breaching the FFP regulations including fines, points deductions and limiting player squad sizes etc. Is it wrong that clubs may still make serious losses over 2 or 3 years (i.e. over €45m) and not be excluded from the Champions League? Is a fine or points deduction enough of a deterrent? Are LFC engaging with UEFA to clarify how sanctions will be imposed? How much of a hard line stance needs to be taken?
There are a lot of clubs within the league that support financial fair play. We believe the league itself may have to adopt its own rules given that clubs seem to be ignoring UEFA's rules, which may be porous enough to enable clubs to say that the trend of huge losses is positive and therefore be exempt from any meaningful sanctions.
Does staying at Anfield impede a stadium rights naming deal? If costs can be offset with such a deal, this could give the club a clear FFP advantage too?
A naming rights deal at Anfield could occur, I suppose, if the partner were right. We haven't pursued it.
Most fans assume that, commercially, Liverpool were starting from a very low base when you took over. How much more scope is there to increase commercial revenues compared to where we are today? Is it reasonable to expect double digit, year-on-year commercial growth for a number of years to come?
This club should be able to significantly increase its revenues. But it won't be easy. I believe we have the right people in place to accomplish this. But I don't see it happening at the local level – the vast majority must come from our global agenda.
With the Premier League broadcasting deal being potentially worth over £100m for the winners come the 2013-14 season, does the Premier League become more important as a revenue generator than the Champions League?
There are various ways to generate revenues. A big club has to hit on all cylinders so to speak. Champions League, Premier League, commercial – everywhere that makes sense. As evidenced by Manchester City's success and that of Chelsea and Manchester United, you have to have sufficient resources to replenish and improve your squad annually in the Premier League. You don't have a choice.
In an ideal world, success would be possible in at least both competitions but just as the Carling Cup and to an extent the FA Cup has been somewhat demoted in importance by the financial gains on offer in the Premier League and Champions League, is there a case for diverting finite resources (players' playing time) to the competitions that can guarantee the greatest returns?
No. You don't compete for money; you compete to win. Winning the Carling Cup last year was huge for the club just as making it to the final of the FA Cup was huge. Supporters are the backbone of Liverpool Football Club and they've been through a lot over the last few years. Our players knew what those cups meant to the supporters last year. In some ways they were the only thing we were playing for last year because the league performance was so disappointing.
Our goal is to win the Premier League. It's not going to happen this year, but that is what we are building for – first and foremost. That's only going to happen if our league performance turns around substantially.
You've said it is vital to increase revenues and improve youth development if Liverpool are to compete. This raises two questions. Firstly, do you see it as necessary to match the revenue of rival clubs before Liverpool can compete, or does the introduction of players through the youth system mean this will not be necessary?
It's a massive challenge given where we've been. Winning the Premier League entails all of that if you want to build a sustainable, powerful club. We will do that.

I'd like to thank John Henry for taking time to answer the questions, which were composed by data analyst and TTT stalwart Dan Kennett, football lawyer and occasional TTT author Daniel Geey (including The UEFA Financial Fair Play Rules & Liverpool FC), and increasingly-prodigious contributor Bob Pearce, all of whom are subscribers.
Guess who is in town this year for Just For Laughs? Yep, Jim Jefferies is! This Australian comedian is famous for his brutally honest comedy stand up shows about subjects most tend to avoid. You may also know him as the guy who got punched in the head for some of his material.
As this incident suggests you should have a pretty good idea of his level of honesty. No censorship and no toleration for bullshit! As you might have already guessed you will either love him or hate him but he will definitely make you feel something.
With 14 years in stand up comedy, Jefferies has performed at numerous festivals including British shows such as “Never Mind the Buzzcocks” and “8 Out of 10 Cats”. He won over the audience in both US and Canada by doing stand up on HBO and at Just For Laughs; his comedy series Legit, in which he stars, premiered on 17 January 2013 on FX.
This year he is selling out faster than ever for his show on July 25th at Maison Symphonique. “This is by far the best show I have done in the past 5 years and I have recorded 4 – so it must be good,” he says. “Come along, check it out and see if I am wrong of right.”
As with any good cognac, you taste it at the tip of your tongue for sweetness, the back for bitterness and at the sides for saltiness and sourness, Jim Jefferies comedy is someone who creates multiple sensations. He goes over a variety of subjects that make you laugh your butt off and at times gets you thinking of the bigger picture that he is uncovering in his rough yet so straight to the point stand-up shows.
As for this year's show, he is currently finalizing some material for his newest special. “I might even sing some opera in the middle of the show”, he laughs. You would expect the guy with such provocative and down dirty material to be intimidating in an interview, however this guy is full of surprises. Apart from being a super nice guy who hasn't even said the “F” word once during the interview, Jefferies started his career in the Music University in Australia as an opera Singer but dropped out after he realized he is better at comedy than he is at singing. And we are sure glad he did!
If you are familiar with George Carlin, his favourite comedian, you will know what to expect from Jim Jefferies. This year's special will include some inside Hollywood stories, anecdotes from the parties he attended, gun control jokes, political discussions and of course sex jokes to spice things up.
When we started the interview he proudly mentioned that his upcoming special is completely new and it is going to be super funny, so if you have seen his other shows, you won't hear the same jokes in this one. “But if you are bringing someone along to the show you better make them watch a couple of my videos on YouTube just so they know what to expect,” he says.
Although the tickets are going super fast there are a couple left so you better get one fast before it is too late!
I already got my ticket so I hope to see you open minded people in the audience! If you are interested in getting to know Jim Jefferies a little better (and I think you should because he is an awesome guy) read on for our full interview below.
Enjoy!
Victoria Shinkaruk (VS) : Hello? Mr. Jim Jefferies?
Jim Jefferies (JJ): Yeah…
VS: Are you excited about your upcoming show?
JJ: This year it is a big concert hall. The first time I went was one of those package shows with a lot of other comics, the Nasty Show in Chicago and the Nasty Show in St Catherine's Theatre. It was a small theatre and now I am going to be in a big concert hall so it's definitely an odd progression.
VS: Well I am going to be there to see you perform this Friday – so very excited about that!
JJ: Awesome!
VS: So I wanted to ask you about something I read in an article from a couple of years ago. The article mentioned that you trained to become an opera singer, is that true?
JJ: That is correct yes. I might be singing some opera during the concert! (laughs)
VS: (laughs) Well that would be quiet interesting! So, tell me how does one go from a career in opera to becoming an internationally-known comedian?
JJ: Well for me, I always wanted to be a comedian. The reason I got to opera singing is that I got a scholarship to study music at University, which was paid for by the government. So I decided that I better go to college and study music and it was something that made my parents happy that I was studying classical art. They were very strict parents.
I loved comedy since I was a little kid, and while I was at university I started doing stand up shows. There was one bar that did a stand up show on Wednesday so I would go there every night and occasionally I would get on. Once I realized that I was good at it I quit college and left although I had six months left. I dropped out of college. I went to England. I could have done the last six months but I realized that I was better at standup comedy than I was at singing opera.
I was certain I wasn't going to make any money in opera singing and even if I wasn't going to make any money at comedy either I realized I was better off choosing this path anyway.
My parents were super angry at what happened and now I think they are OK with it.
VS: Well I am glad you did it.
JJ: My best friend in Australia is still an opera singer and I watch him sing in an opera whenever I am in Australia.
VS: So you probably heard this a number of times, but could you tell me about that stage incident?
JJ: He was just a drunk who wasn't enjoying the show and I got punched in the head, so he came up and punched me in the head (smiles).
In the end it got him in to the prison cell at the end of the night and it turned out to be good publicity for me.
VS: So does it concern you that people react this way or does it rather compliment you that you are able to invoke hate or love and nothing in the middle with your material?
JJ: I did find it encouraging; I do like that you get one way of the other. I would hate if someone left my show going ”bleah”, you know? I like to have a strong reaction to things I am saying so yeah, I have been appreciative of this incident.
VS: So tell me, did you ever find yourself in front of audience that has no reaction whatsoever?
JJ: Yeah…That happens more often than you think you know, that happens a few times a year. The thing to do is, just try to change directions. I don't want people to leave the show being upset. So if I am trying to do a new joke, and sometimes I will talk about things like gun control or hostile massacre and I notice people being upset I will change the direction.
I want to make people think, and I don't want to come across like I am egotistical or that I want to change people's thoughts. I don't believe that as a comic I can convert anyone's opinion. I think I can maybe make someone look in one direction or the other but I can't make a religious person stop believing in God.
VS: I see. I would say that George Carlin was similar in a way that he attempted to make people think about taboo subjects. Who would you say is your favourite comic?
JJ: George Carlin is my favorite comedian. I've been a comedian for 14 years but I've never watched George Carlin until about 10 years ago. When I started doing comedy I never even knew about George Carlin he was more of an American thing. Back then I was more into Richard Pryor, but I think George Carlin is the best comic that ever lived.
VS: George Carlin is one of my favourite as well. My next question is also based on something I read about your international popularity, and correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that it used to upset you that your homeland was less welcoming than your international audience, is this still correct?
JJ: Oh that has changed! Now I do really well in Australia! Last time I went to Australia I sold more tickets than anywhere else in the world. I used to do the Australian show and I was the least known comedian of all, and now, well I sold 30,000 tickets in Australia in 3 weeks!
VS: Wow! So I guess you are satisfied?
JJ: (laughs) Yeah I am happy! I can't tell you the moment when it changed but I guess at some point people just started watching me on the internet more and started sending more links to more people. I have no complaints with Australia.
VS: I am assuming your parents are no longer angry with you leaving the opera?
JJ: (Laughs) Yeah exactly, my parents come and watch the shows. My dad brings his friends and they come along.
VS: Awesome! My last question is about the up-coming show. What should we expect? I mean obviously it won't be about rainbows and flowers, so could you tell me a bit about it?
JJ: Well it all depends on how I feel that day you know. I have a new special coming up so there will be a lot of jokes from that special.
And if you have seen me before you haven't seen any of these jokes. There will be a few inside Hollywood stories, there will be some crazy stories about the parties I went to, obviously some sex jokes, there is going to be some political commentary and I am going to do some stuff on gun control. So I wouldn't say the show has a theme but a wide range of topics.
Most of all I want people to come along and know it is going to be really funny. I think this new show is possibly the best show I've ever done.
I am actually editing the new special right now and I think it's by far the best special I've done in the last 5 years! And I've recorded four in the last five years and this one is the best so come along check it out see if I'm right or wrong (laughs)
Jim Jefferies appears as part of Just For Laughs on July 25 at Maison Symphonique (1600 St. Urbain) 9:30 p.m. You can enter our giveaway for a pair of tickets to see the show HERE.
Israel has officially refused to renew the travel document of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement co-founder Omar Barghouti in a move that amounts to a travel ban and is an escalation of its attacks on Palestinian human rights defenders who nonviolently advocate for Palestinian rights under international law.
Barghouti, who lives with his family in Acre, has Israeli permanent residency and requires an Israeli travel document to be able to travel in and out of Palestine/Israel. His immediate reaction was: “I am unnerved but certainly undeterred by these threats. Nothing will stop me from struggling for my people's freedom, justice and peace”.
Israel's decision not to grant a renewal of the travel document on baseless bureaucratic pretences is being viewed by human rights experts as the first step towards revoking Barghouti's permanent residency.
Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri had threatened as much at a recent anti-BDS conference held in Jerusalem when he disclosed that he was “inclined to fulfill” a request he had received from a far-right Israeli member of parliament to revoke Barghouti's permanent residency.
The travel ban follows thinly-veiled incitement to physical violence against Barghouti and BDS activists by Israeli Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz and Minister of Strategic Affairs Gilad Erdan. Katz called on Israel to engage in “targeted civil eliminations” of BDS leaders, while Erdan described BDS activists and leaders as threats and called for them to “pay the price” for their work, following this with a clarification that he does not mean “physical harm”. Defending “campaigns to hold Israel accountable for human rights and other international law violations”, Amnesty International has expressed its concern for “the safety and liberty of Palestinian human rights defender Omar Barghouti” following these threats, “including of physical harm and deprivation of basic rights”.
As a leading volunteer with the BDS movement, Barghouti regularly travels internationally to raise awareness about Israel's violations of Palestinian human rights and to advocate for BDS as an effective strategy to end Israel's regime of occupation and apartheid. Rooted in a long heritage of Palestinian popular resistance, BDS is also inspired by the global boycott movement that helped to end South Africa's apartheid regime and by the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.
The Palestinian Human Rights Organizations Council has recently affirmed “the right of all individuals to participate in and advocate for boycott, divestment, and sanction actions”, calling on states and businesses to “uphold their related legal responsibilities”.
Mahmoud Nawajaa, the general coordinator of the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the broadest coalition in Palestinian civil society that leads the global BDS movement, said:
“Having failed to stop the growth of BDS in the mainstream, Israel is now launching a desperate and dangerous global war of repression on the movement. After losing many battles for the hearts and minds at the grassroots level, Israel and its well-oiled lobby groups are pressuring western states to implement patently anti-democratic measures that threaten civil liberties at large”.
“By banning our colleague Omar Barghouti from travelling and threatening him with physical violence, Israel is showing the lengths it will go to in order to stop the spread of the non-violent BDS movement for Palestinian freedom, justice and equality”.
The international BDS movement aims to pressure Israel, as South African apartheid was pressured, to comply with international law. It has attracted the support of mainstream unions, churches and political parties across the world and compelled large corporations, including Veolia and Orange, to end their involvement in Israel's human rights violations.
Prominent artists including Ms. Lauryn Hill and Roger Waters have refused to perform in Tel Aviv; several academic associations in the U.S. and thousands of academics in Europe, South Africa, North America and Latin America have endorsed a comprehensive boycott of Israeli universities. The authors of a recent UN report said that a 46% drop in foreign direct investment in Israel in 2014 was partly due to the impact of BDS.
At Israel's request, governments in the UK, France, Canada and state legislatures in the U.S. are introducing anti-BDS legislation and taking other anti-democratic measures to repress BDS activism. In France, one activist was arrested simply for wearing a BDS t-shirt.
Israel is also using its security services to spy on BDS activists across the world, as repeatedly reported in the Israeli media and by the Associated Press. This espionage is likely to involve monitoring of citizens' communications in violation of domestic laws.
Journalist and constitutional lawyer Glenn Greenwald, known for breaking the NSA surveillance story, has described this well-orchestrated series of draconian measures against the BDS movement as the “greatest threat to free speech in the West”.
Mahmoud Nawajaa added:
“The western governments that are repressing BDS activism at home are giving Israel a green light to continue its violations of international law with impunity. We urge governments, parliaments and human rights organisations to follow Amnesty International's lead and uphold his rights as a human rights defender under threat”.
Ushering in an uneasy world of femmes fatales and shady sleuths, The Maltese Falcon marked the beginnings of film noir. Seventy-five years on, how can this genre speak to our times?
“I'm so tired. So tired of lying, making up lies, not knowing what is a lie, and what is the truth.” There, in 10 seconds of The Maltese Falcon – Mary Astor still gaming as she “comes clean” to Humphrey Bogart, he's swooping in to kiss those lying lips, but distracted by the gunman waiting outside – is the whole of film noir. The femme fatale and the detective. An untrustworthy universe etched in melodramatic two-tone: sex and death.

It is the 75th anniversary of the John Huston classic, released across the US on 18 October 1941 and often deemed the first real noir. And there's more of the black stuff around than ever, from the chilly Nordic variety to David Lynch's return to Twin Peaks next year. How did a genre with such a pessimistic and oppressive worldview come to rule the roost?
The Maltese Falcon – in which Bogart simultaneously redefined his own screen persona and gave us the benchmark shady PI, Sam Spade – deserves much credit for sending the genre steadfastly out into the night. But they didn't even call it film noir at the time; besotted critics referred to Huston's thriller as the most successful example yet of the hardboiled style.
Warners' third attempt in a decade at filming Dashiell Hammett's story, after the 1931 version of the same name and 1936's Satan Met a Lady, was the one finally true to the author's spirit. Dense, conspiratorial and with a sadistic gleam in Bogart's eye, the film minted a new American screen sensibility, one in which the compromised hero, beset by dark machinations, got by on attitude alone. “Are you getting this all right, son, or I am going too fast for ya?” Bogey asks the district attorney's stenographer during a pause in another preening monologue.

Like the enamelled “black bird” everyone's lusting after, there's much to scratch at beneath the surface of The Maltese Falcon. It was the first mainstream hit to bring noir's active ingredients together, but several had appeared in isolation in earlier films: the so-called “proto-noirs”. Stranger on the Third Floor, a 1940 RKO B-production, had arresting expressionist dream sequences – the off-kilter visual style that German emigres brought to Hollywood and which was beginning to filter out of horror pictures into what became noir. (As its killer, it also had Peter Lorre, expressionism made flesh, and hypnotic as Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon.)
Blind Alley, in 1939, flirted with suffocating psychological torment in its tale of a gangster who invades the home of a shrink. But, laborious in its Freudian explanations of the source of the ne'er-do-well's troubles, it wasn't ready for a true noir downer, and pulled back from the brink. Unlike the following year's They Drive by Night – which after looking innocuous enough, plunged over it. Bogart and the man he later supplanted as Sam Spade, George Raft, are a pair of struggling truck-driving brothers in a cornball Hollywood drama. Then frustrated trophy wife Ida Lupino murders her husband and comprehensively loses her marbles in an extraordinary final stretch that is surely a femme-fatale dress rehearsal.
The disillusioned mood in Hollywood's output at the end of the 1930s marks a belated reaction to the great depression
These premonitory outbursts suggested the US had something on its mind. The second world war is commonly cited in film studies as noir's driving demon, with the troops returning to a different, more troubled world. But the pulp fiction that provided the bedrock for noir emerged after the first world war, the streetwise gumshoes and petty hoods marking a shift from the patrician, gentleman-sleuth crime fiction that had gone before. Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M Cain and, the man who provided more direct story material for film noir than anyone else, Cornell Woolrich, were all already in full flow by the late 30s. The marginalised lives and lyrical sensitivity of French poetic-realist directors such as Marcel Carné and Jean Vigo provided another noir influence, as did the flood of Nazi-regime escapees – including Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak and Edgar G Ulmer – who filled out its ranks. As well as cinematographic flair, a sense of paranoia and helplessness in the face of malignant institutions was their gift. The disillusioned mood creeping into Hollywood's output towards the end of the 30s seemed more like a belated reaction to the great depression, rather than to a war the country wasn't involved in yet.

The war, though, undoubtedly crystallised the genre's appeal. Hollywood soft-soaping no longer washed for the battered veterans and the housewives who had experienced a taste of employment. Noir, entering its high phase, was ready to cater. If not with stories directly touching on demobilisation – such as 1947's Crossfire and Dead Reckoning – then with a sardonic and jaded worldview that coloured the genre fedora-downwards. That certainly summed up Double Indemnity, directed by Billy Wilder and, in 1944, noir's first major box office hit. It was one of five films – alongside The Maltese Falcon, Laura, Murder, My Sweet and The Lost Weekend – that went on show in Paris at a special catch-up exhibition of Hollywood fodder two years later. The darkening mood of American cinema didn't escape anyone's attention; critic Nino Frank's writeup in L'Ecran Français, using the term for the first time, finally gave film noir a name.
And the biggest marketing come-on? It turned out misanthropy and fatalism were dead cool. As James Ellroy later summed the whole business up: “A righteously generically American film movement that exposited one great theme, and that theme is: you're fucked.”
Chinatown feasted on the rotten heart of LA and spiced it up with graphic violence, which was previously forbidden
Noir, according to the official ledger, was done by 1958 – the narrative possibilities wrung out, shinier postwar consumerism, including television, on the ascendant. That year, Orson Welles's late masterpiece A Touch of Evil was its epitaph. But it wasn't away long, even if you ignore the French, Japanese and British imitators that kept it alive during the interregnum years. A mere 16 years, if you count Chinatown (debatable) as the start of the “neo-noir” revival. More grandiose than the first wave, Roman Polanski's film feasted on the rotten heart of Los Angeles, and spiced it up with niceties previously forbidden under the Hays Code: graphic violence, incest and the unshakable conviction that the house always wins. But the essential dynamic between Jake Nicholson and Faye Dunaway – arousal and aggression in terse tango – was unchanged from Bogart and Astor three decades before.
In noir's Venetian blind-lit vale of tears, though, they could be any guy and any dame. Mood is the constant. Noir is as much a sensibility as a fixed genre, which perhaps explains its longevity. It has become a kind of cinematic Instagram filters that can – and has – been applied to almost any locale to add murky ambience and moral relativity. Like romanticism or hip-hop, it has been triumphantly international: away from the well-trodden side streets of the Nordic and French varieties, we've had Bollywood noir (Satya, 1998), Japanese noir (Branded to Kill, 1967), Australian noir (Lantana, 2001), Indonesian noir (Kala, 2007), German noir (Phoenix, 2014). In the neo-noir phase, the all-pervading-web-of-corruption narrative perfected by Ellroy in his LA quartet of novels has become common operating practice, even exported to places where there seems to be limited scope for such skulduggery. The idea of North Yorkshire Police, in David Peace's Red Riding trilogy, operating a death squad always seemed laughable.

Its smoky contours apparent after 75 years, noir is well placed to reinvent itself. Yes, the likes of Lisbeth Salander, Sarah Lund and Saga Norén have gender-swapped the genre, usurping the tough-talking men. But 40s noir also subverted expectations and reflected shifting gender roles, with slack-jawed patsies such as Detour's pianist Tom Neal prey for women such as the peerlessly terrifying hitchhiker Ann Savage – demonised projections of newly liberated and assertive femininity. Maybe the recent appearance of the “homme fatale”, like Joel Edgerton's creepy neighbourhood caller in last year's The Gift, will spark corresponding calls of misandry.
But noir ultimately stays wedded to the past – not a surprise given the inescapable Romantic undertow from the off, the doomed hero's thoughts constantly drawn back to prelapsarian times. That can leave some modern noir as little more than an excuse for a retro love-in, as in the last Sin City or LA Noire, the note-perfect simulation of 50s Los Angeles from Grand Theft Auto publisher Rockstar Games.
If we're lucky, noir's backlight works with greater discernment, illuminating how cinema works on us – our consumption and internalisation of past styles, postures and attitudes. In Blade Runner, Harrison Ford is probably a replicant, so his future-Marlowe act is literally by design, another facet of Ridley Scott's exquisite assemblage of noir textures. Everything is artificial, including identity. Everyone is putting on a front, too, in Lynch's Mulholland Drive, recently voted the best film of the 21st century. But with the opposite effect. Naomi Watts's starlet comes to LA and relishes her first acting job, playing sleuth for her new amnesiac friend fatale Laura Harring. As she embraces her roles and zeroes in on the mystery, noir becomes a conduit to something vital and authentic. Something live to the touch.

The Maltese Falcon was already playing cat-and-mouse with appearance and reality 75 years ago. Its dissembling hoodlums and kingpins scratch at the surface of the trophy, desperate for it to be the real thing. It never is. In an inauthentic world, style is the only recourse – a cornerstone of Bogart's screen persona – but it masks real pain and desire. That contradiction is 24-carat noir. The modern version, if it isn't going to become a box of fossilised tropes, has to continue locating its own heart of darkness.
Documentary has sometimes managed to swivel the spotlight towards noir to interrogate it under reality's harsher glare. In his 2012 film The Act of Killing, Joshua Oppenheimer asked former regime executioners for Suharto to reenact their deeds in genres of their choosing. Tough talk and moodily lit bureaus was how they dressed up torture and genocide, fiction infiltrating the world and turning rogue – a noirish proposition if ever there was one. The black bird flies on.
While on Goodreads yesterday, a writer in one of the groups I frequent, mentioned her book was free on Amazon, and because I am bound and determined to fill up my TBR pile until my Kindle explodes(sarcasm), I went to look for it. I found it, and also saw some good reviews, so I had to download it. I really had no intentions of reading it now, but after finishing another book, started this one in the middle of the night last night, and I literally could not put it down!
Alex is sixteen, and lives in a small town in Washington state with her widowed mother, and ten year old brother, Jake. They go to watch a meteor shower, a once in a five thousand year event. Things get scary, when debris starts hitting earth. The next morning, her mother is deathly sick-like your worse cold multiplied by a hundred, or so. Alex goes out to the store to get cold supplies, and realizes that there's a run on all the cold supplies, and everyone she sees, seems sick. While out, she runs into Chris, a boy from school, that she kinda knows a little. He's not sick, but the two compare notes on how many people obviously are. When people start getting better, and obviously are not the same as they used to be, things get pretty scary, and fast.
I really liked the characters of Alex and Chris. They are faced with horrible situations, people in their life dying, or acting strange, and still manage to persevere. Alex is a typical teen when this starts, and while she does break down at times, she becomes a much stronger person by the end. Chris is her rock, the only person she can lean on when the going gets tough, and boy does it get tough! I also really liked Jake, the little brother. He ends up being way smarter then his years at times, but still remains a good young character. Everything might be going to hell in a hand basket,but he still trudges on. And last but certainly not least, I loved the dog. Yep, there's a wonderful, intelligent, golden retriever, named Baxter, that actually had a big part in the book. And no I can't help that I totally pictured Lassie at times, and yes I know it's two completely different kinds of dogs!
In the beginning, I wasn't sure where this book was going. Was it going to be dystopian? Were there going to be aliens? Was there a government conspiracy? Why did her Egyptian father leave her a book on ancient Egyptian history, and why did he leave her clues? Was her father's death simply a mugging, or was he murdered? Lots of questions to be answered here for sure!
It ended up being a really fast read, well written, and I have already bought and started the second book in the trilogy. I enjoyed the mystery, the conflicts, the intricate, and well thought out plot, and the friendship between Alex and Chris. It's young adult, and I would classify it as science fiction, with a hint of a horror vibe. Actually, the more I think about it, it would make for an excellent movie! 4.5 stars rounded up(RabidReads.com)

It's the end of 2015 and I'm on hiatus from my job as executive producer and showrunner of the scripted television comedy You're The Worst. (The finale of our second season aired Wednesday evening on FXX.) I'm currently in a café reading the “Television Critics' Poll” (assembled by Hitfix), which is a ranked and scored aggregation of the year-end critics' lists for the best television of 2015. Shows are given points for how many top-ten lists they appear on and at what rank. A larger list is then assembled. The 90-plus shows that received top-ten scores come from the usual prestige players — HBO, FX, AMC, Netflix — a few broadcast networks, an alphabet soup of basic-cable networks, Amazon and Hulu, and then such random words as Pivot and Crackle.
It is a very good time to work in television, but also very confusing. Shows that used to be on NBC or Fox are suddenly on Yahoo or Hulu. My PlayStation now has original programming on it somewhere. FX Networks Grand Pooh-bah John Landgraf recently, infamously, gave a speech at the Television Critics Association tour in which he said there was too much television, and that consolidation is inevitable. I'm not nearly as smart as he is (he told me once that he reads about international health policy for fun), so I don't know if consolidation is indeed coming or not, but I do know that my “to watch” list is fast becoming unmanageable, and I've basically given up on ever starting Friday Night Lights or Game of Thrones.
With so many new networks and technologies and services and apps scrambling to define themselves with original scripted content, the pressure on we who create television to make our shows stand out is increasing. Which is why my writers and I decided to “tackle” mental illness in this season of our half-hour romantic comedy.
Yes, it was a creative decision — it made sense for the character, we thought it would be a worthwhile writing challenge, our lead actress (Aya Cash, who plays music PR rep Gretchen Cutler) is so insanely talented we wanted to give her something more meaty than most comedies could, etc. But in the back of my mind was the shameless and scary knowledge that even I often forget about shows I genuinely love and enjoy watching by the time they come back for their second season (hello, Last Man on Earth). A first-season show is like a puppy. It's new and cute, and sure, maybe it pees on the rug, but wow, does it smell fresh, and look at its wet lil' nose! But when a show comes back for its second season, it's suddenly an awkward teen. The peeing indoors aren't so lovable anymore, and that bark is more shrill than adorable and … oh my god, there are more puppies over there! The effort to remain a puppy in your second season feels sweaty, and the whole enterprise ends up carrying a whiff of desperation. In this landscape of new shows debuting with alarming and increasing regularity, the challenge, then, is to embrace series' adulthood and attempt to find a way to mature into something unexpected — something the viewer or critic never could have predicted, but that still makes sense given the show's initial DNA. It should feel wholly surprising, but somehow inevitable.
Having cut my teeth on Jenji Kohan's Showtime series Weeds, I was aware that in changing the fabric of a show, you ran the risk of alienating a portion of your audience. (Even by season eight of that show there were people still mad that Nancy Botwin & Co. had ever left Agrestic, the show's initial and iconic setting.) And, indeed, with You're the Worst, after Gretchen revealed to her boyfriend Jimmy (played by Chris Geere) that she suffered from clinical depression, and we watched her struggle mightily with the admittedly not-much-fun disease, we did get a handful of audience members saying they missed their good-ol'-hang of a show. “Where's the comedy?” they asked. (I'm paraphrasing, and removing the curse words.) But that number was massively outnumbered by those who appreciated the more substantive, dark, risky turn we'd taken. And while I remained less than 100 percent sure a goofy rom-com could (or should even try to) pull off a believable portrayal of mental illness, reading that critics' poll this morning and seeing that we'd not only not lost ground in the critics' view, but rather moved up significantly (from 30th last year to 18th this year!), was gratifying assurance that we had, at the very least, grown into a fine adult dog. (And one that's coming back for season three in 2016. Woof.)
Looking ahead to the second half of the MLS season, it's hard not to feel intrigued. Despite several slow starts by some of the clubs, no team is out of the playoffs just yet.
Late turnarounds are not foreign to MLS, with the particular example of the Seattle Sounders surging at the business end of last year to claim the MLS Cup title. We saw the extraordinary impact that one quality player can make when Nicolas Lodeiro arrived in Seattle at a time when the reigning MLS Cup champions were last in the West.
Here are 10 players who, in the second half of the season, need to up their game in a big way, or make an immediate difference if they've only just arrived, to get their teams into the playoffs and make them a serious contender for the MLS Cup.
10) Sebastian Blanco (POR)
Blanco has three goals and four assists in 18 appearances, and defensively he's very active when Portland lose possession, which is great to see, but that's not enough for a Designated Player. The Argentine needs to adjust his game: perhaps he ought to be a little less generous in helping with defensive transition, and save some energy for the attacking third.
9) Kaká (ORL)
Unless they acquire a playmaker in the summer window, Orlando will largely depend on 35-year-old Kaká to connect their unbalanced midfield and a one-dimensional attack (very powerful, but a bit lacking in craft). There's no doubt that the Brazilian can offer the match-winning spark in the final third, but the question is, can he stay healthy?
8) Jonathan Mensah (CLB)
Spending big on Jonathan Mensah hasn't helped Crew SC fix their leaky defense. The Ghanaian DP's performances have revealed too many mental lapses and too many mistakes in possession. Still, the back-three system has improved things and coach Gregg Berhalter should stick with it as having two other center backs next to Mensah could help him grow in confidence.
7) Valeri Qazaishvili (SJ)
It's same old story for the Quakes: they can't score, even with all the new players they brought in. The latest addition of Georgian DP Valeri Qazaishivili, aka Vako, is supposed to make the team tick offensively. If the attacking midfielder can make an immediate impact, the Quakes will become a team to watch in the postseason, because everything else is solid.
6) Matteo Mancosu (MTL)
One thing the Montreal Impact need is goal scoring from sources other than Ignacio Piatti and Blerim Dzemaili. They might seek help during the summer transfer window. Bt if they don't, Matteo Mancosu will need to improve. The Italian only has three goals and he doesn't help much in the construction of play. He'll need to start replicating his brilliant form from last season's playoffs, or else the Impact probably won't go very far.
5) Sacha Kljestan (NY)
With six goals and 20 assists last year, Sacha Kljestan was a candidate for MVP. This year, he's not even close. He hasn't scored yet and has managed six assists, which is low for his standards. The Dax McCarty trade to the Chicago Fire has certainly not helped, leaving the Red Bulls in need of a summer signing, a creative player, who can combine with Kljestan and get the most out of him.
4) Jordan Morris (SEA)
Jordan Morris' first half of the season has been a classic sophomore slump: only two goals through 16 games. The Sounders need Morris in his best form and playing him in a wide position doesn't seem to be helping: he should be Seattle's closest player to the opposing goal.
3) Chris Pontius (PHI)
The Union have showed much improvement since April. Their biggest problem, though? Chris Pontius' lack of scoring. Pontius, who scored 12 goals last year, has yet to find the mark this season. Forget wide runs to the corner flag, Pontius needs to start coming inside and playing a lot closer to CJ Sapong. Leaving such a strong player in the air isolated so often is unforgivable. Fix that, and the Union could become very dangerous.
2) Fredy Montero (VAN)
Fredy Montero's six goals probably isn't the kind of output the Vancouver Whitecaps would like from their DP. The most Montero has ever scored in an MLS season (for the Seattle Sounders) was 13. Where he's been underwhelming, however, is in the assist department: He only has one. Montero has very good feet and can pick a pass. How about a three-forward attack, with Montero looking more like a false 9?
1) Giovani dos Santos (LA)
It's been a strangely bad season for the Galaxy. They are currently below the red line, though they manage to sneak into the playoffs consistently. To get there they're going to need to find balance in midfield and a new number 9 to lead the attack. They'll also need Giovani Dos Santos in a number 10 position, playing consistently and at his best after returning from the Confederations Cup.

What in the sorcerous hells is this? Kokichi Sugihara's ‘Rectangles and Circles' illusion is a mind-bending visual trip that turns squares into circles and circles into squares right in front of your face. Different shapes are placed at a mirror and what you see in front of you is totally different from what you see in the mirror. It's like the mirror is actually a portal to another dimension where squares are circles and circles are squares. Seriously ... what the hell?

And here's the full video:
The “War on Drugs” that came soon after the “War on Terror” is being decisively lost. Ten years after the US invasion Afghanistan remains the world's biggest opium poppy producer. Meanwhile, the UK is making inroads to the market.
As the West struggles to destroy drug production in Afghanistan, Britain harvests a new crop of poppies to plug a growing painkiller shortage. Some believe that is counterproductive.
In the rolling fields of Oxfordshire, UK, at this time of year, you will probably see wheat or barley ripening for the harvest.
But dry springs and warm summers have enabled local farmers to plant a very different type of crop – opium poppies.
They are under contract to a pharmaceutical company that turns the opium into morphine and codeine in order to plug a shortfall in strong painkillers in the National Health Service.
In fact, there is a global shortage of drugs made from poppies.
The opium grown in Britain will be put to good use, but thousands of miles away, NATO troops are wiping out existing Afghan poppies with bombing, burning and spraying.
“The main question is why are we destroying the Afghan crop and then having to grown poppies in fields in Oxfordshire? It's been used by the American and British governments repeatedly, one of the so-called soft arguments that they put, one of the liberal arguments that they put, is that they're fighting a war on drugs. This is complete hypocrisy, it's not true, it's not what the war is about, and we should own up to that,” says Lindsey German from the Stop the War Coalition.
It is easy to understand why Afghan farmers grow, then sell opium to the Taliban. There's an effective distribution network, and they can make around 17 times more profit per hectare than they can on wheat. Despite the obvious economics, farmers are still being encouraged to grow other crops.
British MP Frank Field thinks that policy has failed, but the Americans will not budge.
“America rules and we follow on behind them. It makes a nonsense of what this relationship is about, when you're putting British lives at stake, not to be able to use this as a bargaining position with the Americans, to rethink a strategy which I think most people think over the years has failed, historically, has failed, why don't we try a new tack?”
Frank Field and his group Poppy Relief believe that Afghan opium should be legalized instead. It would benefit Afghan farmers, raise much-needed revenue for the government's nation building efforts, and stop the opium from falling into the hands of the drug cartels. Field also says it should be military strategy too.
“In Afghanistan we have chosen bombs, rather than brains. Anybody who would be thinking about how do we get ordinary people, ordinary farmers who see poppies as a cash crop, how do we get them to protect the backs of our troops, we would be thinking about how do we harness this crop, how do we pay them for it and how do we then use that crop to transfer it into medicines to counter pain.”
With opium being burned in Afghanistan and kept a secret in Britain, no-one wants to talk about the UK's opium-growing program.
RT asked both the farmers and MacFarlane Smith, the company they grow for, if they would give an interview.
MacFarlane Smith said they would not allow the farmers to talk because it is a part of their contract with the Home Office that they keep the poppy growing secretive.
The Home Office also declined to comment.
While poppies are increasingly harvested in Britain, the so-called war on drugs is being decisively lost. The UN says opium production in Afghanistan has been on the rise since the US occupation began in 2001.
SCP-461
Item #: SCP-461
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-461 is to be kept in a locked room without windows and its display faced away from the door. The door must be guarded by one Level 3 security personnel whose presence is monitored via security cameras. A Level 2 security rating is required to enter the room. No one is allowed entry from 0300 to 0305 GMT until further notice.
Description: SCP-461 is a 25-inch cathode ray tube (CRT) television of unknown origin, although it outwardly resembles a Zenith unit manufactured in the early 1980s. The model number is “ZT-035,” but this does not correspond to any known Zenith television. Once a day, at exactly 0300 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), SCP-461 self-activates and displays video footage lasting precisely five minutes. The nature of the footage varies widely, but it is never a conventional broadcast. Instead of standard television programming, SCP-461 displays what appears to be video feeds of closed-circuit security cameras in both commercial and residential settings. All footage appears contemporary and transmitted "live."
SCP-461 does not require an external energy source to operate; it has no power cable. It also has no antenna. When it is active, changing the channel has no effect, and its unadjustable audio produces only low static. Its knobs to adjust color, sharpness, tint, or other visual settings have no effect and may not be connected.
All attempts to physically access the internal components have proved fruitless. The device has no seams, screws, bolts, or other entry point or fastener. X-ray scanning does not reveal the interior of SCP-461, and sonographic inspection is similarly inconclusive. The unit is also unusually heavy for a CRT television — approximately 50 kilograms above normal weight for a device of this type.
Addendum 461-A: Incident log, 03/08/20██
We put the device inside of a Faraday cage today to filter out all incoming signals. Nevertheless, SCP-461's behavior proceeded as normal at 0300 GMT. Perhaps it's transmitting from an internal data storage component? Dr. ████
Addendum 461-B: Incident log, 09/04/20██
Today, the device displayed footage of the interior of the room it is contained in, from the perspective of the corner just above the door. However, there are no security cameras or other video recording devices in the room. Advise that no fewer than two individuals occupy the room at one time. Also advise closed-circuit cameras to be installed in the room to monitor for unusual phenomena. Said footage is designated SCP-461-1. Dr. ████

If anyone knows it's not easy making it in the NFL, it is Miami Dolphins Pro Bowl defensive end Cameron Wake.
The former undrafted player out of Penn State had a few unsuccessful tryouts in the NFL after college. He found himself out of football before going to Canada to jumpstart his career in the CFL. After winning Defensive Player of the Year two years in a row, NFL teams came calling and the rest is history.
With fellow defensive end Michael Sam making national headlines for his decision to go to the CFL to try to boost his playing career, Wake is living proof that playing in Canada can be a bridge to the NFL.

“I think it's a good move for anybody if you get an opportunity. I loved it in my time there,” Wake said this offseason. “It was an opportunity to get out there and play. If you have the desire to get back [to the NFL], teams kind of grab those guys. To get out there and play the game just for the love of the game was a great opportunity for me.
“My path, I wouldn't change it for the world. You have first-round picks and all that. But my path is my path and that made me what I am today.”
Wake signed with the Dolphins in 2009 and has gone on to become a four-time Pro Bowl selection and one of the team's best players of the past decade. Wake still credits the CFL for providing the needed reps and development.
Sam's CFL journey got off to a rocky start after the left the team for personal reasons. But Sam reportedly will return to the Montreal Alouettes this week to continue his football journey.
As Wake proved early in his career, if Sam is a dominant player in Canada, that could generate interest from NFL teams.
“There are so many things in football that are just football. I don't care if it's CFL, NFL, XFL, Arena [League], whatever,” Wake explained. “Rushing the passer is rushing the passer. Catching the ball is catching the ball. Tackling is tackling, no matter what the auxiliary rules are. If you can beat somebody and manhandle a guard, you can do that anywhere. So just getting up there and being able to show what you can do and put your resume on field, the rest will take care of itself.”
For those of you who don't follow the news, last week Nintendo announced a price drop for the 3DS and Nintendo's CEO, Satoru Iwata, apologised for the handheld being an eye-scorching, horror-portal that no one wants. He then had to apologise to angry 3DS owners for the price drop. Presumably next week, he will apologise for the great depression and rickets.

You might think that more bus stops mean better bus service, and to some extent that's true. A transit system certainly becomes more useful when you can get on near your home and off near your destination. That said, every stop made by a city bus increases trip time from Point A to Point B. Strong systems find a way to strike a balance between stop access and route speed.
Sometimes striking that balance means getting rid of stops that are clogging up the line. Last week, reporters at News1130 in Vancouver pointed to research showing that eliminating some bus stops "reduces travel times significantly without drastically affecting the number of people served along a route." They suggest that city agency TransLink cut stops as a "simple" way to reduce costs while still improving service.
TransLink's particular situation aside — the agency later responded that it does an annual review of its routes and stop placement — the research mentioned by News1130 is worth a closer look. Published last year [PDF], it focused on the bus system in Fairfax, Virginia. The researchers analyzed stop spacing under a variety of walking thresholds (how far someone will walk to reach a stop) and found that many of the system's 121 stops seem redundant:
The researchers believe that at a walking threshold of 800 meters (roughly half a mile), the Fairfax bus system could eliminate 53 of its 121 bus stops and still provide coverage to 82 percent of the area. Removing the stops would reduce both travel time and operating expenses by about 23 percent; plus, faster service would attract more riders and generate more revenue. And since only 10 percent of the population would lose coverage from the cuts, the researchers see stop removal as a win on balance.
6 Steps to Lean Project Development
January 19, 2016
At the heart of transforming an idea into reality is the learning process. For most types of projects, an effective solution is not created by a master building their masterpiece in a state of isolation. An effective solution emerges, as in nature, as a result of a continuous process of evolution and adaptation which is fueled by feedback from its environment.
Facilitating this feedback, learning from it, and cycling new knowledge back into the creation process is what leads to projects that are agile enough to meet the environment's shifting needs and are positioned to make a real impact.
Here we'll take a look at something called Lean Project Management for guidance on how to do this. Lean thinking centers around creating rapid prototypes that generate feedback as quickly as possible. Instead of building a large, comprehensive solution based on a series of assumptions you may have, those assumptions are tested early on to eliminate wasting energy in the wrong places. In a world of increased complexity, some of these assumptions are usually proven wrong and adjustments are needed.
To do this, an early prototype called the ‘minimum viable product' (or MVP) is created — this is a stripped-down version of what you may be envisioning for the final product. It won't have all of the features you are imagining, but it's stable enough to allow others to start using it. These first users are called ‘early adopters' and they are prepped to interact with an incomplete product and to share their thinking about it.
Often the Build-Measure-Learn model is referred to in the literature on Lean — here I have modeled two cycles of this process with 6 steps to help guide the early-stages of project development. The strategy is to get through the cycle and start generating new knowledge — the bottom line — as quickly as possible:

1) Talk to Potential Users/Clients
You have an idea for a solution to a particular problem — a product or a service that will improve the lives of others. First, who are those ‘others'? Who are the people affected most by this problem? Narrow it down. Then, go find them and talk to them about how the problem affects their lives. Because this takes a lot of courage, it is a step that is often overlooked or skipped. But it is critical. You need to get a sense for whom these people are and what their very specific daily challenges look and feel like. Don't assume everyone thinks like you — they don't. One good way is to design a survey, online or in person. Find ways to collect basic demographic data about these potential users of your solution and record their responses to your questions. See this resource on creating good survey questions for guidance.
2) Identify Patterns & Assumptions
Take the data you've collected from your surveys and begin to identify the characteristics of what your typical users might look like. Try creating fictional personas for your potential users or clients to get a feel for who they are. Be as comprehensive and detailed as you possibly can. Then, write out assumptions you still have about these people related to how they will interact with your solution — what they are willing to do, what they already know how to do etc.
3) Design a Prototype
After talking to potential users your original idea will probably have already begun to evolve. Here you want to identify the minimum viable product — the most bare-bones version of the product or service that you can allow others to reasonably interact with. What are the absolute essential features or components? Leave everything else out. Remember, you are trying to get through the learning cycle as quickly as possible. Don't spend time on anything that is not critical to this early prototype version. When appropriate, you may consider a mock-up version of the product the first time through the cycle. This could be a 3D model or even a hand-drawn image. The quicker and easier the better. The prototypes main function is to test those assumptions you identified — what the users will be willing or able to do. View it as an experiment.
[images style=”0″ image=”http%3A%2F%2Fwiredroots.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F03%2FBML-cycle-2.png” width=”800″ align=”center” top_margin=”0″ full_width=”Y”]
4) Build Prototype & Test with Early Adopters
Now is the time to run your experiment. The challenge is to find the right group of individuals — the early adopters — who can interact with your prototype and give you valuable information. Ideally these people will be representative of your future users. Reaching out and building relationships that lead to willing participants is crucial. Depending on the type of prototype you've created, you will need to find ways of observing their behavior while interacting with it and collecting data. You can record videos, have them ‘think aloud' while using the prototype and record audio, or use digital analytics to document their behavior. Feedback forms after their experience are also useful. See this resource on Rapid Prototyping Tools & Best Practices.
5) Gather & Analyze Feedback
Here you will take the information you collected during your testing and make some sense of it. The key is to be methodical. Look to measure how long it took users to accomplish tasks, where they got stuck and needed help, where they made errors, what type of support they asked for, what they found confusing, what they had a hard time finding, and anything else that might be relevant. Take stock of the ideas presented in the feedback forms. When possible, try to organize this information into charts or tables that will help you to identify the most common patterns. Identify which of your assumptions where right and which were wrong.
6) Make Adjustments to Product
Now that you have all of this feedback, you can make some decisions about what needs to be modified and what should be added to the product. The key to remember is that these are rapid and never-ending cycles — you don't want to spend too much time on a new feature before testing it out and getting feedback. Make small adjustments and then look again to run experiments, collect and analyze feedback, and learn. Your bottom-line metric in this approach is learning. Find ways to be creating new knowledge about your users and how they interact with your solution with every small step that you take.
No matter what you are building or the nature of your project, this agile approach to development becomes increasingly necessary as the environment becomes more and more complex. In such an environment it is difficult (or, impossible) to predict how people will behave in the future. Entrepreneurs and everyone within any type of organization needs to be continuously learning and adapting to the rapid and never-ended changes around them.
How this model applies to your project is largely up to you to decide. However, you may want to take us up on our offer for a free 30-minute development consultation designed to help you identify what strategies will work best for you and your unique context.
BALTIMORE (WBFF) -- The most advanced space telescope in the world --and beyond -- is being built in our own backyard.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), is slated for launch from French Guiana in October of 2018.
Dr. John Mather is the Senior Project Scientist and is one of thousands working on the infrared telescope, which will be a successor to the Hubble Telescope.
The technology is undergoing extensive tests to ensure it will survive the launch.
When this telescope is a million miles away there's no way to fix it, so potential problems are solved at Goddard's facility in Maryland.
"We have the capability here and we might be the only place in the entire universe that can do this," Dr. Mather said. "We are certainly the only place in NASA that can lead this project."
Next, parts will ship to California where the observatory is being built but once the telescope is in space, it will be monitored right from Baltimore.
"The operations of the observatory are going to be in Baltimore," Dr. Mather said. "At the Space Telescope Science Institute where they also run the operations for the Hubble Telescope."
Scientists are eagerly awaiting the launch. There's no telling what the findings will reveal about the universe.
"We think we will be able to see the first galaxies being born,the first black holes being born," Dr. Mather said, adding, "if we guess right about how they actually do. How the galaxies grow."
He is confident about the team in place preparing the advanced technology for its deep space mission.
"We have a wonderful team here," Dr. Mather said. "The eng i neers are are some of the best I've met. They make things happen you could only wish for. Eventually we will point the telescope at the sky and discover things you've never known about."
“Often the object of a desire, when desire is transformed into hope, becomes more real than reality itself,” Umberto Eco observed in his magnificent atlas of imaginary places. Indeed, our capacity for self-delusion is one of the most inescapable fundamentals of the human condition, and nowhere do we engage it more willingly and more voraciously than in the art and artifice of storytelling.
In the same 1948 lecture that gave us Vladimir Nabokov's 10 criteria for a good reader, found in his altogether fantastic Lectures on Literature (public library), the celebrated author and sage of literature examines the heart of storytelling:
Literature was born not the day when a boy crying wolf, wolf came running out of the Neanderthal valley with a big gray wolf at his heels: literature was born on the day when a boy came crying wolf, wolf and there was no wolf behind him. That the poor little fellow because he lied too often was finally eaten up by a real beast is quite incidental. But here is what is important. Between the wolf in the tall grass and the wolf in the tall story there is a shimmering go-between. That go-between, that prism, is the art of literature.
He considers this essential role of deception in storytelling, adding to famous writers' wisdom on truth vs. fiction and observing, as young Virginia Woolf did, that all art simply imitates nature:
Literature is invention. Fiction is fiction. To call a story a true story is an insult to both art and truth. Every great writer is a great deceiver, but so is that arch-cheat Nature. Nature always deceives. From the simple deception of propagation to the prodigiously sophisticated illusion of protective colors in butterflies or birds, there is in Nature a marvelous system of spells and wiles. The writer of fiction only follows Nature's lead. Going back for a moment to our wolf-crying woodland little woolly fellow, we may put it this way: the magic of art was in the shadow of the wolf that he deliberately invented, his dream of the wolf; then the story of his tricks made a good story. When he perished at last, the story told about him acquired a good lesson in the dark around the camp fire. But he was the little magician. He was the inventor.
What's especially interesting is that Nabokov likens the writer to an inventor, since the trifecta of qualities he goes on to outline as necessary for the great writer — not that different from young Susan Sontag's list of the four people a great writer must be — are just as necessary for any great entrepreneur:
There are three points of view from which a writer can be considered: he may be considered as a storyteller, as a teacher, and as an enchanter. A major writer combines these three — storyteller, teacher, enchanter — but it is the enchanter in him that predominates and makes him a major writer. To the storyteller we turn for entertainment, for mental excitement of the simplest kind, for emotional participation, for the pleasure of traveling in some remote region in space or time. A slightly different though not necessarily higher mind looks for the teacher in the writer. Propagandist, moralist, prophet — this is the rising sequence. We may go to the teacher not only for moral education but also for direct knowledge, for simple facts… Finally, and above all, a great writer is always a great enchanter, and it is here that we come to the really exciting part when we try to grasp the individual magic of his genius and to study the style, the imagery, the pattern of his novels or poems. The three facets of the great writer — magic, story, lesson — are prone to blend in one impression of unified and unique radiance, since the magic of art may be present in the very bones of the story, in the very marrow of thought. There are masterpieces of dry, limpid, organized thought which provoke in us an artistic quiver quite as strongly as a novel like Mansfield Park does or as any rich flow of Dickensian sensual imagery. It seems to me that a good formula to test the quality of a novel is, in the long run, a merging of the precision of poetry and the intuition of science. In order to bask in that magic a wise reader reads the book of genius not with his heart, not so much with his brain, but with his spine. It is there that occurs the telltale tingle even though we must keep a little aloof, a little detached when reading. Then with a pleasure which is both sensual and intellectual we shall watch the artist build his castle of cards and watch the castle of cards becomes a castle of beautiful steel and glass.
Indeed, as important to the success of literature as the great writer is the wise reader, whom Nabokov characterizes by a mindset that blends the receptivity of art with the critical thinking of science:
The best temperament for a reader to have, or to develop, is a combination of the artistic and the scientific one. The enthusiastic artist alone is apt to be too subjective in his attitude towards a book, and so a scientific coolness of judgment will temper the intuitive heat. If, however, a would-be reader is utterly devoid of passion and patience — of an artist's passion and a scientist's patience — he will hardly enjoy great literature.
Lectures on Literature is a wealth of wisdom in its entirety. Also see Nabokov on the six short stories everyone should read, then revisit famous writers' collected insights on writing, including Elmore Leonard's 10 rules of writing, Walter Benjamin's thirteen doctrines, F. Scott Fitzgerald's letter to his daughter, David Ogilvy's 10 no-bullshit tips, Henry Miller's 11 commandments, Jack Kerouac's 30 beliefs and techniques, John Steinbeck's 6 pointers, and Susan Sontag's synthesized learnings.
The investigation remains ongoing into the death of a two-star general found dead in his home on Redstone Arsenal just days before he was to take command of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command.
Maj. Gen. John Rossi, 55, was found dead July 31. Rossi was new to Huntsville, having moved to the city from Fort Sill, Oklahoma to replace Lt. Gen. David L. Mann as commanding general of USASMDC/ARSTRAT.
Rossi was scheduled to take command of the unit Aug. 2.
Chris Colster, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Army Garrison at Redstone Arsenal, told AL.com on Monday that a cause of death had not yet been released.
"We're still waiting on the investigation to work itself out," Colster said.
New commanding general of SMDC identified as Redstone Arsenal death Maj. Gen. John Rossi was found dead Sunday, two days before taking command of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command.
Rossi, a native of Long Island, New York, graduated from West Point in 1983 and was commissioned in the Army as an air defense artillery officer, KSWO-TV out of Lawton, Oklahoma, reported. He was a commander at every level, becoming commanding general of the U.S. Army Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill in 2014.
Prior to that assignment, according to Redstone Arsenal, Rossi served as the director of the Army Quadrennial Defense Review Office at the Pentagon.
Rossi leaves behind his wife, Liz, three children and a grandchild.
It is the prerogative of every generation of graybeards to look down the age ladder and accuse today's young of sloth, greed, selfishness -- and stupidity. We hear daily jeremiads from baby boomers who wonder how kids who'd rather listen to Linkin Park and play "Grand Theft Auto III" than solve equations or read books can possibly grow up to become leaders of the world's superpower. The recent publication of "The Dumbest Generation" by Mark Bauerlein of Emory University epitomizes the genre. His subtitle -- "How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future" -- says it all.
Generational putdowns, Bauerlein's included, are typically long on attitude and short on facts. But the underlying question is worth pursuing: If the data are objectively assessed, which age-slice of today's working-age adults really does deserve to be called the dumbest generation?
The answer may surprise you. No, it's not today's college-age kids, nor even today's family-starting 30-somethings. And no, it's not the 60-year-olds who once grooved at Woodstock. Instead, it's Americans in their 40s, especially their late 40s -- those born from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. They straddle the boundary line between last-wave boomers and first-wave Generation Xers. The political consultant Jonathan Pontell labels them "Generation Jones."
Whatever you call them (I'll just call them early Xers), the numbers are clear: Compared with every other birth cohort, they have performed the worst on standardized exams, acquired the fewest educational degrees and been the least attracted to professional careers. In a word, they're the dumbest.
Obviously, we're talking averages. No one would apply the word "dumb" to Barack Obama (born in 1961) or Timothy F. Geithner, his nominee for secretary of the Treasury (born in the same month). Yet the president-elect himself has written eloquently about how hard it was for him and his peers to obtain a serious education during their dazed-and-confused teen years. Like it or not, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (born in 1964), who stumbled over basic civics facts during her vice presidential run, is more representative of this group. Early Xers are the least bookish CEOs and legislators the United States has seen in a long while. They prefer sound bites over seminars, video clips over articles, street smarts over lofty diplomas. They are impatient with syntax and punctuation and citations -- and all the other brainy stuff they were never taught.
Want proof? Let's start with the long-term results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is housed within the U.S. Department of Education. Considered the gold standard in assessing K-12 students, the NAEP has been in continuous operation for decades. Here's the bottom line: On both the reading and the math tests, and at all three tested ages (9, 13 and 17), the lowest-ever scores in the history of the NAEP were recorded by children born between 1961 and 1965.
The same pattern shows up in SAT scores. The SAT reached its all-time high in 1963, when it tested the 1946 birth cohort (including such notables as Gilda Radner and Oliver Stone). Then it fell steeply for 17 straight years, hitting its all-time low in 1980, when it tested the 1963 cohort (Mike Myers, Quentin Tarantino). Ever since, the SAT has been gradually if haltingly on the rise, paralleling improvements in the NAEP. In 2005, teens born in 1988 scored better on the combined SAT than any teens born since 1956 -- and better on the math SAT than any teens born since 1951.
Some critics say that the average SAT score should be adjusted for the share of all teens taking the test, since a larger share "dilutes" the average with lower-aptitude kids. Good point, but it only deepens the mystery. Early Xers have both the lowest average score and the lowest share of test-takers. The share taking the SAT peaked at about 40 percent in the mid-1960s, fell to a low of only 30 percent around 1980 and has since been rising again -- to a record high of more than 45 percent during the last few years.
These numbers make the recent rise in SAT scores by the new Millennial generation seem even more impressive -- and the early Xer low even more disappointing. With a lot more kids getting higher scores, the average SAT scores of Ivy League undergrads have jumped since the late 1970s -- from 1230 to 1425 at the University of Pennsylvania, for example. Average scores for nearly all graduate exams have also been rising since the early 1990s, including the GRE, the LSAT, the GMAT and the MCAT.
Now let's turn to education and career outcomes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans born from 1958 to 1962 have the highest share that has never completed high school among all age brackets between 25 and 60. They also have the lowest share with a four-year college degree among all age brackets between 30 and 60, and they're tied for lowest in graduate degrees. Pushed by their passion for enlightenment (and by their fear of being drafted for Vietnam), first-wave baby boomers became obsessive degree achievers. That drive dropped off sharply during the next 10 or 15 years. Less-degreed than their elders, early Xers represent an anomalous back-step in educational progress.
Once early Xers entered the labor force in the 1980s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noticed something else: For the first time in decades, the share of young adults entering professions such as law, medicine and accounting began to drop. Around the same time, economists began to worry about the stagnation of median income and the decline of household assets among Americans in their 20s. Today, they're worrying about the economic stagnation of Americans in their 40s.
So what explains the smartness deficit (and the related income gap) that has tracked these early Xers throughout their lives? Some say it's demographic pressure. Early Xers were born into large families at the tail end of the baby boom, with a relatively large share of higher-order siblings (just as first-wave boomers have a relatively large share of first-borns). As they grew up, they got crowded out in the competition for parental attention, good teachers and good colleges. Later on, by the 1980s, they arrived too late to enter the most lucrative professions and the cushiest corporations, by now glutted with boomer yuppies. Their only alternative was to pioneer the pragmatic, free-agent, low-credential lifestyle for which Generation X has since become famous.
Yet sheer numbers aren't the whole story. The early Xers' location in history also plays a large role. Quite simply, they were children at a uniquely unfavorable moment -- a time when the divorce rate accelerated, when the media image of children turned demonic and when the "latch-key" lesson for kids stressed self-reliance rather than trust in others. By the time they entered middle and high school, classrooms were opened, standards were lowered, and supervision had disappeared. Compared with earlier- or later-born students at the same age, these kids were assigned less homework, watched more TV and took more drugs.
Most early Xers know the score. Graduating (or not) from school in the early 1980s, they saw themselves billboarded as a bad example by blue-ribbon commissions eager to reform the system for the next generation, the Millennials. Angling for promotions in the early 1990s, they got busy with self-help guides (yes, those "For Dummies" books) to learn all the subjects they were never taught the first time around. And today, as midlife parents, they have become ultra-protective of their own teenage kids and ultra-demanding of their kids' schools, as if to make double-certain it won't happen again.
Does America need to worry that this group is taking over as our national leaders? Probably not. Early Xers have certain strengths that many more learned people lack: They're practical and resilient, they handle risk well, and they know how to improvise when even the experts don't know the answer. As the global economy craters, they won't keep leafing through a textbook. They may be a little rough around the edges, but their style usually gets the job done.
Just don't tell the early Xers that today's youth are the dumbest generation. Not only is that jibe factually untrue, it also calls into question all the family sacrifices the early Xers are now making on behalf of this youth. Let Generation Jones keep the "dumbest" label. They know it fits, and they're tough enough to take it.

US authorities will no longer allow travelers from 13 African and Middle Eastern countries to bring computers and laptops into airplane cabins anymore, two news agencies have reported.
The new rules were laid out in an e-mail sent to airlines today by the US Transportation Safety Administration. This is according to The Guardian, which was first to report on the matter. Cell phones will still be allowed, but anything larger—including laptops, tablets, and cameras—must be put in checked baggage. CNN, citing two unnamed "administration officials," confirmed the report.
It isn't clear which airlines received the new directive, but The Guardian reports that at least Royal Jordanian and Saudia Airlines are among the airlines affected. The affected airlines have 96 hours to comply.
The TSA referred press inquiries to the Department of Homeland Security. Via e-mail, a DHS spokesperson told Ars, "We have no comment on potential security precautions but will provide an update when appropriate."
Royal Jordanian published a statement on the matter on its official Twitter account, but then deleted the tweet a short while later.
The statement said that "following instructions from the concerned US departments," the airline would be banning any electronic device in flight cabins except for "cellular telephones and medical devices."
"This announcement is effective starting with March 21, 2017, and the instructions will be applied on the New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal flights, the last two destinations served by a combined flight," reads the announcement, which was saved by both news outlets before it was deleted. "Thank you for your understanding. We wish you pleasant flights on board RJ."
Royal Jordanian has since confirmed that the new rules will apply to Canadian customers flying from Montreal to Amman, as well. In a response to upset customers expressing themselves on Twitter, Royal Jordanian has since posted that "further updates will be announced soon."
Clanton, Ala., police arrested a 20-year-old man last week on disorderly conduct charges after four white men drove through a predominantly black neighborhood flying the Confederate flag and shouting racial slurs.
Jeremy Varden was arrested Thursday for disorderly conduct. (c/o The Clanton Advertiser)
20-year-old Jeremy Varden was "charged with disorderly conduct after blocking a road with his vehicle and refusing repeated requests from a police officer to move the vehicle," according to The Clanton Advertiser.
Clanton Deputy Police Chief Keith Maddox told WIAT they received reports that racial slurs were shouted before residents damaged two vehicles with bats and rocks.
"You had one group that brought this symbol that created some problems in the area and antagonized some folks. And then the ones that were antagonized then took it a step further and started doing property damage, so you know really both are wrong," Maddox said.
WIAT reports Varden's vehicle was damaged before his arrest. He later denied using racial slurs and said he and his friends were traveling through the area.
Maddox said he was "very belligerent" and wouldn't calm down after an officer approached him.
"The people that were in these vehicles were, best we can tell 18 to very early 20's and they just used very poor judgment. Under the current climate you don't really want to do anything like that to antagonize anybody," Maddox said.
Veronica Perkins, who lives in the West End, told WIAT she believes the men drove through the neighborhood just "to cause trouble."
"We didn't ask Governor Bentley to take the flag down," she said. "He did that all on his own. We had nothing to do with that."
Concerned residents met with city officials and church leaders the day of the incident, the Clanton Advertiser reports.
"We're the police department for the entire city, and we're not going to let you down," Maddox said. "We're not going to put up with that in this community or any community."

On March 27, while riding a $450 motorcycle through Vietnam, I lost my backpack. It contained my camera, computer, and two hard drives containing seven months of RAW photos and videos. This is what I learned from the ordeal.
First, you're probably wondering how I managed to lose $8,000 worth of equipment that's essential to my livelihood. It didn't get lifted. I didn't entrust some stranger with all of my valuables. It wasn't stolen from my hostel either.

The morning after concluding a guided tour of the Central Highlands, I headed out on my own. My next destination was three days north at Phong Nha, where I'd explore the third largest cave in the world. The highway I had been following soon turned into an auxiliary road; that turned into a path that was equal parts dirt, gravel, and asphalt — where potholes occupied more area than pavement.
I stopped at an intersection to check the map for directions when a local man rode past me on his scooter. He was pointing frantically behind me. I looked to see what his deal was — then immediately noticed that my pack was gone; the bungee straps were still dangling from my rack.
Today I had the opportunity to drastically change a rural Vietnamese person's life. Thanks to some faulty bungee cords, a very bumpy road, and a lack of diligence, a very lucky person has been given either three years income in the form of camera and computer equipment, or even better - the opportunity to jump into a brand-new career as a photographer. I hope that my loss is exponentially someone else's gain - I only wish that I could have those hard drives back with my last seven months' of photos and videos. At least I already booked my ticket home! This is the last photo I took with my 5D. May it serve it's next owner well.
I whipped around the 110cc Win and raced; timing was of the essence. Judging from the straps still hanging from my rack, it couldn't have been gone for long. I remembered navigating a huge bump a couple of kilometers earlier, so I retraced my steps to that point. Nothing. I widened my search radius; scanned the area for hours until I finally gave up and continued on my way, sending out good vibes out as I left.

I had been touring around Vietnam for the past two weeks, with the pack more-or-less bungeed on the same way each day. So what gave? Due to the Sufat Win's small size, most of the cargo weight was distributed over the rear wheel. Before taking off that morning, I broke routine and attempted to distribute the weight better; in an effort to do so, I must have strapped my pack down worse. Shoulda stuck to routine.
A lack of diligence = negligence
There were a dozen things I could've done differently that day to prevent my bag from falling off. I could have added a second set of straps. I could've worn the pack on my back. I could've wrapped my chain and lock around it. But I didn't. I was lazy and complacent. A lack of diligence equals negligence. I paid dearly for that.

Keep important items close
Passport. Wallet. Phone. Cash. These things should never leave your person. Fortunately, I was very anal about that; as such each of those items were safe despite my loss. And after losing my pack, I didn't have to scramble to make it home during the final two weeks of my journey. I was still able to travel and I was still able to work. Even if they only thing I had to shoot on was a single GoPro.
Always check twice
You're sitting in a cab; the driver barely speaks English. You're using your phone to help navigate to a destination that neither of you have ever been. As the cab approaches the destination, you set your phone between your legs on the seat; begin to scan the surroundings in search of your destination. There it is! The driver pulls up; you hastily pay him and exit the cab. Five minutes later you grab your phone to check in, but wait! It's not in your pocket. Or your bag. It's back in the cab. The driver is gone forever; so is your phone.

Scenarios like these are incredibly common when you're traveling; the most simple way to avoid them is by checking your seat whenever you get up. Whether you're leaving a taxi, subway, restaurant, or bar — always check twice.
Being more careful than me is the best insurance policy.
Get insured
In the event that you do lose your stuff — whether it's a camera, phone, or computer — having a travel insurance policy that covers your gear will ensure that you don't take too much of a loss.
Advertisement
If traveling with high-value items (such as a high-end dSLR and lenses,) increase cover for them as-needed, because oftentimes base policies will not cover the full amount in the event of a high-dollar loss.
I use World Nomads, because in addition to covering all my gear - they also cover adventure activities, from skydiving to mountaineering to bushwhacking and everything in-between.
One backup is not enough
I carried two 2TB LaCie Rugged Mini external hard drives throughout my journey. All of my RAW photos and videos were redundantly backed up to each of those drives each week. I carried one and when I traveled with a buddy, he carried the other, in the event that one of us suffered a loss.

When I started traveling alone I resorted to carrying them both; both in the same bag. My data was protected in the event of a drive failure, but not in the event of a loss or theft. Well, guess what? Both of those drives were in the pack that I lost. I should have continued to carry them separately.
But what about the cloud?
I edited all of my photos along the way; uploaded retina-resolution JPGs to my OneDrive account (where it's pretty easy to rack up massive amounts of free storage). I also uploaded full-resolution, print-quality JPGs of my favorite shots. However, with more than 1.5 TB of RAW photos and videos and consistently inconsistent wifi connections, there was no way to upload all my files to the cloud.

Typically, about 1 out of 10 photos is a keeper; maybe one-third are worth editing. I use Lightroom to edit; set my export folder destinations to OneDrive, so all of my JPG exports automatically began to upload whenever connected to the internet. I should've used the same process; exported RAW selects to the cloud too. Those RAW selects would've been a much more manageable cloud upload; when I lost my drives, I would have still had my most important original files.
Don't lose your shit, literally and figuratively
The best way to avoid a heartbreaking scenario like mine is to not lose your shit. But in the inevitable case that it eventually does happen, keep your cool. Only by remaining calm and collected will you have the patience to search for (and hopefully locate) your stuff.

Labels, labels, labels
If you do lose your stuff, there's a small chance that someone with the best intentions will find it. Make their task of locating you, the owner, as easy as possible by labeling your stuff. If traveling abroad, the name that you use on social media, as well as your email address, are the best pieces of information that you can provide.

This is the Vietnamese family that found my stuff and reached out to me on Facebook to return it.
Don't give up hope
In the days, weeks, months, or even years after you lose your stuff, don't give up hope. Someone could be out there, tirelessly trying to reconnect you and your stuff.

Modern junk filters do a pretty good job at fending off unsolicited contact, so keep an eye out on your “other” inbox on Facebook, and your junk folders in email. There could have been a Vietnamese minority ethnic group family trying to reach out to you all along. At least that's what happened to me. Everything's on its way back to me right now.

A British Columbia senator is calling on two female NDP MPs to step forward and share details of their misconduct allegations against two suspended male Liberal MPs.
Larry Campbell, a former Vancouver mayor appointed to the Senate by Paul Martin, said MPs Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti are facing a "smear."
Campbell was a guest on CBC Radio's "As It Happens" Wednesday where he discussed the harassment accusations that have rocked Parliament Hill for weeks and led Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to boot two members from his caucus pending an investigation.
Campbell told The Hill Times last week that the two female NDP MPs should identify themselves in the interest of fairness.
When asked by host Carol Off what would be accomplished if the women were to come forward, Campbell said it would help get facts on the table.
"As far as I'm concerned, right now we have nothing more than a smear here," he said.
Campbell said that because the allegations involve equal members of Parliament, there is no "power relationship" behind the situation.
"Do you not buy any of the arguments the women are giving that it's not an atmosphere in Ottawa to come forward with these kinds of allegations, that there will be consequences if they come forward?" Off asked.
"No, I don't," he said. "And I want to be clear on this. This is not an employer-employee relationship. This is two equals."
Campbell said the careers of the Liberal MPs have been "basically destroyed" without the public knowing why. He said he also disagreed with Trudeau's decision to suspend the MPs while sharing little details.
"It could range from bad jokes, offensive jokes, up to actual touching," he said. "We have no idea."
Though Campbell acknowledged a gender imbalance on Parliament Hill, he said he couldn't understand why the women would feel humiliated or fear possible repercussions for their career if they divulged details.
He also seemed to suggest that harassment on Parliament Hill toward women is not as pervasive as some think. At one point, Off said CBC journalist Kady O'Malley told her she "doesn't know a woman who works on the Hill" who doesn't have a tale of some kind of harassment.
"I would find it hard to believe that 100 per cent of the women she knows have been sexually harassed or harassed," he said.
"Maybe it's because you're a man," Off replied.
"That's entirely possible," he said.
Pacetti and Andrews, who both deny any wrongdoing, have said little since Trudeau suspended them on Nov. 5 and announced their nominations for the next federal election have also been suspended, pending an investigation.
But on Wednesday, Andrews told reporters in Newfoundland he intends to run again in 2015.
New Democrats have been sharply critical of Trudeau's decision to suspend his own MPs without first alerting the alleged victims. NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair has accused Trudeau of further victimizing the women. Mulcair says the two female MPs wanted the matter kept confidential.
But the Liberal leader has maintained that the seriousness of alleged misconduct and fact that one of the NDP MPs involved complained to him directly left him with a "duty to act."
Earlier this week, The Canadian Press' Jennifer Ditchburn and Joan Bryden revealed NDP MP Craig Scott, a former law professor, accompanied one of the alleged victims to an Oct. 30 meeting with the Liberal and NDP whips to discuss the matter. Sources told CP that Scott stated at the meeting that, based on what he knew about one of the allegations, it constituted sexual assault. That second-hand assessment ultimately prompted Trudeau's decision, sources told CP.
Scott lashed out at Liberals Wednesday with a statement saying confidentiality around the meeting had been "deliberately broken in a way that further disrespects and puts pressure on the victim."
"For Liberal backroom operators to claim that somehow I am responsible for Justin Trudeau's decision is simply laughable," he said in the statement. "I will therefore not dignify this spin with any further comments."
The Liberals originally wanted the multi-party Board of Internal Economy, which oversees the operations of the House of Commons, to investigate the allegations. On Tuesday, the board said it had no mandate to handle such disputes and kicked the matter to the procedure and House affairs committee.
Andrew Scheer, Speaker of the House of Commons, has offered both the Liberal and NDP whips the confidential use of House administration resources as well as "external experts" for an impartial, third-party investigation.
But in a letter to Liberal whip Judy Foote, Scheer also stated "the most successful resolution of any harassment complaint relies on the willingness of all involved parties to come together to address the issues."
On Wednesday, Mulcair told reporters the two women shouldn't be pushed to lodge formal complaints or participate in a third-party investigation.
"Nobody has the right to decide in the place of a victim what they do and at what speed," he said.
Trudeau agreed the NDP MPs shouldn't face pressure to participate in a third-party probe but conceded it would not be "ideal" to proceed without them. Liberal insiders told CP that if women opt not to participate, the notes taken during the whips' meetings with the alleged victims could be examined.

Sen. Bernie Sanders addresses several hundred people on Sept. 16 in New Paltz, N.Y., during a rally for Democratic congressional candidate Zephyr Teachout. Teachout is running in New York's 19th congressional district against Republican John Faso. (Tania Barricklo/Daily Freeman via AP)
NEW PALTZ, N.Y. — Anyone driving into Bernie Sanders's rally here, anyone with a radio tuned to ABC News, could hear the low-key voice of Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson. In 60-second radio spots, the former governor of New Mexico introduces himself as a pragmatist who, like most voters, resented a presidential choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
"Our economic challenges will be conquered not by force, but by cooperation and mutual respect," Johnson says in one of the ads. "For the independent majority of Americans who feel as I do, I say: Why wait one more day?"
[What Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for president, wants to do to America]
At the rally itself, Sanders continued making the pitch he's been honing since he returned to the campaign trail: This isn't a year to vote third party. Mentioning Clinton's name sparingly, Sanders told several hundred voters — many still wearing gear from the Democratic primary — that their votes could stop the election of a Republican "who thinks climate change is a hoax."
Sanders, who was the most prominent independent in American politics even before his run, is gradually embracing a role as a third-party critic, a spoiler of the spoilers. As Democrats contemplate ways to tamp down a protest vote for Johnson, or for the Green Party's Jill Stein, Sanders is already arguing that anyone who voted for him would set the movement back by voting against Clinton. In an interview after the rally — the first in a three-state weekend tour for Democratic candidates — Sanders said that Democrats and the media need to focus on Clinton's actual policies more than they have been, in a campaign dominated by back-and-forths about Trump's gaffes.

"This is not the time for a protest vote, in terms of a presidential campaign," Sanders said. "I ran as a third-party candidate. I'm the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. I know more about third-party politics than anyone else in the Congress, okay? And if people want to run as third-party candidates, God bless them! Run for Congress. Run for governor. Run for state legislature. When we're talking about president of the United States, in my own personal view, this is not time for a protest vote. This is time to elect Hillary Clinton and then work after the election to mobilize millions of people to make sure she can be the most progressive president she can be."
The journey from Clinton primary foe to Clinton surrogate has been awkward for Sanders. At high-profile moments during the Democratic National Convention, including an address to his delegates, he mentioned his endorsement near the top of his remarks and was blown back by jeers and boos. Since then, Sanders has tucked his endorsement later in his speeches, after rundowns of exactly what concessions his campaign got from the Democratic Party, and what a Trump presidency would undo.
[Bernie Sanders: Here's what we want]
That spoonful-of-sugar approach has led to less obvious backlash; it's also truer to Sanders's long-term goals. His campaign performed most strongly in "open" primaries and caucuses, where independent voters could play without registering as Democrats. He did worse than expected in New York, and cited the state's onerous registration standards, which require voters to be members of a party for six months before voting in their primaries. The state's Working Families Party, which endorsed and organized for Sanders, found itself in a bind.
In the run-up to the Democratic convention, Sanders unsuccessfully lobbied for the party to open all of its primaries to all voters. Since then, he has confirmed that he will seek reelection as an independent. And on Thursday night, Sanders keynoted the 18th annual Working Families Party gala, mentioning Clinton's name just twice in the context of his "political revolution." One of those times, Sanders beseeched anyone who backed Clinton "to vote for her on the Working Families Party line."
New York's unique "fusion" laws, which allow candidates to seek multiple party nominations and aggregate their votes toward a winning total, give Sanders the opportunity to back Clinton while growing a force outside the Democratic Party. In two-dozen interviews at the New Paltz rally, four voters said they had contemplated voting for a third party but were rethinking that after polls showed Trump gaining ground.
Eli Campbell, 21, arrived at the rally with a photoshopped portrait of Trump and Clinton wearing crowns in front of the White House. (The original photo was taken at Trump's wedding to his third and current wife, Melania, which Clinton attended.) "People like me have been told that it doesn't matter if we want a world that works," said Campbell, as other voters, many from the nearby university, snapped photos. "We have to wait for it."
Campbell said he was leaning toward supporting Stein, but he, too, had seen polling that suggested Trump might win the presidency. If it seemed that his vote would be decisive, Campbell admitted that he could vote for Clinton.
"Bernie pushed her a lot further left than she wanted to go," said Campbell. "I mean, if it's close, I think I'll vote for the lesser evil."
Vladimir Yakovlev, the founder of Kommersant newspaper and former editor of Snob website, is raising funds for a new Russian independent media project on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The project's description on the Kickstarter page claims the goal is to create a media outlet that will counteract the Russian “state propaganda machine” and help “turn zombies back into people.”
Russia today is torn by hatred caused by a multimillion-dollar state propaganda machine. This is a real danger for an entire world as we know it.
People hate each other. They have a terrible delusion that Russia is surrounded by enemies. Recent murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov is just one of numerous casualties of state-funded hatred campaign.
Now, more than ever, we need a new independent media to unite the best journalists by common goal: to stop propaganda of hatred; to find a way to resist the madness that is tearing apart an entire country bringing it closer and closer to a horrible social disaster.
I want to start this new media project as soon as possible. It will be a powerful, formidable, effective multi-media platform free of political control and Kremlin power.
[…]
If Kremlin media is so good in turning people into zombies, why can't we create a media to turn zombies back to people?
Britain on alert for deadly new knife with exploding tip that freezes victims' organs
Senior police officers have been warned to look out for a new knife which can inject a ball of compressed gas into its victim that instantly freezes internal organs.
The 'wasp knife', which can deliver a ball of compressed gas capable of killing its victim at the press of a button, may be heading for Britain, the Metropolitan Police fear.
A needle in the tip of the blade shoots out the frozen ball of gas which instantly balloons to the size of a basketball, freezing organs.
The Metropolitan Police have told colleagues in the West Midlands to be on the lookout for the blade, which is designed to kill sharks and bears.
Police fear that the 'wasp knife' - designed to kill bears and sharks - may soon hit the streets of Britain
Police are concerned that the £200 weapon could fall into the wrong hands.
The American-made weapon is sold to hunters and divers and injects the frozen gas when the small handle-mounted trigger is pressed.
The manufacturer describes it as perfect for downed pilots, soldiers and security guards and boasts that it will "drop many of the world's largest land predators".
It can snap-freeze all tissue and organs in the area surrounding the blast.
A source close to West Midlands Police said: "The Met is obviously concerned about this and that is why they have circulated the information.
"This knife will almost certainly kill and the Met must have intelligence that they are in circulation.
"I think it is only a matter of time before one of these is used because the internet makes it much easier to find and buy weapons like this."
Labour MP for Perry Barr in Birmingham, Khalid Mahmood, said: "Weapons like this are absolutely disgraceful and there is no reason at all why people should be walking around the streets with them.
"There should be high-profile operations and high-profile arrests against anybody caught with them. The way to tackle the wider issue of knife crime is with effective community policing, which the West Midlands force does very well.
"The Met could pick up on the lessons from West Midlands Police in its excellent community work in places like Handsworth, Aston and Lozells."
The Wasp injection website states: "The effects of the compressed gas not only cause overinflation during ascent when used underwater, but also freezes all tissues and organs surrounding the point of injection on land or at sea."

2) The new plan intends to save $2.4 trillion — which would replace and double the savings of the sequester — beyond the $2.7 trillion in deficit reduction that's already been enacted. So that's $5.1 trillion in total deficit reduction.
3) The new plan includes about $600 billion in revenue through tax reform, which would mean total new revenue would be about $1.2 trillion after including the fiscal cliff deal. So-called "chained-CPI", which increases revenue as well as cutting Social Security benefits, would push that to about $1.3 trillion. That's around what President Obama proposed in his final offer during the fiscal cliff negotiations, but it's less than half the new revenue contained in the original Simpson-Bowles plan. So Simpson and Bowles have revised the tax ask way, way down.
A note on that graph: The numbers for Simpson-Bowles 1.0 come from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and they cover 2013-2022 while the numbers for Simpson-Bowles 2.0 cover 2014-2023. Updated numbers for Simpson-Bowles 1.0 would show slightly more in taxes and slightly more in spending cuts. Both sets of numbers count interest savings under spending cuts, as that's how the original Simpson-Bowles plan counts it.
4) A more detailed comparison isn't yet possible. What we have so far is an outline, not a plan. We don't know the size of the discretionary cuts. We don't know the size of the mandatory cuts. We don't know any of the policies save for chained-CPI. All of that's forthcoming. "Right now, all they've released is a framework," says Marc Goldwein, policy director at the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. "They want to spend a couple of weeks getting comments and input."
5) The exact numbers haven't been released yet, but total discretionary spending cuts will be lower than in the original Simpson-Bowles plan, Goldwein tells me.
6) This isn't meant to be an update to Simpson-Bowles 1.0. Rather, it's meant to be an outline for a new grand bargain. To that end, Simpson and Bowles began with Obama and Boehner's final offers from the fiscal cliff deal. That helps explain why their tax ask has fallen so far: Obama's final tax ask was far lower than what was in the original Simpson-Bowles plan, while Boehner's tilt towards spending cuts was far greater than what was in the original Simpson-Bowles.
7) That said, while this plan doesn't include more tax increases than Obama asked for, it does include significantly more than the $1 trillion in spending cuts than Boehner asked for — about $500 to $700 billion more, if I'm reading it right. In increasing the total deficit reduction, Simpson and Bowles have put the weight on the spending side of the budget.
8) In that way, this plan sacrifices the most useful element of the original Simpson-Bowles effort, which was that it created a model — not the only model, of course — for how you might go about reducing the deficit if you weren't bound by the various promises, interest groups and political constraints of the two parties. This plan, by contrast, is an effort to split the difference between the two parties while amping up the total deficit reduction.
Correction: The original graph didn't include interest savings for the original Simpson-Bowles plan. It's been updated.
‘Super Mario Bros.' (PG) By Hal Hinson
Washington Post Staff Writer
May 29, 1993 Who would have thought that "Super Mario Bros.," the movie based on the popular video game, could be such a treat? There are some, I'm sure, who saw the end of civilization here. But relax. This movie, which was directed by music video whiz kids Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, is sweet and funny and full of bright invention. In short, it's a blast. The picture begins in Brooklyn 20 million years ago, when dinosaurs happily walked the Earth and Flatbush Avenue was a green and leafy trail through the brush. Suddenly, according to the story (which was written by Parker Bennett, Terry Runte and Ed Solomon) a meteorite destroyed most of the planet, forcing the giant beasts underground, where during the eons between then and now, they evolved into people, just like us. Just like us, except that they are descended from reptiles, not mammals, and live in a parallel universe ruled by a tyrannical lizard king named Koopa. Koopa, played by Dennis Hopper with his hair done up in blond ruffles like those on a tuxedo shirt, has a plan to merge the two worlds and take over with his gang of eight-foot-tall Goombas (big dumb goons with shrunken little dino heads). To succeed, all he has to do is find Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis) in the other world, steal the tiny particle of meteorite she keeps on a strap around her neck and put it back inside the main meteor. So far, though, he's had very little luck. Because the two lackeys he's sent to find the girl (played delightfully as a pair of punk losers by Richard Edson and Fisher Stevens) aren't too smart, they keep bringing Koopa the wrong girl. And when they do finally manage to deliver the real Daisy, she's accompanied by a pair of super-hero plumbers named Luigi and Mario Mario (John Leguizamo and Bob Hoskins), who by their efforts to save Daisy throw a monkey wrench into the evil dictator's plot. As you might imagine, though, the story is hardly the movie's main attraction. What makes "Super Mario Bros." such a good ride is its rambunctious toss-away spirit. Morton and Jankel (who also directed the remake of the noir classic "D.O.A." and were the creators of "Max Headroom") have given the film a flamboyantly colored, densely cluttered surface that resembles (especially in the reptile kingdom) "Blade Runner" on a semi-sunny day. And though they keep the action moving along briskly, they leave plenty of room for bizarro bits of fun. Like what? Like Dennis Hopper flicking his lizard tongue as the germ-phobic Koopa and ogling Princess Daisy. ("You look so fresh, so clean," he says, with just a hint of "Blue Velvet" in his voice.) There are also a huge woman named Bertha (Francesca Roberts) in a red leather outfit decorated with red rubber who takes a shine to Mario (calling him "Fluffy Buns") and a cuddly baby tyrannosaurus rex named Yoshi, whose appearance will certainly whet our appetites for the upcoming "Jurassic Park." Strangely enough, the actors don't get lost in all the pyrotechnics. As Mario, Hoskins is a solid, practical older-brother type who raised Luigi by himself and who's always talking about the importance of keeping your tools nearby. It's Leguizamo's buoyant performance, though, that gives the film its light, innocent tone. Leguizamo (who is best known for his phenomenal one-man show "Spic-o-rama") is a remarkable, baby-faced actor, and as Luigi, he comes across as a likable lunkheaded, up-for-anything kid who's never had a dark thought in his life. His crush on Daisy (who, thanks to Mathis's spunky performance, makes a more than worthy damsel in distress) gives the movie heart. The underground, sewer-pipe world here may seem familiar from the "Ninja Turtle" movies, but aside from the pizza Koopa orders just before he puts his evil plan into action, the similarities end there. Nothing in those films can compare with the Goombas (who are the best movie heavies since the flying monkeys in "The Wizard of Oz") or the adorable Yoshi. "Super Mario Bros." may be junk, but it's superior junk. It wipes the floor with those turtle dudes. Copyright The Washington Post Back to the top

MORE than 3,000 speeding tickets were issued to the county's ambulance service in just one year.
Only two other ambulance services in England – Yorkshire Ambulance Service and East Midlands Ambulance Service– were given more tickets than the 3,306 given to South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire.
The penalty charge notices added up to £330,600 in 2013 for the service, but it is believed many of them were successfully appealed against because speed limits do not apply to emergency vehicles responding to calls.
Former volunteer SCAS ambulance driver Goff Smith, 66, said the tickets should not be issued.
The Faringdon resident worked as a community first responder for the service for 15 years until 2013 before being sacked for speeding on his way to a call-out, as the exemption does not cover volunteers in their own vehicles.
He was reinstated after an Oxford Mail campaign but left SCAS again in December 2014 to retire.
He said: “I think we need to look at the way these tickets are sent out to stop this happening.
“I think if an ambulance goes through a speed trap but it clearly has its blue lights on a ticket should not automatically be issued.
“It is an added pressure for paramedics and this has been going on for years but nobody has ever done anything to stop it happening.
“The time spent appealing against these tickets would be much better spent saving lives.”
As well as the 3,306 speeding tickets issued to the ambulance trust, another 58 were issued to paramedics working for SCAS between 2013 and 2015.
The highest speed recorded by a SCAS emergency vehicle was 96mph in a 60mph zone.
In order for an ambulance service to appeal against a speeding ticket it must check the vehicle's registration against records to get a radio call sign and then check this call sign against the 999 incident logging information
If it turns out the incident log matches the time that the vehicle got the ticket then the service must write an official letter to police. SCAS spokeswoman Michelle Archer said: “SCAS has worked closely with the police forces in our area to develop an approved and robust system to handle all notices of intended prosecutions which means that we should not receive notifications for activations where blue lights are visible.”
Section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 states that police will assume a vehicle with blue lights is allowed to speed.
Joe Gibbs Racing names Dave Rogers technical director for its NASCAR XFINITY Series Operations.
Rogers had previously served as the crew chief for the No. 19 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series team before taking a personal leave of absence in March of this season. He will work closely with JGR's Executive Vice President Steve deSouza in all aspects of competition across the organization's XFINITY Series program.
"I really appreciate the support I've received over the past couple of months allowing me to take care of what I needed to in my personal life," said Rogers. "This position really excites me and I'm looking forward to working closely with Steve (deSouza), our crew chiefs and everyone in our XFINITY Series shop on all aspects of competition."

Wendy Becker already had three daughters when she miscarried at 14 weeks. That she was already a mother didn't lessen her grief.
"What people didn't understand was that having my other children and realizing how unique they are made it harder for me," said Becker, who lives in Highland Ranch, Colo.
At first, her husband was understanding of her need to talk through the loss and the hours she spent online searching for support groups. But as the months wore on, he became frustrated at what seemed to be her inability to get over it.
"At a time you would think you would be able to help each other, we were going totally separate directions," Becker said. "I was grieving. He was moving on."
The Beckers aren't alone in experiencing strain in a relationship in the aftermath of miscarriage; their marriage remains intact. New research finds that couples who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth are more likely to break up even years after the loss than couples whose pregnancy ended with the birth of a child.
For miscarriage, or pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks, the likelihood of breaking up is 22% higher than for couples who have a successful pregnancy. The rate of splitting up peaks between 18 months and three years afterward, before falling back to rates similar to that of other couples, according to the study.
For stillbirth, or pregnancy loss at 20 weeks and beyond, the risk of breakup or divorce is heightened by as much as 40% for as long as a decade after the loss, according to the study.
The researchers say this is the first nationwide study of the fallout on relationships, both among married partners and couples living together, from miscarriage and stillbirth. The study analyzed the results of 7,770 pregnancies using data from the National Survey of Family Growth.
"The findings were quite surprising at how strong they were and how long they lasted," said study author Dr. Katherine Gold, an assistant professor in the departments of family medicine and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor.
The study is published in the May issue of Pediatrics.
Miscarriage can cause grief, anger and guilt, Gold said. Those feelings may fade in time, but not nearly as quickly as friends and family may expect them to, and can crop up again on the anniversary of the due date or the loss itself.
Becker, whose miscarriage occurred three years ago, remembers feeling alone in her grief. "No one else is grieving with you," Becker said.
The impact of stillbirth can be even worse, with some women becoming depressed or suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress or anxiety disorders, Gold said.
Yet pregnancy loss by no means dooms a relationship. Most women are resilient, Gold said.
"Most women after miscarriage actually do quite well, and most couples do well after miscarriage," Gold said. "But there is this subset of people who may be at higher risk for their relationship breaking up."
Researchers said it was possible that having a baby could help sustain relationships, rather than a miscarriage heightening the risk of a breakup. In addition, it's possible unknown factors could contribute to both risk of miscarriage and risk of divorce, such as mental illness or other chronic physical conditions.
After a miscarriage, men and women also experience the loss differently, said Dr. David Keefe, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at New York University Langone Medical Center.
For women, the sense of loss lasts longer. While men can certainly bond emotionally with the fetus and the idea of being a father, women have also experienced physical changes that can intensify the attachment, Keefe said.
Men and women tend to grieve differently, with women wanting to discuss the loss and men tending to want to "close up and go play golf," Keefe said, though there are always exceptions.
For couples going through infertility treatment, who may have already heavily invested themselves in the pregnancy financially and emotionally, the loss can be especially difficult to bear.
"The study provides evidence scientifically of what a lot of us sensed was an issue, which is that following a major disappointment of a miscarriage or stillbirth, that marriages can fall apart," said Keefe, a fertility specialist who has also trained as a psychiatrist.
After the miscarriage, Becker had trouble sleeping, became depressed and wanted to "talk about what had happened to anyone who'd listen," she said.
Though she and her husband of 22 years never seriously considered divorce, "it did affect our relationship," Becker said.
Gradually, Becker found her own way of coping. Now 44, she started a website, miscarriagememories.com, where she offers support to other women going through similar loss and sells silver charms to memorialize the baby that could have been.
"People e-mail me all the time and say, 'Thank you for telling me I am not crazy for feeling this way,'" Becker said. "I would rather have the baby, but if I couldn't have that, I am happy that something positive has come out of this."

On Friday, I spent roughly nine hours—from 6 am to 3 pm—on the streets of drizzling Washington, DC, inside and outside the Secret Service checkpoints at Donald Trump's inauguration. I have been to every inauguration since 1997, gauging the size and enthusiasm of the crowds. It's fun and a perk of living in DC. Ad Policy
I wasn't planning to write about what I saw on Friday until I saw White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer say on Saturday, “This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.” Then, as his voice shook and his face became mottled, he shouted, “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.” The next day, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said that Spicer was merely stating “alternative facts.”
These are not “alternative facts.” These are lies. This is an attempt at “gaslighting”: manipulating someone by psychological means into questioning their sanity. It's unconscionable behavior for an anonymous Internet troll, let alone the press secretary of the president of the United States.
It's one thing for a campaign to say things that are demonstrably untrue. That's been the reality for as long as we've had campaigns. But it is chilling when people who hold the levers of power will look straight at a bank of cameras and lie.
So here's the straight truth from someone who walked every inch of the inaugural ground on Friday. This was the smallest inauguration I've ever seen. I was tweeting that and saying it on camera to Democracy Now! during the day on Friday before I heard those observations justified by both aerial shots and Metro rider statistics. I said it because I saw the empty stands that were supposed to be filled with throngs of Trump supporters. I said it because I saw how easy it was to ride public transportation and drive into downtown. I said it because of the surprisingly sparse smatterings of red baseball caps as well as my conversations with local souvenir salespeople who were overloaded with “Make America Great Again” merchandise that wasn't moving. It was obvious. The people just weren't there.
I can understand why Sean Spicer was ordered to lie (though I can't explain why he didn't have the courage to refuse). It's not just because of Trump's obsession with insisting that things in his life that are small—his hands, his net worth—are actually huge. The motivation for these reckless and easily provable lies are found in the second part of Spicer's statement, “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.”
The fear of waning enthusiasm among the Trump faithful is real and well-founded. Not only does he enter office with the lowest approval ratings in the history of recorded numbers for an incoming president; not only does a significant majority of dislike the way he has handled the transition; but his base supporters are looking at his appointment of billionaires, Goldman Sachs parasites, and DC swamp-dwellers and already wondering if they were sold a false bill of goods. I spent a good part of Friday looking for people in red #MAGA caps and speaking to them. I cannot say loudly enough how different their mood was from the 2001 and 2005 people with whom I spoke at the Bush/Cheney inaugurations. The Bush supporters were confident, ready to argue and even fight. The famously pugnacious Trump supporters were unsure, confused by the small turnout, and disoriented about how to respond to being on security-checkpoint lines and finding themselves outnumbered by chanting protesters.

Walter, a Trump supporter from Virginia, said to me, “This isn't what I thought it would be. I thought this was going to be like our version of Woodstock. Instead I'm just cold.” Susan from West Virginia said to me, “On the plus side, I guess it can't get worse. And I'm still glad we're going to get the Supreme Court. But today—this is sad.” Raymond from West Virginia shrugged his shoulders and said, “I thought it would be like one of his rallies. Instead, it's this.” (Raymond then asked if I was Jewish. I said yes and he said “Just checking.” I said, “C'mon Raymond! Even your anti-Semitism sounds demoralized.” He looked down, sadly.)
In addition, the Secret Service and TSA personnel in charge of the checkpoints, both groups maligned by this administration, were cracking jokes about the president-elect as we were going through the metal detectors. One TSA agent even took a button from me that said, “Solidarity Trumps Hate.” He wasn't confiscating the button. He took it to wear (“later,” he told me). If it wasn't for the thousands of protesters who came out for both permitted and non-permitted demonstrations, the day would've had no life at all.
I know many are making jokes about Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, and their embrace of “alternative facts.” On one level, you laugh to keep from losing your mind. But jokes alone are not going to cut it right now. It would've been so easy for Sean Spicer to say, “It was a rainy Friday. The crowds were small. Time to get to work making America great again.” The fact that they can't admit something so small raises the terrifying prospect of what they will say when the question is not about crowd sizes but whether or not to go to war. The great journalist I.F. Stone once said, “All governments lie.” And that's true. But I don't think there's ever been a group of people willing to set the bar so low. Unlike the Bush people, they're not even bothering to construct false evidence for their lies. They're just betting a majority of the country won't care. We have to be better than that. We have to be better than them. The future depends upon it.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this article misattributed the quote “All governments lie” to Howard Zinn, who was in fact quoting I.F. Stone. The text has been corrected.
Last year, Solána Rowe walked away from music for good. She was 25, and she had been putting out EPs as SZA (say it like “scissor”) since 2012, when rapper/producer Terrence “Punch” Henderson stumbled across some early tracks and signed her up to Top Dawg Entertainment, the label that's also home to Kendrick Lamar, Isaiah Rashad and Schoolboy Q. In the time she had been working, she had co-written Feeling Myself for Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj, and Anti's opening track Consideration for Rihanna. But the path to a debut album proper had been long, slow and tortuous. It was promised at the end of 2015, then at the start of 2016. Last October, she had had enough. “I actually quit,” Rowe tweeted. “@iamstillpunch [Henderson] can release my album if he ever feels like it. Y'all be blessed.”
But it's 10 months later and SZA is still here. Her debut album, Ctrl, has finally been released, and it has turned out to be one of the most inventive and intimate records of the year, an astonishing collection of styles and stories that feels like a hazy conversation over a long night with a close friend. Its often brutal honesty about sex and relationships and self-esteem for women in their 20s has found a dedicated and devoted fanbase – the new season of Insecure, for example, uses tracks from it in multiple episodes.
So how serious was she really about quitting? “Super serious,” she insists today, in the back room of a house in south London, where she's curled up in an armchair, texting friends and family back home. “I don't feel subscribed to anything. So I feel like, when this isn't fun, I'm not gonna do it any more. When I can't grow, I'm not gonna do it any more. But it's still fun.” She laughs knowingly. There's a pause. “For now.”

Two things are evident about the world around Rowe. The first is that she doesn't do anything she doesn't want to do. It's a relatively new attitude, she says, which gives her some sense of control over her life. “I've started practising carte blanche just … doing whatever the fuck I feel like doing, as long as I do it with good intention. So I don't feel crunched,” she explains. “Now with all this new shit around me, I don't always know what's negotiable. I sometimes just assume, because things are very official and shiny and very fast-paced and very organised and very not what they were … ” She tails off.
The second is that chaos seems to swirl around her. Over the course of our conversation, people come and go, wanting a minute of her time. A very drunk woman tries to get her number, disappears, comes back into the room and then starts crying; we move the interview to the bathroom, then get locked in. Is it always like this, I ask? A member of her entourage says no, at the exact same moment Rowe yells, delightedly, “Yes!”

In person Rowe is frank and funny, and SZA fans love her openness and warmth. The night before we meet, she does a Q&A session for a room full of mostly female fans who plainly adore her, including Chewing Gum's Michaela Coel. Much of Ctrl feels like a series of messages between friends and lovers. “Let me tell you a secret/ I have been secretly banging your homeboy,” she sings on album opener Supermodel. “I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike/ I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night,” she sings on Drew Barrymore, which dives right into a Netflix-and-chill scenario: “Somebody gets the tacos, somebody sparks the blunt/ Let's start the Narcos off at episode one.” But is she just telling stories, or is it all true? “Unfortunately, it is, yeah,” she sighs.
The one problem with laying her life bare like this is that she thinks her mother doesn't like it. Rowe was born in Missouri and raised in New Jersey, and there are reports online that she was raised in a strict Muslim household. The reality is slightly more complicated than that. “My mom didn't let me eat sugar or candy until I was older,” she explains. “She didn't let me perm my hair till I was old as fuck. And I begged her to. My mom is a Pan-Africanist. My dad is still Orthodox Sunni Muslim, but he's super fun. He worked in television for years. He was a Black Panther.” So wait, they weren't that strict? She laughs. “No, they are strict. I just didn't care! I made it very difficult for them.”
Rowe says that when she broke away from Islam as a teenager, she stopped speaking to her father for a while. Her mother, who appears on Ctrl in a series of spoken-word interludes, hasn't mentioned the album at all to her daughter. “I know she probably thinks I'm very exposed. My mother is probably mortified actually about my album, but she loves me so much.” She wouldn't tell you? “No, because it's a personal opinion. And we already kinda had this talk when Beyoncé dropped her album. My mom was like, ‘I feel naked listening to her album. I just feel like there are some things you shouldn't say to the world.' That was already after I had made Supermodel and Doves in the Wind, and those songs were done.”

Her mother was yet to hear what they were about. “I was like, ‘Well, Mommy, you're not wrong.'” As a kid, she says, her mother would beg her to change her clothes before church. “And I would not change,” she says, unsurprisingly. “I was a funky kid. I didn't give a fuck. I loved experimenting. In the early 00s, the only influences for funky styles were Jamiroquai and Kelis. And George Clinton, because your dad is really on some old school shit. Now you're out here just wearing drawers on the outside, and a fur coat. Cam'ron!” she recalls. “These are your fashion icons. Your mom, and Lauryn Hill also. My mom just didn't understand. She wasn't having it. So I'm sure she knew this was coming but she's relinquished her desire for control over me. She's loosened her grip. So now she just accepts, well, all right.”

At this point, chaos swirling, we move into the bathroom. Perching on the edge of the shower, she explains that the delays around Ctrl were because of a kind of blinding paralysis brought on by anxiety, which affects her “awfully”. “I freestyle everything, all the way down. And I listen back and think, what's shitty? And if something's too shitty and I can't put my finger on it, and I think, wow this sucks to me, then I get way frustrated, and usually scrap the song.” She says that's what happened with Ctrl. That, and the fact that she gets lost on tangents too easily. She says her mother has always complained about her loose sense of time. “Everyone I've ever dated have been complaining about that. ‘What? I haven't seen you in three days, relax!' They're like, ‘I haven't seen you in six months, what are you talking about?' But that's just the way it is.”
Eventually, Rowe explains, Ctrl came out in June because “they cut me off”. So who decided it was finished? “They just took my hard drive from me. That was all. I just kept fucking everything up. I just kept moving shit around. I was choosing from 150, 200 songs, so I'm just like, who knows what's good any more?” She doesn't know who took it, just that it was gone from the safe in the studio one day. So after all that, this Ctrl isn't necessarily the Ctrl you would have put out? “No, absolutely not. Any longer and I probably wouldn't … I'm also driving myself fucking crazy, so I don't know. Give me another month and it would have been something completely different.”
However, she doesn't think we'll have to wait so long for the follow-up. “No! I have less anxiety about the things that hindered me putting this album out, so I'll probably be done in the next six months.” On the next one, she wants to look outwards instead of in, and write about the world. “The woorrrrld,” she whispers, conspiratorially. “Other people. I feel like we're all connected anyway.”

Maybe, she considers, the reason young women are so into what she does is because, in being so honest, she's attracting people with like-minded energy. She's interested in energy, and psychology, and mentions neurological science and theories a lot. “As long as you're being honest and there's intention in what you're doing, then I think that energy permeates your field and becomes like a homing signal for other people with like energies. And then it's, like, you draw each other in, cos you're looking for each other subconsciously. Or sub-energy-etically.” She giggles. “Sub-energistically?”
She thinks it's this same energetic likemindedness that led to Drew Barrymore appearing in the video for the single named after her. (Rowe is a huge movie buff, and she's as much a fan of the trashy 90s schlocky horror Poison Ivy as she is of Never Been Kissed. “You feel me? Nobody knows that movie! It's fire!”) She wrote Barrymore a letter asking her to appear but never sent it. Barrymore asked to be in the video anyway. “She just came 100% on her own because she fucked with it,” she says. “This doesn't make any sense. But people always say when you write things down in the physical world it becomes something. It transmutes the energy. It's wild. But I find that to be kinda true. I found my notebook from the other day and I had drawn my album cover. Like, to the T, but months before I shot the cover or even had the thought. But I forgot! It was just in my journal. Your brain is always with you even when you're not with it.”
What is it about the brain that fascinates her so much? “I love information,” she laughs. “I also worry that I've smoked too much weed and shot my brain to heaven so I always worry that I'm not going to get any smarter. It makes me so sad, so I'm always like, fuck, well, try to retain information girl. You can.” Someone is calling Rowe again; this time it's a manager, trying to locate her, so she can bundle her into a car, on to her next stop. “I'm in the bathroom!” she shouts, then tries the door. It's stuck. After a moment of panic, we barge it open, and she bursts through it, still laughing. She pulls me in for a hug, says goodbye, and grins. “Sorry for the calamity.”
Ctrl is out on TDE/RCA Records
Virtual reality has been a very long time coming, however probably the most notable strides have come in the past few years. Oculus has led a revitalization in Virtual Reality tech, the development of which had slowed considerably over the previous decade. Now, a resurgence in consumer VR products has resulted in great strides, and inexpensive virtual reality kits like the Samsung Gear VR make virtual reality accessible to almost anybody.
However there is still one key piece missing from the virtual reality puzzle that prevents the consumer from being really immersed in a VR experience. That will soon change, however, because of work being carried out by some researchers in Germany.
A group of researchers from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lab at Germany's Hasso Plattner Institute have created working prototypes of a device they call Impacto. The gadget is integrated into a band that may be worn on the arm, leg or foot of a virtual reality person. When mixed with a VR experience that incorporates the HCI researchers' special software, Impacto simulates contact on the wearer so that she or he can really feel objects virtual reality. At least, to an extent.
Examples demonstrated by the group include a boxing sport where the consumer can actually feel the impact from blocked punches on his or her arm, and a game where the participant bounces a soccer ball on his or her foot and can really feel every strike.
Of note, Impacto isn't a simple vibrate motor shoved into a plastic box. The machine combines a haptic vibration engine with electrical muscle stimulation to actually create a sensation of pushing or pulling, therefore more closely mimicking the sensation of contact from actual physical objects.
“The key concept that allows the small and lightweight impacto device to simulate a powerful hit is that it decomposes the stimulus: it renders the tactile aspect of being hit by tapping the skin utilizing a solenoid; it adds impact to the hit by thrusting the person's arm backwards utilizing electrical muscle stimulation,” the team, led by Pedro Lopes, stated in an summary covering its research paper on Impacto. “The device is self-contained, wireless, and sufficiently small for wearable use, thus leaves the person unencumbered and able to walk around freely in a virtual environment. The gadget is of generic form, permitting it to even be worn on legs, in order to enhance the experience of kicking, or merged into props, such as a baseball bat.”
Here's a video of the HCI team's Impacto prototype in action:
Use cases for Impacto are limited in the meanwhile because of the device's shape and size, however it's totally possible to use the same technology in both smaller and bigger units. As a result, different Impacto modules could possibly be combined to form a suit of sorts that may give the wearer multiple contact points. So, rather than only being able to feel a jab to the arm or a soccer ball bouncing off of a foot, virtual reality users may feel contact from VR objects throughout their bodies. The researchers mentioned that they already have plans to create new Impacto modules for the stomach area and shoulders.
KOBANE BORDER—Kurdish forces inside Kobane said today that the city is now under full control and Islamic State (ISIS) militants have been driven out of all neighborhoods.
Muslih Zebari, a Peshmerga commander in Kobane told Rudaw that ISIS militants remain only in a small village attached to the city “And the Peshmerga and YPG fighters are already on their way there,”
“Retaking that village is easy and today all of Kobane will be free,” he said.
A strong ISIS force invaded Kobane in mid-September last year but a coalition of YPG fighters, Peshmerga and US airstrikes halted the radical group's advance until it was liberated today.
Zebari said that the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) and the Peshmerga are gearing up to drive out ISIS from several other villages in the outskirts of the city.
“In the fighting, an ISIS tank and lots of ammunition have fallen in the hands of the Kurdish forces,” Zebari added.
Zebari said that the only Kurdish casualties were a few soldiers with slight injuries.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the YPG fighters have killed more than 1,000 ISIS militants in the battle for Kobane.
It is indeed tiring and bothersome to repeatedly call out the hypocrisy of India's intellectual elite. But this onerous and unpleasant task must be undertaken, if we want India to be a truly liberal society.
The context of this argument is of course centred around the recent violence that erupted in Delhi University's Ramjas College between members of the right-wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and Leftist All India Students' Association (AISA) over inviting Umar Khalid, a Jawaharlal Nehru University student accused last year of sedition over anti-India sloganeering, for a lecture.
At the very outset, let us be clear. Violence has no space in political discourse. Ideas cannot be defeated by physical assault. Nothing can justify the use of force to establish thought-control.
ABVP workers would do well to introspect on and understand that violence affects both the perpetrator and the victim. No one emerges unscathed. If Leftist student unions indulge in habitual strong-arm tactics to maintain their writ over India's colleges and universities, actions of the right-wing student's union prove that it is trying to emulate the Left model of intolerance, and not replacing it with a model of tolerance. This is a slippery slope.
Umar Khalid is right. His 'venom-spewing' against the Indian state would have been limited to just a handful of listeners if the 'Culture of Protest' seminar held in Ramjas had he been allowed to proceed. But by responding to provocation and seeking to cancel it, the ABVP has managed to hand the ultra-Left radical a far bigger platform. It is the perfect example of how an idea can only be combated with a better idea and any attempt at use of force only increases its potency.
Khalid, who belongs to Democratic Students Union (DSU) – one of the front organisations for banned Maoist groups active in Delhi – has accused ABVP of enjoying government patronage.
"ABVP is only working to disrupt discussions in universities. The body enjoys government and institutional patronage. But we refuse to be bullied into silence by ABVP," Khalid was quoted as saying in a video.
The political narrative that has emerged from the Ramjas fiasco has dovetailed nicely with the return of the phoney intolerance debate. The Left-liberal brigade has been quick to point a finger at the government for promoting "violence in campuses" and the media and the academia, strongholds of the ideological and political Left, have laid all onus solely at ABVP's door, accusing it of trying to stifle freedom of speech through action.
Enough material exists in mainstream and social media to prove that the violent ABVP-AISA clash was an equal opportunity conflict but the truth, as always, has been lost in propaganda.
An elaborate charge has been levelled that the ABVP, emboldened by the political wind in its favour, is trying to break open universities, the last bastions of 'liberalism', through force and that this violence is a ruse to gain political foothold and banish all intellectuality. An argument in favour of this charge was also previously argued by Firstpost.
One marvels at the way the Leftist ideology has become synonymous with "liberalism". This remains 20th century's most stunning sleight of hand. Not just in India, the global intellectual establishment has been aligned to one ideology and there has been an attempt to root out non-Left thinkers and dissenting voices deliberately and systematically.
This has resulted in a strange phenomenon. Students who emerge from these centres of learning – members of the global elite – are indoctrinated with the left-wing ideology. This skewed and blinkered 'education' essentially queers the space for debate because pluralism is looked down upon and contrarians are neatly labelled as alien outliers, who are to be resisted at all costs.
There is an automatic and vociferous pushback against independent thinking at all levels – be it students or professors, media, lawyers, authors, artistes. In short, every member of the civil society who has had access to this mode of 'education' is intrinsically intolerant of dissent.
Strength in numbers enable these indoctrinated intellectuals to claim and subsume the 'liberal' legacy and from thereon, every debate becomes 'liberalism vs conservative', or 'liberalism vs nationalists,' 'liberalism vs right-wing hatred', as the case may be. Every independent thinker is outlawed or ostracised and this patently 'illiberal' act is done in the name of liberalism.
Writing for British magazine The Spectator, author James Bartholomew posits: "The academic world is overwhelmingly left-wing and the textbooks spin to the left. They distort the facts or omit them… There is no analysis of counter-arguments. In fact, no data is offered on which a counter-argument could be based. This is not education. It is not teaching children to challenge ideas and think for themselves. This is anti-education: Teaching them what they must think. It is as prescriptive as education in the Soviet Union."
We find Chris Patten, Chancellor of the University of Oxford and a former EU commissioner, expressing similar worry of claustrophobia invading British and American campuses. In his piece for Project Syndicate, he writes: "In the US and the UK, some students and teachers now seek to constrain argument and debate. They contend that people should not be exposed to ideas with which they strongly disagree… There are calls for “safe spaces” where students can be protected from anything that assaults their sense of what is moral and appropriate. This reflects and inevitably nurtures a harmful politics of victimisation – defining one's own identity (and thus one's interests) in opposition to others."
The situation is similar, if not more stark in India, mainly due to the weakness of our institutions.
The relentless attempt since Independence to cleanse the academia, policy-making bodies and educational institutions of non-Left thinkers has resulted in a stifling uniformity of thought.
Rajeev Mantri, co-founder of the India Enterprise Council, writes in Livemint: "Not only does the Indian Left enjoy state patronage and a pervasive grip on academia, it has a long history of being viciously intolerant towards contrary viewpoints. Economist and member of Niti Aayog Bibek Debroy had recounted recently how renowned Columbia University trade economist Jagdish Bhagwati was forced out of Delhi School of Economics in the 1950s."
Author and economist Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic adviser in the ministry of finance, presents the clearest timeline of how the Left has wielded the power in its command to root out intellectual challenges.
In his column for The Week, he writes: "The Left dominance over the intellectual establishment has its roots in the systematic “ethnic cleansing” of all non-Left thinkers since the 1950s… The result of the systematic cleansing was that there were no non-Left academics remaining in the social sciences field in India by the early 1990s… Thus, economics students are mostly taught material written by Amartya Sen and his stable of academics but exposed only in passing to the thoughts of Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman or Jagdish Bhagwati, Sen's intellectual rival. Even when non-Left thinkers are included, their ideas are lumped together as exotic curiosities to be critiqued, rather than imbibed."
It is in this context that we must put Khalid's claim that "ABVP enjoys government patronage" and marvel at the post-truth world of Leftist hegemony. The irony is stark! Facing a political challenge for the first time in its hegemonic control over academia, the Left accuses the Right of stealing its proprietary right over violence.
If the Right resorts to brutality, we must condemn it with all our might. But we should be equally sincere and stringent in criticising the Left for playing the victim card after long subjecting its ideological rivals to mindless violence – a phenomenon that this writer is all too familiar with while growing up as a student in the Left Front-ruled West Bengal.
During his talk at the London School of Economics, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said: "I find this absolutely strange that an argument is being raised that I have free speech to advocate that India should be broken into pieces and those who oppose me are hindering that right to free speech. Well, they too have a right to free speech."
This is the crux of the argument. A global wind of change is blowing across continents. If the Left cannot accommodate the Right and engage in a battle of ideas, these violent fits will sadly continue. None will emerge the better for it.
