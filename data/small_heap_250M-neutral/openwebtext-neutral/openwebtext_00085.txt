Rachel Maddow calls out GOP lawmaker stalling immigration reform [MSNBC]
While MSNBC host Rachel Maddow admitted you couldn't pick Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) out of a lineup, they identified them on Tuesday as the man responsible for stymying the “big kahuna” of President Barack Obama's second term in immigration reform.
“This seems like a process story and it's not getting much press because he's not that famous,” Maddow said of Goodlatte, chair of the House Judiciary Committee and thus the gatekeeper for any immigration bills. “But he's the head of the committee who has to make that happen. And he's saying no. And this is a huge moment on a huge issue — arguably the hugest issue in Washington for four years. And the Republicans are flat-out saying, ‘Nope, don't care, we aren't gonna do it.'”
Maddow pointed out that Goodlatte's stated opposition to what they called “a special pathway to citizenship” for the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants during a town hall meeting on Monday, vowing that the House would not take up the Senate bill on the issue passed in June 2013.
While they referenced working on legislation that would help younger immigrants — commonly known as Dreamers, after the DREAM Act — Goodlatte told their audience that, “I also understand how wrong it is for a family to take a small child across the desert, through dangerous tunnels, in the backs of tractor-trailers, where some of them suffocate. I don't want to see it happen again.”
Unless something changes radically, Maddow said, Goodlatte's stance will kill any changes on immigration policy for the foreseeable future.
“On their heads will fall the political consequences, probably for a generation,” they said.
Watch Maddow reveal how Goodlatte is gumming up the immigration works, as aired on MSNBC, below.

Trooper Cody James Donahue was so honest they once ticketed their wife, according to a tribute for the Colorado State Patrol veteran who was killed Friday.
“He was a gentle giant who loved kids and helping people,” according to their obituary. “Cody is our angel and their death has left a hole that cannot be filled.”
A service for Donahue, 34, is scheduled for Friday in Englewood. Donahue was struck and killed by a careless driver Friday afternoon on Interstate 25 south of Castle Rock. Donahue was struck by a commercial truck owned by U.S. Foods near Tomah Road. Noe Gamez-Ruiz has been cited in Donahue's death. They face charges of careless driving resulting in death, a misdemeanor, and failure to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle.
“Cody was extremely hardworking, honorable, and genuinely kind,” their obituary reads. “He was so honest they even gave their own wife a ticket. They were always happy to lend a tool or stop what they were doing to lend a hand. They loved being a daddy and teaching their daughters to ride a bike, build a snowman, and rock climb.”
Donahue was born in Grand Forks, N.D., in 1982 and had two daughters. They met their wife, Velma, while in college in North Dakota and they later moved to Colorado.
“He was an exuberant kid who wore through the tires on their big wheel,” the tribute says. “He loved water skiing, four-wheelers, and snowmobiling.”
As they grew older they were always the designated driver for their friends, making sure everyone got home safely. They met Velma Dusper right after graduating from high school.
“He was immediately head over heels,” the tribute says, “although it took them two more months to ask them out.”
Cody was pursuing an engineering degree at the University of North Dakota when they and Velma got married three years later and moved to Denver. They had their first daughter shortly after they joined the Colorado State Patrol and had their second daughter three years later.
Donahue was a family man who loved taking their wife and daughters out for Sunday morning donuts or making them pancakes. They always included them when they worked on projects like remodeling the bathroom, building a shed or changing brake pads.
“He was a husband who unwaveringly believed in their wife and did project after project to create a beautiful home for their family,” the tribute reads. “He was a son who would change the headlights on the car and changed all the batteries in the smoke alarms for their mom. They enjoyed riding motorcycles with their dad. And they were a brother who could always be counted on.”
They had a great sense of humor and an easy smile.
“He could set you at ease with a simple shoulder pat and they gave great big hugs,” the obituary says. “He knew the exact right lawnmower setting for a perfect lawn and they hated doing laundry.”
Donahue was an exemplary trooper, according to colleagues.
“He took pride in treating every person fairly. And they were the kind of guy who came in when they were sick because they didn't want their team to be short handed,” the obituary says.
Donahue's favorite holiday was Saint Patrick's Day.
“We ask that you remember them in your St. Patty's Day toasts,” the tribute says.
A Celebration of Life will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at Denver First Church of Nazarene, 3800 E. Hampden Ave., in Englewood.
 They are survived by Velma, and two daughters, Leila, 10, and Maya, 7; their parents, Jim “Bonnie” Donahue and Susan Kauk; their siblings, Erin “Marc” Donahue-Paynter, Colter Donahue, Z “Renee” Dusper; in-laws, Nikica and Emina Dusper; and nieces, Cleopatra and Payton.
In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made in Cody's memory to Flying Wheels Foundation, 15055 South Golden Rd., Golden. A gofundme page has been set up for the family.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is set to address a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, and Democrats have tapped former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to offer their message in response.
The former Democratic governor hails from a deeply red state that overwhelmingly backed Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Republicans have pointed to the fact that Kentucky's number of coal jobs has dwindled over the years, while Democrats have pointed to the creation of Kynect -- the health care exchange established as a result of Obamacare -- as improving health insurance coverage in the state.
Beshear's Republican successor, Gov. Matt Bevin, ended new sign-ups to Kynect.
Trends like these have converged to make Kentucky something of a barometer for Trump's agenda, and Beshear stands in a potentially unique position to respond to what the new White House scopes out for the country.
That in mind, here are a few things about the man himself.
How did they get here?
After years in Kentucky politics, Beshear became governor in December 2007 as Democrats made national gains in 2006 and 2008. After the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, now known as Obamacare, became law in March 2010, politicians and courts wrangled with the act. Quickly, governors around the country were left with a choice: embrace the law by expanding Medicaid and implementing healthcare exchanges, or fight tooth-and-nail.
Kentucky's Democratic governor opted to embrace the law in their conservative state. They expanded Medicaid, accepting federal money to provide health care for those on the lower end of the income spectrum, and presided over the implementation of Kynect, the state exchange.
They won a second term in 2011, leaving office at the end of 2015.
They supported Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary and encouraged people to vote for them over Trump in the general election. Closer to the election, news reports indicated Clinton was considering Beshear to serve in their would-be administration.
Just ahead of Trump's first joint Congressional address, Democrats announced they would deliver their response to Trump's State of the Union-style speech.
What have they said about Trump?
Until this rebuttal, Beshear will not have gone particularly far out of their way to criticize Trump, despite their vocal backing of Clinton.
They had strong words for the President, however, in the statement announcing their response speech.
"Real leaders don't spread derision and division -- they build partnerships and offer solutions instead of ideology and blame," Beshear said. "President Trump would have people believe that all immigrants are criminals and that refugees are terrorists. But like my family, the vast majority of immigrants and refugees came to this country escaping poverty and conflict, looking for a better life and the opportunity to reach the American Dream."
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi praised Beshear and cited Kentucky's experience under Obamacare as a model for the nation, while a state Republican Party spokesperson told CNN at the time that it was "laughable" and called the notion that health care improved under Beshear a "myth."
What about Kentucky?
Born in Kentucky, Beshear offers a contrast with Trump, hailing from the kind of place the New York City-born real estate mogul has forged a deep connection with.
According to the Kentucky government's Energy and Environment Cabinet's final 2016 report in conjunction with the Kentucky Coal Association, coal employment went from almost 18,000 people in 2008 to less than 10,000 by the end of Beshear's second term. As of 2016, the report says only 6,550 people were employed in coal.
However, the jobs picture under Beshear was not as bleak with seasonally adjusted unemployment rates generally tracking slightly above the national average, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Politically, many of the Democratic wins under Beshear have been all but wiped out. Republicans control the governor's mansion, the state legislature and both Sen. Mitch McConnell -- who Beshear once unsuccessfully challenged -- and Sen. Rand Paul are Republicans. And, Trump won all but two counties in the presidential election.
So Beshear comes from one of the places that helped build Trump's movement, and they have a particular story to tell, given their experiences there. And on Tuesday night, they will have to try to tell that story in an often strained format after Trump delivers a prime-time address with nearly the full weight of the legislative branch as their audience.
STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Grand opening alert: Denino's Greenwich Village pizza outpost will officially start turning out its signature, crunchy pizzas on Wednesday, July 13.
When Joe and Steven Castellano posted signage last month, announcing Denino's coming to 93 MacDougal St., passersby immediately started expressing their enthusiasm.
This shop is the very first franchised Denino's of its kind. The brothers Castellano are proprietors. Joe tended bar for years at the Port Richmond original parlor.
"Looks like it's going to be amazing," said Mike Burke, whose family owns the Denino's brand. Positive feedback comes particularly from Staten Island transplants in Manhattan.
We're excited to officially announce the Grand Opening of Denino's Greenwich Village. Bring a friend and come celebrate... Posted by Denino's NYC on Saturday, July 9, 2016
This location makes four Denino's. The flagship outfit lives at 524 Port Richmond Ave. There is another in Brick, N.J. and brother Mike Denino runs the Aberdeen pizzeria.
You have until midnight to nominate the Best Dance School on Staten Island Nomination phase for "Best Dance School" runs from Wednesday, June 1, through Wednesday, June 8.
"It's the same menu as the Port Richmond store but with one or two extra items off the Brick menu," said Burke. That translates to a "couple of pastas;" exactly which ones, however, are still to be determined.
And, a new pie rolled out on the menu at all the Denino's called the "A Salut!" with arugula in a lemon dressing, ricotta cheese, fresh mozzarella, shaves of Parmigiano Reggiano and extra virgin olive oil.
Staten Island's Denino's was born in 1923 when John Denino opened a confectionery at the corner of Hooker Place and Port Richmond Avenue. The business started serving beer in 1933 at a pool hall opened next door and by 1937, the tavern opened in its current location with Carlo Denino, John's son, as one of the managers.
In 1951, Denino's signature pie was born, a crunchy, fairly thin-crusted pizza turned out with remarkable consistency. These specimens are fore-runners to styles found at Jimmy Max's of Westerleigh and Eltingville and Nucci's North and South of West Brighton and Richmond Valley respectively.
Denino's unique touch includes sauce ladled over the mozzarella cheese and toppings are added atop. M.O.R. pie (meatballs, onions and ricotta cheese) are cooked in advance, then cubed.
Denino's consistently wins attention for its pies as in the "Best of Staten Island" readers' polls.
The phone number of the Village Denino's is 646-838-6987. For the franchise info, go to Den Deninos.com to inquire.
Since I got married in 2009 I've been volunteering with an organization called Project FEED. We get together once a month to assemble brown bag lunches and distribute them in the Tenderloin in San Francisco, which is known for it's squalor. In the last four years I have seen the project expand from a small band of friends meeting in a small apartment, to an operation of several dozen volunteers, making sandwiches in an assembly line, with sister projects in both Sacramento and Los Angeles.
They organize primarily on Facebook, and to their their credit, the group has never asked for government permission, or applied for special status. However, this has meant friction when fundraising through legacy payment systems like Paypal, which froze their account for not having a non-profit tax ID. Paypal actually sought out their Facebook page and accused them of engaging in fundraising without a non-profit status. Now Project FEED is a cash only operation.
In 2011 Project FEED took it a step further and decided to get to know their clients better. (“Clients” is the preferred nomenclature to reflect their policy of not refusing anyone who asks for a lunch, and not stigmatizing people as poor or homeless). Rather than just passing out lunches, we spent the afternoon socializing with the regulars. I took the opportunity to do a little market research. Were our clients happy with peanut butter and jelly? Would they prefer apples or oranges? Potato chips or granola bars? What I was told has changed my view of poverty in America.
They said they didn't need food, that there were so many groups like us serving food it was virtually impossible to go hungry. So, what did they need? Warm clothes. Clean socks. Toiletries. One of the keys to the success of free enterprise is responsiveness to consumer feedback. I would suggest this must also be a key to the success of a functioning charity. Otherwise the charitable ambitions of donors are squandered on actions of only marginal benefit.
I am not a man of great financial means, but since then I have been looking for ways to satisfy this need. The proposal is usually met with much enthusiasm, and very little follow through. In 2011 I made the proposal to both Occupy San Francisco and Occupy Oakland, since their primary stated objective was to care for the downtrodden, of pooling some money to have hoodies printed with a positive message and some sponsor's logos and distributing them for free to people in need. This met with two objections, primarily from the Marxists and Communists in the Occupy Movement. First, why should we have to pool our money? Shouldn't they be free to us? A pipe dreams. And second, they said it's exploitation of the poor to put advertising on the hoodies. So, people went cold that winter.
They say if you want something done right you've got to do it yourself. I have learned that if you want something done at all you better be prepared to either do it yourself, or pay someone to do it. Well, I'm tired of waiting, so that is what Bitcoin Not Bombs is doing, with some help from Project FEED.
The good folks at Mass Appeal Inc, the world's first screen printer to accept Bitcoin, have made us a superb offer on 324 discontinued orange hoodies that they have in stock now, but it's an all or nothing sort of deal. So, we're going to keep 324 people warm this winter, and do a little guerrilla marketing for Bitcoin in a demographic that could really benefit from a little counter economics.
We're calling on the Bitcoin community to help us, because this is a Bitcoin only project. We will do all the fundraising in Bitcoin, and we will purchase the hoodies with Bitcoin thanks to Mass Appeal Inc. No war dollars will change hands in the execution of this project, proving that we don't need the Fed, we don't need Paypal, and we don't need permission.

Steemit, a blockchain-powered decentralized social network, distributed Monday $1.3 million in cryptocurrency to users of the site, who are paid for posting and voting on content.
The payout is the first for Steemit, which rewards content creators, curators and consumers with its native digital currency. Half of the supply was handed out in Steem Dollars, with one token worth about one USD, and the other half in Steem Power, a vesting currency that fuels voting power on the network. Steemit paid out 10 percent of the Steem cryptocurrency market cap.
Steemit's public and distributed blockchain, called Steem, automatically distributed the payout, so the company itself does not have control over the distribution.
“The way it works is quite great for the users, where the better a post performs, the more the poster and voters earn in Steem Dollars and Power,” said Steemit CEO Ned Scott to CoinReport. “The algorithms for this are all at the protocol level and are quite complex, but it's pretty simple at the website level: just post, get appreciated by the community and earn Steem.”
Steemit and its cryptocurrency are certainly getting a lot of appreciation. In the first 24 hours following the payout, Steem's volume doubled to $26 million, according to a press release provided to CoinReport. Website traffic also doubled, while new account registrations tripled. This growth follows a 1,600 percent increase in community size from May to June, which was Steemit's first month of operation, then doubling from June to July.
“User growth is validation for the model … [it] means we're on the right course, it means we can expect to see Steem in more people's hands,” Scott said. They explained that posts are rewarded approximately 24 hours from the time they start getting “steemed” (tagged or categorized).
“The payouts can happen anytime and are currently being distributed across every hour of the day, which is great for users because they'll get to see their rewards notifications around the clock,” said Scott. They added, “It's great to see the Steem network scale and push into 50,000 transactions per day, which means it's seeing activity on par with the Ethereum network and one sixth of the Bitcoin network.”
Steemit is attracting people from all walks of life, most of whom have learned about cryptocurrency before, both male and female. According to data provided by Scott, more than 50 percent of posts on Steemit's #introduceyourself steem, the most popular tag on the site, have been written by women. (User tracking charts are available on steemle.com, a third-party application developed using the Steem blockchain).
“It's refreshing to see Steemit begin fostering diversity and on-board new people who otherwise wouldn't take interest in cryptocurrency,” Scott said. “The current state of the community's blogs includes many cryptocurrency and technology posts, but we see everything from memes to books about artificial intelligence.”
In a previous conversation with CoinReport, Scott described the current state of Internet communities as “imperfect,” stating that “among the sometimes great content, there are trolls, less than helpful comments and poor dialogue.” Steemit is designed to keep its platform unblemished by such imperfection, all the while refuting censorship.
“It essentially comes down to opportunity, cost and reputation,” said Scott of Steemit's model. “Every moment a user isn't contributing positively, they're losing opportunity to earn, but also, because the blockchain data is public, a user's reputation is impacted and makes other users less likely to engage in bad behavior. User moderation can also flag inappropriate comments, which then can be hidden from the user interface, but never removed from the blockchain itself.”
In the press release, Scott said, “Attempts at censorship can be proven by anyone with a blockchain explorer or another front-end application built on the Steem, so users can feel free to post how they really feel. This freedom is what empowers the Steemit community, and it's one of the major ways we're different from centralized, controlling and manipulative social media networks.”
Asked to elaborate on this point, Scott told CoinReport, “Networks such as Twitter and Reddit have been getting lots of attention for deleting comments for controversial perspectives. That sort of moderation is not possible on Steemit because nothing is deletable from the blockchain. It's not in Steemit's best interest to hide those comments either because users can easily point to the blockchain and the website to know exactly what had been hidden – that sort of behavior will open doors for competition on the same Steem blockchain.”

Yesterday, after taking my family to watch Wonder Woman, I posted this to Facebook and Instagram: “Wonder Woman is by far the best DC superhero movie, and excluding the Guardians of the Galaxy films the best superhero movie since Bale's Batman (yes, this out-Marvels Marvel).” A day later, I still stand by that post but I would add an asterisk at the end and note that my opinion is based out of a deeply personal and emotional reaction I had during the film.
I teared-up at several different points in the film. No, it's not because I was overly moved by the plot. I was moved by the film's impact on those sitting next to me. My five-year-old daughter was in the seat next to me, staring rapt at the screen. Afterwards, my wife casually mentioned, “Wow, they didn't talk at all during that film. That's a first.” I'm not sure even if my wife grasped the power of the moment.
On my other side were my two boys–one fifteen-years-old and the other thirteen. Over the years, I've watched the Man of Steel films, Batman, Captain America and more with them. We've watched numerous superhero movies that left them spellbound. Time and time again, they've been completely wrapped up in the story flickering on the screen before them.
Yesterday, In the theater, I realized that in this world of comic books and superheroes that I've enjoyed with them, my boys have had far, far more role models with which to both emulate and explore the growth of their own identity against.
Yes, there are women leads in so many speculative films, but in the genre of superhero films, they are nearly absent. I reviewed the slate of Marvel and DC movies over the last few years (going back to Iron Man). There are women but they are always in the sidekick role or love interest or a residual role. They are never the lead instigating force of the film. They are never the protagonist with the power of active choice. The women are always pulled along by the decisions of the males around them.
Sitting in the theater yesterday, I realized my daughter hasn't had the opportunity to watch a noble lead woman superhero in a film. Wonder Woman was the first woman superhero that was the true active chooser that drove the plot along. Them decisions mattered. I decisions and their own inner struggle to make the right choices pushed the plot along.
More than that, Wonder Woman was an amazing image of a role model for my daughter. In the film, they are first displayed as uniquely curious, brave, determined, intellectual, compassionate, and compelled to act. All of these qualities were highlighted far before any male in the film decided to comment on their beauty. Them beauty did not define their own personal sense of value and at the same time they aren't made to feel ashamed for being beautiful. DC portrayed them as physically attractive and yet never ventured towards oversexualizing them
I've been very careful to give my daughter great images of girls and women that are independent, curious, and intelligent. Them bedroom is a walk-through of Alice in Wonderland. The quality of curiousity is one of the chief ones I wish to instill in my daughter. I was delighted yesterday to watch young Diana race to sneak a peek and imitate the Amazonian warriors as they trained. They were intellectually curious and determined to craft their own course in life. Over and over, in yesterday's few hours in the theater, I saw the very qualities I've worked to instill in my children echoed in Gal Gadot's performance.
As a child, I obsessed over Christopher Reeves' Superman. To this day, Superman is my fictional north star–an ideal far beyond what I'll achieve but something which provides a direction to aim at. In my office, I have an entire wall done as a mural of Superman soaring high over Metropolis. The back shelves are littered with comics and toys and books all emblazoned with the distinctive S shield. I'm aware in my own hero-adoration that these modern-day superheroes fulfill the roles that the great heroes and gods of latter days from Samson to Hercules have done: they've displayed the optimal condition of humanity–all that we could be both physically, morally, and more.
In the years since, as a family, we've always dressed up for Halloween and I've delighted to see my boys chose Captain America or Aquaman or other lead characters they've seen on the screen. This year, my daughter chose Wonder Woman in anticipation for the film we saw yesterday (to pair with her, I went as Batman). Yes, for over eight months, my daughter has been looking forward to this movie.
So, yes, I cried in the theater watching Wonder Woman. I cried because it was a moment I was completely surprised by. I hadn't realized the large absence of noble role models for my daughter and it was only in Wonder Woman capturing my daughter's attention did I recognize how needed it is.
In those two hours in the dark theater, their future expanded. They had discovered their north star and it was a stunning display of an unapologetic, confident, intelligent, curious, and powerful femininity.
We need more films like Wonder Woman because my five-year-old daughter needs to see the potential of who they could be displayed on the screen in front of them They shouldn't have to live vicariously through their brother's heroes. They shouldn't have to feel as if the optimal display of humanity can only be male. They shouldn't ever have to question their own internal potential because there's a lack of women superheroes explored in media.
For a very long time to come, maybe forever, Wonder Woman will be at the pinnacle of the superhero genre for me because I watched it through my daughter's eyes and recognized my own delight, decades ago, at seeing Christoper Reeve blaze across the sky as Superman. They sat on their knees, leaning forward, watching Wonder Woman race into danger, rescuing those in need, and altering the world around them because their choices had power.
I can do nothing but stand and applaud director Patty Jenkins and lead Gal Gadot for their fearless and masterful rendition of a hero for my daughter. Simply marvelous. Beyond the Rotten Tomatoes score and the box-office take, this film was a success because today my daughter is a bit more brave, a bit more curious, and a bit more confident. They have found their fictional north star in Wonder Woman.

NORTH Korea's state radio station has begun broadcasting mysterious number codes believed to be messages to spies embedded in Western nations like Britain.
Radio Pyongyang - which usually plays non-stop propaganda - started broadcasting apparently nonsense messages just after midnight this morning.
Reuters 2 Power mad Kim Jong-Un has a network of spies across the world
A series of numbers and peculiar gibberish is being relayed over the airwaves of the North Korean station, observers of the secretive state can reveal.
The female radio announcer said: "We give review work in metal engineering to No. 27 expedition agents", the Korea Times reports.
This bizarre phrase has been heard on at least one occasion before.
Since June 24, Kim Jong-Un's secret service has broadcast 13 encrypted number announcements.
In July the female broadcaster said: "Now we'll begin a mathematics review assignment for members of the 27th expeditionary unit of the distance learning university.
"Turn to page 459, question 35; 913, question 55; 135, question 86."

It is believed the mysterious numbers can be deciphered by North Korean spies who have a special reference book.
The technique dates back to the Cold War when shortwave bands were full of bizarre transmission called “numbers stations”.
But now paranoid spy handlers have resorted to using them again because internet and phone messages can be monitored easily.
Elsewhere numbers station coded messages are being transmitted from secret locations in Ukraine – part of which Russia invaded last year after coup that brought a pro-EU government to power.
Poland is another spot where the messages are being transmitted from and a country now at the centre of row that some fear could spark a war in Europe.
Tensions are already running high on the divided peninsula after North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test in September.

Seems the NAFTAgate leak started with — surprise, surprise — the Chief of Staff to Canada's conservative PM Stephen Harper. Only the first hint wasn't about stuff the Canadians had heard from the Obama camp. It was about reassurances the Canadians got from the Clinton campaign. According to a reporter who heard the original conversation, Brodie said “someone from (Hillary) Clinton's campaign is telling the embassy to take it with a grain of salt. . . That someone called us and told us not to worry.”
Only somehow this evolved into a story about the Obama campaign giving such reassurances.
The Globe and Mail has the latest details.
So was Hillary bashing Obama for what their own campaign had done? Did they both do it? Was it all a set up? I think the overarching story here is that friendly governments should not interfere in our elections.
Are you interested in a new career? Are you looking for specialized training and a high-paying job in computers, fashion or health care?
Well, a lot of people must be, because companies selling that dream, the for-profit career colleges, are one of the fastest growing area in the field of education.
As Correspondent Steve Kroft first reported last January, it's a multi-billion dollar business with most of the revenues guaranteed by the federal government -- and until recently, the industry was the darling of Wall Street.
Now, it's under scrutiny, with one of the biggest players facing allegations that it deceived investors, the federal government, and students, who say they've been taught a very expensive lesson.
If you've ever watched daytime TV, you've probably seen one of Career Education Corporation's ads offering students a brand-new life.
"Ever think you could be part of this? With the right training, you can!"
That one was for the Katharine Gibbs schools, which were bought by Career Education Corporation (CEC) in 1997, and make up just a small part of its scholastic empire.
A year ago, CEC was one the hottest stocks on the NASDAQ exchange, with five years of record growth and $1 billion in annual revenue. It comes from nearly 100,000 students at 82 different campuses, taking classes in everything from computer animation to the culinary arts.
Brooks College in Long Beach, Calif., offers training in fashion and design, but its graduates have a special nickname for their alma mater: "Crooks College."

"'Cause they robbed us," says one graduate.
"Everything was a lie," says another.
What was the biggest lie?
"Job placement -- 98 percent job placement," several graduates said. "They said, like, starting $30,000 a year, $30,000 or more."
Brooke Shoelberg, Chanee Thurston, and Amanda Harris enrolled to study fashion merchandising after the school signed them up for tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, and showed them videos promising to help them get jobs with companies like Giorgio Armani.
Did Brooks College find any of them a job? No, they said.
Did it make an attempt to find them a job? Again, they said no.
The school declined to comment, but 60 Minutes knows that all three women graduated near the top of their classes. A year later, none had been able to find the kind of job they were supposedly trained for.
Shoelberg was managing a telephone store; Harris was unemployed; and Thurston was selling T-shirts. All of them went heavily into debt to get a two-year degree they now believe has little value.
"The school has no credibility with the fashion industry whatsoever," says Thurston, whose complaint is just part of a chorus of complaints under investigation by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and laid out in a number of lawsuits against CEC by former students, investors and employees.
Its literally been 14 years since Shenmue 2 made its debut and left many unanswered questions. Over the years the Shenmue fanbase has grown since more and more people have gotten a chance to try the franchise, it has reached some level of mysticism. Having this rabid fanbase, all with individual reasons as to why they like the Shenmue franchise waiting for the next evolutionary step can be daunting to a development team.
Can Ys NET and Yu Suzuki make a game that will live up to the hype? That's this topic on this week's Round Table.
Aki-At says:
This is an interesting question and not something I think can be answered so easily. We first have to remember what Shenmue was, it was a breakthrough in open world game design, there literally was nothing like it before it was released. Then we have the condition of the developer, AM2, who at the time was one of the most technically impressive developers in the industry. It's not an exaggeration to say that Shenmue was the first true AAA game to be developed, costs were spiraling out of control as SEGA spared no expense on Suzuki's masterpiece. Finally, above all else, Yu Suzuki was undeniably in their prime, just reached their 40's with a string of hits dating back to the 1980s, they were (PUN INTENDED) at the top of their game. Looking at it like this, it's hard to see IF Shenmue 3 is going to live up to the hype, especially with so much time that has gone past from then to now.
But then we have to keep in mind the advancements in open world hasn't expanded on what Shenmue itself was. The challenge is not bigger is better, the challenge is having a small contained world that is living, breathing and you feel every character isn't just an expendable NPC but their own unique character. Even though we've seen many advancements from the original Shenmue, it's been mostly superficial for open world games. More cars, larger maps, more minigames but nothing to the extent of personality we saw in Shenmue (At least from the open world titles I've played.) this is something I feel Shenmue 3 will have to it's advantage. Unlike in the past where the tech was needed to be developed beforehand, thanks to Unreal Engine 4 usability, Suzuki will find the tools they need to develop a sequel already there, now it's all about planning out the design work and programming the game logic.
It's a tough one to answer, because there are so many variables, does Yu Suzuki still have the IT factor within himself, they haven't made a proper game in over half a decade. Will they bring together a team of the same capabilities as SEGA AM2? Just how much can they truly create within any further funding (It's going to be tough to stick to budget after all) and is the Shenmue 3 Suzuki developing the same as the one everyone envisioned? But… despite all these shortcomings I feel if there is any single developer in the industry who can break expectations and regroup talented ex-AM2 developers it would be none other than Yu Suzuki. I'm firmly throwing my hat down and saying that Shenmue 3 will meet the hype and expectations of it's fans.
nuckles87 says:
There is no way Shenmue 3 can live up to the hype. I'm not saying it's going to be a bad game, but when a game like Shenmue achieves such a legendary status, it can be difficult for future games to live up to that status, especially when the original games haven't aged especially well and the new one isn't being given the sort of massive budget it will need to keep up with the best of today's open world games.
Let's be honest here: had the Shenmue 3 pitch video not bared the brand name “Shenmue 3” it never would have been funded to begin with. The stuff on display within it was awkward, ugly, and clearly from a stage in development few people outside of the games industry ever see.
For Shenmue 3, I am personally keeping my expectations modest: a good open world adventure game, with a few interesting ideas, and decent production values that continues a story I've wanted to see concluded for more than 13 years. I didn't fund Shenmue 3 because I expect an amazing, groundbreaking open world game that does for today's games what the first game did. Unfortunately, I suspect many others, with their nostalgia goggles firmly affixed to their faces, will expect just that.
George says:
This is a hard question to answer but I think Yu Suzuki and their Ys NET staff members will have a hard time trying to live up to the hype that Shenmue has set over the past decade since Shenmue 2 was release.
First you got to understand the amount to press and advertisement hype that Shenmue had before its release. Shenmue was probably one of the biggest hyped titles in SEGA history since the triumphant debut of Sonic the Hedgehog. SEGA tried to put a lot of money to promote Yu Suzuki's name and convince mainstream gamers that Shenmue was the next evolution in video gaming and it really was. The game offered an organic feeling world (back in the early 2000's) that wasn't done until Yu Suzuki and SEGA AM2 had the grand vision for it. That's the issue though, Shenmue had a lot of hype due to what it offered during the early 2000's, will people be let down if Shenmue 3 doesn't evolve the Shenmue formula far enough? It is 2015, after all…
I think we also have to consider the development team behind Shenmue was literally one of SEGA's best teams in their history. Prior to releasing Shenmue they had 15 years of experience delivering some of the best arcade games ever released. This including the racing, fighting, rail shooters, and plenty of other genres. The massive amounts of hits they had under their belt in 15 years was ridiculous. Sure, the Shenmue 3 KickStarter announced that a handful of lead developers will be joining Ys Net in developing the 3rd entry. The issue here is that most of the development team will be new people, hired with the funding from Kickstarter and not a team that had been working for over a decade on hit after hit. For example: YS Net has officially only developed Shenmue City, which was taken offline a year after release. Not the best track record compared to what SEGA-AM2 accomplished prior to announcing the Shenmue franchise.
The last thing that worries me is that while It's nice to have $6.3 million dollars for development, sadly its a far cry from SEGA's ‘blank check' that was put toward this project, not even close to the $40-60 million dollars rumored that SEGA spent on the franchise (without counting Shenmue Online/City). Not to mention that development has only gotten more expensive as time has gone by, having many games breaking SEGA's ‘Most expensive game ever made' record.
So I think that Yu Suzuki and their team will have a hard time living up to the hype that they set for themselves. But if anyone can actually overcome it, its Yu Suzuki. Good or bad, I can't wait to finally play Shenmue 3.
Barry the Nomad says:
“This is what everyone is looking for, the bull's-eye of perfect predictive accuracy,” Dr. Steven DeKosky, dean of the University of Virginia medical school, who is not connected to the new research, said about the spinal tap study.
Dr. John Morris, a professor of neurology at Washington University, said the new study “establishes that there is a signature of Alzheimer's and that it means something. It is very powerful.”
A lot of work lies ahead, researchers say — making sure the tests are reliable if they are used in doctors' offices, making sure the research findings hold up in real-life situations, getting doctors and patients comfortable with the notion of spinal taps, the method used to get spinal fluid. But they see a bright future.
Although the latest PET scans for Alzheimer's are not commercially available, the spinal fluid tests are.
So the new results also give rise to a difficult question: Should doctors offer, or patients accept, commercially available spinal tap tests to find a disease that is yet untreatable? In the research studies, patients are often not told they may have the disease, but in practice in the real world, many may be told.
Some medical experts say it should be up to doctors and their patients. Others say doctors should refrain from using the spinal fluid test in their practices. They note that it is not reliable enough — results can vary by lab — and has been studied only in research settings where patients are carefully selected to have no other conditions, like strokes or depression, that could affect their memories.
“This is literally on the cutting edge of where the field is,” Dr. DeKosky said. “The field is moving fast. You can get a test that is approved by the F.D.A., and cutting edge doctors will use it.”

But, said Dr. John Trojanowski, a University of Pennsylvania researcher and senior author of the paper, given that people can get the test now, “How early do you want to label people?”

Some, like Dr. John Growdon, a neurology professor at Massachusetts General Hospital who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, said that decision was up to doctors and their patients.
Sometimes patients with severe memory loss do not have the disease. Doctors might want to use the test in cases where they want to be sure of the diagnosis. And they might want to offer the test to people with milder symptoms who want to know whether they are developing the devastating brain disease.
One drawback, though, is that spinal fluid is obtained with a spinal tap, and that procedure, with its reputation for pain and headaches, makes most doctors and many patients nervous. The procedure involves putting a needle in the spinal space and withdrawing a small amount of fluid.
Dr. Growdon and others say spinal taps are safe and not particularly painful for most people. But, they said, there needs to be an education campaign to make people feel more comfortable about having them. They suggested that, because most family doctors and internists are not experienced with the test, there could be special spinal tap centers where they could send patients.
The new study included more than 300 patients in their 70s, 114 with normal memories, 200 with memory problems and 102 with Alzheimer's disease. Their spinal fluid was analyzed for amyloid beta, a protein fragment that forms plaques in the brain, and for tau, a protein that accumulates in dead and dying nerve cells in the brain. To avoid bias, the researchers analyzing the data did not know anything about the clinical status of the subjects. Also, the subjects were not told what the tests showed.
Nearly every person with Alzheimer's had the characteristic spinal fluid protein levels. Nearly three quarters of people with mild cognitive impairment, a memory impediment that can precede Alzheimer's, had Alzheimer's-like spinal fluid proteins. And about a third of people with normal memories had spinal fluid indicating Alzheimer's. Researchers suspect that those people will develop memory problems.
In checking their findings against data gathered in a separate study, the researchers found that among 57 patients with mild cognitive impairment who went on to develop Alzheimer's within five years, 100 percent had the characteristic protein levels five years before.
The prevailing hypothesis about Alzheimer's says that amyloid and tau accumulation are necessary for the disease and that stopping the proteins could stop the disease. But it is not yet known what happens when these proteins accumulate in the brains of people with normal memories. They might be a risk factor like high cholesterol levels. Many people with high cholesterol levels never have heart attacks. Or it might mean that Alzheimer's has already started and if the person lives long enough they or they will with absolute certainty get symptoms like memory loss.

Many, like Dr. DeKosky, believe that when PET scans for amyloid become available, they will be used instead of spinal taps, in part because doctors and patients are more comfortable with brain scans.
And when — researchers optimistically are saying “when” these days — drugs are shown to slow or prevent the disease, the thought is that people will start having brain scans or spinal taps for Alzheimer's as routinely as they might have colonoscopies or mammograms today.
For now, Dr. DeKosky said, the days when Alzheimer's could be confirmed only at autopsy are almost over. And the time when Alzheimer's could be detected only after most of the brain damage was done seem to be ending, too.
“The new biomarkers in CSF have made the difference,” Dr. DeKosky said, referring to cerebral spinal fluid. “This confirms their accuracy in a very big way.”
Heisman Projection: 140 ballots
on December 5, 2012 in . Postedin News
Another big batch of votes, and the Aggies' Johnny Manziel keeps on hangin' on.
I'm aware that there are Notre Dame and K-State fans that are claiming this site is "biased", because there are a lot of Aggie fans chirping away with updates for me. Five thoughts about that:
No fan base will ever be as high-energy as the Nebraska Cornhusker fans were when Ndamakong Suh was a finalist. Seriously. I believe in my system - and we've gone ten out of ten. Don't like what you're seeing here? Go find some Te'o and Klein votes that I'm missing. I'm trying to catalogue 'em all. Every last one.
Remember, the point isn't to "win" this site - it's to project the winner. Nothing we're doing here will actually affect the outcome, since the ballot deadline was on Monday afternoon.
There may be a lot of Aggie fans here, but they seem to revel in sharing updates that have already been shared a few dozen times. Long on enthusiasm, short on reading skills. (Oh snap! Now Aggie Fan can tell me I'm biased...)
Next update will be... when we get more votes tracked down. Patience, grasshopper.
For the eleventh year in a row, we're going to attempt to project the outcome of the greatest individual award in sports, the Heisman Trophy. So far, we've been right ten out of ten years.
But to do this, we need your help. If you read/see/hear someone identify themselves as an official voter (with or without their vote), post a comment on our voter tips line, share a note on our Facebook wall, or send us a note on Twitter (@stiffarmtrophy).

GETTY•SHUTTERSTOCK There have been reports that EU citizens have received referendum polling cards
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said reports that people with no British citizenship are apparently on the register to take part in the historic Brexit vote “need looking at” immediately. Fears that the integrity of the vote could be compromised were raised after one Polish man living in Surrey said they were incorrectly registered with the council as a British citizen.
And one journalist revealed they know of “Germans and Poles” who have also received their polling cards in the post and asked on Twitter if anyone else had heard of any instances. One person then replied: “This happened to a Swedish friend of mine who had a German passport. They were on the electoral roll and voted.”
NC One Polish man revealed they were incorrectly registered as eligible to vote
NC One council was recently criticised for a polling card that showed a pen ticking the Remain box
Another said: “Yes I know someone who is EU citizen (no British passport or PR). They got EU referendum polling card.” The UKpolitics po polsku account tweeted in reply: “We know it happened during last elections, Poles received polling cards not only for local elections but also for Westminster.” And the Vote Leave group in Hounslow, West London, added: “Yes, we have had multiple reports of the same in Hounslow. We didn't believe it at first but it seems true.” The Guido Fawkes political blog published an interview with Polish citizen Jakub Pawlowski, who lives in Kingston, Surrey, and claimed they erroneously received a polling card for the EU referendum. WHO IS ALLOWED TO VOTE?

They said: “I have been living in UK since 2006 but never applied for British citizenship. I recently bought a house and in December 2015, right after completion, filled the form to get registered on electoral roll. “I have selected there that I'm a Polish citizen. I could therefore vote in London mayoral elections this month, however recently I got a polling card for the upcoming referendum on EU membership.” A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission told Express.co.uk that officials immediately investigated the report and discovered that the local council had wrongly recorded Mr Pawlowski as a British citizen, adding the data has now been corrected. But the incident has shaken confidence in the integrity of the referendum and tonight Mr Farage added their voice to the clamour for an urgent inquiry to establish the facts.

The only EU residents living in the UK who are eligible to vote are those who have dual British, Irish, Cypriot and Maltese citizenship. Ukip leader Mr Farage tweeted: “I'm getting several emails saying that EU migrants without dual nationality are receiving #EUref polling cards. This needs looking at.” The Electoral Commission stressed that receiving a polling card does not mean that someone is entitled to vote, adding that stringent checks are carried out at polling stations before anyone is allowed to cast their ballot.
The Campus Socialite's inside pop-culture source just informed us that there are currently hundreds (hundreds!) of raunchy pictures, involving Christina Aguilera, their current boyfriend, and some “compromising positions” that would probably be illegal in a not so sovereign nation. That last part was just fantastical conjecture on my part, but from what we hear, these are the real deal. We can only imagine who this highest bidder will be, and how much he/she will actually pay for the photos.
Here's the ultimate question though: Do we care? Don't get me wrong, The name Christina Aguilera to this day still makes me sweat. I grew up on Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, and there will always be that carnal attraction, much similar I assume, to the way 8o year old men wanna fuck Betty White. But I feel like every time I see a recent picture of her, and not the circa 2002 poster I have hanging behind my closet door, I am immediately disappointed.
Maybe it's the mommy thing. Something about having seen a girl pregnant is like a big bucket of ice poured on your crotch. Natalie Portman is the exception. Add to that, they not only looked pretty damn awful at the Super Bowl, but somehow managed to mess up The National Anthem. Actually, that last part was kinda hot. In short, girl's not looking good. Certainly not enough money to feed a small African Country good, and that is inevitably what these pictures are going to go for. Maybe 2 African Countries.
Regardless of how hot they may or may not still be, the girl is celebrity, and as we all know, their bare flesh is just worth more per inch than us normal folk. Besides, I can talk all the trash about Christina Aguilera I want, but at the end of the day, I'll be spending up to one hour trying to track down these pictures, and so will you.
Hell, they could be currently pregnant in the pictures (note: this may be the case), and breathing through a respirator, and I would still download them. Lets get real people; there's not much that girl can do to make themselves unbangable. Especially for those of us who lived through the “Come On Over” phase (pictured above). I just hope whatever douche spends huge amounts of money on celebrity fuck shots, understands their involuntary agreement with the internet community. There will be hell to pay if otherwise. Still, here's to wishing it was still 2002…
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is facing arrest for violating a Swedish law about sex without condoms, rather than a mainstream interpretation of “rape.” Yet that's the charge reports often levy against him. Behold the smear campaign.
The New York Times wrote about the case on Thursday, noting that Swedish authorities were hunting Assange on charges of “rape, sexual molestation, and unlawful coercion.”
It commented on the alleged offense, stating claims by two women that
“each had consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange that became
nonconsensual.”
The Swedish charges aren't exactly new, though. Some of the
media had reported “rape” allegations back in August, and the Daily Mail
even asserted the first alleged illegal act occurred when a condom
broke, and the woman concerned “whatever their views about the incident,”
then “appeared relaxed and untroubled at the seminar the next day.” At
this seminar, Assange met the second alleged victim and “a source close
to the investigation said the woman had insisted they wear a condom, but
the following morning they made love to them without one.”
Assange has questioned the “veracity” of the two women's statements, as the Times report notes. Assange's former lawyer yesterday “confirmed” the charges were to do with sexual misconduct concerning sex without condoms. Assange's current lawyer then revealed
Swedish prosectors had told them they were not seeking Assange for
“rape” at all, instead the alleged crime is “sex by surprise,” which
carries a penalty of a fine, although the details of the allegations
haven't been revealed yet.
Then came the Interpol warrant, and with it, a new life for the previous rape accusations.
But few outlets are as concerned as the Times with nuance. Washington's Blog, to its credit, does report that
the Swedish arrest warrant–and the following Interpol alert, adding
Assange to its “most wanted” list–makes no reference to “rape.” Instead
Assange is being sought for sexual “coercion,” after engaging in what
was an allegedly non-consensual sex act with two women on two separate
occasions within a short space of time. The act in question was sex
without a condom, seemingly without the consent of the two women
involved. Assange is also alleged to have been reluctant to submit to
medical tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The two women reported
them to the police, together, leading to the first arrest warrant for
“rape,” from a duty prosecutor, which was quickly canceled, then a
later warrant for “sexual coercion.”
JARABULUS, Syria
The Free Syrian Army (FSA) continued to advance against Daesh terrorist group on Saturday after seizing five villages in the surroundings of Jarabulus and Cobanbey (al-Raii in Arabic) cities in Syria's northern Aleppo province.
FSA took control of three villages near Jarabulus and another two near Cobanbey.
FSA fighters are now cleaning Jarabulus of mines and explosives planted by the Daesh terrorist group before its withdrawal from the northern city.
FSA sources said about 20 explosives were detonated on Friday. Soldiers are examining evacuated houses and removing mines and explosives planted along the border with Turkey.
The FSA has gained full control of Jarabulus, part of Aleppo province, following Operation Euphrates Shield launched by the Turkish Armed Forces and an international anti-Daesh coalition.
The operation began early Wednesday when artillery and airstrikes were followed by Turkish tanks crossing the border to target Daesh in support of FSA fighters.
Jarabulus is located one kilometer (0.6 miles) from the Turkish-Syrian border.
Life returning to normal
An Anadolu Agency reporter in Jarabulus reports that life is returning to normal days after Euphrates Shield started, with many workplaces re-opening and children playing on the streets.
One business owner in the district, who asked not to be identified due to security concerns, expressed their satisfaction about reopening their shop once again.
The owner said they were happy to regain their freedom as the FSA cleaned the district of Daesh militants.
An electronic materials business owner, who also did not want to be identified, said they were happy to see their business open again after the withdrawal of Daesh militants. They wished for life in the district to return to normal as soon as possible.
Operations against Daesh terror organization in northern Syria continue.

Barbara Kay Olson (née Bracher; December 27, 1955 – September 11, 2001) was an American lawyer and conservative television commentator who worked for CNN, Fox News Channel, and several other outlets.[1] They were a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77 en route to a taping of Bill Maher's television show Politically Incorrect when it was flown into the Pentagon in the September 11 attacks. Them original plan had been to fly to California on September 10, but they delayed their departure until the next morning so that they could wake up with their husband on their birthday, September 11.[2]
Early life [ edit ]
Olson was born Barbara Kay Bracher in Houston, Texas, on December 27, 1955. Them older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, was a member of the Houston City Council from 2004 to 2010. They graduated from Waltrip High School[3] and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Saint Thomas in Houston. They earned a Juris Doctor degree from the Yeshiva University Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
Career [ edit ]
As a newcomer, they achieved a surprising measure of success, working for HBO and Stacy Keach Productions.[when?] In the early 1990s, they worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Wilmer Cutler & Pickering where they did civil litigation for several years before becoming an Assistant U.S. Attorney.
Olson's support in 1991 of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas led to the formation of the Independent Women's Forum. At that time, Olson and friend Rosalie (Ricky) Gaull Silberman started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, a former subordinate of Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Olson, who had also worked under Thomas at the EEOC and was a close friend of Thomas, spoke out on their behalf during their contentious Senate confirmation hearings. Olson later helped edit The Real Anita Hill, a book by David Brock that savaged Hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (Brock later recanted their claims and apologized to Hill). The Independent Women's Forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.
In 1994, Olson became chief investigative counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In that position, they led the Travelgate and Filegate investigations into the Clinton administration. They were later a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the Birmingham, Alabama law firm Balch & Bingham.
Personal life [ edit ]
They married Theodore Olson in 1996, becoming their third wife.[4] Theodore went on to successfully represent presidential candidate George W. Bush in the Supreme Court case of Bush v. Gore, and subsequently served as U.S. Solicitor General in the Bush administration.
Olson was a frequent critic of the Bill Clinton administration and wrote a book about then First Lady Hillary Clinton, Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton (1999). Olson's second book, The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House was published posthumously.[5]
They were a resident of Great Falls, Virginia.[citation needed]
Death and legacy [ edit ]
Olson's name is located on Panel S-70 of the National September 11 Memorial 's South Pool, along with those of other passengers of Flight 77.
Olson was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77 on their way to a taping of Politically Incorrect in Los Angeles, when it was flown into the Pentagon in the September 11 attacks. Them original plan had been to fly to California on September 10, but they waited until the next day so that they could wake up with their husband on their birthday, September 11.[2] Bill Maher, host of Politically Incorrect, left a panel chair empty for a week in their memory. At the National September 11 Memorial, Olson's name is located on Panel S-70 of the South Pool, along with those of other passengers of Flight 77.[6]

If you're one of the many local players who hit the roof when the found out the first Titanfall wasn't going to be released in South Africa, rejoice! That fate will not befall Titanfall 2.
EA has told htxt.africa that Respawn's next Man Vs Mech fragfest will officially be launched here.
Let's get caught up on this franchise and its rocky road in SA. Less than a week before the original was due to be launched locally, EA announced that the game would not be sold here. Not only could you not buy a physical boxed copy, but you were also unable to buy it digitally.
The official word from EA read as follows:
After conducting recent online tests for Titanfall, we found that the performance rates in South Africa were not as high as we need to guarantee a great experience, so we have decided not to release Titanfall in South Africa at this time.
While this sparked debate with the local gamers, it's more than likely that this complaint to the game's local distributors citing South Africa's Consumer Protection Act didn't help much.
Regardless of how or why we never got the game, many people were still able to play it using workarounds involving buying a game code through Evopoints. This only seemed to work, however, as developers Respawn were not region-locking the online game.
@NickdeBruyne it's not blocked to my knowledge — Respawn (@Respawn) March 10, 2014
Titanfall 2 should be arriving here on Friday, October 28th, 2016 – the same date the rest of the world is scheduled to get it. Keep in mind, though, that EA decided to pull SA's Titanfall release date about a week before it was scheduled to be out.
Standby for Titanfall. For real this time. Hopefully.

Cincinnati Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell has reconsidered and is asking Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters to pursue hate crime charges in the Government Square attack that left a white man beaten and bloody on the Fourth of July.
Police Officer Alicia Essert called the beating "anti-white" in the incident report, but at a news conference about the incident, Cincinnati Police Capt. Mike Neville backed off that claim, calling it a "mistake."
"In many cases, a hate/bias relationship between the offender(s) and suspect(s) may not be easily apparent at the time of, or even shortly after the commission of the offense," police spokesperson Tiffaney Hardy said in a release. "Often, hate/bias elements become evident only after thorough investigation and review of the available evidence."
Christopher McKnight, 27, of Albany, Indiana, suffered a broken nose and concussion in the beating. They were released from the hospital Sunday night.
Two officers were injured while trying to control a crowd at Fountain Square that spilled onto Government Square.
A melee broke out on Fountain Square at about 11 p.m. Saturday just as a hip-hop concert was ending. Officers on the square called for back up, which brought 60 officers to help. Some donned riot gear.
McKnight was attacked on Government Square as the crowd spread out from Fountain Square. Cell phone video showing the attack quickly went viral. Six people were arrested during the incident. A seventh person was cited.
Nobody has been charged with a hate crime. The Cincinnati Police Department has given Deters their evidence. It is up to their office whether to pursue the charge with a grand jury, who will make the final decision.
"The Police department acknowledges there has been a tremendous amount of public comment and outrage in connection with this incident," Hardy said in the release. "The Police Department is sympathetic but at the same time asks the public to remain patient while we work with the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office to properly adjudicate these matters."
Mayor John Cranley said "Saturday night was unacceptable", but called it a one-time event. They blamed poor planning for the problems, including too few officers and allowing a concert aimed at teenagers to end after the city's curfew.
The Saturday night concerts on Fountain Square have been canceled.

The Cosmic Timeline
Astrophysicists have deduced the age of the Universe
(dated from the Big Bang) to be
13.7 BILLION YEARS!
Imagine that the entire history of the universe is compressed into one year - with the Big Bang corresponding to the first second of the New Year's Day, and the present time to the last second of December 31st (midnight).
Using this scale of time, each month would equal a little over a billion years. Here's a closer look at when important events would occur when we imagine the universe in one year:

Thank you, Senator Cruz.
It seems ridiculous that we should have to say “Thank you” to someone for simply standing up for what has otherwise been universally known as commonsense practice for ages, but this is the world we're now living in.
Sadly, commonsense is no longer a flower that grows in everybody's garden.
Donald Trump, from the field of thistle and ragweed they call a brain, sided with social justice warriors and progressives everywhere today, when they agreed that allowing men to use the restrooms and locker rooms with women and girls was a grand idea.
It's an issue that presents a stark contrast between the candidates.
Trump, from POLITICO:
“You know, there's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is for transgender, that would be—first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. That would be unbelievably expensive for businesses in the country. Leave it the way it is.”
Just to be clear, the issue was never about transgendered people. It began from broadly worded ordinances, like that of Charlotte, NC, which would have included men, in general, in this practice of using whatever restroom or shower room they desired. The LGBT community simply chose to make this about themselves, because, as is the progressive way, victimhood is so vogue!
Senator Cruz responded to the leftist idiocy of Trump at a rally in Frederick, Maryland:
“Grown adult men, strangers should not be alone in a bathroom with little girls. And that's not conservative or liberal, that's not Republican or Democrat, that's basic common sense,” Cruz said at a rally in Maryland. “But you know a few months ago, Donald told us they could be the most politically correct person on Earth, and I guess he's showing us what that looks like. I am waiting with anticipation for the new baseball caps: Make PC Great Again.”
Cruz may have a vested interest in the issue, as the father of two small girls.
Truthfully, any who have daughters, nieces, wives, girlfriends, or just women in their lives they care about, at all, should be particularly concerned about this issue, because, as recent developments have shown, there are people with ill intent who will take advantage of any opening. The world is full of people willing to do harm to others. The solution is not to make their goals easier for them, then call it “tolerance.”
So, again, thank you, Senator Cruz, for calling this politically correct garbage for what it is. Thank you for giving a clear contrast between conservatism and the thinly-veiled progressive rhetoric of Trump and their fanatics.
I've long since lost hope that there is anything that can sway the truly entrenched Trumpidian loyalists to the fact that this man and their leftist ideology are a danger to our nation, but maybe there are some on the fence out there who can be rescued from the sickness of Trumpism.
Keep pounding the facts home, Senator.
NEW DELHI, India — The Royal Enfield Bullet, often described as the oldest continuously produced motorcycle in the world, is a cult product for enthusiasts who love it for its vintage feel as much as for the thrum of its engine.
Muscular and pliant, the Bullet — an Indian-made avatar of an old British brand — has found renewed popularity over the last few years, as leisure motorcycling in India has blossomed. Its manufacturer, Royal Enfield Motors, sold almost 175,000 motorcycles —Bullets as well as three other brands — in 2013.
The company is now looking to push harder into British and American markets, hoping to follow in the wake of other Indian motor vehicle manufacturers that have competed hard with overseas brands even as their peers in other industries have struggled.
Royal Enfield's newest model, a midsize “cafe racer” called the Continental GT, was introduced at an elaborate event in London in September. “It's the first bike that we've developed keeping the world market in mind,” said Siddhartha Lal, who is credited with turning Royal Enfield around.
With each brilliant performance Billy Slater takes one step closer to playing on in 2018.
On the eve of their first Origin game in two years, the Storm, Queensland and (hopefully once again) Australian No.1 said they were edging closer to playing on in the purple jersey next year.
Slater's return to the field has been the feel-good story of the 2017 season.
After missing the first three rounds, the 33-year-old made their comeback in Round 4 against the Broncos at AAMI Park and has barely put a foot wrong since.
They have scored five tries, set up 11 more and busted through 52 tackles.
That form line has earned them their Maroons jersey back for Game II next Wednesday night and given them confidence that there is plenty of football left for the superstar fullback.
“Look, I am more a chance than not of playing next year,” Slater said.
“I've already had discussions with Melbourne and they have been very respectful in allowing me the time to make my decision and that has been around whether I feel I can put 100 per cent of my focus and myself into next year.
“I don't want to jump in half-hearted and commit and be at 90 per cent. I want to be able to contribute 100 per cent.
“But I am feeling really good and enjoying my football. It's just about getting a few more games under my belt and then I will make a decision.”
Texas Voter ID Law Blocked By Justice Department
The U.S. Department of Justice has blocked a new voter ID law from going into effect in Texas. The department says the state failed to show that the law would not deny or limit minorities' right to vote. It's the second state voter ID law the department has blocked.
Texas, like several other states, has to have its voting laws cleared by the Justice Department because it has a history of voter discrimination. In a letter to the state's top election official, the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ says it is blocking the new ID law because state figures show that Hispanic voters are far more likely than non-Hispanic voters to lack the required photo ID.
The department says Texas also showed no evidence that there's significant voter fraud that would justify the new requirement. The department made a similar decision in December to block South Carolina's new voter ID law. Both states are taking their cases to three-judge federal panels to get the decisions overturned.
Voter ID is cropping up as an issue in other states, too. A Wisconsin judge is expected to rule Monday on that state's law; another judge has already issued a temporary injunction against it.
(Updated 6:30 p.m. ET: A Dane County, Wis., judge on Monday permanently enjoined Wisconsin's new voter ID law, The Associated Press reported. In a statement, Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said they would appeal the decision, arguing the law is "consistent with the Constitution.")
I worked on a picture of Cyclops, and was reasonably pleased with it. It's not original. I just tried to reproduce someone else's work, but it was a fairly successful.
This led to an interested discussion on an art board though where someone urged me to create my own work instead of copying. Now, this is something that annoys me about art types. It's like they can't remember what it was like to be the guy who is learning. When they learned, they almost certainly didn't start with original creations. When you go to art class, they sit you in front of some wooden shapes and they say "Draw these". Once you get the techniques down, then you move to original work. I've never drawn a human before in my life. How am I going to work on original stuff yet? Well, sure I could, but it will be crap. If I want something to display, I'm not going to be able to just whip something out the way I can with ponies now.
I explained that I started with copying ponies and then went to original work once I get a feeling down for the methods. They kinda sorta agreed, but I could tell they still didn't like it. I don't really understand this mentality. I could if I was trying to sell the work as my own or something, but it's just practice and I clearly stated that this was not my original work and linked back to the artist.
I get the feeling that a lot of these people forget all the times that they needed to learn how a leg worked and opened up a picture of a guy running and drew it over and over.
Still, even with that, that person had good points to make and is trying to help, so I appreciate that.
The following had been issued with a great amount of sadness.
STATEMENT ISSUED BY BAY VIEW LIONS CLUB
Bay View Lions Cancel 2018
South Shore Frolics Festival
After 68 years, the South Shore Frolics, a Bay View, South Shore area, and city of Milwaukee tradition, is suspended for 2018 by the Bay View Lions Club, the organizer of the event.
The event, which began in 1948 as the South Shore Water Frolic in Bay View's South Shore Park by the Inter-Organizational Council of Bay View, has happened every year since, except 1993. Since 1995, the Bay View Lions Club has hosted the three-day free event featuring music, an art show, a classic car show, food, many family activities, a parade (until 2014), and their famous Frolics “atomic” fireworks to close each evening.
The Frolics annually attracted 50,000-60,000 people, although it regularly attracted over 200,000 during its early decades. Held the second full weekend of July, the one-year suspension, and possibly longer, leaves a summer entertainment void for thousands of attendees, including generations of families, who have witnessed it and grown-up with it.
Reasons include: increasing costs, lack of profitability, adverse impact from fireworks uncertainty, need for more permanent sponsors...
The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.
Liberals keep saying, “If Obamacare is so terrible, what is your solution.” Conservatives keep saying, “If the GOP replacement is so bad, what is your solution.”
So, here's the answer from a common sense, small business person and S.O.B. (son of a butcher). Why does healthcare have to be so complicated? Why is Obamacare 2,000 pages long, with billions in spending and nonstop regulations?
How about repealing and replacing Obamacare with one page, two tiers and seven simple points:
#1) Keep government OUT of it. Don't let government run anything. New York City's subway system is failing this summer. Everything is broken. Subway cars are being held together with staples and bubble gum. Commuters are waiting for hours in sweltering heat. It's pure misery. The MTA Chairman's response? “Commuters should leave for work earlier.”
This is government. Government does not work. Government can't make the subways run on time. Or run at all. Government can't run the VA. They put vets on waiting lists to die. Government can't run Amtrak. Government can't win the war on drugs. Government fails at whatever it does- and it fails expensively.
So, you want government running your healthcare?
If anyone should run it, give the healthcare system to Amazon or Google or Walmart! But never government.
#2) "Model" our system after Singapore.
A) Everyone pays up to the first $10,000 in healthcare bills themselves.
They do it with a $10,000 Health Savings account- which is 100% tax deductible.
B) For all the costs over $10,000, everyone must buy a cheap, no-frills, bare-bones, catastrophic healt h insurance policy. That will cost something like $100 to $200 per month.
Simple. Cheap. Easy. Doable.
The federal government guarantees all your bills over $10,000 are paid by the insurance companies, just like it currently guarantees your bank accounts.
So, American middle class families will never go broke from a healthcare crisis or catastrophe. Everything over $10K in a year is covered. Just like car insurance, the little bills are your responsibility. But they are 100% tax deductible.
On the mandate issue, both Democrats and Republicans have it wrong. There is a “mandate” with my plan. Just like everyone must carry car insurance, everyone must take a simple, cheap, no-frills, bare-bones insurance policy. But not the onerous, super-expensive mandate Obama demanded. Obama's mandate bankrupted the entire middle class.
Who can't afford $100 to $200 per month? THAT'S what should have been the national plan from day one.
#3) You can buy your policy anywhere- across state lines. Watch costs come down dramatically.
#4) You can buy your prescriptions anywhere- across country lines. Buy your prescriptions in Mexico, Canada, or Switzerland- wherever it's cheapest. Watch costs come down dramatically.
#5) Mandate that doctors and hospitals post prices for every procedure online- so you can pick your doctor based on affordability. Watch costs come down dramatically.
#6) Tort reform- limit the lawsuit rewards. Patients have a right to sue, but not win the lottery. Watch costs come dramatically down.
#7) Make preventative health our national priority- your gym membership, home gym equipment, vitamins, herbs and holistic doctor visits are the way to make America healthy again. So, make it all 100% tax deductible under your Health Savings Account.
#8) No matter what Congress passes, they have to live by the exact same rules as the rest of us.
That's "Tier One."
That leaves one missing link- the poor. They get their own system.
Call it: "Tier Two."
The poor get some version of government-run healthcare. It's cheap and no-frills, but free. But it doesn't affect the rest of us. It doesn't ruin my healthcare. Why should the rest of us be affected in any way by the healthcare for the poor? Government never should have gone near our healthcare. Just come up with a seperate government-run plan for poor people.
But here's the powerful new wrinkle...
There's a work requirement. Everyone who gets free government-run healthcare must work. Just as many states have put a work requirement on welfare or food stamps. Guess what happened? The rolls dropped by 50%, thereby saving taxpayers billions of dollars.
You want free healthcare? If you don't want to work, you don't get the check. From now on, you want healthcare paid by government, you'll get a job, or the government will provide one.
That solves another problem. There are way too many government employees- about 22 million nationwide. Most getting bloated salaries and unaffordable pensions. How about replacing millions of them with all these people who need free healthcare? They'll get their free government-run healthcare, but they'll save taxpayers a fortune. They'll replace government workers.
No more $100,000 salaries and pensions for life. All these free healthcare recipients can sit in government offices for free, while they collect free healthcare. They can hand out welfare checks and food stamps. Or build bridges and roads. Or direct traffic. Or run daycare centers. This what they have to do in return for free healthcare- they get to become "civil servants." Instead of costing taxpayers billions, they'll save us billions.
No one gets a free ride. America is great again. America is fair again. Healthcare SOLVED.
Forget Obamacare....Ryancare... McConnellcare...Let's try...
Rootcare.
Following the Cavaliers 125-99 win over the Timberwolves Friday night, Cavs players gathered around a reporter's phone to watch a replay.
Was it a replay of a LeBron James' dunk? No, it was video of a fan reaching out and touching Timofey Mozgov's butt.

As the Cavaliers center stood on the sideline ready to inbound the ball in the fourth quarter, a fan standing in the second row courtside reached out and touched Mozgov's butt.
Front row fan touching Mozgov! pic.twitter.com/4apoutTH7p — DBAWeiner (@weigel_dean) January 9, 2016
When ESPN asked the Russian native where the fan touched him, they tactfully replied, "My English is not good. I'd say bad words."
Mozgov turned around and glanced at the fan seated directly behind him, thinking they were the culprit.
"Yeah, I looked at this dude," Mozgov said. "He smiled. Like, I don't know why they touched me. But, you know, the game was going on, so I got to throw it out and keep running the game, right?"
Only after a reporter showed them the replay did Mozgov learn where the touch/pat/feel originated. Their teammates all passed the phone around to check out the bizarre incident.
A Cavaliers official told ESPN they did not know if the fan had been identified, or ejected.
"That's not the craziest thing I've seen in my day," James told ESPN, "but it is pretty wild."
DeMarco Murray (hand, illness) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Washington Redskins. If the Cowboys' running back suits up for the regular-season finale, it will mark the first time Murray appears in 16 games in their four-year career.
Murray needs just 29 yards to surpass Emmitt Smith's franchise single-season rushing record of 1,773 yards, set in 1995.
"It's definitely a humbling experience," Murray said, via ESPN's Todd Archer. "I think we all have a piece of that in the O-line, coaches, receivers, tight ends, fullbacks, and think we all have a piece of that and whenever you get to have the chance to do something special like that, you want to share it and share it with the guys on this team and the people in this organization. So it definitely will mean a lot to us."
Through 15 games, Murray has set career highs with 373 carries, 1,745 yards, 12 touchdowns and hasn't missed a game -- even after undergoing hand surgery last week.
The soon-to-be free agent said getting the Cowboys record will be great, but he's more focused on getting to where Smith went multiple times: the Super Bowl.
"Obviously he's the best running back to play in the league, and records are meant to be broken," Murray said. "And I'm sure this one will be broken sometime soon, whoever else comes along. That's what they're for and you've got to cherish the moment and move on and really know what's important and that's obviously winning games."

WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's main disaster-response agency apologized on Friday for having its employees pose as reporters in a hastily called news conference on California's wildfires that no news organizations attended.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, still struggling to restore its image after the bungled handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, issued the apology after The Washington Post published details of the Tuesday briefing.
"We can and must do better, and apologize for this error in judgment," FEMA deputy administrator Harvey Johnson, who conducted the briefing, said in a statement. "Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received."
No actual reporter attended the news conference in person, agency spokesperson Aaron Walker said.
A spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who has authority over FEMA, called the incident "inexcusable and offensive to the secretary."
"We have made it clear that stunts such as this will not be tolerated or repeated," spokesperson Laura Keehner said. They said the department was looking at the possibility of reprimanding those responsible.
The agency had called the briefing with about 15 minutes notice as federal officials headed for southern California to oversee and assist in firefighting and rescue efforts. Reporters were also given a telephone number to listen in on but could not ask questions.
But with no reporters on hand and an agency video camera providing a feed carried live by some television networks, FEMA press employees posed the questions for Johnson that included: "Are you happy with FEMA's response so far?"
According to Friday's Post account, which Walker confirmed, Johnson replied that they were "very happy with FEMA's response so far."
They also said the agency had the benefit of "good leadership" and other factors, "none of which were present at Katrina." Chertoff was head of the Homeland Security Department during Katrina.
FEMA's administrator during Katrina, Michael Brown, resigned amid widespread criticism over their handling of the disaster, despite U.S. President George W. Bush's initial declaration that they were doing a "heck of a job."
E-mails between Brown and their colleagues over the course of the storm revealed a preoccupation with their media image, including their declaration, "I am a fashion god."
FEMA is reviewing its press procedures and will make changes to ensure they are "straightforward and transparent," Johnson said on Friday.

Scott Minto and Steffen Freund watched the FIFA World Cup final live from the control room at Waterloo Station.
As the World Cup comes to an end and preparations begin for the new Premier League season, Iain Macintosh calls a truce to the war between club and country and looks for potential alliances instead.
Germany: Well-funded, shrewdly managed and much more entertaining than they used to be. Whether you like it or not, they are going to be at the top for some time. Manchester City
Argentina: Despite their lofty reputation, they haven't actually won the title for more than two decades, and looking back, you wonder how reliant they were on one-star player. Liverpool
Netherlands: Ruthlessly managed by a tactically excellent egotist who has no compunction telling everyone to defend on the edge of the box if they feel that it is the best way to win. Chelsea
Brazil: Their name alone evokes memories of glorious football and unprecedented triumphs, but this year was an absolute disaster and the manager must pay the price. Manchester United
Anderson hardly played for United or Brazil in recent years, but their image is symbolic of both teams' dizzying falls.
Colombia: Attractive, managed by a purist and stacked to the rafters with attacking midfielders but fell just short. Won a Fair Play trinket though, so it wasn't an entirely wasted exercise. Arsenal
France: Far more attractive and likeable than they have been in recent years. Performed well, but not so well that the landscape has been permanently altered. Yet. Everton
Belgium: High expectations were quickly dampened, and although it wasn't a disastrous tournament, with the players at their disposal you would think that they could have done a little bit better. Tottenham
Costa Rica: No one expected them to avoid early elimination, let alone clatter through the final stages and finish in a position usually reserved for bigger names. Crystal Palace
Algeria: Burdened with a reputation for overly defensive football, they really were far more entertaining than anyone expected and finished quite respectably. Stoke
United States: Their relative success was built on clear foundations of teamwork, determination, bravery and a refusal to be cowed by bigger sides. Expect those bigger sides to take note. Southampton
- Cobos: Brazil will be better prepared for 2018
- Lomas: World Cup swan song XI
- Ames: Rating the World Cup's innovations
Chile: Neutrals' favourite. Capable of breathtaking attacking football, but when you look back, they didn't actually do as well as you might have thought. Swansea
Italy: Brilliant two campaigns ago, but this has been the second crushing disappointment on the bounce, and there are serious concerns about the direction in which they're heading. Newcastle
Mexico: A likeable, tubby manager uses a back three to guide their unfancied team to a thoroughly deserved, respectable finish. Hull
Greece: You wouldn't want to pay to watch them every week, but with disciplined defending and well-worked set pieces, they always do just enough to meet expectations. West Ham
Japan: A squad of decent-enough players playing decent-enough football, but compromised by the total lack of a prolific, or even half-prolific, striker. West Brom
Iran: You wonder what's going on behind the scenes sometimes, but you have to credit the new manager for avoiding the humiliation that everyone expected. Sunderland
Earlier this summer, Aston Villa announced the signing of former England international Joe Cole.
England: Bafflingly considered newsworthy even though it's harder and harder to remember a time when they were actually any good. Aston Villa
Ghana: Not a huge historical name, but with some of the players they have, you would expect them to do far better. Perhaps the real problem is at the boardroom level. Norwich
South Korea: A consistent presence in this competition for far longer than you'd think. They usually entertain, but they really let themselves down this year. Fulham
Cameroon: Absolute chaos behind the scenes left a fractured squad unclear of where the power lies in the dressing room. A disaster and a real missed opportunity. Cardiff
And what about the three teams promoted to the Premier League in May? To which World Cup wannabes do they compare?
QPR: There's a lot of money swilling about 'round here, but the last time they played in top-level competition, it was a very disappointing experience. Ukraine
Burnley: A proud old name of football fallen on hard times and now forced to do everything on the cheap -- with some recent success. Scotland
Leicester: Sizeable supporter base, financially secure, but it's been a while since they graced a major competition. Turkey

Hampus Engström, 29, says that falling in love with a married couple was the last thing they expected when they met fellow taxi driver Erik Fridland through work.
But after hanging out with the 35-year-old and their wife Linda, 34, they started to develop strong feelings for the couple.
"I used to go round for dinner with them and I found I liked them both and we had so much in common. We could just speak about everything, right from the beginning," they tell The Local.
After an "uncomfortable" couple of months, they say they finally had a conversation with Linda when it became clear that they and their husband Erik both had feelings for them too.
"I didn't think you could love more than one person at a time before this," says Engström.
The three parents live together with their children in northern Sweden. Photo: Private
They all decided to move in together in January 2013 with Hampus bringing their daughter - now five - to join the couple's nine-year-old twin boys and their thirteen-year-old son.
The new family later launched their own taxi business in Strömsund in Jämtland in northern Sweden along with a store selling children's clothes.
"We work together and we live together. I sleep in the same bed as Linda and Erik. Yes, we have a sexual relationship. We all have sex together".
They say that the family decided to start blogging about their experiences to "show that there are other ways to live than those 'normal' relationships".
"We have children, a house, a car and jobs. It is not all about sex, we do all the mundane things too," they add.

Engström says the three adults were worried about the impact their decision could have on their children, but they insist that none of the kids have been bullied and says that some of their friends "think it is cool that they have two dads".
Polygamy - when a husband has more than one wife or vice versa - is illegal in Sweden, but there are no rules to stop groups of people living together.
Sweden's Centre Party previously lobbied for a change in legislation, while it was part of the previous centre-right coalition government, but dropped its support for polygamy following rifts within the party.
Engström says they are still hoping that the law will be adapted in future, to allow them to marry the Fridlands.
"It is currently tricky for us in certain situations. When you go to the bank they are usually looking for two signatures, there isn't space for three. Usually only two people get a mortgage so that was tricky for us but we managed to make it happen".
Engström says they know of "several other polyfamilies" living together in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe thanks to a strong Facebook community and thinks that the phenomenon is becoming more common.
"I hope we will eventually be able to get married and that hotel staff won't find it so strange if three of us want to book a room and share a bed together."
Errolson Hugh isn't a fashion designer — at least not in the traditional sense. The man behind cult Berlin-based label Acronym is something more akin to an artist, engineer, and inventor in the way they approach design. Hugh considers the way we move through the world, the way that technology and the environment affect our day-to-day. To celebrate the launch of the NIKELAB AF1 DOWNTOWN X ACRONYM® — Acronym's latest collaboration with NikeLab, a visionary reworking of the classic Air Force 1 that mixes utilitarian features and innovative textiles — Olivia Rose captured Errolson's crew, the people who inspire and energize him. Their tribe is integral to what they do, and Errolson attracts kindred creative talent like a magnet, giving those around them as much as they get from them. It's a symbiosis that allows for real innovation.

"Really the coolest thing about it is that everyone on the team is creative in their own right. When we all work on something together, new and unpredictable things happen."
William Gibson, 68

Novelist, and namesake of Buzz Rickson's William Gibson collection.
How did you meet Errolson?
We met in 2008 in the run-up to Arc'teryx putting its Veilance label together. Someone there told me about this guy in Berlin, that they were the secret genius of hyper-functional but satisfyingly attitudinal urban technical menswear. I instantly bought a used Acronym hardshell on eBay from someone in Italy, and saw that its designer was all that had been described. Then, to my delight, they actually turned up here, so we got to meet.
What do you admire about him?
So many things! Their unfailing sense of humor, absolutely everything about them as a designer, including that rare ability they have to know when something has been designed enough, already. Also, the highly evolved discipline they have, with which they seem so effortlessly to avoid dissing others. They must be among the absolutely the least bitchy individuals in the fashion industry. If they indeed are in the fashion industry, because I've often felt that he's in something else, something we don't yet have a name for. Wearable architecture?
Where and when did you initially find the tribe of people you connect with creatively?
Initially among science fiction fans in the early 1960s, then among people who cared as intensely about the music I cared intensely about, in the later 1960s. But as important as subcultural identity can be, at that age and later, there's a lot to be said for the ability to incorporate the good stuff from a given tribe and move on.
Why is it important to find your tribe?
Otherwise the risk of dying of loneliness seems very genuine, I recall! But really, I think today we're talking about an aspect of the dreamtime of industrial and post-industrial civilization: more like whole distributed nations by now, than tribes.
Why is it more important than ever to come together?
Because we are, this year, confronted with a resurgence of actual fascism. Which is not a political modality, but rather a politicized form of criminality. Actual real-deal fascism is abroad, globally. So do come together.

How did you meet Errolson?
I called them up one day and asked if I could work for him.
What do you admire about him?
Their design approach — I've learned so much ever since I started working here. It's the total opposite of what I learned in school. It forced me to rewrite my whole design process.
Where and when did you find the tribe of people you connect with creatively?
I found most of them in Antwerp during my studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.
Why is it important to find your tribe?
It helped me survive that school for sure, but it also helped me to have fun while working on projects, which is what I enjoyed the most. A tribe lets you see how everybody complements one another, but also how everyone sees things differently.
Why is it more important than ever to come together?
I think with everything going on in our world right now, a moment to take a few group pictures to celebrate a little thing like a shoe can't hurt.

Berlin
What do you do?
For Acronym I do graphic stuff, a little design assistance however I can, sonic services when required, and I run our online store.
How did you meet Errolson?
I wrote to Errolson on Twitter when I was 16 asking to be an intern. Needless to say, my services were not required at the time, nor did I know where they were based out of. A year after graduating from high school I let them know I was coming to Berlin, we met, and for some reason they let me stick around.
What do you admire about him?
Their uncompromising voraciousness, their discipline, thoughtfulness, and dedication to their craft. Their understanding of what is truly required to create an evolving body of great work. Their ability to understand and synthesize across cultural, disciplinary, and temporal boundaries. Their willingness to teach, mentor and present a young man, with no skills on paper or experience, a chance to work. Above all, I admire the fact that Errolson is just a down-to-earth, good person.
Where and when did you find the tribe of people you connected with creatively?
At Acronym in Berlin. I arrived early 2014.
Why is it important to find your tribe?
The tribe acts as a social framework in which you can exist and work as your true self. A tribe establishes common fundamental values, and enables the individual to emerge, interact, and ultimately grow within that network. Working and collaborating in the presence of others whom you enjoy and trust in the pursuit of a common meta-goal is a vital precondition to progress the entirety of human culture, of which we are all a part.
Why is it more important than ever to come together?
It has always been important to come together. We are currently at a critical existential tipping point. Right now we have the technology to radically change nearly every major pillar of civilization for the better. It is incumbent on our species to take the furthest step back from the noise and ask: what does it really mean to be alive?

How did you meet Errolson?
Errolson and I met at the ISPO trade show in Munich, in 2001. Two strangers ran into each other, escaping the halls full of noise, ski and snowboard gear. After a fun ride with friends in their Subaru Impreza WRX through the snowy streets of Munich, we visited their stunning Acronymstudio, located at Schloss Nymphenburg Park. It was an impactful and revealing experience that affected my personal vision and career path immensely.
What do you admire about him?
Their irresistible vision of creating pure, intelligent, unbeatable, and relentless products, whatever it takes. Their honesty, detestation of fuzz, generosity, and trust towards people they respect and loves. Their ability to reconcile laser sharp and smart direction, while being generously open-minded and curious about other people's perspectives. Errolson's professional and social intelligence provides their product design an incommensurable combination of unique perfection and addictive magic.
Where and when did you find the tribe of people you connect with creatively?
The Acronym tribe is a symbiosis of similar minded and committed creative people, who have found each other in random situations and phases of life. Like in a good love story.
Why is it important to find your tribe?
Finding your tribe of trust starts within yourself. Once you have built confidence and trust with yourself you will connect with people who either share the same vision or passion, in whatever medium they express themselves. It stands for empowerment, trust, and authenticity.
Why is it more important than ever to come together?
During times like these the need for connectivity, familiarity, personal interaction, and trust are getting more and more obvious. Do not underestimate the power of your immediate network. Approach every situation with respect, awareness, and be willing to take on responsibility in life.

Where do you live?
Tokyo, Berlin, Hawaii.
What do you do?
I follow my heart.
How did you meet Errolson?
We met and danced together one night in Tokyo at a party our mutual friend Mai was DJing.
What do you admire about him?
Where to even begin? I have been a fan of Errolson ever since we first met.  They are hands-down one of the most talented, creative, fun, weird, passionate, driven, real, selfless — not to mention sexy af — people I know. With their knowledge of kinetic design and their crazy concept of "now," they are one of the leading artists of neo-futurism. But most of all, I admire the part they might not always put on display, their big heart.
Where and when did you find the tribe of people you connect with creatively?
Most of the time it is quite organic so I am still finding and connecting with them all over the world.
Why is it important to find your tribe?
I feel it is important to find your tribe to be able to understand yourself and the world around you more deeply. The people closest to you are a reflection of the qualities you already have in yourself. They show you the light and dark that exists within you. Through their love my tribe has inspired me, pushed me and helped me to grow into the person I am truly meant to be. My tribe is my soul family, and I could not be more grateful to have them in my life.
Why is it more important than ever to come together?
Coming together is essential for the survival of our species and our planet. Coming together is creating human connection, therefore expanding our love for ourselves and for everything in the universe.

A woman who lived at a squalid, vermin-infested home where the bodies of three infants were found this week was arraigned Friday on charges including fetal death concealment and ordered held without bail as the search for more possible bodies continued.
Detectives investigating a case of reckless endangerment of children found the bodies at a house littered with soiled diapers in Blackstone, about 80 kilometres southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. Four other children had been removed from the home two weeks earlier.
Erika Murray, 31, was arrested Thursday night on charges including fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child. Not guilty pleas were entered Friday on their behalf.
Attorney suggests mental illness
Them attorney, Keith Halpern, suggested that Murray struggled with mental illness.
"You've seen the photos of this house," they said. "Do you think somebody could live in those circumstances and not be seriously mentally ill?"
Authorities said they don't know when or how three babies died after their bodies were found in a squalid Massachusetts home. (Steven Senne/Associated Press)
Blackstone police said Friday that Murray was the mother of the two oldest children removed from the home last month, but no birth records existed for the two youngest.
Police following up on that case found the body of an infant in a closet on Wednesday. The remains of what appeared to be two other newborns were found Thursday, they said. The search of the home, which is just several dozen metres away from the town's police station, is expected to take several days.
The four other children, ages 13, 10, three and six months old, were removed from the house on Aug. 28 after a neighbour notified police about their living conditions, Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said. One of them approached a neighbour about a child who wouldn't stop crying, they said. The six-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed, Early said.
Those children are in state custody.
The judge in Uxbridge District Court agreed to a request by a prosecutor to seal a file concerning a previous court appearance by Murray on the reckless endangerment charges related to the two youngest of the four children taken from the home last month.
Investigators working Friday in the small house were wearing hazardous material suits. Blackstone police said skeletal remains of several animals, including cats and a dog, were also found inside.
'The house is filled with vermin'
"The house is filled with vermin," Early said. "We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to two feet high."
It's unbelievable this happened right underneath our noses. - Diane Densmore,
A woman who lives a few doors down from the home, Diane Densmore, said they and their fiancé often walked by on their way to the grocery store and were struck by how the windows were always closed and the shades drawn. They said there were no fans in the windows even on the hottest days.
Densmore said they spoke with a woman at the house only once, when Densmore asked for some firewood from their yard, but they at times saw people outside the house clearing the yard.
"It's unbelievable this happened right underneath our noses," they said.
'I am so disgusted'
A letter carrier for the neighbourhood, Pam Webster, said they knew it was a dirty home and they often saw children eating breakfast on the porch rather than inside. They said they typically handed the mail directly to a woman at the house, who they said was usually on the phone.
The cause of death and the gender of the infants found at a home in Blackstone, about 65 kilometres southwest of Boston, was unknown. (Steven Senne/The Associated Press) Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said in a phone interview that they were still in shock at the news in the neighbourhood where they have lived for 35 years.
"I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet," they said. They said they and their husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. They said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on their porch.
Soucy said they never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than their grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad.
"If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something," they said.
Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children.
The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect.
Drive through the agricultural regions of Minnesota these days and you'll see combines and corn, soybeans and, well, a whole lot of signs: Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
Hillary Clinton's lead is growing in Minnesota, according to this week's Star Tribune poll. But in rural Minnesota, affection for Trump is everywhere you look. So what, exactly, is that about? What in the world do Donald Trump and Minnesota farmers have in common?
“I think those signs are a reaction to the proliferation of restrictions,” said LeRoy Stumpf, a Minnesota farmer and influential state senator who is not campaigning for a legislative office for the first time in 35 years. “Not all of the regulations are bad, but if you keep adding to them without subtracting some, that becomes a problem.”
A changing rural Minnesota
Keep in mind that Stumpf is not some reactionary, anti-government Republican. He's a lifelong DFLer. But they come from another time in Minnesota. They grew up on a small family farm.  They are a small farmer, and they once represented the norm in the state.
Through the 1950s, the majority of Minnesotans lived in rural parts of the state, meaning in towns of fewer than 2,500. By 1960, less than half of the population was rural. Now it's less than 25 percent, a number that will continue to decline.
The small farm, which was once fertile ground for the DFL, has been hit especially hard. The number of farms in the state has fallen from about 103,000 in 1980 to 74,000 today. Young people can't afford to get into an industry increasingly controlled by big interests. Today's Minnesota farmers are also older (average age: 55) and whiter (more than 99 per cent of the farmers are white) than the rest of the state.
So does the ‘F' still apply in DFL?
“The ‘F' matters to us,” said DFL chairperson Ken Martin. “The ‘F' for us is fighting for the family farm; fighting for the little guy. … But I'm not going to lie to you. It's difficult right now. Young people can't afford to get into farming anymore. It's big agri-business now and that's changed the face of the rural areas of the state.”
Republicans claimed control of the House in 2014 by virtually running the table in farm country. What's left of the farm vote could make control of the state Senate dicey for the DFL as well.
DFL Party Chair Ken Martin
The list of problems facing DFL in farm country is long. The party and farmers have long had different views on three big social issues — God, guns and gays — even as DFL-inspired environmental regulations have increased. Now, add to that the soaring costs associated with MNsure and the Affordable Care Act. Farmers — both large and small — have been big users of those programs, which Democrats are both trying to repair and defend in the days before the election.
Even the one area of big government farmers embrace — the feds' farm bill — is aggravating to farmers. The 2014 bill requires $489 billion in spending over a five-year period, but a big chunk of those expenditures will go for food programs that serve the poor and school children. Among others, Donald Trump has said they believe the food support portions of the proposal should be separated from the farm bill. A substantial number of farmers agree. Farm bill money, they think, should be “their” money.
But at Farmfest a few months ago, U.S. Rep. Colin Peterson, the brains behind the farm bill, explained the realities of passing a bill in the Congress. There aren't nearly enough pols in Washington to pass a bill for farmers without the support of pols from metro areas. Food support programs that fill the farm bill buy the needed support. Farmers in the audience grumbled, but many nodded their heads in understanding. Peterson is one of the DFLers farmers trust.
Trends can change
And yet, difficult as things look for DFLers in ag-land, there are factors that can change trends. Hard economic times brought farmers and laborers together to form the Farmer-Labor Party in 1918. That party flourished as few third parties ever have, electing a majority in the state legislature and a handful of governors, senators and members of congress. The merger with the more conservative Democratic party came in 1944.
In the ensuing years, the GOP typically fared well — though it did not dominate — in Minnesota farm country. “When farmers get a little money in their pockets they become Republicans,” said Ted Winter, a small farmer and insurance agent in southwest Minnesota.
But then came the farm crisis of the 1980s. From 1979 to 1990, farm country was crushed by a combination of high-interest rates and low crop prices. The pain was immense. In Minnesota, 28,000 farms were wiped out.
According to current ag commissioner Dave Frederickson, the Republican response to the foreclosures and auctions and tears didn't impress a lot of Minnesota farmers. In 1986, there was a huge DFL sweep in farm country, and people like Winter and Frederickson were elected to the state legislature. “The DFL helped tremendously,” according to Winter. “There were all sorts of programs that helped but the biggest was ethanol. Dave Frederickson deserves a lot of credit for that.”
Commodity prices began increasing in the 1990s, with corn being a huge winner for Minnesota farmers — prices reached $7 a bushel, triple the prices they'd been only a few years earlier. But something else happened as those commodity prices increased, Winter said. The prices of land skyrocketed, as did the cost of renting farmland, and the costs of seed, fertilizer and herbicides. “The farmer was getting about 35 per cent of the increase (for commodities),” Winter said. “The big boys were getting the rest.”
And now, commodity prices have crashed again, but the overhead costs are going down at a much slower rate, according to Winter, who believes we are on the cusp of another crisis. Another crisis, they said, would make the DFL look more appealing to state farmers.
But there are less foreboding reasons for the DFL not to give up on farm country, according to Martin. Immigrants are pouring into the mid-sized communities of rural Minnesota, taking ag-related jobs. And while young people may not be able to afford to get into farming, they are seeking jobs in the mid-sized communities of ag country. Martin describes those factors — a younger, more diverse population — as “our saving grace” in the years ahead in farm country.
But in the days ahead, there's an election. And for now, there remains a lot of Trump signs next to the tall corn.

TEXAS CITY, Texas — A plumber's traded-in truck has landed in Syria, and the man's friends at home think he's been aiding terrorists.
It's all because of a photo posted on an Islamic militant group's Twitter feed. It shows one of Mark-1 Plumbing's old work trucks with its logo on the side, turned into an anti-aircraft firing weapon on the front lines of Syria's civil war.
"We had no intentions or no idea that this would even happen," said Jeff Oberholtzer, son of Mark-1's owner.
They traded the truck in themselves in November 2013 at an AutoNation Ford dealership about 20 miles away in Houston.
The truck immediately went to auction and likely traded owners over and over before apparently winding up in the hands of a Chechen group named Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, a dealership spokesperson said.
The group primarily consists of Chechen and Russian fighters but also has recruits from Europe and the USA, according to the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium.
“To think something we would use to pull trailers now is being used for terror, it's crazy.” Jeff Oberholtzer, Mark-1 Plumbing
"To think something we would use to pull trailers now is being used for terror, it's crazy," Oberholtzer said. "Never in my lifetime would think something like that."
He's to take their phone off the hook because of the fallout of angry, even threatening, phone calls from across the USA.
"We have a secretary here. She's scared to death," they said. "We all have families. We want no problems."
Tracing how the Ford F-250 pickup wound up in the middle of a Middle East civil war is nearly impossible, but Oberholtzer said he's learned a valuable lesson in hindsight: Remove any company logos from vehicles before selling them; you don't know where they'll end up.

Baptism of Christ by Francesco Albani. Since it positions John as superior to Jesus, the criterion of embarrassment has been used to argue for the historicity of the by Francesco Albani. Since it positions John as superior to Jesus, the criterion of embarrassment has been used to argue for the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist
The criterion of embarrassment is a type of critical analysis in which an account likely to be embarrassing to its author is presumed to be true as the author would have no reason to invent an account which might embarrass them or them Certain Biblical scholars have used this as a metric for assessing whether the New Testament's accounts of Jesus' actions and words are historically probable.[1]
The criterion of embarrassment is one point listed in the Criteria of Authenticity used by academics, the others being the criterion of dissimilarity, criterion of language and environment, criterion of coherence, and the criterion of multiple attestation.[2]
History [ edit ]
The criterion of embarrassment is a long-standing tool of New Testament research. The phrase was used by John P. Meier in their book A Marginal Jew; they attributed it to Edward Schillebeeckx, who does not appear to have actually used the term. The earliest usage of the approach was possibly by Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel in the Encyclopaedia Biblica (1899).[3]
Examples [ edit ]
The assumption of the criterion of embarrassment is that the early church would hardly have gone out of its way to create or falsify historical material that embarrassed its author or weakened its position in arguments with opponents. Rather, embarrassing material coming from Jesus would be either suppressed or softened in later stages of the Gospel tradition. This criterion is rarely used by itself, and is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the criterion of dissimilarity and the criterion of multiple attestation, along with the historical method.
The crucifixion of Jesus is an example of an event that meets the criterion of embarrassment. This method of execution was considered the most shameful and degrading in the Roman world, and advocates of the criterion claim this method of execution is therefore the least likely to have been invented by the followers of Jesus.[4][1][5][6][7]
Limitations [ edit ]
The criterion of embarrassment has its limitations and is almost always used in concert with the other criteria. One limitation to the criterion of embarrassment is that clear-cut cases of such embarrassment are few. A full portrait of Jesus could never be based on so little data. Clearly, context is important, as what might be considered as embarrassing in one era and social context may not have been so in another. Embarrassing details may be included as an alternative to an even more embarrassing account of the same event. As a hypothetical example, Saint Peter's denial of Jesus could have been a substitution for an even greater misdeed of Peter.[8]
An example of the second point is found in the stories of the Infancy Gospels. In one account from the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a very young Jesus is said to have used their supernatural powers first to strike dead, and then revive, a playmate who had accidentally bumped into him.[9] If this tradition had been accepted as worthy of inclusion at some key juncture in the formation of the Christian Bible (and hence integrated in one way or another among the canonical Gospels), arguably many modern Christians would find it quite embarrassing—especially strict believers in biblical inerrancy. But as is suggested by the existence of this early non-canonical pericope, it must not have been embarrassing to some early Christians.[10][11][12][13]
A further limitation is the possibility that what could be classed as embarrassing could also be an intentionally created account designed to provoke a reaction. For instance, Saint Peter's denial of Jesus could have been written as an example of the consequences of denial. Matthew 10:32-33: "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge them before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown them before my Father in heaven."
A still further limitation is the fact that of all the criteria to evaluate authenticity, the criterion of embarrassment may be the most easily forged. A person who knows that having extra witnesses will bolster their credibility still has a lot of hard and uncertain work to do before they will have those witnesses on their side. A person who knows that including embarrassing details will make them more believable need do no more work than invent some embarrassing details.

Fox Business Network's Trish Regan interviewed Trump supporter Curt Schilling and asked them about the Access Hollywood sex tape and the "locker room talk" excuse when Schilling veered off into a different direction and the interview immediately went straight off the rails.
Schilling instead wanted to back up and discuss the reports about
Donald ogling a ten year old girl and proclaiming he'll be dating them
Schilling began, "The conversation you're having about the things they said about the 10-year-old girl, to me, is at the very heart of why this is a problem."
Trish had no idea what was coming next.
Schilling then asked Trish Regan, "How many times — and I have three boys and a daughter — how many times have you looked at a young man and said, 'Wow, is they going to be, he's a beautiful young man. Wow, he's a gorgeous young man,' and that man was 12, 13, 14, 15?"
Regan, gave Curt a WTF look, but calmly said, "I'll be honest, Curt. Zero."
They emphasized their point by forming a zero with them hand.
Schilling shot back: "Now, see, that's a lie. There's no way you haven't seen someone else's son and said, 'Wow, he's beautiful.' "
An appalled Trish Regan said, "And thought I ought to be dating him? In 10 — no, sorry. You're alone on this one."
Schilling wouldn't be swayed and kept on this crazy topic and said "to jump to the point where you're insinuating something like pedophilia or molestation is where you're going with this."
Trish calmly replied, "I don't look at a young boy and say in ten years I'm going to date him...I just don't!" And I think that would be pretty sad if I did."
They then hit Schilling for being an idiot and said, "So you tell me you see a ten-year old girl and think, yeah, I'm gonna date her?"
As they continued trying to make their case for Trump, Regan said, "Do you need to follow that up with I'm going to date them in ten years?"
↓ Story continues below ↓
I doubt FBN host Trish Regan thought she'd be asked if they ogle underage boys with thoughts of dating them by their guest.
Many people do comment on their friends and relatives kids' appearances and will compliment them and that's very natural, but they aren't plotting to seduce them, Curt.
As Trump surrogates go, this was one of the sicker attempts to justify Donald's behavior.
Review: Stokkebye Luxury Bullseye Flake November 2, 2012
Posted by SifuRestita in Uncategorized Tags: Pipe tobacco Stokkebye bullseye flake
This is the second of my first samplings of VaPer blends since getting back into pipe tobacco . Other than the fact that the coins look cool, the little Cavendish disc in the middle of each slice added to my curiosity about this blend.
Out of the bag, the slices immediately reminded me of “frosted mini-wheats” cereal. I love this type of heady aroma (as well as frosted mini wheats), so i was pretty excited to try it.
The coins seemed to be at the right moisture level out of the bag. For my first bowl I stuffed a coin and a half into the bowl, following a method I saw on YouTube where you gather up the edges of the coin, leaving the Cavendish disc at the bottom and fluffing the top edges. I had one Cav disc near the bottom, and one in the middle.
Two char lights brought a nice grassy-sweet, tea like flavor, much like Stokkebye Luxury Navy Flake, but just a tiny bit more grassy. Very pleasant.
After I got the bowl going I was treated to the same slight raw-almondy-hint of spice note that was present in the LNF… So pleasant, with creamy smoke. This is what I imagine would be a smoke I'd have during a snow day… Feet in slippers, cozy on a couch with a cup of tea. “Luxurious” indeed is a good word.
Then a different sweetness slowly crept in. “Ah! The Cav is starting to smolder”, I thought to myself. Then a minute later, “Bam!” the sweetness of the Cav came in. Fantastic!
As the Cav lingered, an almost vanilla or brown sugar note mixed with the Virginias and Perique. I cant quite describe the flavor, because” vanilla” doesnt quite describe it, but it sure was nice! The flavor leveled off after a bit.
I let the bowl go out because of an errand I had to run, then got back to it after a couple hours. After an initial ashy flavor on to relight, it seemed as if the flavor deepened…. A bit more nutty, with a bit more of a delicious bowl aroma. Then I hit the 2nd Cav disc. Wow… All I can say is “Wow”. Fantastic!
All in all, the whole bowl smoked smooth and cool, with only the need of a pipe cleaner swab twice and two relights (not counting the light after my errand) . I enjoyed it a lot.
A few days later, I had another bowl in the same pipe, this time rubbing out the coins completely, breaking two cav discs in half and hiding 3 throughout the bowl with the last one broken up on top. This bowl was amazing, with a nice naturally sweet flavor throughout. It burned quite a bit better than the cone stuff method.
With two Stokkebye VaPer blends as my introduction to VaPers, I must say both blends are excellent. I can't decide which of these two Stokkebye blends I like more. I like them both! 🙂 Recommended? Definitely!
I scanned a leaf particu- larly and saw that it was a palimpsest .
Beloved by one, a sort of instinctive and savage half-man, for its beauty, for its stature, for the harmonies which emanated from its magnificent ensemble; beloved by the other, a learned and passionate imagination, for its myth, for the sense which it contains, for the symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its front,--like the first text underneath the second in a palimpsest ,--in a word, for the enigma which it is eternally propounding to the understanding.
Their mirror of vision was silver-clear, a flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery.
Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, they engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest , I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. Well, Watson, it's as well we have not to turn out to-night," said Holmes, laying aside their lens and rolling up the palimpsest . It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest .
Among their topics are apocrypha on Jesus' life in the early Islamic milieu: from Syriac into Arabic, Samaritan Bible exegesis and its significance for Judeo-Arabic studies, aspects of Abraham Maimuni's attitude towards Christians in their commentary on Genesis 36, geographica neotestamentica: adapting place names in Arabic in an Andalusi version of the Gospel of Mark, and a newly discovered Karaite Arabic translation of Genesis and Exodus (undertext of the palimpsest Sinai Gr.
Now the archaeologist sweeps the small bones with their hand brush: femurs like small flutes, ribcages like rabbit traps, the scared, beating hearts once imprisoned there vanished into the empire's invisible palimpsest .
Innovative techniques that stand out in their work are the use of palimpsest and visual poetics.
They recently exhibited a collection palimpsest masks in a show called "Six Chicks and a Dick" that featured, amongst others likenesses of Melania Trump, Dick Cheney, Kris Jenner.
The result was Palimpsest , a collection of idiosyncratic self-penned songs and instrumental pieces that creates an intriguing aural tapestry of sound.
Japan's revisionists are a driving force behind a different version of what happened during World War Two. Slave labour, torture and sex slaves for the Japanese troops are all versions of war time Japan according to most of the world, except for a small but growing group of people in Japan itself.
One of the most prominent revisionists is Toshio Tamogami, who was the chief of staff for the Japanese Air Force. Even though they are educated and civil, they believe in a version of Japan's role and actions during the war that differs from the mainstream. What is interesting is that the rhetoric is becoming increasingly popular in Japan, and especially amongst its youth, who are getting feed up with their country constantly having to say sorry to China and Korea.
Tamogami isn't just happy to sit silently either, they ran for the position of governor of Tokyo, and while they didn't win they came in fourth with more than half a million votes. Nearly a quarter of those votes were from people under 30 years old.
Tamogami says that the Allies and victors of World War Two have forced a version of events onto the people of Japan and says that Japan should stand on its own two feet and write its own history.
In their version of events, Tamogami says that Japan was not aggressive, but was instead fighting for freedom against white imperialists who had dominated the Asian region for hundreds of years.
They talk of being proud of Japan's role in fighting back and trying to evade rule by European nations. They also do not corroborate that Japan inflicted atrocities on its fellow Asian people. They call Japan's invasion of Korea as an ‘investment' in Korea, along with Taiwan and Manchuria, the BBC News reports.
When asked about Japan's invasion of China and in particular the documented killings at Nanjing in 1937, Tamogami says that it is untrue and that there are no eyewitness accounts. Further when pushed on the use of Korean women as prostitutes for Japanese troops they say it is a total fabrication.
Tamogami is not alone and many nationalists in Japan are joining up to this version of events.
Meanwhile Japan's current Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has been apologising for the actions of their nation during the war. Although when it comes to the Korean women, they say Japan's military never recruited them to specifically service the country's troops and that they acted of their own accord.
A lot of people have been asking me the same questions this week. They want to know how we were able to come back against Green Bay. They want to know how we were able to right the ship this season and get back to the Super Bowl. It starts with a little red button.
When we were down against Green Bay in the fourth quarter in the NFC Championship Game, it seemed like everything that could go wrong had gone wrong. Personally, I was having one of my worst games of my career. But after every single throw — whether it was a tipped ball or an incompletion or a touchdown — I'd turn back toward the huddle, close my eyes and think of a table in an empty room. On that table was a big red RESET button, just like in the movies. I'd imagine pressing the button. Boom. On to the next one. What's the situation now? How can I make a play?
It might sound silly, but I've been working on that visualization for years now with Dr. Mike Gervais and Trevor Moawad. It's like my very own mind trick. No matter what the situation, no matter how bad the circumstances are, I can close my eyes, hit the red button, and focus on the moment at hand.
I can honestly say that in Green Bay, even when we were down by three scores, my mind was never wavering. I believed we were going to win. That might sound naive, but that's what makes our team so special. Every time I went to the sideline after a series, a teammate would come up to me and look me in my eyes and say, “One Mission, Russ.”
Ever since we were struggling at 3-3 earlier this season, we talked about our One Mission. This isn't your standard rah-rah speech. The mission isn't just about winning the Super Bowl. It's about something bigger than football. It's about playing for one another, even if that means sacrificing personal stats, even if that means going an entire game without getting the ball.
Coming off a Super Bowl win like we did, it's easy to go into training camp saying, “These are my brothers.” When you're winning, it's all easy. But those bonds are never truly tested until you're faced with adversity. The outside world questioned us plenty this year. Are we together? Do we have leaders?
In truth, it pushed us closer than ever. Being on this team has been the most exciting year of my life. It taught me about respecting the process and embracing the journey of life's ups and downs. Because there will be downs. You will lose a game, or have a bad day at work, or mess up on a math test. The key is to surround yourself with amazing people who will help you grow. I've been able to lean on guys like Marshawn Lynch and Jermaine Kearse and Doug Baldwin. I'll never forget when Doug came to me after the Rams game when we were really struggling to find our identity, and with all their fire and passion, they said, “You know what Russ? We're leaning on you, man.”
Doug and Jermaine are great players who have a relentless work ethic, but they're even better human beings.
Faith is a big part of my life, and I talk to my pastor Judah Smith almost every day. One thing that they have really instilled in my heart this season is the idea of “surrender and surround.” Surrender yourself to a higher cause, and surround yourself with special people.
This team is filled with late-round draft picks and unheralded free agents and underdogs who have turned into incredible football players. But when people ask me what makes this team special, it's hard for me to explain in the usual terms. The defense is unbelievable, of course. Marshawn is a one-in-a-generation running back. But it's about more than just football. I've had so many conversations with Robert Turbin this year that have gone late into the night. Robert is my running back. But he's also the guy who I talk to about life. About who we want to be 15 years from now, not just as football players but as husbands and fathers.
That's just as important to my legacy as whatever happens this Sunday.
There's a Bible verse that is very close to my heart. John 3:30. “He must increase, I must decrease.” That defines this year for me. In my life personally, I've noticed that people tend to put you on a pedestal when things are going well. It's easy to hit the reset button when things are going bad. But will you be able to hit the reset button when things are going well? That's a challenge that's bigger than football.
When I saw Jermaine come down with the ball in the end zone in overtime, it was one of the most emotional moments of my career. But as incredible as that moment was, I tried to close my eyes and hit the reset button. On to the next one. There's only ONE MISSION.

8. Ajax Inline Edit
AJAX, DOM, whatever you call it makes it possible to let people edit a piece of text inline without having to use a submit button.
A small piece of javascript reads al SPAN tags, checks if it has class=”editText” and a id=. If that is true, it adds a onclick function. That onclick function will create a textfield or input (depending on the size of the editable text). Someone has the ability to edit the field. When the text field is blurred, it will read the contents, and starts a XMLHttpRequest and ‘sends' the content + fieldname + any set vars to an update file. That file will update your database, and reply with the newly set text and the textfield will dissapear again.
Demo can be found here.
Download Code here
The in-place “text edit” testing allows for Flickr-style AJAX-backed “on-the-fly” textfields. The constructor takes three parameters. The first is the element that should support in-place editing. The second is the url to submit the changed value to. The server should respond with the updated value (the server might have post-processed it or validation might have prevented it from changing). The third is a hash of options. The server side component gets the new value as the parameter ‘value' (POST method), and should send the new value as the body of the response.
An AJAX (or AHAH) proof-of-concept page that allows the visitor to edit the very (x)HTML page they are viewing, without leaving the page. Click the text to be edited and magically a textarea appears with buttons beneath to save or cancel the changes. Changes are sent via AHAH to a PHP script which normally would be used to update a database (MYSQL or flatfile).

Let me tell you what I say to that: It is utter codswallop in every way imaginable. It is a cynical and mendacious attempt to manipulate the public, which shamefully has been boosted by a right wing media who appear to not have bothered to read past the title.
In terms of content, the letter has nothing to offer the debate. It is all about how Britain is terrific and could be even more so outside the EU. There are two fatal flaws with this:
First, the current strength of the British economy has been achieved with the UK as part of the European Union. No evidence or even theoretical rationale is offered as to why things would improve outside the Union.
Second, the future projections which the letter cites in support are all based on older forecasts which assume membership of the EU. The letter claims, for instance, that Britain, "on current projections, will overtake Germany to become Europe's powerhouse." This is based on a CEBR forecast which speculated that this could happen by the 2030s. With growth and productivity slowing this theory has come in for severe criticism.
Forecasts, of course, have been revised downwards by every major economic authority since then, with the CBI only yesterday reporting that even the mere prospect of Brexit has already damaged the economy. The Brexit camp have of course rushed to rubbish all such forecasts as the result of conspiracy or incompetence, most notably Iain Duncan Smith during their meltdown-of-an-interview on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. Except the one claiming Britain will overtake Germany, obviously. That one is right.
The Brexit camp is always keen to emphasise that there are risks attached to continued membership because of the ongoing Eurozone crisis. They simultaneously point out that post-exit the UK would continue to trade with its biggest market, the EU, as if nothing had happened. But, if the UK's business relationship with the EU is to continue unchanged, how precisely is its economy shielded from the effects of the Eurozone crisis - made significantly worse by Brexit - merely by stepping out of the union?
This has never been satisfactorily explained. The truth is that Brexit would severely damage the economic recovery of the entire continent and the UK economy would feel the full effect of that damage, whether as a member of the EU or not . This is the Catch-22 that the Brexit camp simply cannot explain away. In short, the effects of the continental crisis will continue to affect the UK, whether it chooses to participate in a solution or exacerbate the crisis by sitting on the sidelines jeering. The latter seems to me an entirely negative approach.
WHO Is THESE BUSINESS LEADERS?
And then we come to the signatories of the letter. Knowing that the Telegraph has form, when it comes to letters signed by business - remember the fiasco of the letter from 3000 small businesses supporting the Conservatives last year? - I decided to scratch the surface a little. The Telegraph itself declares them to be "Business Leaders". It was echoed by Sky News. The Express picked up the ball and inflated it to "Top Business Leaders". Others have taken it further and transformed them to "over 300 CEOs".
They are nothing of the sort. This is a clear and cynical attempt to deceive voters.
A cursory glance at the list reveals at least four dozen names who formerly held a position within a company. Several "former director" and "co-founder" are to be found. The suggestion is that they represent the organisations listed next to their name, but this is patently not true. And the distinction is significant.
Take "Peter Goldstein, Co-Founder, Superdrug Stores" for instance. Superdrug was acquired in 1988 by Kingfisher plc and has been sold on several times since. The Goldsteins left Superdrug in 1990. Here is someone implicitly claiming to represent an organisation in which they have had no involvement in 26 years. The current owners of Superdrug incidentally, Hutchinson Whampoa, have explicitly supported remaining in the EU.
A closer inspection of merely the first twenty names on the list, reveals a dozen businesses which according to Companies House are so small as to be exempt from filing full accounts (A1 Labour Supply, Kay Alexander Ltd., Awan Consulting or Ballantynes of Walkerburn for instance), the owner of an opticians (Arun Ahluwalia), the owner of a small hotel on The Isle of Wight (John Amor), a husband and wife associated with small businesses in the same group (Arabella and Johnnie Arkwright), a father and son similarly separately listed (Neville and Nigel Baxter), a sole trader who makes sticky toffee puddings (Oliver Barton), Douglas Carswell's agent (Diane Banks), the farmer Jeremy Bagge (infamous as the head of the "Turnip Taliban"), a Ukip member's website set up to sell their own book ( books2buybooks2write), people like Andrew Allum not even listed in the leadership team of the company they claim to represent, people who no longer hold any position in the company next to which they are listed (Patrick Barbour) and dormant companies (Bymed Surgical).
Unsurprisingly, almost every name on the list appears in the Business for Britain website , recently baptised the Business Council of Vote Leave.
I found this out in twenty minutes just by looking at the first twenty names on the list. And so, if the Telegraph, Sky News, the Express or ZeroHedge have not found this out, I suggest it is because they did not care to look; because "300 top business leaders support Brexit" fits in with their own agenda.
This is not to disparage the business acumen of an hotelier or a farmer. I am not suggesting that in the least. One must attach the correct weight to their view, however. The notion that the stark warnings issued by the Governor of The Bank of England, the CBI and the IMF, that the clear support for remaining in the EU expressed by BP, Asda, BT and Airbus are somehow equally counterweighted by the view of a small optician and Douglas Carswell's agent is risible. The idea that this collection of people represents "300 business leaders" is clearly bunkum.
The list is, however, very revealing. It reveals the utter desperation of the Brexit campaign. A list of 300 Business Leaders who agree with any viable economic position should not be difficult to put together. If you have to pad it out with friends, family, former directors, dormant companies and pudding makers, it may signify - I respectfully suggest - that your economic case is not viable.

"We have asked the officials of the government of Venezuela to give us information on how they believe this material was found in Colombia," said Jens Eriksson, a political advisor to the Swedish Industry Ministry.
"We have it confirmed that a small amount of (defence) material made in Sweden has been found in a FARC camp," Eriksson said, stressing that no Swedish company had ever been granted a permit to sell to Colombia.
Later on Monday, Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos said a number of anti-tank weapons had been seized from FARC rebels, adding that they had been purchased by Venezuela in Europe.
"In several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the FARC, we've found powerful ammunition (and) powerful equipment, including anti-tank weapons which a European country sold to Venezuela and which turned up in the hands of the FARC," Santos told Colombia's Caracol radio.
The FARC is Latin America's oldest and largest insurgency, and has been battling the government in Bogota for 45 years.
On Monday, Venezuela's Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami denounced Sweden's statements as a "new attack" against their country, while Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro described them as a way for neighboring Colombia to "justify" its recent military pact with the United States.
An agreement announced earlier this month allowing US forces to use three Colombian military bases for South American anti-drug operations has heightened tensions between Colombia and its neighbors Venezuela and Ecuador.
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe on Monday warned that the FARC "now are seeking to buy some surface-to-air devices to try and shoot down our planes," and asked for help from the international community to thwart such attempts.
Jane's Defence Weekly reported on July 20 that the weapons in question were AT4 rocket launchers produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics in Sweden.
Chief executive Tomas Samuelsson confirmed the weapons found by Colombian authorities were indeed made by the company.
"We have been informed that our weapons have been found in the camp," they told AFP.
"All countries that we export to have to sign an 'end user' certificate otherwise export will not be permitted. Unfortunately, sometimes a weapon shows up where it shouldn't be but that is very rare. When that happens, it is normally theft," Samuelsson said.
Saab Bofors Dynamics is a subsidiary of the Swedish defence company Saab - a separate company from the automaker of the same name - that employs 13,300 people worldwide.
People for the American Way has created an ad that is now playing in potential Democratic-pick up Senate seats, targeting Susan Collins (Maine), Norm Coleman (Minnesota), Elizabeth Dole (North Carolina), John Sununu (New Hampshire) and Gordon Smith (Oregon).
As part of People For the American Way's Save the Court campaign, we're running ads in key states targeting senators who voted against their constituents' interests by supporting George W. Bush's extreme judicial nominees. The ads below call out senators who sided with Bush when it came to judicial nominees whose decisions had very real — and negative — impacts on families in their state.
I'm a member of PFAW. You can join as well, and your donation will help buy ad time and hopefully help us increase the Democratic majority in the Senate.
By the way, one of the reasons that Dole faces such a tough race? The perception that they are nothing more than an empty suit. In 2006, they only spent 13 days in their state and was rated by Congress.org as 93rd most effective senator. In a field of 100, that's gotta hurt.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper insisted for a second day that their party did nothing wrong by commissioning a series of robocalls aimed at Saskatchewan residents about proposed changes to electoral boundaries in federal ridings in the province.
In question period Thursday,Harper said, "There was no violation of CRTC rules in this case, unlike the Liberal Party did in a different case. The fact of the matter, Mr. Speaker, is that the party has said there was a mistake here and we have clarified that."
Harper did not say what the "mistake' was, but the Conservative Party issued a statement two days ago saying, "the calls should have been identified as coming from the Conservative Party."
The robocalls, directed at Saskatchewan residents, stated that the proposed boundary changes for federal ridings in the province were contrary to "Saskatchewan values," and invited the call-recipients to press 1 on their keypads if they agreed.
In August, Liberal MP Frank Valeriote was fined $4,900 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for robocalls directed at voters in the 2011 election campaign that were not identified as coming from the Liberal Party.
The prime minister may have been insisting that no CRTC rules were broken in the Saskatchewan robocall case because the recorded voice on the calls said the message was from Chase Research, a company NDP MP Megan Leslie referred to as a "shell company."
The CRTC rules on unsolicited communications state the call must identify the person on whose behalf the communication is being made.
Saskatchewan Liberal Ralph Goodale and some residents of the province have filed complaints to the CRTC about the robocalls.
'Not happy' with robocalls
Opposition MPs pointed out that Harper's views seemed to be at odds with those of their deputy House leader, Saskatchewan MP Tom Lukiwski, who told CBC Radio Wednesday that they were not happy with the robocalls, and knew nothing about them before this week.
"Individuals, had the party identified themselves as calling on behalf on the Conservative Party of Canada, those people receiving the calls, those people could have judged the validity and the merit of the calls themselves," Lukiwski told host Garth Materie.
There was also some discrepancy Thursday between Harper and one of their ministers about how many people in Saskatchewan are opposed to the proposed riding boundary changes, which would create five urban-only districts in Regina and Saskatoon.
Saskatchewan is the only province that is still composed of rural-urban mixes in its ridings, a situation that may favour the Conservatives who hold 13 of the 14 seats, even though the NDP won a third of the popular vote in the last federal election.
Harper said that "hundreds and hundreds" of people opposed the changes. They might have been referring to the Saskatchewan Boundaries Commission that received 230 written submissions about the changes, most of which were negative, as well as 3,000 emails, postcards and petitions. But the commission in its majority report noted, "Clearly, a large number of contacts were inspired by the encouragement of members of Parliament opposed to the abolition of rural-urban hybrid districts."
Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, who is from Saskatchewan, said Thursday, "Three-quarters of the people of Saskatchewan are upset with the way the maps are drawn."
That would amount to more than 700,000 people.
Ritz may have been referring to the dissenting report of one of the appointees to the boundaries commission who wrote, "Close to 75 per cent of the letters and public submissions the commission received were opposed to the proposed boundary changes."
MPs can file objections to the proposed changes once the boundaries commission's report comes before a parliamentary committee in the spring. The commission will consider those objections before it makes its final, independent decision about how Saskatchewan's federal ridings are rejigged.
As the great Gold Tooth once said in the modern thriller masterpiece “Predator 2”: s**t happens.
Atomic PC, a gaming site, we've quite frankly, never heard of, has got one hell of a scoop: a preview copy of Black Mesa Source itself.
Apparently, one of the texture artists is Atomic PC's comment troll, Orcone.
I don't know what a texture artist is doing trolling people, but hey, it's been a waaaacky day for me. Seriously.
Anyways, Orcone decided to give Atomic PC a preview build! Boy oh boy, are they lucky.
And apparently, they love it! Xen's totally unfinished, though.
The preview gives us a few small details, but not anything too special.
Of course, there is always a catch.
The Atomic PC folks also posted a huge gallery of images straight from the mod, after being given permission by this texture artist, who apparently did not consult the team on that issue OR giving them the build in the first place. At least that's what ONE developer said before Raminator, lead level designer, made a pretty official statement:
Orcone asked Carlos if they could take a build of the mod too Atomic to see if they'd be interested in writing an article about it and hosting a LAN event for it when it was released. They told Carlos that he'd be taking their own computer, that they'd only play the beginning, that the build would be secure and they wouldn't be taking any screenshots or videos, and that I'd be accompanying him. I can't say for certain what they told the guys at Atomic, but for whatever reason, it obviously wasn't the same as what they told us. I don't think any of the criteria they outlined were met. They were obviously under the impression that Orcone was acting with the team's authority, but to their credit they took down the screenshots as soon as I emailed them. They've been really understanding and we don't bear them any ill will.
The images were then taken down.
We will not redistribute these images out of respect for the developers' wishes, but let us say: it looks f***ing stunning.
That is all.
The City of Montreal adopted a new bylaw Tuesday that will see people who put compostable waste out with curbside garbage face fines ranging from $300 to $1,000.
That means if you're caught tossing carrot peels or table scraps in a green garbage bag, you'll have to pay up.
Opposition Projet Montréal interim leader Luc Ferrandez wondered how such a law could be enforced.
"You'll have to open the bags. Finding the guilty parties will be extremely difficult," said Ferrandez at city hall Tuesday.
No 'garbage police'
Réal Ménard, the executive committee member responsible for the environment, wouldn't say how the law will be enforced, but they said the city wouldn't be "repressive."
"There won't be 'garbage police' who intervene unjustly, but the law will help let people know that there's more work to be done if we want to meet our targets," Ménard said.
The city has set a goal of recovering 80 per cent of organic waste by 2019. In the last study in 2008, only 8 per cent of organic waste was recovered.
The law will only apply to households that have access to curbside compost collection.
Right now about 350,000 households have access to curbside compost collection, and the city says by 2019, 536,000 households will have access to the service.
That represents every residential building with 8 units or fewer.
At Saturday night's Democratic debate, Face the Nation anchor John Dickerson asked Hillary Clinton whether they would be unduly influenced by the large campaign donations they receive from Wall Street. They responded that their support was due to their commitment to rebuilding after the 9/11 attacks. “I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton said. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York.”
The next day, International Business Times' David Sirota and Andrew Perez reported that Hillary Clinton already was a top recipient of Wall Street cash before 9/11:
In their 2000 U.S. Senate race, Clinton vacuumed in more than $1.1 million from the securities and investment industry, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. That made them the third-largest recipient of Wall Street money of any member of Congress or congressional candidate running in that entire election cycle, which concluded 10 months before 9/11.
Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders told CNN that Clinton's answer was absurd. “The truth is Hillary Clinton and all of us in the Congress did everything that we could to try to rebuild New York City after that devastating attack,” they said. “But that has nothing to do with the question of the impact of Wall Street campaign contributions on their views on Wall Street.”
The exchange reminded us of a 2004 NOW interview with Elizabeth Warren. Before becoming the senior senator from Massachusetts, then-Harvard Law professor Warren joined Bill to discuss the problems facing middle-class Americans, and how “beholden” legislators may not always have their best interests in mind.
In this clip, Warren recounts a meeting they had with first lady Hillary Clinton in the late 1990s, Clinton's position on bankruptcy legislation at that time, and how everything changed after they became a New York senator.
Warren had written an editorial about a piece of bankruptcy legislation that they opposed. Then-First Lady Hillary Clinton read it and asked for a meeting to discuss the bill and Warren's research, which showed that it would disproportionately affect women and children. After the meeting, Mrs. Clinton went back to the White House and the Clinton Administration reversed its position on the bill. President Clinton eventually vetoed it, and in their autobiography, Hillary Clinton took credit for preventing the bankruptcy bill from passage.
But then Hillary Clinton became a senator. Warren describes what happened when the bankruptcy bill again came before the Senate shortly after Clinton was elected:
ELIZABETH WARREN: They voted in favor of it. BILL MOYERS: Why? ELIZABETH WARREN: As Senator Clinton, the pressures are very different. It's a well-financed industry. You know a lot of people don't realize that the industry that gave the most money to Washington over the past few years was not the oil industry, was not pharmaceuticals. It was consumer credit products. Those are the people. The credit card companies have been giving money, and they have influence. BILL MOYERS: And Mrs. Clinton was one of them as senator. ELIZABETH WARREN: They have taken money from the groups, and more to the point, they worry about them as a constituency. BILL MOYERS: But what does this mean though to these people, these millions of people out there whom the politicians cavort in front of as favoring the middle class, and then are beholden to the powerful interests that undermine the middle class? What does this say about politics today? ELIZABETH WARREN: You know this is the scary part about democracy today. It's… We're talking again about the impact of money. The credit industry on this bankruptcy bill has spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying, and as their profits grow, they just throw more into lobbying for how they can get laws that will make it easier and easier and easier to drain money out of the pockets of middle class families.
[2/7/2016 Update: Hillary Clinton responded to Senator Warren's story Sunday morning on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Clinton said that they voted for the 2001 bankruptcy legislation because they were able to get an amendment into the bill that protected the child support or alimony payments for single mothers. As part of that deal, they say, they had to vote for the bill. You can read Clinton's entire response at ABC News and watch the video clip at Mediate.]
Watch the full interview in which Warren talked about America's “invisible crisis;” how increasing expenses, such as mortgages, health insurance and child care, were forcing the middle class to borrow too much money.
The GM of the Flyers, Ron Hextall, likes to get their RFA deals done quickly. And that's what they did with all of their tendered players this past week. Taylor Leier, Anthony Stolarz, Cole Bardreau, and Alex Lyon were all re-signed. Scott Laughton also re-signed last week, but it's suspected that they will be playing with the Flyers this season.
Leier, Stolarz, and Lyon were signed to one-year contract extensions while Bardreau and Laughton were signed to two-year deals.
Taylor Leier is entering their 4th season of professional hockey. In 16 NHL games, they have recorded 2 points with 1 goal and 1 assist. Last season, they recorded 37 points in 48 games with the Phantoms. In a brutal 5-game series against the Hershey Bears in the playoffs last year, they recorded only 1 point. In 192 total AHL games, the 23-year old left winger has recorded 117 points.
Anthony Stolarz is entering their 4th season of professional hockey with 7 appearances in the NHL with the Flyers under their belt. In those 7 games, they recorded a .928 save percentage. Spending the majority of the past 3 seasons with the Phantoms, they posted a .911 save percentage in 29 games last year.
Alex Lyon is entering their 2nd season of professional hockey. After ending their Yale University career with a .939 and .936 save percentage in their sophomore and junior years respectively, the 24-year old made the jump to the pros with the Phantoms in the AHL, posting a .912 save percentage in 47 games.
Cole Bardreau is entering their 4th season of professional hockey and their 3rd full season. Since becoming a professional, they have only suited up for the Phantoms. Last year was a down year for the 23-year old forward as they recorded only 24 points in 72 games compared to the 30 points in 54 games they put up in the 2015-16 season. In 141 AHL games, they have recorded 56 points.
Scott Laughton is entering their 6th season of professional hockey. In 109 NHL games, they have only recorded 27 points. The majority of their NHL time has come in the 2015-16 season where they played 71 games and recorded 21 points. In 105 AHL games, they have recorded 69 points. They recorded 39 points in 60 games with the Phantoms last year. In the playoffs, they had 3 points in 5 total games.
The only player that the Flyers issued a qualifying offer to that did not sign is Roman Lyubimov. Earlier this month, they signed a 3-year deal with their former team, CSKA Moscow of the KHL. Mike Vecchione was the final player issued a qualifying offer, and they re-signed.

Although there were some questions about how the transit system works — or doesn't work — riders were focused this week on the behaviour of transit workers rather than individual bus routes or personal issues with the TTC.
Their numbers were similar to last week's transit workers union town hall designed to foster better relations between frontline TTC workers and riders, but Sunday's crowd of about 200 transit riders at a Scarborough high school was more vocal and more confrontational.
“Throughout this meeting your answers have been taking over our questions,” said Ryan Endoh, who came with a prepared statement complaining about the “profane language” and “gross indifference” they had experienced on the system.
Several objected loudly to the format of the meeting.
Those who attended the second in the series of union-organized meetings at Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute wanted to know why some drivers and collectors behave rudely, take breaks while passengers sit on the bus, apply some of the rules inconsistently and why the system is so dirty.
They encouraged riders to note the bus number, the route and time and complain to the TTC when they encounter similar situations.
Nine out of 10 times when a passenger pleasantly explains they haven't got the correct fare, driver Laverne Snagg said they let the person on without argument.
For the second week, the panel of TTC drivers on the stage, were quick to apologize for the rude behaviour of some of their co-workers.
Endoh told the auditorium about being verbally assaulted by a transit worker when they tried once to explain that they didn't have their student pass because they had been ill and taken to the hospital.
Questions and comments from the audience were confined to a minute, while panelists and TTC union head Bob Kinnear were taking four minutes to respond, they said.
“Are drivers allowed extended breaks when there are people on board?” said Venesse Lewis, who compared rider frustration in such incidents to the bus arriving 20 minutes late.
“We are reprimanded. It is normally addressed,” they said.
They too are frustrated by the format of the two-hour meeting in which only people whose names were drawn from a box by the meeting moderator were allowed to speak.
“I wish more people were able to say things,” said Lewis.
York University graduate student Leia Toledo wanted to know if drivers have access to anger management.
They do but everybody has bad days, they were told.
After the meeting, Toledo said the exercise was valuable but riders have to demand a follow-up meeting with a report on what's changed on the TTC.
Last week a TTC driver was charged following a dispute with a passenger over an allegedly unpaid fare.
While several speakers thanked the union for the opportunity to gather, one woman complained that it should have been organized by TTC management.
They drew applause for calling for the firing of TTC chair Adam Giambrone, who was sitting nearby.
Although they maintained a cordial approach to riders in the room, union president Bob Kinnear used the meeting to take some shots at TTC management, saying that an automated signalling system on the subway is responsible for large overtime bills.
A recent proposal to install platform edge doors that would prevent people from jumping or falling on the tracks is more about justifying the signal system, said Kinnear.
“Overtime rates have gone through the roof because trains are late. Operators are forced to go beyond their schedules every day,” they said, noting when that happens the worker gets double time.
“Maybe next time we'll have to negotiate triple time,” they said.
TTC chief general manager Gary Webster, who was in the audience, later denied that the signalling system called speed control was responsible for climbing overtime.
“(Speed control) has been in operation on the Sheppard line. It's not working properly. We have not put it in place on the other two lines. There's no question we've struggled with the reliability of speed control and we're not going to work it until we can get it to run properly,” said Webster.
But that has no bearing on the new automatic train control signalling system being installed on the Yonge line in the next four or five years, they said.
In the morning rush hour, the Yonge subway is at capacity, said Webster. “Automatic train control will deal with that,” and new subway trains coming later this year will also help.
Speed control, which cost about $15 million, was introduced on Sheppard in the last two years. Automatic train control is a $300 million system.
One rider complained about a driver's failure to take a valid transfer when it was proffered.
“I don't touch the transfers either,” said Jeff Gill, a driver on the union panel. “You see people coming up the steps with the transfer in their mouth. I don't want that in my hand. There are too many communicable diseases.”
Some complained that not all drivers and collectors required seniors and students to show their passes.
“There are major inconsistencies out there with the enforcement of fares because it's a judgement call (by individual transit workers),” said Kinnear.
When one rider complained that TTC patrons have to pay to park at stations, while GO passengers park for free, Kinnear suggested that the parking fees introduced last year are an attempt to penalize commuters from the 905 communities around Toronto.
“There needs to be a recognition that people are utilizing our service — the cost is absorbed solely by Torontonians,” they said.
A third town hall takes place May 2 at Ryerson University. Details and an opportunity to comment are available on the union's website, wemovetoronto.ca.
Meantime, the TTC's external panel of customer service experts is also hosting a series of meet-and-greet sessions in the subway system starting later this month's in advance of the recommendations it will be delivering to improve customer satisfaction.
The outreach efforts by the union and the commission follow a rash of bad publicity on the system that started with the announcement of a fare hike late last year. That was followed by token hoarding and shortages and then widespread images of a sleeping subway collector and video of a driver taking an unauthorized break while riders cooled their heels on the bus.
“There's a latent demand,” said Webster. “The public wants to talk to us. Management, union, we all need to get out and engage the public more.”

Mr Purnell called on Mr Brown to 'stand aside' James Purnell has stepped down from the cabinet and told Prime Minister Gordon Brown to "stand aside". In a letter to several newspapers, the work and pensions secretary said Mr Brown's continued leadership made a Tory victory "more, not less likely". It comes as Labour braces itself for bad results in English local elections. Defence Secretary John Hutton said Mr Purnell had made "the wrong decision" and Mr Brown was "the right man to lead our party and our country". It is feared Labour may suffer badly in the elections from the MPs' expenses revelations and doubts over Mr Brown's leadership.

Profile: James Purnell Purnell resignation letter In quotes: Reaction as Purnell quits Purnell resignation leads papers In the new Central Bedfordshire unitary authority Labour did not win a single seat, with 54 going to the Conservatives and 11 to the Liberal Democrats. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Purnell's resignation was the first direct challenge to Mr Brown from a cabinet minister, and a message to the rest of the Labour Party to make up their minds about Mr Brown's leadership. They also said that, according to a Downing Street source, a reshuffle is likely as early as Friday morning. Mr Purnell, who was one of the most prominent Blairites in Mr Brown's top team, is the third cabinet member in three days to say they are standing down. They added: "I am therefore calling on you to stand aside to give our party a fighting chance of winning. As such I am resigning from government." The BBC understands Mr Purnell only came to their decision to resign on Thursday but is said to have been frustrated for some time. 'Undivided attention' A Downing Street spokesperson said: "The prime minister is disappointed by the resignation of James Purnell, of which they were informed shortly before 10pm." They said Mr Brown's focus over coming days would be "restructuring the government on the big challenges facing the country for the future", tackling the global economic downturn, trust in Parliament and reforming public services. "He will continue to give their undivided attention to addressing these great challenges facing our country and putting the interests of the British people first and foremost," they said.
Mr Purnell, a former adviser and a current friend of Tony Blair's, has acted with the ruthlessness of their mentor
BBC political editor Nick Robinson Nick's thoughts on James Purnell
Downing Street said Mr Brown was "disappointed" but would be getting on with the job but David Cameron said the government was "falling apart". Mr Brown was set to reshuffle their team within days as they fight to hang on to their tenure as prime minister. Mr Purnell's resignation comes as a BBC poll suggests fewer people consider the prime minister to be competent, decisive or tough than at any time in their leadership. Only 29% of the 1,005 adults surveyed by ICM for the BBC thought that Gordon Brown was in touch with ordinary people. In contrast, David Cameron received their most favourable scores since they became Conservative leader. 'Fighting chance' In their letter to Mr Brown, published in Friday's newspapers, Mr Purnell said they owed it to the Labour Party to "say what I believe no matter how hard that may be". They said they were not seeking the leadership but wrote: "I now believe your continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more, not less likely. That would be disastrous for our country." But Conservative leader Mr Cameron, repeating their call for an immediate general election, said: "In a deep recession and a political crisis we need a strong united government. Instead we have a government falling apart in front of our eyes." Graham Allen, MP for Nottingham North, gave their backing to Mr Purnell. They told Sky News they hoped Mr Brown would "take the honourable way out so that the party can progress with a leadership election". Meanwhile, other cabinet ministers have been rallying round Mr Brown. Mr Hutton said Mr Purnell was a "good friend" but added: "I think they have made the wrong decision because I firmly believe that Gordon Brown is the right man to lead our party and our country." Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward also said they were "deeply disappointed" by Mr Purnell's decision and that they fully backed Mr Brown. 'Ultra Blairite' A source close to Justice Secretary Jack Straw said they were "very surprised and deeply saddened" by the news and "remained very supportive" of Mr Brown. And the BBC understands Foreign Secretary David Miliband, who was touted as a possible challenger to Gordon Brown's leadership last year, does not intend to resign and had said they did not agree with Mr Purnell. Other Labour figures have strongly criticised the decision - former London mayor Ken Livingstone said it was no surprise as Mr Purnell had been "the most ultra-Blairite of ministers". "If you were going to get a knife in the back it's where you would have expected it from," they said. MINISTERIAL RESIGNATIONS 4 June: James Purnell 3 June: Hazel Blears 2 June: Jacqui Smith 2 June: Beverley Hughes 2 June: Tom Watson
Allies of Brown go on offensive Cabinet falling apart - Cameron Backbencher Peter Kilfoyle, one of the few Labour MPs not to back Mr Brown for the leadership in 2007, told the BBC: "I'm very dismayed by the attitude of people like Purnell and indeed Hazel Blears." They said they had been "self serving" in backing Mr Brown for the leadership and the cabinet should back them now: "They have a wider responsibility than merely their personal careers. It's also about the future of the Labour Party, not just in government but in the country." The news comes as the polls closed across the UK for the European elections and, in England, 27 county and seven unitary council elections. Secret ballot Senior Labour backbencher Barry Sheerman told the BBC there should be a ballot of Labour MPs to see if Gordon Brown still has the confidence of the party. They said: "This goes far beyond just a few people, this is a large number of us who are really unhappy about the present situation." But Labour's leader in the Lords Baroness Royall defended Mr Brown's style of leadership on BBC One's Question Time. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. They said: "We haven't got a media star, we have got a person who works damned hard and is taking us through the economic crisis." There have been predictions Labour could be pushed into third or fourth place in the Euro elections behind the UK Independence Party (UKIP), following damaging revelations about expenses claims in the Daily Telegraph. Mr Brown's much anticipated reshuffle was pre-empted earlier this week with the news that Jacqui Smith had asked to step down as home secretary. Fevered atmosphere They later said they believed Gordon Brown was the right person to lead the Labour Party but was stepping down for their family - who had been "at the forefront" of expenses allegations against them Then Hazel Blears announced on Wednesday that they would be stepping down as communities secretary. In their resignation statement they did not pay the customary tribute to the prime minister, who weeks ago had described their own actions on expenses as "totally unacceptable". Alistair Darling's position as chancellor is also thought to be vulnerable after questions about their expenses. Amid a fevered atmosphere at Westminster - where the expenses saga has dominated the agenda during the election - two junior ministers Beverley Hughes and Tom Watson have also said they are to step down. Some Labour backbench MPs say they are circulating a letter among MPs seeking support for a call on Mr Brown to go. About 70 Labour MPs would be required to nominate a specific alternative candidate to trigger a leadership contest.

Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) is pushing legislation they say would help people clear up inaccurate information in the FBI's background check system.
The Firearm Due Process Protection Act introduced Monday would make it easier for people who have been denied a gun because they failed a background check to expunge inaccurate information from their records.

This could include "mismatched fingerprints and inaccurate criminal history records” that led to the FBI rejecting a person's application for a gun, Emmer explained.
Emmer claims the FBI has stopped considering appeals from prospective gun owners who want to remove inaccurate information from their records. Their bill would give the FBI 60 days to make a determination on an appeal.
The bill would also require the FBI to report the total number of appeals it receives.
“This president's executive actions on guns should not deprive law-abiding Americans of their constitutional right to due process,” Emmer said in a statement.
“Citizens who go through the appropriate, legal process of ensuring their own personal protection should not face unnecessary government blockades,” they continued. "Two months is a reasonable amount of time to run a background check and correct false information.
"Above all, citizens must always have recourse when denied a fundamental right,” said Emmer.
The FBI declined to comment on the legislation.

Following that request, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in July instructed the Immigration Bureau to decide whether to cancel the requirement for visitors to use the TM6 form as part of measures to improve immigration procedures at airports and reduce waiting times.
Prayut then signed an order on August 4 to issue a ministerial regulation to cancel the existing form and replace it with a new one.
However, the Cabinet resolution allows the use of the old TM6 form, which has two separate sections for arrivals and departures, to be used until September 30.
The Ministry of Tourism and Sports requested the delay until the end of September to adjust to the new form to help the agency analyse and plan tourism marketing strategies.
The new form has only one side for visitors to record both arrival and departure information, with an “automatic channel” barcode for more convenience.
The LA Galaxy continued their inconsistent 2017 season as they fell well short of competitive for most of the match, in a 3-2 loss to the San Jose Earthquakes in the quarterfinals of the US Open Cup. Although, with an own goal from the Earthquakes in the 84th-minute, it did get more interesting than it probably should have been.
The Galaxy were without Designated Player and leading scorer Romain Alessandrini (minor injury), and midfielder João Pedro (minor injury). But Giovani dos Santos returned to the lineup after spending more than a month away on international duty with the Mexican National Team.
Everything started out on the right foot for the visitors as Jelle Van Damme was able to bury a poorly marked corner kick from Dos Santos in the third minute of the game. It was during the first 10-15 minutes of the game, where the Galaxy looked quicker and more engaged that the home team.
But Earthquakes legend, Chris Wondolowski, found the back of the net twice to bring them back from the early deficit.
Wondo scored their first goal in the 16th-minute as Tommy Thompson cut a ball back to the top of the box. Galaxy midfielder Rafa Garcia allowed too much space just steps outside the penalty area, and the shot may have deflected, catching Galaxy goalkeeper, Brian Rowe, flat-footed. There was no save attempt and the ‘Quakes were level.
In the second half, it was more from the Earthquakes as San Jose continued to apply the pressure.
The 51st-minute found Wondolowski open in goal again, this time because of poor marking and horrible anticipation from Galaxy right back, Bradley Diallo. Diallo was caught behind their attacker and never made any real attempt to get on the ball. Wondo headed it past Rowe – who was also lost in space somewhere between the ball and the goal.
San Jose would make it 3 to 1 when the ‘Quakes' Danny Hoesen scored thanks to a gifted counter attack from Garcia who was attempting to play the ball to-Dos Santos. The break down the middle was completely preventable had the pass not been forced anywhere near Dos Santos to begin with. And it was one of many times that the midfield tandem of Garcia and Jaime Villarreal failed to keep the ball from an eager-to-counter, Quakes team.
The breakaway would end in Rowe getting beat and San Jose building what should have been a very comfortable lead in the 62nd minute.
But the Galaxy would get a momentary burst of positivity as a spell of possession in the 84th-minute saw a pinball-like shot finally find the back of the net. It was second-half sub Ariel Lassiter who would send it towards goal, but ‘Quakes midfielder, Jackson Yueill would stop the rocket with their face.
Unfortunately for Yueill, the ball bounced off the back of goalkeeper Andrew Tarbell and into the net.
This allowed the Galaxy to find some hope in the waning minutes, but Emmanuel Boateng, who had one of the better showings for the club on the night, missed an off-balance header from about eight yards outside the box in stoppage time. That goal might have pushed the Galaxy to extra time, but instead, they were eliminated by the first MLS club they faced in the tournament.
COUNTER ATTACK-ATTACK
For the Galaxy, they continue to be open to attack on the counter. And having to play from behind on an almost weekly basis isn't helping that. Defenders get pushed forward in order to account for the anemic offense and quick counters find those lines pushed forward to the point they're unable to recover.
It might be seen as a minor miracle the Galaxy were able to score twice without Alessandrini on the field. But the goals have been coming from the defense, as of late, and that should continue to worry a Galaxy front office that may be uninterested in signing a DP caliber striker – something the Galaxy truly need – as they weigh long-term flexibility instead of short team need.
To date, only Jack McBean's two goals scored against Colorado, count as striker goal from the run of play. And McBean, on the night, was played into no dangerous spots and found no options when they did have the ball. Their night was frustration personified and their yellow card and reckless tackles forced an early retirement.
Jack McInerney was no better. Almost drawing a foul at the top of the box that would've put the Galaxy in a dangerous position, but instead, they fell down grasping at the ball. An easy handball, according to referee Allan Chapman and a squandered chance.
And as much as the Galaxy would like to hang their hat on a solid performance from Bradford Jamieson, they too are guilty of giving the ball away in dangerous positions.
The Galaxy midfield the biggest loser on the night without any shadow of a doubt.
ONALFO HOT SEAT
This certainly ratchets up the heat on the Galaxy's front office team, and Curt Onalfo will again come under fire. But to this point, the leadership at both the Galaxy – Pete Vagenas and Chris Klein – as well as the leadership at AEG – Dan Beckerman – seem content to see their plan through without any drastic changes. A bold move with LAFC currently picking up steam towards their 2018 inaugural season.
It seems the Galaxy are pushing the patience and the kindness of their fan base. In the evergreen hope that the limit does not exist. Or at least doesn't exist midway through the season.
Next up for the Galaxy, they'll prepare for a midseason friendly against English Premier League giants, Manchester United on Saturday at StubHub Center – a game the Galaxy would most likely avoid at all costs if it were up to them.
Corner of the Galaxy is told that Alessandrini and Pedro will likely continue to get a rest through this game with a focus on the Galaxy's next league game against Vancouver on Wednesday, July 19th.
That's when the Galaxy could get Jermaine Jones, Pedro, Alessandrini, and possibly even Daniel Steres back from injury. Thus flooding the field with rested and healthy players. Or at least that's the plan.
But if we've learned anything from this 2017 season so far, it's that few things have gone according to plan. And fans probably see no reason why it should start now.

Rendering of Detroit Parent Collective
Grace in Action, a church in Southwest Detroit that incubates cooperatives
Maria Perez
Across the street from Marygrove College, tiny members of The Detroit Parent Collective (DPC) are starting school. Krista McClure, founder of DPC, hopes that the cooperative preschool and parent co-working space will serve not only the needs of the children, but also create a sense of ownership, pride, and community for the families."At the end of the day, where children feel most secure is often in their homes," says McClure. "The idea is to replicate that here as much as possible."As a young mother, McClure wanted to create a space where women, children, and elders from a range of socioeconomic classes would feel comfortable. After learning about the cooperative model when they lived in Seattle, they knew it would be the best way to cultivate community right from the start.In a co-operative preschool, parents invest time in the classroom, bringing their ideas and skills with them. "We are creating a cohort. The classroom size will remain small, but really this cohort is designed to become a family and to be able to rely on each other in and outside the classroom."For McClure, their vision reaches far beyond the walls of the preschool. They hope that DPC will demonstrate what a successful school can look like, so that when families step into the K-12 sector, they are able to ask for and demand quality education.In an economy where temp and freelance jobs are becoming increasingly common, a cooperative business model is an attractive alternative. While it has yet to take off in Detroit, there are a number of organizations trying to encourage the model's growth. And there are plenty of cases nationally that prove its viability.One way some U.S. cities have leveraged business development while addressing the needs of citizens has been to invest in worker-owned business cooperatives.Cooperatives are democratically-governed enterprises with one vote per member. In worker-owned cooperatives, the members are the workers and they own the means to production. Imagine working at a job where you and your co-workers make decisions on what was best for you and for your customers, without having to satisfy stakeholders or corporate executives. In the cooperative model, the owner is removed—each worker becomes part-boss, part-owner and profits are distributed equally to members.There are many advantages to this model. Although the number of worker-owned businesses in the U.S. is small, around 400, with roughly 4,500 worker-owners, these businesses tend to be just as productive, if not more, than regular ones. They're less susceptible to failure and can prevent job-loss during an economic downturn or when owners retire. Cooperative businesses help keep profits rooted locally rather than going to executives and shareholders who may live elsewhere.Cooperative business development has become an increasingly popular alternative to waiting for private investors to create jobs, which in the years following the Great Recession have largely been low-paying or temporary.In Cleveland, Ohio, The Evergreen Cooperatives were created to address poverty in specific neighborhoods across the city. The Evergreen model took a "build and recruit" approach, creating jobs by incubating businesses and then training local residents to fill them with the help of foundation support. Profits were therefore redistributed in the local community , creating a sustainable model for reducing poverty.Two of the three incubated businesses are now profitable.Cooperatives have also been used to help prevent gentrification. As in Detroit, real estate speculation in the Northeast Minneapolis began to the neighborhood, and many residents were concerned about increasing property prices.That's when community members joined together to purchase commercial property. Residents formed an investment cooperative that now owns commercial space and has directly helped the neighborhood address community needs and desires.By prioritizing the needs of the community and its members over profits, these models addressed the roots of economic equality, and illustrate how a city like Detroit could benefit from city and foundation backed cooperative development.Detroit is ripe for cooperative businesses development. The city has a thriving network of entrepreneurial and technical support organizations. There are dozens of programs and incentives for businesses in Detroit through organizations like TechTown, Build Institute, and the New Economy Initiative. Despite this, cooperative businesses have barely been discussed as a viable model for entrepreneurship and business development.But why not here? Jobs that are on the horizon for Detroiters are generally low paying and temporary. Of the 24,000 jobs promised by Dan Gilbert's proposed downtown developments , 15,000 are temporary construction jobs—many of which will never be held by Detroit residents.The good news is that cooperative businesses are not new in Detroit, and there's currently an increased effort to create more.The Detroit People's Food Co-op , a membership based cooperative, is in the final stages of planning before they break ground on a brand-new building in the North End. The Cooperation Group in Highland Park and The Center for Community Based Enterprise in Midtown are fully-equipped technical support service providers that help with cooperative business development. The recently founded Detroit Community Wealth Fund is dedicated to providing non-extractive loans to cooperative businesses in the city.In Southwest Detroit, Grace In Action aspires to be a cooperative incubator, cultivating their collectives into fully functioning cooperative businesses . They recently incubated their first co-op, Cleaning In Action , a women-owned cleaning cooperative. The women had previously worked for temp agencies and now make a living wage.Co-founder Maria Perez hopes their business will inspire others. "This co-op helps women in our neighborhood. If we tell others about it, the idea will catch on. I see that this will open doors for others, especially younger generations."What will the Detroit model look like? When will we begin to build upon the work and efforts of residents who are rooted in their community and who already know how to address their needs?B. Anthony Holley, a partner at The Cooperation Group, believes Detroit is the perfect place for the cooperative model to thrive. "Cooperatives are important in Detroit because in a place where there is extreme poverty and privatization, cooperatives offer a space where democracy and ownership are inherent."
"He was a necromancer, right? One of the ones we caught before they organized and took the Northern territories."
"Solush was the one who drowned a whole township over a few years' time, but ironically couldn't figure out how to re-animate any of them to defend himself. When our empire's troops finally arrived at the remote village, they were so unprotected that they had no problem taking them into custody. As I recall, their punishment was an eternal vacation sealed in their own personal fire-pit."
"What puzzle? They were a sick fucking necromancer, and they killed a great deal of innocent people. Learning that without taking so much time off from your duties to the king would've been pretty easy. You know, the dwarves have tried two uprisings while you have been gone, we've really needed your help here. Why do you care so much about this Solush anyway?"
"It's an intriguing question, I agree, but the clearance to enter Chan tower is higher than even the Archmage of this province has. No amount of scouring the countryside is going to change that."
"You've seen a copy? No offense, but you've really been had if you think so. The Empire isn't sure the books even exist, and the necromancers sure as hell aren't going to let you know about it if they do. All the desert sand must have gotten to you."
"And you made the trade? You had dealings with a necromancer? You'll be lucky not to be carved when the Empire finds out. I should probably get away from you lest they think I'm interested in the art of death too. I'll see you in the prison, perhaps ..."
"Gassing a village seems a plausible way for a necromancer to work their evil. Granted, modifying the spell each time doesn't make much sense, but the fact that you read their meticulous notes about it still suggests more about you than him."
"Well, my cynical side says this only means they tortured them to death instead of killing them outright. But are you implying that they had a greater motive than accumulating bodies?"
"... so when we found him, everything he'd done looked just like death wizardry, even though it was something else entirely. Interesting. I still don't understand why they were trying to modify the spell, though. Gases are useful enough as they are, and they aren't even trying their versions in other spells."
"Amazing! Only the gods have ever created new spells, but Solush created one through trial and examination. Even though their methods were horrific, they were a genius. Have you told anybody else about this yet, sent word to the Council of Archmages?"
"I can think of some great places to begin. A bread spell turned into an instant turkey dinner. Our best teleportation ritual still only works within a mile or two as well. And the simple fire-snap we all learned as children, why, it could be made so large ..."
"Perchance do you remember the story about Solush that we all had to learn during fifth year?""That's part of it, but do you remember the what happened, the reason they had to be brought to justice?""Yeah, that's the guy. You have an excellent memory for history , I had to read up on them to know any of that. In fact, that's where I've been for the last year, virtually every territory in the Empire had a little piece of the puzzle.""Well, before I ever left I learned that when the soldier s captured him, they could only find the second half of their books, which they turned over to the Council of Archmages. The Council, as they always do with materials of necromancy, locked them away in the tower at the tip of the Chan peninsula. It's the fact that they had written so much down which intrigued me. Most mages, including most necromancers, accumulate only two or three volume s of spells over their lifetime. You and I have barely started on our first. So I wondered what they could've possibly been writing in allheavy tome s.""Truth. But in the desert I got a chance to see a copy of the first half of Solush's collection for myself, and ..." Let me finish. There are still a few necromancers hiding in the middle of the desert. King Abraham knows that it hasn't rained there for centuries, so they never bothered to try and shake them out after the schism . They probably assumed they were all long dead. I came across one who had put their cave into stasis, and undid the spell. When they awoke they were so thirsty that they offered any of their possessions for a simple water spell.""Wait! Just wait a moment. That old fart in the desert laughed out loud when I said I wanted to see Solush's books. I knew why when I looked at them, too. Instead of being filled with unnameable spells and black rituals, they were just page after page of tables and numbers and descriptions. There were spells in them, but not anything useful, just repetitions of the same cauldron bubbling gas spell with a few changes to each one. Every iteration had a few tables which described what the effect breathing the spell's vapor had on the townspeople.""Look at it this way. We were both taught that a poorly cast spell is more dangerous to the caster than most anything else. We learned to cast spells exactly as we learned them, or upon divine inspiration , exactly as the gods gave them to us. Solush was doubtlessly taught this rule too, but they figured out that it might be a limitation rather than a good practice. Instead of using their gas spell to simply kill the villagers, they were changing it little by little so they lived longer each time.""Yes, I believe they did. Solush was trying to create a spell all their own. Instead of being granted a divine inspiration or finding it in an unknown tome, they were modifying an existing spell until it suited their purposes. Unfortunately, since they were taught to be a necromancer from birth, they didn't think hundreds of casualties were any problem at all ...""Indeed not, but I mentioned the victims generally lived longer during each trial. It took me a long time to piece it together, but I think they were trying to make a spell that released breathable air instead of a poison gas. Nobody in any tower I visited knew of such an incantation , and it would be very useful for breathing underwater or in deep caves. In the first dozen volumes the life expectancy of somebody breathing the gas had gone from one or two minutes to almost five hours. I'd bet that in the second half they got a result that worked for an entire day, or even a week, or longer.""No, not yet, I'm afraid of being found guilty of necromancy just for knowing so much about Solush. I only told you because I knew you'd understand, even if it did take a long time to hammer into your head. Instead of beginning by telling everybody about Solush, I think we should modify a spell ourselves to prove that the method is sound."

PoliZette Netanyahu: ‘For First Time in My Lifetime' Peace, Change Are Possible Israeli leader lauds Trump for firm stance against Iran, opening doors to Sunni-Jewish cooperation
In a joint press conference on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the presidency of Donald Trump represents the “first time in my lifetime” that change and peace in the Middle East are possible.
Netanyahu made it undoubtedly clear that they and their country are thrilled that after eight years of icy treatment from the Obama administration, U.S.-Israeli relations are thawing fast with Trump in the White House.
“But for the first time in many years — and, Mr. President, for the first time in my lifetime — I see a real hope for change.”

“I cannot tell you how much we appreciate the change in policy on Iran, which you announced,” Netanyahu told Trump during the press conference, and “how much we appreciate the reassertion of American leadership in the Middle East.”
Netanyahu's words echoed earlier remarks made on Monday by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin following a closed-door meeting with Trump.
“I believe that the unbreakable bond between us, along with your determination, will open up new possibilities for the state of Israel and the entire region,” said Rivlin. “We are happy to see that America is back in the area,” Rivlin continued. “America is back again.”
[lz_jwplayer video=9xm3LpIQ]
Trump, in both their appearances with Rivlin and Netanyahu, respectively, stressed how the regional threat posed by Iran could bring Israel and Sunni Muslim nations in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, closer together — a sentiment Netanyahu echoed.

“I … look forward to working closely with you to advance peace in our region — because you have noted so succinctly that common dangers are turning former enemies into partners,” Netanyahu said.
“That's where we see something new and potentially something very promising,” Netanyahu continued. “It won't be simple. But for the first time in many years — and, Mr. President, for the first time in my lifetime — I see a real hope for change,” they said.
[lz_related_box id=”799188″]
Trump's first trip abroad has so far been relatively well-received in the mainstream media, and less-biased sources are widely praising the first leg of the trip as a success. Both the Saudis and Israelis have expressed an eager willingness to work with the United States to combat extremism in the region.
“During my travels, I have seen many hopeful signs that lead me to believe that we can truly achieve a more peaceful future for this region and for people of all faiths and all beliefs and, frankly, all over the world,” Trump said during the press conference with Netanyahu.
Davidsonville resident Steuart Pittman has announced their candidacy for county executive.
Pittman, the owner of Dodon Farm Training Center, will run as a Democrat. They confirmed their plans to The Capital Thursday. They plan to focus on development as a core issue.
 They are the first Democrat to announce their candidacy for executive. First term County Executive Steve Schuh, R-Gibson Island, is the only candidate who has officially filed to run in the June primary.
“I felt like they should be replaced, their policies should be challenged,” Pittman said. “It took me some time to be comfortable with the notion of being county executive. It is a very winnable race.”
The county has not had a Democratic county executive since Janet S. Owens, who served from 1998 to 2006.
Pittman provided The Capital with core platform issues. Those issues included supporting businesses already within the county, higher-paying jobs, higher developer impact fees to pay for infrastructure and working with the county auditor. Pittman is positioning themselves as a “flight attendant” of the land, saying their experience as a farmer will set a vision for preserving county land.
The reason Pittman thinks they can beat Schuh is primarily linked to development. Pittman believes the county executive's practices and policies put the county on a path toward population growth and denser developments. The new executive would oversee long-term plans that guide county development for 20 years. Pittman wants the county to focus on redevelopment where needed and land preservation elsewhere.
“Development has to be smart and in the areas that need it,” Pittman said. “Much more managed and slower growth.”
Pittman joined farmers on the Anne Arundel County Soil Conservation District. They also served as Maryland Horse Council president. They founded the Retire Racehorse Project, a nonprofit that assists in training horses for second careers after racing.
The Anne Arundel County race will be another major battleground in 2018 as Democrats aim to retake lost sectors of Maryland, with the highest prize being the governor's office held by Republican Larry Hogan.
Democrats are hopeful President Donald Trump will prove to be a catalyst. The Annapolis mayoral election had a Democratic candidate in Gavin Buckley who soundly defeated Republican incumbent Mike Pantelides.
Pittman doesn't think voters will vote against Schuh specifically because of Trump. But they do think the president will energize Democrats to show up in a county with majority Democrat registration.
Hogan, however, is well-liked, with support polling around 60 percent, Pittman said. They may counteract that effect.
“Traditional Democratic and independent voters are realizing that elections do matter,” Pittman said.
HOW abnormal are Swedes, and other people in the Nordic region, in paying tax? A general stereotype for Europe holds some truth: unlike tax-shy southern Europeans, those in the far north pay up readily to get comprehensive, efficient government services—plus societies with unusually equitable income distribution. In Sweden, even after years of slashing high taxes (an inheritance tax went in 2005, another for wealth disappeared in 2007, some taxes on residential property went the next year, corporate tax is low at 22%), the share of GDP claimed by the state remains high. The OECD reckons its government spent over 51% of GDP in 2014. Income tax rates, at least for the well-off, can be as high as 57%. And the Swedes comply. Sociologists, economists and others have long debated this readiness to cough up for the common good. Lutheran beliefs about the importance of supporting the whole community might be a factor. A strong sense of cultural homogeneity for the “folk” matters (now some worry this will be undermined by too much immigration). Maybe the generations spent huddling together to survive long, dark winters has played a role.
This week brought a new puzzle, however, with evidence that some Swedes are deliberately overpaying their taxes. Official figures published on February 22nd showed tax revenues poured in far faster than forecast last year. Sweden's government got a budget surplus of 85bn kronor ($9.5bn) in 2016. Nearly half of that, 40bn Skr, was from overpayment by firms and individuals. This appears to be deliberate. It also causes a headache for civil servants who will have to make repayments and manage the funds. What is going on?

This is not evidence, in fact, of a new or extreme culture of Nordic eagerness for paying tax. Instead the explanation is financial, a bizarre result of the existence of negative interest rates. For the past two years, since March 2015, Sweden's central bank has kept rates below 0%, as have other Swedish banks, in a broad effort to have the economy avoid deflation. At the same time, the government promised to pay a positive interest rate—0.56%—for any funds that had been overpaid in tax, upon their return to the taxpayer. Even though this interest payment has since been cut to zero, individuals and companies remain better off storing their savings in the form of overpaid tax, rather watch them shrink in the bank. According to the Financial Times a similar situation, again thanks to an unusually large government surplus, is emerging in Switzerland, which also imposed negative interest rates in 2015.
Officials and politicians would usually crow about a growing budget surplus. But Sweden's official bean-counters are not cheering. The cost of borrowing from taxpayers, ie taking in their over-payments, is higher than raising funds in other ways. It is also not entirely clear how the practice might grow, nor how quickly those who have overpaid will demand their money back, which all makes it tricky to manage the flow of money. Negative interest rates are likely to continue in Sweden for some time, which suggests that overpayment of taxes will also go on. That sounds like the sort of problem a government in southern Europe would be delighted to have. In Sweden, however, officials may ask taxpayers to cool it and please pay a bit less.

(Reuters) - New York will appoint a special prosecutor to handle investigations when civilians are killed during confrontations with police, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.
Cuomo told reporters they would issue an executive order valid for one year that would place Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in charge of investigating and prosecuting police-involved killings, taking those cases out of the hands of district attorneys.
“We will be the first state in the country to acknowledge the problem and say we're going to create an independent prosecutor who does not have that kind of connection with the organized police departments,” Cuomo said, according to the New York Times.
Cuomo said the appointment of a special prosecutor would help rebuild public confidence in law enforcement, following several high profile killings of unarmed black men by officers. Among them was Eric Garner on Staten Island in New York, who was choked to death nearly one year ago.
A grand jury in March declined to indict the officer who placed Garner in a chokehold, a maneuver banned by New York City police. The decision led to weeks of protests over law enforcement's use of force.
The phrase “I can't breathe,” which Garner was heard saying before their death, became a slogan of “Black Lives Matter” demonstrations around the country.
Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, attended a rally on Tuesday urging Cuomo to appoint a special prosecutor to handle deaths of civilians, saying some district attorneys are too closely linked with local police to conduct a fair investigation.
“It's for future families. We don't ever want to see this happen, what happened to my son,” they said in comments carried on local news broadcaster NY1.
The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the New York City's largest police union, called the executive order “unnecessary” and said it could lead to the indictment of officers “for the sake of public perception,” a statement said.
Well, let me get on with it, Mr Walker. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairpersonship.
I congratulate my hon. Friend Karl McCartney on securing this important debate. It has been an excellent and pacy debate, with excellent speeches on both sides of the Chamber, particularly the passionate speech, based on personal experience, of my hon. Friend Graham Evans, the thoughtful speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Congleton (Fiona Bruce), for Telford (Lucy Allan) and for Portsmouth South (Mrs Drummond), and other speeches that I will refer to in a moment.
As my hon. Friend Siobhain McDonagh have so clearly set out, there are still far too many young people—boys and girls—who are held back by their background and circumstances and who leave school without the basic building blocks for a successful future. The Government are determined to tackle those issues. Tackling educational inequality means raising the bar, setting the highest expectations for all pupils at every stage and raising standards so that every school can deliver a world-class education.
We have already made enormous strides. More than 1.4 million more pupils are now being taught in schools judged good or outstanding by Ofsted than in 2010. Once again, this year's A-level and GCSE results are testimony to the hard work of thousands of pupils and teachers. But while it is right that we celebrate those achievements, we must also recognise that there are groups of pupils for whom the chances of achieving good GCSEs and A-levels are simply too low.
Tackling the inequality driven by socio-economic background is a key priority for the Government, as is tackling the inequality driven by gender. Whichever way we read the data, they show that girls outperform boys at all educational stages in most areas of the curriculum. In 2015, there was a gap of nearly 16 percentage points between girls and boys judged to be achieving a good level of development at the end of the early years foundation stage: 74.3% for girls and 58.6% for boys. The gap persists at primary school in most, but not all, subjects.
In 2015, while boys' and girls' performance in mathematics was consistent—87% of boys and girls achieving level 4 or higher in the key stage 2 maths assessment—a significantly higher percentage of girls than boys achieved the expected standard in reading, writing and grammar, punctuation and spelling. In reading, writing and maths, 83% of all girls achieved at least the expected standard, compared with 77% of boys.
By the time pupils reach the end of key stage 4 at secondary school, the gender gap in attainment has increased. Girls outperform boys across all major curriculum subjects, although the size of the gap varies considerably by subject. For example, in 2015, girls only just outperformed boys in maths and individual sciences, but in English the gap was nearly 15 percentage points, and in the most commonly studied languages—French, German and Spanish—it was around 10 percentage points. Girls remain more likely than boys to be entered for the English baccalaureate: in 2015, more than 43% of girls studied the suite of English baccalaureate qualifying subjects, compared with 34% of boys. More girls than boys achieved it, too: 29% of girls, compared with around 19% of boys.
The cumulative impact of low prior attainment during primary and secondary school is likely to be one of the main factors influencing the slightly lower proportion of boys progressing to a sustained college or sixth form at 16 and the slightly higher likelihood that boys will be not in education, employment or training at the same age. In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply to university than young men; the difference in application rates between them is the highest on record.
It is important to note, however, that gender gaps are a common occurrence internationally, as Patricia Gibson pointed out. They are in favour of girls in reading, in favour of boys in mathematics but mixed in science. According to the most recent PISA study—the programme for international student assessment, conducted by the OECD—the reading ability of girls is higher than that of boys in every country.
On average across OECD countries, 15-year-old girls are around a year ahead of boys—38 PISA points. The size of that gap is narrower in England: our girls outperform boys by 24 PISA points. The gender gap in maths is reversed—boys do better—and is not as large: 11 PISA points, or four months of education, across the OECD. In fact, boys only scored significantly better than girls in 27 out of 65 countries, and the gender gap remains in favour of girls in Jordan, Qatar, Thailand, Malaysia and Iceland, as I think the hon. Lady referred to. The size of the gap is similar in England to the average across all OECD countries, which is 13 PISA points.
What are the drivers of boys' under-achievement? I listened very carefully to the excellent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth South. While there is a plethora of data to show where and by how much girls do better than boys in education, there is only limited evidence that explains precisely why boys do not perform as well as girls. There is no shortage of theories, but many of them are not supported by robust research evidence. For example, it has been argued that boys naturally prefer examinations and girls prefer coursework, so boys may have been disadvantaged by the move from exam-based assessments to GCSEs, which place a greater emphasis on coursework. In fact, the attainment of girls at the end of secondary school was already improving before the introduction of GCSEs, and subsequent reductions in the weighting of the coursework component of GCSEs have had little impact on gender attainment patterns.
Another view, which my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln referred to, is that the performance of boys is held back by the lack of male teachers in schools, particularly during the primary phase.  They are right to point out that there is a huge disparity in the numbers of men and women teaching in primary schools, but studies that have looked for correlation between teacher gender and pupil attainment have mostly found no relationship of improved attainment when boys are taught by male teachers—although that does not mean we do not want to address the imbalance in the gender of primary school teachers.
The research evidence does suggest that the behaviour and attitudes of boys and girls towards school and academic study tend to differ in a number of ways—my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth South referred to some of those. Pupil-level factors appear to play an important role in the gender attainment gap. We know that there are some schools in which pupil attainment is high and the gap between girls and boys is small or non-existent. Those schools tend to be characterised by a positive attitude to study, high expectations of all pupils, high-quality teaching and classroom management, and close tracking of individual pupils' achievement.
As the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden so passionately and ably pointed out, academies in the Harris Federation in their constituency are improving educational standards for pupils from poorer backgrounds because they adopt those attitudes to education. I have not yet seen evidence of the gap closing, because I do not have the data, but if the hon. Lady has them, or if I can get them from Dan Moynihan, it would be interesting to see the extent to which the Harris Federation's approach to education is having an impact on the gender gap.
It is important not to generalise. It is simply not true that all boys do badly and that all girls do well. For example, white British girls who are eligible for free school meals generally do much worse than white British boys who are not. Indeed, there is clear evidence that poverty is a much bigger predictor of poor educational attainment than gender, as the shadow Education Secretary pointed out. While gender imposes a relatively consistent educational performance gap across all ethnic groups, the impact is compounded significantly by deprivation. As the Prime Minister noted in their inaugural speech, the chances of going to university are extremely low for white working-class boys. In 2015, fewer than one in four white British boys eligible for free school meals achieved five A* to C grades at GCSE, including English and maths, compared with more than 56% of non-disadvantaged white British boys.
The question is: how are we tackling educational underachievement? The Government's approach is to set high expectations for what all pupils will achieve by introducing an ambitious and stretching national curriculum and world-class qualifications. To deliver such reforms, we are building a school-led, self-improving education system, characterised by high levels of autonomy and strong accountability arrangements, through which the characteristics of high-performing schools, such as those referred to by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden, can be shared and embedded across the whole system.
We want all pupils to secure the basics in literacy and numeracy by the end of primary school, and we have set higher standards in those areas of the curriculum. We have embedded the teaching of phonics in key stage 1, which we know is the most effective way of teaching reading for all children, and we are providing catch-up funding to secondary schools to support those pupils who do not achieve the expected standard at 11. As a result, 120,000 more six-year-olds are on track to become fluent readers. Our introduction of the English baccalaureate sets a strong expectation that all pupils will receive a rigorous academic education that prepares them for adult life and success in our modern economy. We have made clear our aim that, by 2020, the vast majority of pupils, boys and girls alike, will take those facilitating subjects as part of a well-rounded education that opens the door to education and employment.
Our new performance accountability measures are also intended to drive up attainment across the board. Secondary school performance tables now report on pupils' progress from the end of primary school to the end of secondary school, as well as their GCSE attainment. The new measures, known as progress 8 and attainment 8, will encourage schools to focus their attention on the progress and attainment of every pupil, not just those at or near the borderline of a particular performance threshold.
Looking beyond the curriculum, our commitment to character education seeks to ensure that all pupils develop the essential qualities of resilience, perseverance and self-control, all of which are critical for success in both education and adult life.
CLOSE Many cities across the U.S. identify as sanctuary cities, despite President Trump's threat to withhold federal funds. Here's a closer look at what that label means. USA TODAY NETWORK

Donald Trump vowed throughout their presidential campaign to punish "sanctuary cities" that fail to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement authorities. Yet three months into their presidency, the Trump administration still can't answer a simple question: What exactly is a sanctuary city?
That's a multimillion-dollar question.
The reason: The administration wants to withhold federal money from cities, counties and states that it considers "sanctuaries" for undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security has tried to publicly shame such jurisdictions, and the Department of Justice issued letters to nine local governments warning that they may lose federal grants if they are deemed sanctuaries.
Even so, when a group of mayors met this week with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and their staff in Washington and asked for a definition of the term, they got scant satisfaction.
"They told us, 'We haven't fully fleshed that out yet,'" said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who received one of the threatening Justice Department letters. "We're happy to work with the president, but they have to understand what they're talking about. You can't accuse us of violating the rules if you haven't told us what the rules are."
Even U.S. District Judge William Orrick, who on Tuesday struck down Trump's executive order to withhold all federal grants from "sanctuary cities," encouraged the administration to develop regulations or guidance on "designating a jurisdiction as a 'sanctuary jurisdiction.'"
When asked for a definition of a sanctuary city Wednesday, the Justice Department said it could not comment “in light of the pending litigation” before Orrick.
At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars in Department of Justice grants that help pay for local police, prosecutors, judges and jailers. Orrick ruled that only those kinds of grants can be withheld from local jurisdictions.
The local governments say they are being coerced into assisting with immigration enforcement — a federal responsibility — and engage in the legally questionable practice of detaining suspects solely to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents time to investigate their immigration status.
The local leaders say that has caused unnecessary confusion for their budgets, since so many rely on a variety of federal grants. Santa Clara County (Calif.) Counsel James Williams said the vague, undefined threats from the Trump administration have been "hanging over our heads."

"Sanctuary city" is not a legal term but a general term often used to describe more than 300 jurisdictions that don't fully comply with federal immigration efforts. Several administration officials have turned to a federal law when asked to define it. The law forbids any local agency from enacting a policy that orders its employees to withhold the immigration status of people in its custody.
"That means, according to Congress, a city that prohibits its officials from providing information to federal immigration authorities — a sanctuary city — is violating the law," read a White House statement Tuesday.
That doesn't explain how the Alachua County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office ended up on a report issued by Homeland Security last month shaming sanctuary cities. That department has a policy that forbids its agents from honoring federal requests to hold suspects for up to 48 hours for immigration agents. Sheriff's spokesperson Art Forgey said courts have ruled that practice to be a violation of the constitutional due process rights of suspects, so they refuse to comply.
But Forgey said their office immediately shares information on every inmate that enters its jails with the local office of the federal immigration enforcement agency. They said deputies pass along the name, fingerprints, country of birth, criminal charges and even the estimated release date of each person in its jails. That's why it came as a shock to their office when it was listed as a sanctuary city.
"Where they come up with their information and how they come about it, it's perplexing," Forgey said. "The people at Homeland Security, I think they're ill-equipped to deal with the orders that have been placed upon them."

At the turn of the 20th century, sport was transforming from a recreational pastime to a more structured, codified and modern form. Drawing inspiration from the Olympic movement, administrators sought to promote values, virtues, health and athleticism through organised sport. At this time cricket was the longest established of the major sports and English presence in major Italian cities saw cricket incorporated into new sporting clubs, many of which have now become internationally renowned.
It is hard to imagine that AC Milan, a club so synonymous with Italian style and passion, was actually founded by two Englishmen from Nottingham. At that time the Midlands town had strong links to lace-making firms in northern Italy which drew a small community of English industrialists to Milan. Two such men, Alfred Edwards and Herbert Kilpin, unwittingly created one of the highest-profile and successful sporting clubs in the world.
Lamenting the absence of the traditional summer game of their homeland, they met with friends one evening in a tavern in the city and over a beer or two sketched out a charter for the Milan cricket and football club. It was two weeks before the dawn of a new century, a century that would see these sports become the most played and popular in the world with a defining impact on the development of modern culture.
It is pertinent that cricket came first in the title, despite the fact that Kilpin was a talented amateur footballer and an influential pioneer. The famous sporting organ the Gazzetta dello Sport reported on the foundation, stating its aims as to 'spread the game of football and to play cricket as widely as possible'.
Edwards, known as 'papa' to historians of the club, became very wealthy indeed from interests in the Pirelli company. They were the first president of the club and bankrolled it, while Kilpin was the captain and star player. While there was an immediate impact on the football field, with AC Milan winning their first national title in 1900 and surpassing Genoa as the leading team in the country by 1906, the extent of their cricketing experience is a matter for speculation.
Two years before that fateful night in Milan, Juventus had been formed in Turin by students of the Massimo D'Azelilo lyceum as a sporting club. Cricket is thought to be among those it planned to play, but by 1899 football was the sole focus and the name was changed to the Football Club Juventus.
It can only be assumed that there was insufficient interest in cricket within the club for it to continue. But the honour of the earliest multi-sport club in Italy goes to Genoa, still officially named the Genoa Cricket and Football Club.
In 1893 the club was formed by British expats as the Genoa Cricket and Athletic Club. Initially its membership was restricted to British members. This mirrors the wish for exclusivity seen in the committees of the clubs established in Lisbon and Porto.
That the club was a patriotic expression is seen from the choice of white shirts to match those of the England team. The club had grounds in the Combasso district, to the north-west of the city. One of the founding fathers of the club was Sir Charles Alfred Peyton, a diplomat who had been transferred from Mogador, Morocco, to the vice-consul in the city in the spring of 1893, and had joined others in the British community in founding the club.
For the first two years of its existence, the club played cricket matches, mainly against the crews of visiting ships arriving in the harbour. Peyton's posting to Calais in 1897 may well have been critical for cricket's future in the city. A year before, James Richardson Spensley, a doctor, had arrived in Genoa charged with tending to English sailors on the coal ships. They took responsibility for leading football in the club, becoming its first manager. Acknowledging the burgeoning interest in football among the local population, and under pressure from the city authorities, the club opened its membership to Italians.

The locals clearly wanted to play football rather than cricket. In 1898 Spensley established the Italian league and led their team to victory. Although it is uncertain whether cricket was still being played by the club after 1897, it is interesting to note that, when a name change was voted for in 1899, cricket remained while athletics was dropped. This may have been in deference to the club's founding purpose, but indicates a willingness for cricket to remain part of the club's activities.
Meanwhile back at AC Milan, cricket was being marginalised as the seeds of football fever that would capture Italy's soul were sown. The English founding fathers walked away from the club in 1908, perhaps frustrated that it had not embraced cricket as originally intended.
In a few years at the dawn of the 20th century three of the richest and most influential sporting institutions in Italy had played cricket. If only it had survived for a few more years and captured the imagination of Italians, the clubs would have provided the organisational capacity and financial clout to establish cricket in the country.
This missed opportunity is particularly the case in Genoa, formed before football was widely known outside England and before a national infrastructure for the sport was established. For the first five years of its existence, cricket had the upper hand and the bigger profile. But in these crucial years the club didn't allow Italians to join, protecting the exclusivity of their English sport. Cricket in Italy would never have such opportunity again.
Simon Rosenberg is the most bullish of Democratic strategists. The former Clinton administration official and head of the young non-profit group NDN has been the chief proponent of the belief that Barack Obama's election produced the opportunity for a "30-to-40-year era of Democratic dominance." A specialist in the political habits of different demographic groups (specifically Hispanics), they insist that, absent a drastic makeover, the GOP risks cementing itself "as irrelevant to the 21st century."
Sagging poll numbers and policy setbacks have done little to dissuade these rosy prognostications. There's only one thing that makes Rosenberg nervous: another Bush.
"Jeb [Bush] is married to a Latina, is fluent in Spanish, speaks on Univision as a commentator, their Spanish is that good," Rosenberg said of the former Florida governor and brother to the 43rd president during a lunch at NDN headquarters last week. "And if you look at the electoral map in 2012, you have to assume that Obama is going to have a very hard time in holding North Carolina and Virginia. The industrial Midwest, where the auto decline has been huge, has weakened Obama's numbers... a great deal. So Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin become a bit more wobbly. So if you're Barack Obama, the firewall is the Latin belt from Florida to southwestern California. And there is only one Republican who can break through that firewall. And it is Jeb."
Such a sentiment, Rosenberg admits, carries a slight hint of hysteria. After all, there is a good chunk of the country that recoils at the idea of another pol with the Bush surname. But that chunk has begun narrowing. And even within Democratic circles, there is an emerging belief that in a Republican Party filled with base-pleasing dramatizers or bland conservatives, Jeb stands out.
"The vast majority of the voting public yearns for a non-Bush," said longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazille. But, they added, "Jeb has the talent, the experience and the ability to rebuild the GOP's tent."
"I believe Jeb Bush could run," said Stanley Greenberg, a longtime Democratic pollster. "He is more of a genuine conservative than Romney. Bush is a big hangover, but not impossible." The question, Greenberg asks, is "does their immigration position get them into primary trouble?"
Talk of a prospective Jeb Bush presidential run in the 2012 election is, by definition, speculative. But Rosenberg's frankness in acknowledging their fears gets at a larger, more immediate political phenomenon. Roughly one-and-a-half years after George W. Bush left office with abysmal approval ratings and the likelihood of historical ignominy, the Bush brand is vying once more for political relevance. Within Republican circles, the fear that once accompanied any association with the 43rd president has diminished. There remain, of course, substantive critiques of Bush's presidency. And news that the former president would be releasing their book right around the time of the November election ignited some consternation among Republicans on Thursday.
But the criticisms are mainly offered as a method of distinguishing oneself as a fresh, fiscally sound breed of Republican. Behind the scenes, some of the major figures from the Bush years have assumed influential roles.
Karl Rove, the strategist chiefly responsible for George W. Bush's rise to political prominence, has become the de facto Yoda of the Republican Party, dispensing wisdom in private and from their various public perches. Ed Gillespie, the former RNC chair and Bush hand, has assumed a more institutionally important position, launching a public opinion firm (Resurgent Republic) as well as a election-oriented organization (American Crossroads) that is promising to spend big on the 2010 elections. To be sure, many Bush-linked figures have become, essentially, apolitical in the post-administration era (think: former RNC chairperson Ken Mehlman). But others have yet to kill the political bug, such as Sara Taylor, an ex-Rove aide who now plays an important role with likely 2012 candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.
And then there is Jeb. The former governor, GOP officials say, has become increasingly engaged in charting the future of Republican politics. In addition to working closely with House leadership on various rebranding efforts, they helped craft the delicate strategy that the party took in the Florida Senate Republican primary. Understanding that the National Republican Senatorial Committee was essentially obligated to put its support behind their successor, Charlie Crist, they cautioned chairperson John Cornyn (R-Tex) to anticipate Tea Party favorite Marco Rubio's rise. The committee was, subsequently, well-positioned to handle Crist's GOP defection.
"I am running into them more around the country than before I would have expected, more [than] when they were governor," said Grover Norquist, head of the influential Americans for Tax Reform and a connected Republican tactician if there ever was one. "As I travel around, I hear Jeb Bush was here last week or is coming next month. And I didn't hear that when they were governor..."
What kind of impact the Bush reemergence will have on the broader landscape is a hotly debated question within both party circles. During the 2008 cycle, these officials were marginalized -- either burned out from the past eight years or too toxic for prospective candidates to touch (the McCain campaign, famously, had a fiery relationship with the former president and their team). Now back on, what one operative called "political terra firma," they have already positioned themselves as the axis around which the GOP's election strategies will turn. Both Rove and Gillespie have used their Rolodexes to recruit major donors and their reputations to pow-wow with some of the more high-profile candidates.
Of course, there's some self-aggrandizement going on, several officials cautioned anonymously. Rove, in particular, is often described as more interested in advancing their own brand, often by overstating their influence. "Karl seems to be mostly in the Karl Rove business," said one GOP operative. "Selling books, going on TV, writing for the Wall Street Journal, speaking engagements. I don't know much advising they are doing."
But that sentiment is not shared by everyone. Indeed, at a time when the campaign committees (mainly the RNC) have floundered, more top-flight Republicans are looking at the operatives who led the Bush years as the closest they can get to a sure thing.
"I think that those two particularly [Rove and Gillespie] bring a credibility," says Norquist. "If you want to write a really big check, you trust Ed Gillespie and Rove will spend $1 million wisely... Both of them you can look at through the prism of the last six election cycles. They've won some and lost some but they are always shooting in the right direction."
Whether that direction ends up being right for the GOP in 2010 remains to be seen. For Democrats, Rove's involvement has been cheered -- in as much as it's created the ideal boogeyman to get the 2010 blood flowing.
"He is larger than life all across the spectrum," explained Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who has worked on campaigns at all levels of governance. "His contradiction is being well-known for the colossal failures attributed to their watch and also being well-known for their intellectual, strategic abilities."
But the major question is whether or not the old Bush guard is properly suited for the modern GOP. Rove, to this point, has had two high-profile endorsement busts: Sen. Bob Bennett in the Utah Republican primary, and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson in the Texas gubernatorial primary. In each instance, they found themselves on the wrong side of the Tea Party movement. Whether those are simply glitches in a broader effort to get Republicans elected or indicative of the grassroots and the Bush clan not operating off the same playbook is a major question going forward. And it's one that Jeb Bush -- as they ponder a potential 2012 bid -- will have to consider as well.
Twitter/@TODAYshow Hillary Clinton on Wednesday weighed in on Donald Trump Jr.'s recent statement that they accepted a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer because they believed they had damaging information that could help them assess Clinton's "fitness" and "qualifications" for office.
"It's ridiculous," Clinton said on NBC's "Today" show. "It's another absurd lie to cover up what really was going on, which I hope we finally uncover and understand."
Trump Jr. testified last week for five hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee behind closed doors to discuss the meeting they held at Trump Tower last summer with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
"To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character, or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out," Trump Jr. wrote in a statement provided to the committee before their testimony.
"Depending on what, if any, information they had, I could then consult with counsel to make an informed decision as to whether to give it further consideration," said the statement, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The rationale was a departure from the initial statement Trump Jr. had given after news surfaced of the Russia meeting. They had initially said they met with the Russian lawyer primarily to discuss a program regarding the adoption of Russian children.
Clinton gave several major interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday to tout their book "What Happened," which was released the previous day and details the events that led up to their November, 2016 election loss.
Asked by host Matt Lauer whether the believed the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to sway the presidential election, Clinton replied, "Matt, I can't say that. That's what this investigation is to determine."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday postponed consideration of four bills to curb gun violence after Republicans said they needed more time to study the proposed ban on military-style assault weapons.

The one-week delay by the Democratic-led committee appears unlikely to change the fate of the bills, all of which appear headed to the full Senate for a vote.
The move comes a day after the panel heard emotional testimony that included pleas for lawmakers to back the proposed assault weapons ban.
Neal Heslin, whose 6-year-old son Jesse Lewis was killed with 19 other children and six adults in the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, said the death toll would have been lower if the gunman had not had the automatic weapon.
But Republicans question whether a ban on assault weapons, which is similar to one that was in effect for a decade before expiring in 2004, would violate Americans' right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution.
Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the panel's top Republican, noted that during Wednesday's hearing the measure's sponsor, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, asked for suggestions to improve the assault weapons bill.
Critics of Feinstein's bill, Republicans and some Democrats, say studies indicate the earlier ban had no impact on the nation's homicide rate. But backers say assault weapons have been the firearm of choice in several U.S. mass shootings in recent years.
Besides the bill to ban assault weapons, which faces an uphill fight to pass the full Senate, the other bills call for expanded background checks for prospective gun buyers, a crackdown on the illegal trafficking of firearms, and various improvements to school security.
Support generally has been strongest for the background checks bill, but senators have not reached a detailed, bipartisan agreement even on that proposal.
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said the panel will take up the four bills next Thursday and it could take a few of debate before voting.
Like all other people, transgender people go to the bathroom to pee. Afterwards, they may even take a moment to comb their hair or just look in the mirror. Overall though, their habits in the restroom are just like yours.
But Wednesday night the North Carolina legislature passed – and Governor Pat McCrory signed – a bill that bans trans people from bathrooms that don't match the sex they were assigned at birth. There are 40 similar bills being considered in at least 16 US states that echo this now-successful piece of legislation, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
Transgender restroom use: America's next battle for equality and recognition | Nico Lang Read more
This shocking win not only signals a red alert in the fight for full LGBT equality, but also something more disgusting: a clear message has been sent by North Carolina conservatives, sure to be emulated nationwide, that it doesn't matter if trans people live or die.
I'm not jumping to conclusions here. An analysis of data compiled by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey last month shows that when young people are denied access to a restroom that aligns with their gender identity, their rates of suicide go up.
Translation: not allowing trans youth to use a bathroom only perpetuates feelings of isolation or depression that lead 41% of transgender people to attempt kill themselves at some point in their lives, compared to the 4.6% in the general population.
This finding should be at the forefront of everyone's minds as this bill takes effect in North Carolina, and as other proposed legislation moves forward in states like Kansas, where officials have proposed a bill that would allow someone to sue a public school if they saw a transgender person in a bathroom that didn't match their sex assigned at birth. (Who is going to be checking people's genitals if this passes? And isn't that assault?)
Beyond the research, suicide in North Carolina is a very personal topic for many activists and leaders I have spoken to over years reporting on LGBT violence in the state, where sources have told me that this is one of the biggest concerns they see in their community daily.
Since 2014, the city of Charlotte, which passed the original LGBT non-discrimination ordinance that sparked this new anti-trans bill, has had at least four trans youths take their own lives. One of them was a local homecoming king.
Rodney Tucker, executive director of the local LGBT center there, told me this one morning after Deonna Mason, a black transgender woman, was found dead on the highway after being accidentally hit by a state patrol car in the same city, and then misgendered in the media.
But high trans suicide attempt rates seem to consistently fail to be a concern for those whose only focus is “protecting” non-trans people in bathrooms, though studies have consistently shown that trans people using the restroom that aligns with their gender identity does not lead to violence or crime.
Before the North Carolina bill was passed in the house, Republican representative Dean Arp told the chamber that it was “common sense” to stop transgender people from using the restrooms they desired because “biological men should not be in women's showers, locker rooms and bathrooms”.
Their arguments, and others, were based on protecting their children from the “monsters” they made of transgender people – children they actually seem to not really care about completely, because passage of this latest bill puts $4.5bn in Title IX funding for schools in jeopardy, since blocking transgender youth from bathrooms has been consistently found to be a civil rights violation.
As they and their colleagues continued to use women and children as a misplaced reason for codifying bigotry, for the assault on the most marginalized sector of the LGBT community. North Carolina lawmakers failed to listen to the people who testified before them prior to the vote, saying that this was a terrible idea. That this would harm their lives.
That, for me, is the most frightening part of all this: the fact that, despite local and national outcry and increasing civil parity, these conservatives still cannot see LGBT people – like me – as humans, who deserve to use restrooms in comfort, and who deserve to live.
Nissan will recall more than 226,326 additional vehicles due to faulty airbags, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Saturday, expanding on a March recall of nearly one million vehicles.
The recall involves certain models released between 2002 and 2004, including Infiniti, Maxima, Pathfinder and Sentra cars, the company said in a statement.
The vehicles in the expanded recall have defective airbags manufactured by Japanese auto-parts supplier Takata, which have been known to break upon inflation, shooting metal fragments into the car, the company statement said.
A Nissan spokesperson said the company is not aware of any injuries caused by the airbags and that the recall is a preventative measure, the Associated Press reports.
The Nissan vehicles in March were recalled after some airbags failed to deploy during a collision. The company said in a report to regulators that sensors were unable to detect an adult in the front passenger seat.
The recall, set to begin on August 11, will include both airbags that were installed in the cars at the factory and replacement models, the NHTSA said.
Nissan models from 2002 to 2004 in the expanded recall include:
Infiniti JX35 SUV 2013
Infiniti FX35, 2003
Infiniti FX45, 2003
Infiniti I35, 2002-2003
Infiniti QX42, 2002-2003
Maxima, 2002-2003
Pathfinder, 2002-2003
Sentra, 2002-2004
The 2013-14 recalled Nissan models from March include:
Altima 2013-2014
Leaf 2013-2014
Pathfinder 2013-2014
Serra 2013-2014
Taxi Van NV 2013
Being a professional hockey player isn't easy. It's even more difficult to be one who can constantly contribute at the NHL level.
Last year the Montreal Canadiens had a number of players who underperfomed, whether it be due to lengthy injuries, a lack of discipline, or just downright horrid luck over 82 games. The good news is that all bad things come to an end at some point, and there is reason to believe the previous seasons for a few forwards are ones that aren't likely to be repeated.
For Gallagher, they have suffered through two hellish seasons, having the same hand broken twice; once on a Johnny Boychuk slapshot, and again on one from their teammate, Shea Weber, this past year. This, coupled with (or perhaps resulting in) a lower shooting percentage, hampered Gallagher's production after their 24-goal effort in the 2014-15 season. They managed just 10 goals last year, their lowest total since their rookie season.
Last year is a significant outlier in Gallagher's career thus far, and they themselves said the injury had affected the way they had to shoot the puck, among other things. Despite their hand having to be fully repaired for the second year in a row, they were among Montreal's best possession forwards yet again, clocking in at an impressive 55.7% Corsi-for percentage. Even if they aren't producing goals, Gallagher is driving play in the right direction for Montreal.
 They are a prime target to rebound in the upcoming season, and the departure of Alexander Radulov means that they will very likely return to the top of the lineup. The 20-odd goals that Gallagher is capable of will be a major boost for Claude Julien's offence, both at five-on-five and on a power play that struggled mightily at times without Gallagher buzzing around the crease.
There's no other way to phrase it: Plekanec did not have a good season last year. They were snakebitten and struggled to find any way to match their hefty new contract.
Much like Gallagher, last year is well outside the norm for Plekanec, just to a much larger extreme. With just 28 points in 78 games it was their worst season in over a decade in terms of production. It's easy to be critical with Plekanec sporting a $6 million cap hit this upcoming year, but when we look at their overall career it's hard to think that the Czech centre won't rebound this year.
They still have plenty to offer in the starting lineup, from being a crucial piece on the penalty kill to handling key defensive minutes. It's highly unlikely that Plekanec magically finds their old 60-point form, but it's very possible that they can post a solid 40 points or so while also taking on a relatively tough deployment.
Shaw didn't have a bad season in their first year in Montreal. They did exactly what he's known for: playing hard-nosed, physical hockey, while chipping in the odd goal. The issue wasn't so much their production or their ability to play. In fact they were one of Montreal's top forwards in terms of possession statistics. The problem was that for a good portion of the year Shaw was out of control on the ice, and it was drastically impacting their effectiveness for their new team.
They missed games with suspensions, limiting how useful they could be, and spent a large amount of time in the penalty box, not only not contributing, but directly hurting their club by forcing them into short-handed situations.
When they toed the line and focused on creating offence, Shaw became a valuable piece for the Canadiens late in the season. Under Julien, Shaw's discipline issues were reined in, and should that carry over to 2017-18 they should thrive in the head coach's first full season.
Finally there's a player who isn't quite an NHL regular, but is just on the cusp — if the team can figure out what role to slot them into in the NHL.
McCarron had an extremely promising rookie season in the AHL, and didn't look out of place in their NHL call-up. This past year however, they aren't quite as dominant, but looked right at home in the AHL, which is fine for a prospect of their calibre.
The problem they face is that at the NHL level they became a fourth-liner who fought more than they scored, which isn't what fans expect to see from a first-round pick. They have the talent to be a useful forward, with good hands around the net, and plenty of skill to be more than just a bottom-of-the-lineup player.
To get the best out of McCarron this year, letting them play top minutes in the AHL might be a preferable option over them playing minimal minutes in a shoehorned role.
There's a lot to like about Montreal's forward lineup this upcoming season, with plenty of skilled players, and Claude Julien will ensure the team gets the most out of the new-look defence. When we take into account that last year was likely an aberration for some key players, there's a very good chance we could see Montreal have a better season than the last.
CLOSE Justin Bieber is now accused of attempted robbery in Los Angeles. They have not been charged but it's the latest incident in their growing legal troubles. The alleged victim in this case told TMZ about their run-in with the pop star.

Singer-songwriter Justin Bieber has been accused of an attempted robbery in the Los Angeles area, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed Tuesday night.
The alleged victim reported the incident to police Monday at about 10:30 p.m. West Coast time, and that person was being interviewed by police late Tuesday evening, Officer Rosario Herrera told USA TODAY.
Bieber, 20, had not been questioned by police or arrested as of late Tuesday, they said.
No details were available as to whether the incident was alleged to have happened at a home, business or some other site, but it did take place in the police agency's Devonshire district in the San Fernando Valley, Herrera said.
Herrera said they did not believe the alleged victim had been hurt in the incident.
It was not clear what sorts of items might have been sought in the incident, Herrera said.
The Canadian-born Bieber has been involved in a string of brushes with the law and incidents that have caused fans to distance themselves from him.
They were first arrested in January 2014 in Miami on charges of driving under the influence and with an expired license.
On Mother's Day, during a Los Angeles Clippers game that they attended with their mother, Pattie Mallette, the audience at the Staples Center booed when their face appeared on the Jumbotron screen.

Everex Brings Cryptocash to Silicon Valley
Alexi Lane Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 14, 2017
Everex had the distinct privilege to speak to an enthusiastic crowd in San Francisco over the weekend about the potential for blockchain technology, and how Everex will propel the world to “Exchange Better”. Below is Our CEO and Founder Alexi Lane's summary of the event.
What a few weeks it has been for the entire Everex team. Our week in China was quickly followed up by a busy few days in the Silicon Valley for d10e, an Everex-sponsored blockchain-focused conference, where I presented our capital transfer and microlending system with some of the west coast's most influential blockchain investors, traders, professionals and enthusiasts in attendance. It was an honor.
But first, kicking off the conference, a private dinner was held at the lovely italian food restaurant Il Fornaio, where I spoke alongside blockchain projects Agrello, Propy and Science Blockchain about the Everex solution and, particularly, how we can bring microlending and payment services to a new level by serving various communities from cryptocurrency enthusiasts to the underbanked.
The dinner went extremely well. You could feel the breeze rolling in off the bay. Individuals from some of the most influential blockchain organizations on the west coast were there at the private dinner, with investors and entrepreneurs coming from all the major cities of the west coast, and well beyond, to discuss blockchain technology.
While the private dinner was focused on blockchain technology, the following day brought a shift of focus from blockchain towards Startup Societies, which are essentially organizations seeking to begin their own societies without seeking permission from existing nation-states. I spent Day 1 of the conference discussing with many entrepreneurs potential for partnerships between large companies in the Startup Society space and blockchain space.
On Saturday night, I was lucky enough to participate in a VIP dinner, which was a great opportunity to connect with some of blockchain's best, including EOS co-founder Brock Pierce, Augur founder Jeremy Gardner and even storied technology executive Richard Titus, as well as other local venture capitalists and executives.
Day 2 featured more blockchain than the previous day, and also my speech, in which I was able to really focus on the technology and USP behind Everex. We found a great deal of interest in our system's microlending capabilities, and primarily our native digital token, EVX.
Throughout the day, we spoke with people from influential organizations including Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, Blockchain Capital and more. Tokens in general were a consistent theme of the conference throughout the conference.
Over the course of the two days, we held very important discussions with representatives of very large blockchain-focused venture capital firms. Its discussions like these that are propelling the world to exchange better with Everex. One such can be seen on Facebook. I spoke with Blockchain Investor:
Once again, d10e has outdone itself. This conference consistently becomes more and more interesting, with movers and shakers in the blockchain space coming together with increasingly clear visions of decentralization in the world. We are glad Everex feels so at home among such talented visionaries.
The San Francisco-held Startup Societies Conferenced, curated by d10e, provided a great networking experience at the cutting edge of blockchain, fintech and distributed finance. We look forward to many more!
The people who will be coming up with regulations for Colorado's new recreational-marijuana regime went back to work Thursday with two meetings that only underscored how much they have to do.
The meetings were for two subgroups of the Amendment 64 Implementation Task Force — one dealing with the regulatory framework for a recreational-marijuana industry and the other focused on addressing consumer safety and social issues related to legal cannabis. There are five subgroups that will work through a list of issues, which stretches more than 100 items long, to make recommendations to the full task force.
The full task force will then adopt plans for how lawmakers and state officials should approach recreational-marijuana regulations.
The task force has until the end of next month to issue a report.
“Obviously,” said state Health Department executive director Chris Urbina, the chair of the social-issues subgroup, “we're not going to be able to talk about these issues in one meeting.”
Among the items Urbina's subgroup will tackle are whether the state should put limits on marijuana potency; impose requirements on growing standards, labeling and advertising; and implement restrictions to keep marijuana out of the hands of minors.
At the meeting of the Regulatory Framework subgroup, members questioned whether the state should adopt a requirement that only Colorado residents can purchase marijuana at recreational-pot shops.
“I think that's going to be a big issue,” predicted Bob Dill, a task-force member and Denver lawyer who specializes in regulation law.
Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon knew their love story was a little unconventional. But they were never like, ‘Whoa, this needs to be a movie.'
At least not right away.
But after Nanjiani, who plays the sarcastic coder Dinesh on HBO's Silicon Valley, recounted how they and Gordon met and fell in love to producer-director Judd Apatow, The Big Sick, a romantic-comedy based on their own extraordinary union, took shape.
“I told them a couple of made up stories and then this one,” Nanjiani told the Sun ahead of the film's Toronto premiere. “And when they heard the story of me and Emily they said, ‘This is what we're doing together.'
“I got a little obsessed with the idea of doing this,” they continue. “I said to Emily, ‘I don't think we can do any other meaningful story unless we do this one first.'”
The film tracks the relationship between a Muslim-American standup comic obsessed with Hugh Grant, Kumail (played by Nanjiani), and a blond grad student named Emily (played by Zoe Kazan) who meet after they heckle them on stage. But their romance fizzles when Emily finds out that Kumail's parents expect them to marry a fellow Muslim.
Then things take a further turn for the worse when Emily is stricken by a mystery illness and hospitalized in a coma.
All of which actually happened to Gordon.
But the illness made Nanjiani realize how important their relationship with Gordon really was.
Also true.
“I was terrified we were going to bungle this and you only get one shot,” Nanjiani says. “This is a story that's tremendously important to us and they're not going to reboot this movie if it doesn't work.”
After Apatow signed on to produce, the real-life couple snagged Michael Showalter (Wet Hot American Summer) to direct from a script that they co-wrote together.
It was cathartic for Gordon to relive the Hollywood-ized version of their life, which features Kumail befriending Emily's parents, played by Holly Hunter and Ray Romano, while she's comatose.
“It was nice to right some of the wrongs of our past by writing a funnier, cooler version of our life,” Gordon says.
So did they really meet after they heckled them on stage?
“He said, ‘Is Pakistan in the house,' and I woo-hooed because no one else said anything,” Gordon says smiling. “It wasn't sarcastic… I thought they needed a little assistance in that moment.”
“I will say, and this is the first time I'm saying it, I'm so glad you did that,” Nanjiani replies.
The Big Sick has been hailed by critics as one of the best of the year. But Nanjiani is just happy that they and Gordon have nudged the rom-com genre back into the positive column.
“Just like there was a ton of bad action movies, there were a ton of bad rom-coms and that killed the genre a little bit,” they say. “People started using rom-com as an insult. We wanted to make one that was inspired by really great ones; one that we'd like to watch.”
“I hope people see it and see themselves in it,” Gordon adds. “I hope people see that universality of the emotion of falling in love and disappointing our parents and having to deal with medical stuff — all that stuff is universal.”
Now that they've had success writing one movie together, what'll they tackle for an encore? The werewolf genre.
“Not the Wolfman, that's something completely separate,” Nanjiani jokes.
“We have competing werewolf ideas – I have the female version and they have the male version,” Gordon chuckles. “I think we should write them both and see whose is better.”
“It will be like Bug's Life and Antz,” Nanjiani laughs.
The Big Sick is now playing in select cities. It will expand across Canada on July 7 and July 14.

The multi-million dollar 1000 Genomes project is set to be finished in a year.
The same but different. The 1000 Genomes project aims to catalogue human genetic variation. Punchstock
An almost complete catalogue of human genetic variation could be available by the end of 2009, thanks to a massive genome sequencing project that includes academic and industrial partners around the world.
Announcing completion of the pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes project, the project's co-chair David Altshuler said last week that it has already successfully catalogued 3.8 trillion bases of sequence — approximately a thousand times the number found in a single human genome. Speaking at the annual meeting for the American Society of Human Genetics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Altshuler predicated that the data should be deposited in GenBank, the US National Institutes of Health database for genetic sequences, within the next two months. But that's only around a tenth of the total amount of data the project aims to rack up by the time it has finished.
"One thing we're good at is having ambitious goals," said Alan Guttmacher, interim director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), one of the organizations funding the project — the final cost of which could reach US$50 million.
Variations on a theme
The sequencing initiative is a direct descendant of efforts to sequence the human genome that started in the 1990s. Soon after the announcement of the genome's first draft in 2000, a drive to map all common genetic variations between people began. This effort, known as the International HapMap Project, produced a reference guide of hundreds of millions of single-letter differences among people, which could be used to quickly compare genomes without directly sequencing them. Versions of this map have been used in genome-wide association studies during recent years to find genetic variants that are associated with common diseases, and could point to ways of predicting or even treating those diseases.
But the HapMap details only the most common genetic variants — those that occur in more than 1 in 20 people — and contains little information on rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or on so-called structural variants, such as large block deletions or duplications of gene sequence, which seem to be important in some diseases.
This is where 1000 Genomes comes in, says Altshuler, who is also a professor of genetics and medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. "Next-generation sequencing makes it possible to examine a different part of the allele spectrum," they said. By fully sequencing some 1,200 people from various ethnic groups around the world and looking at parent–child trios alongside data from other sequencing projects, 1000 Genomes hopes to capture rarer genetic variations — namely, those that occur in fewer than 5% and more than 1% of people and some that occur at even smaller frequencies. The work comparing parents and their children could help scientists to get better estimates of the individual mutation rate from generation to generation. "We'll get an unparalleled view of human genetic variation," says Richard Durbin of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, and the other co-chair of 1000 Genomes.
Getting personal
The 1000 Genomes project will contain no detailed demographic or medical information about the people being sequenced so that data can be shared without the need for complicated consent procedures. Meanwhile, another major sequencing effort — the Personal Genome Project, headed by George Church of Harvard Medical School — aims to provide full sequences with medical and personal information for up to 100,000 subjects. Although its goals are less centred on uncovering variation, the Personal Genome Project, together with 1000 Genomes and several other projects looking at genetic variation, will significantly increase the amount of available DNA data for analysis.
The pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes project, which sequenced more than 180 individuals, has identified 4 million SNPs, 22% of which seem to be previously undiscovered. These data will be released in December and January, and quarterly releases are expected throughout 2009 up to the completion of the data-collection phase at the end of next year.
But the near-petabyte levels of data to be collected (by some estimates) pose significant challenges for storage and accessibility, as well as the analysis and usability of the data, says David Haussler, who leads the genome bioinformatics group at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In a nod to this need, the NHGRI announced this month that it will make up to $14 million available during the next two years for data handling and analysis for the project.
In search of 'dark matter'
Once a better catalogue of variation is complete, it could be used to power the next generation of genome-wide association studies to understand disease, potentially filling in some of the so-called missing heritability (see 'Personal genomes: The case of the missing heritability') – the genetic markers for traits or diseases that current association studies have been unable to find. These missing genetic variants have been called the genome's 'dark matter'. But some believe that the rare variants that 1000 Genomes aims to turn up may not provide useful information about disease.
ADVERTISEMENT
"1000 Genomes will be hugely useful for growing the technology to generate and analyse sequence data," says David Goldstein of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, adding "But in terms of a catalogue of the variants most important to human biology and disease, it's less clear how important it will be." Goldstein advocates sequencing people with extreme presentations of disease to understand more about common disease pathways.
Altshuler disagrees with Goldstein but is also cautious. "None of us imagines that we will explain 100% of disease heritability when this is finished, nor will there be drugs in the clinic immediately."
Geneticists, however, are excited about the prospect of exploring DNA's dark matter in a year's time. "I don't think it's going to be dark matter for too long," said David Valle, a clinical geneticist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. "When the light comes, I think we're going to find some interesting biology."
You forgot to test Arctic Breath. IMO it's pretty strong.
Lightning Tendrils yt link is not working.
From what I've seen, Ball Lightning looks strong.
Shock Nova seems good, but it's killing my eyes.
Glacial Cascade would be a lot better with 50%+ Increase AoE.
The Fire spells and Ice Nova feel lackluster. It might be due to not having good cast speed. Dunno. Posted by nebunelux

Yeah I had a flameblast without prolif, and it was about equally bad. BL+Brotherhood is not bad at all. The point of comparing stuff is to see what is bad/what is good. You get to see how mob HP and resist messes up the conversion/freeze/shock mechanics that you'd expect to work in theory.

Good point.

Iconic actor Carrie Fisher was rushed to the hospital after going into cardiac arrest on board an LAX-bound flight. Kate Larsen reports for NBC4 News on Dec. 23, 2016. (Published Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016)
Actress Carrie Fisher suffered a heart attack on a Los Angeles-bound flight Friday, law enforcement officials confirmed to NBC News.
Fisher was in full cardiac arrest on the plane and rushed to a local hospital. They were reported to be in stable condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center several hours later.
Them brother, Todd Fisher, told The Associated Press that they were "out of emergency" and stabilized. They said they could not discuss any other details about what happened.
Passengers were administering CPR on the flight heading from London to Los Angeles International Airport, according to TMZ.
A source told NBC that their condition was "not good."
RAW: Carrie Fisher Talks in Berkeley About Dying, Humor
Actress Carrie Fisher talks about Wishful Drinking, the one-woman show they created and performs that's soon headed to Broadway. They spoke to NBC Bay Area in 2009. (Published Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2016)
United Airlines released a statement about reports of an "unresponsive" passenger on one of their flights, but did not reference Fisher in its comments.
"Medical personnel met United flight 935 from London to Los Angeles upon arrival today after the crew reported that a passenger was unresponsive. Our thoughts are with our customer at this time, and any requests for additional information should be directed to local authorities," the statement read.
The Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics "were standing by for the plane's arrival, provided Advanced Life Support and aggressively treated and transported the patient to a local hospital."
A passenger on board the flight told NBC4 the crew made an announcement 20 minutes before the flight landed to ask if there were any nurses or doctors on board.
Fisher is best known for their role as Princess Leia from "Star Wars."
Mark Hamill, Fisher's co-star in the "Star Wars" movies, tweeted that they are "sending all our love" to Fisher.
Actor Peter Mayhew, the man behind the mask of Chewbacca, asked fans in a tweet to pray for "everyone's favorite princess right now."

About 10 per cent of all structures, which includes detached homes, semi-detached homes, row houses, condos and non-residential structures, were destroyed.
“The biggest thing right now is cleaning up some of the areas and that is going to take awhile before we can start rebuilding,” Iggulden said. “I have mixed feelings (whether it will all be rebuilt). There are plans to move things around and make it better than it was because some of the places that burned are from the 1960s. There will be a lot of upgrading.”
CMHC, the Crown corporation that advises the federal government on housing, says Fort McMurray reconstruction will be strong, but it's not likely to begin in earnest until 2017. The potential exists for construction to be higher than during the peak year of the oil boom when 2,200 homes were started in 2007.
“I think if we buy locally, hire locally, this will help the whole community and allow it to rebuild,” Iggulden said. “The spinoff could be huge.”
In the short-term, CMHC expects Fort McMurray will get an almost immediate boost to the rental vacancy rate, which was at 29 per cent in October 2015, when it was last measured. With residents and workers moving back, that rate is expected to fall.
Sam Kolias, chief executive of Boardwalk Real Estate Investment Trust, which owns eight properties in Fort McMurray, says vacancies are already starting to drop. “We can't predict the future,” they said, when asked how much the vacancy rate might rebound.
Northview REIT, which has about 870 units in Fort McMurray, is also seeing a bit of a bounce back in the last few weeks, the result of workers returning and needing a place to stay while the town is rebuilt and residents who don't have homes to go back to, said chief executive Todd Cook.
“We are seeing a lot more traffic and there will be an uptick in occupancy,” Cook said. “We're focusing on making sure we have space for homeowners, but there is a fair demand from contractors too.”
The support for Fort McMurray's real estate market couldn't have come at a better time. Construction starts in 2015 totalled only 74, the lowest level since 1997. This year only 13 new homes have started construction.
The resale market hasn't fared much better, with existing home sales down 43.5 per cent in 2015 from 2014. Prices have also slumped. The average sale price across the Multiple Listing Service system was $504,097 in the first quarter of 2016, which compares with $608,738 two years earlier. Rental rates dropped 12.7 per cent in 2015 from 2014.
“We are expecting most of the structures to be built,” said Timothy Gensey, market analyst for the prairies and territories region for CMHC. They say municipal policies and insurance will determine how much of the town gets rebuilt, but said active home listings were high before the fire so some returning residents could look to the existing home market rather than building something new.
Part of the problem in predicting what happens with Fort McMurray is still a matter of guessing where the price of oil is going to be.
“We can't really tell. If oil surprises on the upside, we'll get economic tailwinds from an unexpected jump in prices and the reconstruction activity,” Gensey said.

My santa is amazing.
I'm one of those people... you know, the kind that like EVERYTHING? A LOT? That's me. Which may have resulted in my listing off EVERYTHING that I like into whatever the character limit would allow on the questionnaire for my santa. (So sorry!)
REGARDLESS, they did such a wonderful job. I originally signed up for redditgifts solely to do the Lego exchange. I wasn't able to confirm my email address in time and I wasn't matched :( I was super bummed out so I signed up to be a rematcher which I had a lot of fun doing!
So anyway, fast forward to today, at 5:10PM, when my doorbell rings and I FREAK OUT because I had given up all hope on the mail carrier after obsessively refreshing the tracking number all day. I open the door, and what do I do? I pick up the box and shake it like the adult-child that I am and I go, "THIS SOUNDS LIKE LEGOS. NO FREAKING WAY. NOT LEGOS. Calm down." I was so excited to open it that I had to sit with it on the floor for a few minutes. And when I finally opened it... I squealed. I didn't even know I could do that, haha. The thing is, I NEVER get Legos. They're kind of my secret hobby/indulgence that I treat myself to (admittedly too often!) but I never ask for them or expect them from anyone, so this is a first in my adult life. And I am more grateful than these words can even begin to show... it's very special, indeed.
I LOVE the Dorbz figure. I've been collecting Funko pop figures for awhile now (and I have so many!) I've always wanted one from this collection but I always thought ..."mmm, better not," which was right, because now I must have them ALL! (Harley Quinn, solid first Dorbz, too! Love Batman!)
THANK YOU to my most amazing Santa, for going through my endless favorites, making my failed Lego exchange come true, AND somehow knowing that I collect Funko figures! (WHAT?!) So cool. Thank you so much. You are awesome, and that is an understatement.
PS. Totally going to rush through cooking/eating dinner to build the hoth attack tonight :)
Brazil, China and Venezuela sharply critical of 'illegal' program but US says it has taken steps to introduce new guidelines
The US government has defended its use of drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and other countries in front of the UN, telling a chamber full of largely critical nations that in President Obama's view the deployment of unmanned aerial attacks against al-Qaida targets was "necessary, legal and just".
Representatives from a slew of nations, including Brazil, China and Venezuela, lined up to berate the Obama administration for its intensive use of drone strikes. But the US delegation told a plenary meeting of the general assembly in the UN building in New York the president had taken steps to introduce new guidance and standards, and to set out the legal rationale for unmanned weapons deployed in the fight against al-Qaida and affiliated threats.
The UN debate marked the first time that member nations have come together to discuss the rapidly expanding militarised use of remotely piloted aircraft and the fraught international legal issues that it raises. It came at the climax of 10 days in which the question of the legality of drones has caught the headlines, with the release of two UN reports that have sharply condemned aspects of the programmes.
The authors of the two reports addressed Friday's UN debate, beginning with Christof Heyns, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Their study warned of the danger of proliferation of the un-piloted weapons among states and terrorist groups.
In their opening remarks to the UN debate, Heyns said "drones are here to stay". They argued that it was hard to make a case that unmanned aircraft were inherently illegal: "It is difficult to suggest that a weapon system is unlawful because a pilot is not on board."
But they added that drones were easy to deploy across international borders, often secretly. "So it is my view that although they are not illegal, they do pose a challenge, particularly as they are used often in secret, raising accountability issues."
The accountability theme was picked up by the second UN expert, Ben Emmerson, the special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism. Their ongoing investigation into lethal extra-territorial counter-terrorism operations has concluded that the 33 drone strikes that are known to have caused civilian casualties may have been carried out in violation of international law.
They told the assembled nations that lack of transparency was "the single greatest obstacle to an evaluation of the civilian impact of drone strikes and it's a challenge which makes it extremely difficult to assess claims of precision targeting objectively".
They urged delegates to consider whether an absolute ban was needed on secret deals cooked up between states for engagement in joint military actions.
Emmerson also underlined the state of chaos that exists in international law over drones: "Despite the proliferation of this technology, there remains a lack of consensus among international lawyers and between states on the core legal principles."
They added: "It's not the drone that is the problem. The problem is the lack of clarity under which it is lawful to deploy lethal force by drone."
The UK, one of three countries alongside the US and Israel that have attracted most attention for the use of unmanned assault aircraft, also tried to defend its military deployment of the technology. Emmerson's report points out that the UK government has reported only one incident involving civilian casualties: an RAF strike in March 2011 in Afghanistan in which four civilians were killed.
The UK mission attempted to defend its use of drones in military situations, telling the debate that the weapons systems were controlled by personnel on the ground and were therefore not "autonomous" or robotic – a status which would push them over into illegality in the opinions of most legal experts. The UK has no plans to replace controlled drones with autonomous weapons, the UN was told, while the engagement of unmanned planes within the RAF falls under exactly the same strict military rules as ordinary piloted fighter jets.
But several countries questioned the legality of the weapons. Venezuela called drones "flagrantly illegal" and said that by its accounting, 1,800 people had been casualties – only about 10% of whom were "targeted individuals". "This is like a collective punishment," Venezuela's representative said.
Brazil wondered where the line would be drawn in terms of potential targets for drone strikes. "In certain regions we might have sympathisers of terrorists – does that mean they become 'fair game' just because they sympathise with a particular cause, that they are legitimate targets of drone attacks, for yet another kill? This is uncharted waters."
China, which normally keeps to the sidelines of the most contentious international disputes, was driven to state that drones were a "blank space in international law, and this blank space is subject to abuse … We should respect the principles of UN charters, the sovereignty of states and the legitimate rights of the citizens of all countries."
This is a Tinkercad Competition entry.
Easy Edges is the name given to a series of furniture designs by Frank Gehry from 1969 to 1973. These early designs were partially responsible for Gehry's rise to public recognition in the early 1970s. After discovering that corrugated cardboard layered enough times in alternate directions builds strength into the piece and make it suitable for the everyday use, Gehry created a series of pieces of furniture such as the "Easy Edges Wiggle Side Chair" that take advantage of the versatility of cardboard as a medium. Hardboard facing is applied to the furniture's flat surfaces to add to the durability of the designs. Gehry's use of cardboard as a medium demonstrates their "fundamental concern with manipulating basic materials in unconventional ways to produce objects that are functional yet also visually striking".
However, the Easy Edges series never reached high production volumes due to sales prices exceeding rates Gehry had expected. That, in addition to Gehry's aversion to the role of a furniture designer rather than that of an architect resulted in a cessation of production until in 1986 Vitra AG relaunched four models from the Easy Edges series into production (source: publication "Dimensions of Design" by Vitra Design Museum, 1997), including the "Wiggle" chair.

"I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date. I do not know which accounts are unreconciled or whether the unreconciled accounts were or were not subject to the segregation rules." ~ John Corzine
Jon Corzine is a contemporary Richard Nixon: a low rent thief, liar, and American success story.
Corzine, you may recall, bet $6.3 billion on the wrong side of European sovereign debt, a wager their own risk department at MF Global told them was nuts, and a wager so big and so wrong that it wiped out the entire firm.
After the news hit the wire and blood hit the water MF's customers started jumping ship and that is when MF deliberately took customer money as its own to keep its head above water. It was too little, too late. The company filed for bankruptcy protection and Corzine resigned.
Over $1 billion in customer funds remain missing in action.
Depending on who you listen to, Corzine may have known the funds they ordered transferred were customer money. They certainly should have known and there is little dispute they have a serious gambling problem and that they destroyed the savings and lives of hundreds of investors and businesses.
Now, after 10 months of a pretend investigation, one that has not involved so much as an interview by the FBI of Corzine himself, federal prosecutors have decided they are not going to charge them with anything.
Nothing. Nada. Vaya con dios, amigo.
Such is the nature of justice in America's fast lane.
Plausible Deniability Retested
Taking a cue from Nixon's "plausible deniability" gambit, Corzine has reminded us of a few important political truths that every American should remember as they struggle to find a safe place for themselves and whatever money they have left:
1. Former CEOs of Goldman Sachs, like Goldman Sachs itself, are too big and too connected to fail, no matter how egregious their conduct. And, to make sure we all know that, in addition to giving Corzine a pass, the government also announced last week that they are ending an investigation into whether Goldman Sachs misled investors in a $1.3 billion sale of residential mortgage-backed securities in 2006, shortly before the housing crash. You may recall that Goldman was packaging this rancid financial trash so that one client (John Paulson) could short them, while simultaneously selling the other side of the deal to their own clients, conveniently failing to disclose that these instruments were specifically designed to fail.
2. Former US Senators won't be prosecuted for anything, ever, even if caught with underage boys on videotape. They know where too many bodies are hidden, as evidenced by the softballs a fourth grader could have handled when Corzine testified in Congressional hearings on what happened to the money.
3. Big-dollar supporters of any sitting President and their party are too important to lose to jail. Corzine was one of Obama's biggest campaign "bundlers", a way for the rich to gain direct access to a candidate by leaning on people inside their organizations to contribute far more than ostensibly they would have without implicit threats to do so.
Proven Techniques of Truth Suppression
Not wanting to bet the farm solely on their political connections, but needing to make sure the fix was in, Corzine used several of the time-tested "Thirteen Techniques of Truth Suppression", favorites of politicians and their owners who don't want to go to jail, which I estimate to be all of them.
In Corzine's case, they selected from the liar's list as if were a menu of fine wines, first using technique number nine:
Come half-clean. This is also known as ‘confession and avoidance' or ‘taking the limited hang-out route.' This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal "mistakes.' This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken."
Corzine played this gambit well, even professionally, first suggesting that they knew nothing, a proposition so absurd that it fell apart like a cheap suit, then subtly implying that they actually are a moron, a gambler with a problem, too stupid to be held liable for anything, though not in those exact words. Their prepared testimony was, in a word, disturbing: "I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date. I do not know which accounts are unreconciled or whether the unreconciled accounts were or were not subject to the segregation rules. Moreover, there were an extraordinary number of transactions during MF Globals last few days, and I do not know, for example, whether there were operational errors at MF Global or elsewhere, or whether banks and counterparties have held onto funds that should rightfully have been returned to MF Global."
Yes, Corzine swore to all that with a straight face.
To make sure no stonewall was left unturned, Corzine borrowed from the crook's playbook once more, this time technique number ten: Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable." This worked well when the big banks got behind Henry Paulson, another former Goldman Sachs CEO during the housing meltdown, as they explained not-so-patiently that we, the general public, were far too ignorant to ever understand what went wrong and so we should stop trying.
Matt Taibbi observed in their brilliant article in Rolling Stone:
"Theres been an intense effort at trying to convince the public that no crime has been committed. Whoever is handling MF Globals P.R. . . . appears to have convinced the companys officers to emphasize the word ‘chaos' in describing the last days of the firm  as though $1.2 billion wasnt intentionally stolen, per se, but simply lost in a kind of uncontrolled whirlwind of transactions that magically carried the money out of accounts off to worlds unknown."
No one with good sense professes to believe Corzine except those who matter, Congress, and federal prosecutors.
Finally, Corzine called on technique number twelve, Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely," which was easy in this case since they were never interviewed by federal law enforcement, making their inability to prosecute true, albeit pathetic. The fact that MF Global was a client of Attorney General Eric Holder's, and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuers, former law firm Covington & Burling, didn't hurt Corzine's chances either, and the all clear signal was given when Holder (an accomplished criminal in their own right) refused to appoint a Special Prosecutor.
Like Nixon, Corzine is a one-man epidemic of deceit, a thug with the conscience of a rabid hyena, and like Nixon, they are not going to jail.
Epilogue
Not only is Corzine avoiding prosecution, but under the heading of "in your face, MF'er," they are going into business again. Doing what you ask? Handling the money of others, of course. Max Keiser summarized the situation best: "Corzine is considering opening a new hedge fund, though the notion that anyone  even a slack-jawed muppet happy to buy whatever Goldmans prop traders want to sell  would seed Corzine money so they can trade or steal it away seems absurd  rather like putting a child molester in charge of a day-care."
Absurd, yes, but true nonetheless and odds are they will raise millions, and if not become a high-priced political or financial consultant.
The Big Ugly Picture
Corzine is just another poster child for fraud and malfeasance at the highest levels, public and private. Their photo is not alone on that wall of shame.
In the big picture, they are small potatoes. Other bigger players are being given passes for far more egregious crimes. JP Morgan, infamous manipulator of silver, stepped closer to the edge by losing $6 billion in a single trading loss. It's a megalomaniacal CEO, Jamie Dimon, no stranger to truth suppression, expertly employed technique number four: Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike." Dimon took full responsibility (for a nanosecond) before blaming it all on a straw man, a rogue trader who turned out to have all the authority they exercised. No one is going to jail. To the contrary, almost as a gift, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) dropped a four-year investigation (mainly held behind closed doors) into JP Morgan's obvious and rampant silver price manipulation just to show there were no hard feelings.
Still another shining example of "justice", as that term is now defined by the owners, is Barclay's Bank, believed to be a mastermind in the virtually incalculable LIBOR fraud. Its execs have skated criminal prosecution and the bank has paid a relatively meager $350 million fine for everyone to forget it ever happened, except its former CEO, Bob Diamond, who used technique number two: Wax indignant. This is also known as the how dare you? gambit…" after British Parliament observed the obvious  that they are an unmitigated filthy liar like all the rest.
And, then there is Standard Chartered who will pay a $340 million to settle charges that it illegally funneled hundreds of billions of dollars to Iran in violation of innumerable US and international sanctions. No criminal charges, mind you, just $340 million to take care of what amounted to a $250 billion conspiracy. Some might characterize that as a good investment.
Finally, it would be unfair to leave out Morgan Stanley, lead underwriter of the now infamous Facebook offering, who took a play from Goldman Sachs and the great Paulson short. They marketed Facebook stock to the unwitting while shorting it all the way down, making another $100 million.
It is not just about Corzine anymore. The pathology of cronyism is endemic and spreading.
Immoral Of The Story
So, what is the moral of this hideous little tale? What are the lessons for our children?
Perhaps we should sit them down and wax philosophical:
"Kids, you know the old saying that ‘crime doesn't pay?' Well, that's bullshit. Crime pays and pays big unless you are poor and without political connections in which case you will likely join the American gulag and soon.
"And that rule about always telling the truth? How can I put this gently? That's bullshit, too. Liars, good ones, rise to the top of government and corporations. They are sociopaths by nature and have no empathy for anyone other than themselves. They are sick, but they are rich. You can make more money from five minutes knowing the right insider than you can from a lifetime of hard work.
"And, finally, about that Biblical ‘suggestion' to ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you?' Well, that will get you a job selling printer cartridges at Best Buy or teaching yoga to the woo-woos if you are limber.
"No, my children, If you want to make it big in this world, smile, lie, follow the money, suck the ass of those on the fast train, step on the little people and fuck anyone who gets in your way.
"Make Daddy proud."

Hey there Highway Blossoms fans, this is Kevin, the programming/ui/stupid Easter egg guy writing today's blog post. However, most of you following Highway Blossoms probably know me best as the guy who made the reveal trailer we recently premiered at Anime Weekend Atlanta.
That trailer was a lot of fun to work on, especially with how we were able to break up regular 2D drawings into something with more depth than just a regular pan across an image. While that was done in the trailer with standard video production software, we loved the effect so much that we wanted to have it in the actual visual novel itself to not only spice up regular dialogue, but to make sure each special illustration was that much more special. With the help of the fault milestone 3d camera engine, we were able to implement much of what you saw in the trailer in the actual game itself. Combined with Ren'Py 6.99 native resolution text rendering and our new internal rendering standard of 1080p, Highway Blossoms is really nice to look at. But don't just take my word for it; see a preview of the new engine in action:
[We're simply linking it because the embed function seems to be broken right now.]
It really shines with CGs, but we don't want to spoil any special moments for you, so you'll just have to wait a little longer to see those. (Hint: they involve girls falling in love with each other)
While this is great for Highway Blossoms, Human Reignition Project fans are probably wondering how this applies to them. We're happy to announce that these new technologies and development techniques will be coming to the final version of Human Reignition Project as well. No more jittery 2D pans, static backgrounds, or movie-based hacks; the Human Reignition Project will finally look as modern as its setting.
It's a real treat to be able to share all of these new features with our fans. We think you'll really enjoy the extra polish all of these changes add to the experience.
You may recall that a 911 operator emailed TTAG to contradict an article advising people calling 911 to give the operator the salient details of a home invasion – your address, where you are inside the house, what you look like and where the bad guys may be – and then hang up. I stand by my advice. And offer the above 911 recording as evidence. Although it has a happy ending – “What was that?” “Did you think you could beat me half to death?” – riddle me this . . .
what good did the 911 operator do here besides calling the cavalry? What might have happened if the homeowner hadn't been armed and didn't put the phone down and STFU and hide before the cops arrived? And what if the adrenalin-infused homeowner had said something that could have been used against them in court?
In short, you don't need someone to calm you down when facing a deadly threat. You need to concentrate and fight for your life. [h/t Rob]
The most important aspect of the Central American Jihad in the Rio Grande Valley is that Kay Bailey Hutchinson and Jorge Bush are the genesis of today's problem. The failure of the Bush Administration to build the border fence and its collusion with Hutchinson to end funding for the fence directly led to the current influx.
First from 2008:
The Christian Science Monitor By Daniel B. Wood April 1, 2008 Where U.S.-Mexico Border Fence Is Tall, Border Crossings Fall In Yuma, Ariz., border patrol agents tout the success of a high triple-and double-layered wall. But such a fence is unlikely to stretch the entire border. YUMA, ARIZ. — US border patrol agent Michael Bernacke guns their SUV down the wide desert-sand road that lines the US-Mexican border through urban San Luis, Ariz. To their right stands a steel wall, 20 feet high and reinforced by cement-filled steel piping. To their left another tall fence of steel mesh. Ten yards beyond, a shorter cyclone fence is topped with jagged concertina wire. Visible to the north, through the gauze of fencing are the homes and businesses of this growing Southwest suburbia of 22,000 people. "This wall works," says Mr. Bernacke. "A lot of people have the misconception that it is a waste of time and money, but the numbers of apprehensions show that it works." The triple-and double-layered fence here in Yuma is the kind of barrier that US lawmakers – and most Americans – imagined when the Secure Fence Act was enacted in 2006.
SFGate June 30, 2014 by Elliot Spagat Border Patrol Has Lots Of Agents — In Wrong Places SAN DIEGO (AP) — The downcast faces on computer screens are 1,500 miles away at a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas: a 20-year old Honduran woman arrested rafting across the Rio Grande and a 23-year-old man caught under similar circumstances. Four agents wearing headsets reel through a list of personal questions, spending up to an hour on each adult and even longer on children. On an average day, hundreds of migrants are questioned on camera by agents in San Diego and other stations on the U.S.-Mexico border. The long-distance interviews — introduced last year in El Paso, Texas, and extended to California — are a response to the dramatic increase of Central Americans crossing the border in Texas that also has flooded immigration facilities with hundreds of women and children. The Border Patrol does not have the staff to process all the immigrants crossing in the Rio Grande Valley, but faraway colleagues have time to spare.
One example of the staffing mismatch: the roughly 2,500 agents in the San Diego sector arrested 97 immigrants illegally crossing the border on June 14, according to an internal document reviewed by The Associated Press. On the same day, the roughly 3,200 agents in the Rio Grande Valley made 1,422 arrests... In San Diego, the video processing is a welcome change of pace. Arrests are at 45-year lows and many agents go entire shifts without finding anyone. Cesar Rodriguez, who joined the Border Patrol in 2010, said eight hours fly by since they gave up their assignment watching a stretch of scrub-covered hills east of San Diego and took on a new assignment to process the immigrants via video. "If there's nothing going on, what are you going to do? You're just staring at the fence," Rodriguez said in their new office, whose parking lot offers sweeping views of hillside homes in Tijuana, Mexico.
But that was not to be, Hutchinson and Bush saw to that. Flash forward to 2014 and there is no fence in the Rio Grande Valley, but there are 250,000 illegal aliens from Central America in the United States now because there was no fence.And, besides the fact that it is expensive to transfer Federal employees (the government has to pay all the moving expenses)the important factor is that San Diego Border Patrol Agents don't have much to do, for two reasons: One, the triple layered border fence works and Two, the Border Patrol prohibits its agents from heading to the Imperial Valley farms or San Diego's streets to arrest illegal aliens who have settled in those border communities.Even better than the Israeli fence in the Negev, but not as good as the Israeli fence in the West Bank.Even better:But had Hutchinson and Bush not been in cahoots with the cultural Marxists and Mexican, the current crisis would not have happened. Instead of a 72% decline in illegal border crossings, we have an onslaught, a Central American Jihad, a Camp of the Saints in the Rio Grande Valley.
Donald Trump's “assassination threat” against Hillary Clinton appears to have united US newspapers against him.
From coast to coast across the States, papers carried negative headlines and articles about the Republican presidential candidate after their extraordinary remarks about their Democrat rival.
The poster-style front page of the New York Daily News said: “This isn't a joke any more: when Trump hinted gun-rights supporters shoot Hillary, they went from offensive to reckless. They must end their campaign. If they don't, the GOP needs to abandon him.”
This is Donald Trump at their lowest yet: a man hinting at murder | Lucia Graves Read more
The Los Angeles Times's front page carried a picture of Trump speaking with the main headline “Off message” and a sub-deck saying, “The nominee is trumped by again by their own words.”
In the New York Times, an editorial, “Further into the muck with Mr Trump”, stated:
“Seldom, if ever, have Americans been exposed to a candidate so willing to descend to the depths of bigotry and intolerance as Mr Trump. That they would make Tuesday's comment amid sinking poll numbers and a wave of Republican defections suggests that when bathed in the adulation of a crowd, Mr Trump is unable to control himself.”
The paper's columnist, Thomas Friedman, in a piece headlined “Trump's ambiguous wink wink to ‘second amendment people'”, argued that it was the kind of menacing language reminiscent of the extremist talk that led to the assassination of Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.
Even though Trump was making a bad joke, there will be people who don't get it and, instead, hear only the big message. Friedman concluded:
“People are playing with fire here, and there is no bigger flamethrower than Donald Trump. Forget politics; they are a disgusting human being. Their children should be ashamed of him. I only pray that they are not simply defeated, but that they lose all 50 states so that the message goes out across the land — unambiguously, loud and clear: The likes of you should never come this way again.”
That message was certainly to the fore in other American newspapers, from the Washington Post (“Trump decried for gun remark”) to the Denver Post (“Shooting off their mouth”), and from the Chicago Tribune (“Trump's comments stir up new firestorm”) to the Wisconsin State Journal (“Trump seen as pushing violence”).
Online outlets were similarly critical. Politico carried the line “Trump's loaded words fuel campaign freefall” while the Huffington Post simply said “No more.”
But Trump still appears to have some support. In an interview after their controversial speech with Fox News (prop: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp), Sean Hannity didn't so much let Trump off the hook as give them a lifeline.
After playing a clip of Trump's comments, Hannity said to him: “So, obviously you are saying that there's a strong political movement within the second amendment, and if people mobilise and vote they can stop Hillary from having this impact on the court. But that's not how the media is spinning it.”
In other words, here's the answer I want you to give. You didn't mean anything by it, did you?
Trump was delighted. As the Daily Beast reported, they even dared to suggest that the controversy was a “good thing” for them because it will inform more people about their pro-gun stance. Truly, with Donald Trump, you couldn't make it up... and you don't need to.
Kyle MacLachlan in Twin Peaks: The Return.
The reviews were great, the media buzz often deafening, but the hard truth about Twin Peaks: The Return is this: Showtime's limited-series revival of David Lynch's 1990s masterpiece was a ratings disappointment. Despite decades of anticipation and a preexisting fan base for a show, which first aired when most Americans had access to less than three dozen TV channels (and no internet), a mere 2 million viewers on average watched or streamed the summer series during its three-and-a-half month run. That's half the multi-platform audience of a nascent Showtime hit such as Billions (roughly 4.6 million viewers) or the first season of the network's critically acclaimed but hardly a blockbuster The Affair (4.1 million). This almost certainly wasn't the sort of response Showtime execs were hoping for when they green-lit the Twin Peaks revival back in 2014. And yet, despite the softer-than-expected numbers, the network likely doesn't regret its decision to spend the summer hangin' with Agent Cooper. Here are three reasons why:
For premium channels such as Showtime, buzz and critical acclaim are massively important metrics.
Even in the age of streaming, ratings are crucial to the business model of networks such as ABC or FX since a big chunk of their revenue comes from advertisers (and advertisers want to know people are watching their commercials). But a network like Showtime doesn't live or die by how many people watch any one of its series. Instead, its goal is to attract new subscribers while convincing existing customers not to cancel. It does this by making sure subscribers feel as if they're getting their money's worth — that there's enough programming to merit the monthly fee. Programs that have the aura of Must-See TV around them, even if not that many folks are actually seeing them right now — boost the brand of an HBO or Showtime almost as much as ones that get lots of viewers but not as much media or Emmy love.
Case in point: The first season of HBO's Veep had an average multi-platform audience of just 3.9 million viewers back in 2012, nearly half the tune-in for that same year's inaugural run of its Aaron Sorkin drama, The Newsroom. But Veep cleaned up at the Emmys and generated endless raves about almost every episode, while most of the chatter about Newsroom was about how … not great it was. HBO kept Newsroom around for three seasons because, well, Aaron Sorkin. In the end, the show with the lower ratings ended up being one of the network's signature comedies while the higher-rated drama ended after just 25 episodes. Fact is, while networks such as HBO or Showtime certainly want to have a few shows on their roster that attract a relatively large audience, and launching a blockbuster such as Game of Thrones has its perks, shows that get people talking and critics kvelling can have just as much merit as most ratings “hits.” Twin Peaks started generating positive buzz for Showtime the moment it was announced in 2014 and will likely continue doing so all the way through until next September's Emmy Awards.
Doing risky fare boosts Showtime's credibility with audiences and the creative community.
While Twin Peaks: The Return often gets lumped with TV's current wave of reboots and reunions, Showtime's decision to hand Lynch tens of millions to revive their long-dormant series was not the obvious cash grab that, say, Netflix's Fuller House represented. Sure, the network was bringing back a property with an established fan base and widespread name recognition (at least among baby-boomers and Gen-Xers). While Showtime execs figured those two factors might encourage sampling of the revival, they were all too aware Lynch was unlikely to spend a few years of their life on a nostalgia play. Their movie follow-up to the series, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, made it clear they aren't interested in giving audiences another serving of the soapy cherry pie they and Mark Frost served up for ABC back in the 1990s. Lynch even gave Showtime chief David Nevins a very easy out early in the preproduction process when they kinda sorta quit the show due to concerns over an inadequate budget. Nevertheless, Nevins persisted. They let Lynch move forward with something they had to know deep down wasn't going to set ratings records. In the end, Twin Peaks probably didn't meet even Showtime's modest expectations. But the network's commitment to supporting Lynch's vision sent a clear signal to Showtime subscribers: This is a network that's okay with weird stuff, that lets creators see their visions through.
Of course, Showtime is hardly unique in offering such creative freedom. HBO has always been known as an artist's haven, and Netflix has one-upped its legacy linear rivals by remaining (mostly) hands-off when it comes to day-to-day production decisions made by its showrunners. FX, AMC, Amazon, Hulu, and even TBS have also become known for their commitment to the edgy and experimental. The fact that so many outlets are now willing, even eager, to let creators go out on a limb makes it all the more vital for a network such as Showtime — which doesn't have the deep, deep pockets of some of its competitors — to underscore its unflinching support for audacious efforts such as Peaks. When Lynch last spring told Variety's Maureen Ryan their relationship with Showtime was “solid gold,” you could almost imagine Nevins printing the quote out and sending it to every major agent in Hollywood. Money matters (a lot) when series creators shop their projects, but knowing a network will stand behind their vision — and do all it can to get eyeballs in front of it — is often the deciding factor in determining where a sought-after project lands.
Showtime's unflinching support for Peaks, as well as a relentless marketing campaign that began almost the moment the show was announced, will end up a not-insignificant calling card for Nevins as they battle HBO and Netflix in pursuit of ideas.
The show will remain a valuable asset for years.
Despite that cliff-hanger ending, Showtime execs have long stated they envisioned the new Peaks as a one-shot limited-series event. So unlike NBC's Will & Grace revival, which has already been picked up for a second season, Showtime wasn't hoping to establish a new franchise that would live on for several years. This fact makes the soft initial numbers for Peaks redux much easier to take. Though Showtime and Lynch haven't entirely slammed the door on another batch of episodes, Twin Peaks: The Return exists as a finished project, a complete work of art ready to be consumed by audiences at any time on Showtime's multiple linear and digital platforms. Like the full series runs of Sex and the City still capturing new eyeballs on HBO Go and HBO Now, or the countless 1990s sitcoms millennials and Gen-Z viewers have “discovered” on Netflix (how you're doin', Friends?), Peaks will continue attracting new viewers for the foreseeable future.
It'll be a brand-name property Showtime's marketing whizzes will be able to point to as they woo new subscribers: “Sign up for Showtime Anytime, and watch the show critics raved about!” (Plus, the show is a global property, with a big international fan base already being monetized by the network's distribution team).
Now, based on the modest linear numbers for Peaks, the show probably won't be as effective driving digital subscriptions as Games of Thrones or even Showtime's own Homeland. But early evidence suggests there are plenty of folks who've just been waiting a beat before beginning a Peaks binge. While the average episode of Peaks has been seen by 2 million viewers, the first hour of the show has been watched by 4 million viewers, Showtime says. Even if some of those 4 million gave up after the out-there pilot, it's a safe bet many continued watching — and that a significant number of new viewers will jump in for the first time now that the complete series is available to stream. Die-hard Peaks-philes may have wanted to see each episode the minute it aired, but for a generation of viewers accustomed to the Netflix/Amazon all-at-once model, Lynch's vision is probably better suited to a binge-watch.
It's worth noting that the only reason there's any real debate about the success or failure of Twin Peaks: The Return is because ratings data for the show's linear run is widely available via Nielsen, and Showtime has released information about audience consumption via non-linear platforms. If Lynch had sold the show to Netflix, Amazon or Hulu, the media conversations revolving around the show would deal with how many Emmys it might win in 2019, or how wondrous a thing it is that Peak TV lets filmmakers such as Lynch and Frost realize their visions in a way network TV in the 1990s quite couldn't. That's because those streaming outlets don't let anyone know who's watching or when. Those of us in the media declare Stranger Things or The Handmaid's Tale “hits” using the same logic as frustrated parents trying to justify decisions to questioning kiddies: because we said so. But Showtime's business model isn't all that different from Netflix's: Both measure success by subscriber growth and retention, not by who watches within a narrow window of time. Twin Peaks had the same mostly rapturous reviews as the asupervisorstioned streaming series. It set social media ablaze on nights episodes aired, particularly when it first premiered. And entertainment websites like Vulture couldn't stop writing about it. If you put aside old-school metrics, and play by the new rules of Peak TV, Twin Peaks: The Return was far from a disappointment. It was the smash TV hit of the summer.
India is the most sexually contradictory place on earth, the most prudish and permissive. There, holy men proudly exhibit elongated penises they've painfully stretched over years by tying them to boulders, and parents take their children to temples full of sculpted figures locked in graphic and gymnastic copulation. Nonetheless, furious protests take place each year against the "western festival" of Valentine's Day, and making a gentle pass at a woman can easily start a riot.
All of these contradictions are manifested in Indian cinema, for which rape, infidelity and romance have been staple storylines since its inception, though showing the merest onscreen kiss has been a taboo. Last week saw the first London screening of Love, Sex Aur Dhoka (Love, Sex and Pain), Bollywood's belated attempt at addressing India's increasing sexual openness. The film caused a kerfuffle in India with its voyeuristic storyline and CCTV footage of a couple writhing on the floor. But that scene, excitedly described on Wikipedia as a "seven-minute long bareback love-making scene" was cut by the censors to a short sequence showing only a woman's blurry, naked back as they wriggle on top of a man.
The primness of Indian cinema is at odds with wider society. Throughout the country, the government routinely puts up huge posters extolling condom use, and ordinary Indians often live with a degree of tolerance that is rare in Britain. Itinerant workers celebrate in their slum when the wife they haven't seen in years writes telling them she's just borne them a son, and many Indian men fondly remember the "aunty" they skipped school to lose their virginity with while their husband was at work.
Why, unlike almost everywhere else, are Indian films much more conservative than reality? Farrukh Dhondy, who wrote the script for Bandit Queen, suggests it is because the cinema has taken the temple's role in society. "India is so disparate that cinema became the national lingua franca and its national religion. People go to the cinema to worship the idols on screen. The characters are icons telling morality tales. There are ravaanas (demons), but they are always defeated.
"Indian cinema isn't novelistic. It does not draw from real life, it only creates myths. Hollywood creates myths, too, but there's a lot of observational stuff there also. In India, films are treated like religion and that's why the stars are so idealised. Like gods in a temple, characters on the screen are treated with reverence."
Dhondy tried breaking the mould when they wrote the movie Split Wide Open in 1999. "It was all about the seamy side of Mumbai life – paedophilia, conniving wives and homosexuality among the upper classes, and whatnot. But the censor cut it awfully, and when the producer complained, saying it ruined the integrity of the film, this sari-wearing Indian woman replied, 'Why are you making a fuss? We have given you three "fucks", what more do you want?' And that was all we were given."
The director Deepa Mehta also tentatively tested boundaries but caused outrage. Them 1996 film Fire caused much harrumphing at its anodyne depiction of middle-class lesbianism, while its sequel, Water (2005), led to rioting. That film only stated the common knowledge that widows dumped at temple refuges are often forced into prostitution. Reactionaries objected to that fact being displayed onscreen far more than the actual practice itself.
"Indians go to the cinema to goggle and worship," says Dhondy. "They don't want the truth." In Britain, no one would screen pornography in a church, but in India, it's the reverse. Explicit sex is on show in the temples, while the movies don't even get to first base.
THE Australian Industry Group will launch an assault on Labor's industrial relations system today, blaming the Fair Work Act for the country's feeble productivity growth.
Previously cautious in their remarks about the act and consulted closely by Julia Gillard as industrial relations minister in drafting it, Ai Group chief executive Heather Ridout will tell a workplace conference that after two years, parts of it have been ''found wanting''.

''The idea that the Fair Work Act represents the perfect balance between all the competing interests and should not be altered is simply not sustainable,'' they will tell the conference. ''It is common for new, major pieces of legislation to lead to unintended consequences and the Fair Work Act is no exception.
''Any country, which freezes its workplace relations system in time and decides that no further improvements are desirable or necessary, will subject its citizens to low levels of productivity growth, reduced employment, reduced competitiveness, and harsh effects from globalisation.''

Asked by CNN's Manu Raju if the obstruction probe was one of the areas that the committee could investigate without conflicting with other Senate and House committees, Grassley replied, "I think that everything's on the table."
Grassley also hinted in an earlier interview with Politico that obstruction of justice would be one of the areas their committee would pursue.
“I don't want to say for sure. But I don't know how you can avoid it,” Grassley told Politico regarding the possibility of an obstruction probe. “Because the FBI was investigating it before there was a special counsel.”

President Donald Trump has surrounded themselves with anti-abortion activists during their campaign and since becoming president. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is a staunch opponent of abortion with a history of opposing access to contraceptives. Teresa Manning, who became the deputy assistant secretary of population affairs at HHS, is the head of family planning efforts but doesn't believe access to contraceptives can help reduce abortions. In fact, in a 2003 radio interview they said “the incidence of contraception use and the incidence of abortion go up hand in hand.” Meanwhile, the former head of Americans United for Life, Charmaine Yoest, is assistant secretary of public affairs at HHS.
Add to this list Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal lawyers hired over the summer to defend the president in the high-profile investigation into whether Russia hacked the US election. As we reported in 2012, “In the conservative political world, Jay Sekulow is hailed as an avowed crusader for religious liberty and the super-attorney behind the American Center for Law and Justice, a group Time magazine called a ‘powerful counterweight to the liberal American Civil Liberties Union.'” They have also been deeply involved in the anti-abortion movement for nearly 30 years, and in 2015 they began to represent the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) in lawsuits resulting from the deceptive and discredited videos it produced that suggested Planned Parenthood profited off the sale of “baby parts.”
Sekulow has had a long history as a legal activist for the anti-abortion movement. In 1992, they argued in support of the radical anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and others in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, where the court ruled anti-choice protesters blocking access to abortion clinics were not violating the constitutional rights of women. As Rewire reports in its story about Sekulow's anti-abortion work:
Sekulow defended anti-choice activists in the 1997 Supreme Court case Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, where the Court ruled that “fixed buffer zones” around abortion clinics were constitutional. They lost a 2000 case before the Court in Hill v. Colorado, which ruled in favor of Colorado restrictions on “sidewalk counseling” outside of abortion clinics. In a biography posted to their website, Sekulow boasted that they have “submitted numerous amicus curiae briefs to the Supreme Court in some of the most groundbreaking litigation of the past quarter century” such as “pro-life legislation including the federal ban on partial birth abortion.”
The American Center for Law and Justice was created by televangelist Pat Robertson in 1990 and has also been involved in efforts to challenge the Affordable Care Act's mandate that insurance provide contraceptive coverage with no out-of-pocket costs. In addition to their legal advocacy, Sekulow is a reliable guest on many conservative talk shows. On The Sean Hannity Show, they compared the contraceptive mandate to forcing people to eat pork when their religion forbids it.
They also use their radio show, Jay Sekulow Live!, to talk about their views on abortion, according to Rewire.
Sekulow seemingly defended Trump ahead of the 2016 GOP primary election after the then-candidate suggested in March 2016 that those who have abortions should face “some form of punishment” should Roe v. Wade be overturned by the Supreme Court and the procedure be made illegal by some states. During a subsequent March 31 edition of their radio program, Sekulow agreed that women could face punishment in some places should abortion be made illegal. Suggesting that should some laws, seemingly such as so-called personhood laws, be put in place to legally consider a fetus a person, Sekulow said, according to Right Wing Watch, that, legally, “a state could say anybody involved in the process [of an abortion] is committing a crime, if you believe it's a person.” “There's a political question whether they should be,” they continued. “I think that's a legitimate point. But the legal issue is not improbable.”
In addition to their work on Russia, Sekulow's presence in the White House gives one of the leading anti-abortion legal experts access to the president, whose administration has already started chipping away access to reproductive health care.
Do you need a university degree to get a coder job? Is a generic Computer Science degree best or are there more specific programs?
I got this email with Python career questions from newsletter reader Brad:
First, with regards to your Python Tricks book, I thought it was well-written and well-priced. I got good use out of, I'd say, 4 or 5 sections. I've been writing in Python for a little under a year now. I'm entirely self-taught and had 0 programming experience prior. I've picked it up pretty quickly though just by devouring any book I can get my hands on. (McKinney, Hilpisch, Shaw, Sargent/Stachurski, yours, etc.) Here is my question: If I'm thinking about making Python the core of my career/job rather than just a smaller part of it, is formally going back to school necessary in your opinion? If so, where do I start looking—at general comp sci degrees or are there more specific programs out there? How many self-taught guys do you know who have done very well for themselves?
Alright, I counted at least three questions in there 🙂
Let's tackle them one by one. I'll get on the “is formally going back to school necessary to get a coder job” question first:
Getting a formal computer science degree is the “classical” option (it's the path that I went down.) And I think it's a thorough and helpful option if you love doing a deep dive on CompSci theory.
I would not do this and get a CS degree purely for career options, however. Do it if you love and enjoy computer science and want to focus a few years on building your skills with a solid theoretical foundation. Don't do it if your biggest goal is to “get a job” as a dev—
Here's the reason why:
In my experience most schools don't teach very many practical skills or help you build up a portfolio as part of their CS programs. So that's something you'd have to figure out on your own and do it on the side. (Brad sounds really proactive so this might not be a problem.) Also, getting a formal degree can be quite expensive—and, as I said, it's probably not the fastest route to “employability.”
Let's talk about the alternatives to general Computer Science degrees that Brad asked about in their email:
If you don't want to go down the formal education route and your main goal is to get a coder job, another option would be joining a development bootcamp.
That's a practical, hands-on experience lasting several weeks (and up to around 3 months) where you meet, code, and learn with peers and mentors. The greatest benefit of doing a bootcamp is that you'll end up with some example projects and code in your portfolio that you can show in an interview.
You know, for employers the biggest challenge in hiring junior/entry-level developers is that there's little or no data about their past performance. So if someone who's still early in their career looking for their first job it helps a lot if they can share some example code (on their GitHub profile etc.)
These programs can work well for someone who's committed. I've worked with people who had entered the dev industry that way and who are now well on their path towards building a programming career.
So, attending a dev bootcamp might be an option worth exploring for you. It's also a smaller commitment that a CS degree from a time and money perspective. Plus, you can pair it with online training classes to get up to speed on the theoretical fundamentals and to ensure you keep improving after the bootcamp is over.
But just to be clear:
A 3 month coding bootcamp is never going to replace the breadth and depth of a 4 year bachelor's Computer Science program. There's a lot of material to cover and it takes time and long-term effort to absorb it all. But if your goal is to get a paid job as a coder as quickly as possible they can be a valid option.
Something else you want to keep in mind is that it can be challenging to find a high-quality Python bootcamp with a good curriculum and engaging teachers—especially if you live outside the United States.

Rich Stanton is in Iceland attending EVE Fanfest, CCP's celebration of internet spaceships and those who love them. They were there when the company revealed Project Legion, and they tracked down CCP staff to get details of the new sandbox shooter set in the EVE universe.
Finally. Among CCP's odd decisions over the years, surely one of the strangest was in making Dust-514 a Playstation 3 exclusive – and compounding this by releasing it at the end of the console's lifecycle. One could speculate that this was all down to a giant cheque from Mr Sony, but at Eve Fanfest's Dust-514 keynote the inevitable was announced. EVE's Project Legion, a free-to-play PC shooter, aims to make Dust-514 look like a dry run.
But it's not Dust. CCP have been scrupulous about distinguishing between the two games, and insist both Dust and Legion will be developed in parallel. This may again be down to Sony's cheque, because although menu screens and the like are clearly different, the core shooting seems to share many similarities. This is of course not good news for Dust fans, but it may not be very good news for prospective Legion fans either.
There are two things to say about Dust as a foundation. The first is that it was not a very good game at launch. The second is that it's subsequently become much better, thanks to CCP's trademark post-launch care, but not to the extent that you'd place it anywhere near the top tier of shooters. It is not a matter of mechanics so much as of polishing mechanics; everything in Dust-514 works well enough, but very few elements of it are exceptional.
Dust-514 was developed by CCP's Shanghai studio, and a (currently) small team of around 60 there is also handling Legion. The lines really are blurry here; in short, it seems CCP wants to take aspects of Dust and re-build a massively multiplayer shooter framework around them. Perhaps the most obvious difference at first glance is how players use the starmap – one of EVE's most signature sights, an expansive and seemingly endless representation of the universe. In Legion this will be used to pick combat zones depending on their security status and what loot is available, the suggestion being that better players will be able to go straight for the big prizes.
Part of this is the introduction of PvE in the form of salvage drones. A key aspect EVE's lore is that the universe's mega corporations send drones down to battlefields to scavenge what there is of value – and one of their kinks is that they don't necessarily distinguish between living and dead loot opportunities. So it will be possible to play Legion as a pure co-op shooter, hunting down these drones and trying to claim their salvage for oneself – with drones in highsec less lethal and giving up blander prizes, but lowsec drones having more punch and better loot.
This feeds into another area that CCP regards as key to Project Legion's success or otherwise; the economy. Basically scavenging can get you gear, but it seems to be primarily a way of accumulating ISK. The promise is of an economy that works in the same way as that of EVE, though with so little shown of it and EVE's much grander scope it's hard to see how this can be achieved. A dash of scepticism may be necessary here, at least until more is shown, but then on the other hand you have the vast improvement Dust has shown since release – something even its fiercest critics must acknowledge.
But the most intriguing link is of course the one to EVE Online itself. I spoke to Atli Mar Sveinsson, the creative director of CCP Asia, about Project Legion and asked them to clear this up first. “So the games are not linked in the form of a couple of barrels being shot on a planet's surface from orbit. They're primarily linked by corporations and social networks and that is actually what we care most about. Of course we care about the footprints in the sand between games, but at its core this is about socialisation – that, more than a specific feature, drives us to certain conclusions.”
Sveinsson also clarifies for me that the Legion of the title is not meant to reference a Roman Legion – that is, not 100-player battles. Rather it's the sense of ‘I am Legion' and making players feel they have the strength of 100 soldiers. This makes me curious about CCP Shanghai's size, and how many are working on Legion. “Right now we have between 80 and 100 people,” says Sveinsson. “But the reason I'm unsure of exact numbers is because that includes support staff for EVE China, so I'd say the development team is more like 60 people.”
So what about the actual gametypes, the nitty-gritty where EVE's open gameplay translates into a much more traditional (and some might say unimaginative) structure. “You ask me if it will be the same as in Dust where we kind of retrofit team deathmatch gameplay onto planets? In a sandbox wouldn't it be better to allow it to be a continuation of the sandbox elements? In terms of say, a flag, and I don't know if that's some massive structure or a literal flag – why not let the players direct it?”
“We're moving away from that more rigid structure,” says Sveinsson. “Even Planetside is rigid in that sense of it has capture points and stuff and it's rinse-and-repeat. But I would say we're moving more towards the DNA of CCP – give players a set of tools and then be surprised when they use those tools in strange and interesting ways.”
I ask about the timeframe – because Dust-514 didn't make its initial release date, and CCP are being coy about Legion's ETA. “Right now it's a prototype,” says Sveinsson. “We put together the team – it's the same team really, a lot of people from the Dust team but we carved people out. For me I've been on the project for so long it was great to see it with new eyes, we came up with a vision and decided to let the team loose – and how quickly the team has put together something that looks so good. And all of that footage is real, it's crazy. It's not a linear effort, it's logarthymic you know, so although we can't say dates I want to be clear that it's not because we don't want to – it's because we have a history both at CCP and at CCP Shanghai to be very confident about times, and sometimes we haven't been able to realise them. Right now we're much more focused on being honest and up-front with people like you and saying we don't know.”
One of the things about Fanfest is the excitement. EVE fans have wanted Dust on PC since Dust was a thing, and so Legion's announcement was met with the kind of cheers and whoops usually reserved for new ship animations. It's easy to forget in such circumstances the challenges that the game itself will face on a platform that's already overflowing with great free-to-play team shooters – and the EVE audience, large as it is, is unlikely to sustain a F2P shooter on its own back.
Sveinsson says the two audiences – EVE fans and non-EVE fans – “are not mutually exclusive.” But clearly much remains to be seen about Legion – not least how it plays. Dust was a shooter that launched too early – “and we knew this” says Sveinsson. In some ways it hasn't thrown off that launch, though anyone who tries the game now on PS3 may be pleasantly surprised. If there is one thing CCP has proved itself expert at, however, and may be emulating here, it is iteration. Legion might excite the non-EVE fans among us yet, mutually exclusive or not. But if the talk of a freeform FPS where objectives are set by players, among a landscape of PvE opportunities, has anything to it – well, this could be something that gets more than just Fanfest attendees whooping.
It had been a successful mission, and the crew prepared to slowly start the long controlled fall home after completing the retroburn from the Orbital Maneuvering System. But unbeknown to them, the first hint of trouble appeared a few minutes after Entry Interface, defined as 400,000 feet altitude.
The vehicle was still moving at about Mach 24 -- twenty-four times the speed of sound. The yaw moment had changed almost imperceptibly, with a gentle tug to the left -- there was a slight asymmetry in the aircraft's aerodynamics, but no one on the ground or in the cabin noticed it at the time.
Twelve seconds later, a temperature sensor indicated that a hydraulic brake line in the left wing was warmer than it should have been, and was slightly out of specification in that regard. As the vehicle was gradually slowing down, perceived gravity slowly growing to an indiscernible hundredth of a Fee, fiery hot plasma was infiltrating through the hole in the leading edge, insinuating itself into the interior of the wing and starting to damage it, but none realized it yet.
A minute or so later, as they approached the California coast from three hundred miles out, an off-nominal rolling moment appeared, more evidence of subtle changes to the vehicle's outer shape. A few seconds later, Mission Control received a signal that several sensors were starting to indicate problems, but no one on board or in the control room was yet aware.
Half a minute later, still going Mach 23 after crossing the coastline, observers on the ground in California saw an eight-pound piece of the left wing separate from the vehicle, creating a luminescent trail in the plasma, though they didn't know at the time what they were seeing. No one in Houston or in the cabin was aware of this. About the same time, the side-slip angle exceeded any previous entry experience, as the vehicle was no longer moving in a pure forward motion. A little over half a minute later, the left elevon started to trim to compensate for the off-nominal forces, but no one noticed at the time.
A few seconds later, as the craft crossed the border into Nevada, someone in Mission Control finally noted the temperature-sensor anomalies from a couple minutes earlier.
A few more seconds after that, as the crew was doing a pressure check on their suits in preparation for landing, the brightest piece of debris was shed, but the sensors indicated nothing, and no one on board saw it.
The crew started to really sense the deceleration -- about a third of a gravity -- a minute or so later, as the dynamic pressure increased to forty pounds per square foot. This was a value that allowed the aero surfaces to take over from the small rockets that had been controlling the vehicle's attitude. Thirty seconds later, they commenced the first roll reversal to bleed off excess energy, from right-wing low to left-wing low, starting the standard series of S-turns as they approached their eventual landing site. For the veterans on board, the entry seemed to be going normally.
But a picture taken from an infrared camera in New Mexico showed some bulges in the flow field on the left wing that couldn't be explained by the vehicle attitude. No one saw it until later. The trim on the elevon was now departing sharply from a standard entry, as it fought to maintain the nominal attitude in the face of increasing asymmetric aerodynamic loads.
A little over half a minute later, alarms went off in the cabin as sensors indicated problems with pressure in the left main tire. A few seconds later, there was a false signal that the gear itself on that side was deployed and locked. After a minute or so, the crew received a call from mission control about the tire-pressure issue. Within a few seconds, the left elevon had lost control authority to maintain the proper pitch and roll rate. At that point, the yaw jets, which usually operated in pulse mode, started to fire continuously in a vain attempt to prevent the vehicle from turning to the left. The crew could have seen the indicator lights for this, and a rapid decrease in the propellant on the gauge, but we'll never know if they did, because the signal was lost at about that time and mission control had received their last transmission. But the flight control system started annunciating its own master alarm, as actuators started to fail, which wouldn't have gone unnoticed.
Within a few seconds, the hydraulics themselves failed, and the vehicle was out of control. It started to transition from a controlled glide to a ballistic trajectory, like a misshapen cannonball. What had been a forward-moving aircraft started to corkscrew, something that the commander and pilot couldn't have failed to observe, both from the unexpectedly changing acceleration and shifting horizon in the windshield. The mission specialists behind them on the flight deck probably realized that things were going south as well. A few seconds later, the cover of the left Orbital Maneuvering System pod was torn off, and the top of the cabin started to overheat.
The acceleration was starting to build up, but the crew did manage to restore the mode of the digital autopilot to auto when it was accidentally changed to manual, a few seconds later. At that point, the reaction control system was out of propellant, having fought as long as it could to keep the vehicle under control. Seeing the loss of hydraulic pressure from the failed actuators, the flight crew attempted to restart the Auxiliary Power Units that drove the pumps, to no avail. It was likely their last conscious act to save themselves.
The left wing was tearing off, shearing the softened and melting aluminum, and the noise within the cabin would have been horrific. The vehicle started to pitch up.
Within another ten or fifteen seconds, attacked by the dynamic pressure from a direction never planned by the vehicle's designers, the payload-bay doors blew off, exposing the payload bay itself to the brutal force. The hurricane of plasma separated the forebody of the vehicle, with the crew cabin, from the rest.
With all power lost, the cabin went dark other than sunlight and earthlight from the windows, but not silent, and started tumbling. The hull itself was quickly breached, and rapidly started to lose pressure. The crew had never closed the helmets of their flight suits, but it probably didn't really matter. From either the rapid accelerations or the decompression, unconsciousness likely came very quickly, which is merciful, because the heat started to melt the structure itself, spattering molten metal within.
The fiery cabin, now briefly their airborne coffin, continued its long, thirty-four mile uncontrolled parabolic fall over northern Texas, with the charred remains of its inhabitants, until it came completely apart from the increasing atmospheric pressure forces and all took their own path to the earth. Ironically, and perhaps almost poetically, had it occurred an orbit later (as they had considered earlier that day for weather reasons at the planned landing site in Florida), Johnson Space Center would have been ground zero. The heaviest debris would have rained over the southwest Houston neighborhoods in which they had lived at supersonic speeds, and in which their co-workers continued to live. It might have even hit the Mission Control Center itself, where so many of the fateful, and ultimately fatal decisions had been made.
We will never know what thoughts went through the minds of Columbia's doomed crew in that last minute in which they were becoming aware of their imminent peril. Perhaps, being the rational pilots and engineers that they were, they were simply focused on trying to save the ship. It could have been something as pragmatic as, “I wish that we'd had a better look at the leading edge of that wing.” What we can know is that they died doing something that they had worked years to be able to do, and they loved it, and thought it important. If we now fear to open up the high frontier because of what happened to them, they will have died in vain.
This article is the prologue of the forthcoming book, titled "Safe Is Not An Option: How Our Futile Obsession With Getting Everyone Back Alive Is Killing Our Future In Space."
Right-wing commentator Josh Bernstein posted a video recently in which they suggested that God is opposed to the removal of Confederate monuments and is divinely intervening to prevent them from being taken down.
Discussing a decision by “communist” Dallas officials to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a city park, Bernstein said that the first crane brought in to do the job was too small, forcing the city to bring in a larger crane. After praising several companies for refusing to help the city with this effort, Bernstein noted that a larger crane was eventually found, but that it got into a fatal accident on its way to the job site.
“I don't do a religious show,” Bernstein said, “but isn't this a little odd that two attempts have been made to take down this statue and, for whatever reasons, they have not been successful—the second of which being a fatal accident. Is this divine intervention, folks? Is this maybe a sign from up above, saying you shouldn't remove this statue?”
For the record, the statue was successfully removed last night.
Well, this is rich.
Affluent millennials are far more likely than rich seniors to think that money and power go hand in hand in a relationship. Indeed, two in three (66%) rich millennials -- people ages 21-36 with more than $1 million in investable assets -- who are married or living with a partner agree with the statement “whoever earns the most money has the most influence in the relationship.” That's compared to just 37% of Gen Xers and 29% of boomers, according to a U.S. Trust study released Tuesday of more than 800 high-net-worth adults.
Elizabeth Lombardo, psychologist and author of Better Than Perfect: 7 Strategies to Crush Your Inner Critic and Create a Life You Love, says it's because millennials are both driven by purpose, and are very motivated by money. “Consider a family like the Kardashians who are incredibly influential due to their wealth and how they choose to use it,” they say. Millennials have grown up with people like this in the spotlight, and thus often feel “a greater focus on wealth and its power as compared to other generations,” they explain. And this, in turn “can play out in relationships, where the individual who earns the most executes greater influence on decisions within that relationship,” they say.
Rich or not, many millennials say the power dynamic that a major income disparity can create is very real -- but one that can be dealt with so one person doesn't wield too much influence over the other. Tara Gentile, 34, who supports their stay-at-home husband with the income from their app CoCommercial, knows the feeling. “In my experience, there is absolutely a power dynamic that has to be managed, especially as a female breadwinner,” they tell Moneyish. In their case, sometimes their husband feels they don't have enough decision making power in the household.
A lot of their success, Gentile says, is because they keep the line of communication open. They work on “remembering (and reminding him) that money doesn't equal power in our relationship,” they say. “It helps to divide responsibility, it helps to manage our priorities, and it helps to support our different interests--but it does not determine who is in charge or who needs to yield to the other.”
It may also help redefine what financial equality means. Writer Melanie Lockert, 32, makes significantly more than their partner of nine years. “For a long time we split things down the middle because we thought that was ‘equal,” says Lockert. “But we realized ‘equal' doesn't always mean 'fair,' so we've switched to a percentage model that reflects our income.”
It's also important to remember that “money is an easy way to measure things, but there are way more power tools in a relationship,” says relationship expert April Masini -- including everything from kindness and intimacy to sex and experience. “Millennials who think money is the measure of power in relationships aren't wrong, but they're short sighted,” they say. “It's just one.”

In a video released Monday, the Islamic State group threatened to carry out an attack in Washington, D.C. that mirrors its Friday attacks on Paris that killed at least 129 people and injured hundreds more.
The video threatened countries taking part in France's air strikes launched over the group's headquarters in Raqqa, Syria, which began Sunday. "We say to the states that take part in the crusader campaign that, by God, you will have a day, God willing, like France's and by God, as we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington," the man said in the video, according to Reuters.
The video was posted to a website used by the group, and begins with footage from Friday, that involved a shooting, explosions and a hostage situation.
According to Reuters, the man, identified through subtitles as "Al Ghareeb the Algerian," made explicitly violent declarations: "I say to the European countries that we are coming, coming with booby traps and explosives, coming with explosive belts and [gun] silencers and you will be unable to stop us because today we are much stronger than before," they said.
The video's legitimacy has not been verified, according to Reuters. It is not clear who witnessed the video.
On Sunday, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communication for President Barack Obama, said it's clear the Islamic State group has "aspirations" to attack the U.S. on its own soil. "Our determination is there's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time," they said in an interview on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "But we're going to be very vigilant because we know the Islamic State has the aspirations to attack the United States as well as our European and other allies and partners."
While Rhodes acknowledged the terrorist group's desire to carry out a massacre on U.S. soil, they said its capability is weak, pointing out that while thousands of Islamic State fighters have traveled to Syria and returned to Europe, as of March only 40 have done so in the United States, according to the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Time reported.

“What I don't understand, Mr. Clemens,” said Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Wednesday, as they addressed the lawyer for a group of nonprofits who've objected on religious grounds to providing insurance coverage for contraception, “is, when will any government law that someone claims burdens their [religious] practice ever be insubstantial?” Ad Policy
That's the big question raised by Zubik v. Burwell, the fourth challenge to the Affordable Care Act to reach the Supreme Court. At issue is a regulation requiring all employer-provided health plans to cover birth control. Some religiously affiliated nonprofits—schools and hospitals, for instance, and a group of nuns called Little Sisters of the Poor, which runs nursing homes—objected to the mandate, so the Obama administration offered them an accommodation: they could opt out of providing contraception coverage by filing a form stating their religious opposition, and the government would work with insurers to provide it.
The plaintiffs in Zubik v. Burwell argue that even filing a form makes them complicit in the process of providing birth control and, accordingly, violates their rights under a federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Paul Clement, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, argued during Wednesday's hearing that the opt-out process was akin to setting up a clinic that offered birth control in a nun's home. It amounts to a “hijacking” of their health plans, they argued, a phrase later parroted by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is likely to be the swing vote in the ruling.
The objection to the accommodation, specifically, is part of what differentiates Zubik from 2014's Hobby Lobby case, which involved for-profit corporations whose owners also objected to the mandate on religious grounds. In Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that that the companies didn't have to pay for birth control coverage. But it left open the possibility that the government could provide an accommodation similar to what it offered the nonprofits. Now that option is in question. If the religious nonprofits win their case, it means Hobby Lobby, a craft-store chain, and other corporations who object to it would likely be able to fully deny contraception coverage, too, which could impact many more thousands of women.
A main point of contention during Wednesday's arguments was which group would be most burdened: religious groups, in filling out an opt-out form, or female employees who might face bureaucratic hurdles if they're forced to obtain contraceptive coverage through other means. Justice Samuel Alito implied women could simply get contraception through an alternative arrangement. “Suppose that it were possible for a woman who does not get contraceptive coverage under…a plan offered by a church or under a plan offered by a religious nonprofit to obtain a contraceptive­ only policy free of charge on one of the exchanges,” they suggested. Kennedy wanted to know, “If [birth control is] so easy to provide, if it's so free, why can't they just get it through another plan?” Roberts, too, insisted that women could just get contraception-only plans on the insurance marketplace.
The female justices and Solicitor General Don Verilli then had to explain to Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts how women actually get contraceptives. Such tailored policies don't exist, Sotomayor noted, so what their colleagues were really suggesting was setting up an entirely new insurance program for women whose employers deny them coverage. And there's no guarantee doctors would work with those new plans. “Even those small barriers work as a sufficient disincentive that many fewer people use contraception,” Verilli argued. On the other hand, the Obama administration has already lessened the burden on religious groups. “There has to be an accommodation, and that's what the government tried to do,” said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
Kennedy gave mixed signals as to their leaning. In a separate opinion they wrote in the Hobby Lobby case they affirmed that the government has a compelling interest in providing contraceptive coverage. But on Wednesday they expressed concern that the accommodation would make the nonprofits “complicit in [a] moral wrong.” Yet they also indicated at least some sense of discomfort with the slippery slope. “It's going to be very difficult for this court to write an opinion which says that once you have a church organization, you have to treat a religious university the same,” they remarked. “I just find that very difficult to write.” A four-to-four split opinion means lower court rulings would stand. Eight of the nine courts that considered the arguments against the mandate rejected the idea that filing the opt-out form violates religious liberty.
How far must a secular government go to accommodate religious groups, and what makes a burden on religious practice “substantial”? “I'm trying to find the basis for the distinction between those things that we do require people to do despite their religious objection and those things that we don't,” said Justice Stephen Breyer. “I don't think there's a clear line,” Noel Francisco, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, acknowledged.
Throughout the country, religious and conservative organizations are trying to draw the line in a way that allows them to deny services or otherwise discriminate against other groups, particularly women and LGBT people. More than 100 bills have been introduced so far this year in state legislatures that cloak anti-LGBT bias in the guise of religious freedom. On Wednesday, as the Supreme Court debated the birth-control mandate, lawyers for the ACLU in Michigan were in court in a case against Catholic hospitals who they say have put pregnant women's lives in danger by refusing to provide emergency abortion care.
(Of course, there are still blatant attempts to legalize discrimination without even justifying it on religious grounds. Also Wednesday, lawmakers in North Carolina were summoned to an emergency legislative session, not to address the fact that a quarter of the state's children live in poverty, nor the state's chronic underfunding of public education, but instead an ordinance passed by the city of Charlotte that outlawed discrimination against people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The bill Governor Pat McCrory signed Wednesday night not only overturns Charlotte's ordinance; it blocks all local laws that ban LGBT discrimination, and it blocks victims of employment or housing discrimination from seeking redress in state court.)
When the Supreme Court issued what the majority called a “narrow” ruling in favor of religious corporations in the Hobby Lobby case, Justice Ginsburg warned it was really a “a decision of startling breadth.” They aren't wrong: It encouraged broader claims for religious exemptions. This time the Court could decide to define some limit to objections made on the grounds of faith, but it seems more likely to leave the line blurred.
Horowhenua's mayor says they will not be entering their new workplace, believing it to be an earthquake risk.
Michael Feyen was voted into the top job on Saturday, ousting 12 year mayor Brendan Duffy - however they will not be entering the district council's Levin building because they say it is an earthquake risk.
The firm responsible for the design of the building has rejected that claim and said if Feyen has any proof they would like to see it.
Warwick Smith Horowhenua mayor Michael Feyen being congratulated on their victory.
Feyen was previously shut out of the building when their access card was revoked by the previous administration for their demands that an engineer's report be done.

* Palmerston North to probe building designs following Masterton flaws
* Falling through the cracks: experts warn of a wave of new buildings failing earthquake standards
* Councillors' crusade into building's safety costs council $135,000 to refute
But now that they are mayor, Feyen has put an assessment of the building as their first job.
"We are not going into that building until we know something," they said.
Feyen said they had spoken with council chief executive David Clapperton and requested an independent structural engineer inspect the building.
Feyen said the chambers were designed by engineering firm Kevin O'Connor and Associates – the same firm that designed 13 buildings in Masterton that had structural weaknesses.
"There is enough [at the building] to warrant that it needs looking at."
That means they will not be going into the building to be sworn in, nor will the first meeting of the new council be held there.
Instead the swearing in is set to be held at the Te Takere museum and library facility.
The first council meeting will also likely be there. However, Te Takere was also a project of Kevin O'Connor and Associates.
Feyen said they were not aware of that, and would need to verify it himself.
"If that is the case that looks like we will have to be throwing that in the basket to be checked."
They were not aware of any problems at the library.
Clapperton said the structural integrity of the council building was being discussed. Architectural design of the building was undertaken by Design Group Stapleton Elliott, with the engineering design completed by Kevin O'Connor and Associates.
Kevin O'Connor said their firm was confident in the engineering work undertaken on both buildings.
It had no knowledge of any factor that would suggest there were issues with the engineering of either.
"If [Feyen] has any reliable factual evidence for questioning the engineering of either building we would like to see it.
"We also note that the design and construction of both buildings went through the local council design sign-off and consenting processes and they were found to be compliant."
Madeleine Albright: “500,000 Dead Iraqi Children Was Worth It”
Sometimes Genocide Is OK…
It just depends on who is in office at the moment.
Here is a much forgotten exchange between Lesley Stahl and Madeleine Albright on “60 Minutes” back on May 12, 1996 that is not getting much play lately:
Lesley Stahl on U.S. sanctions against Iraq: We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it? Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price–we think the price is worth it.
In case you missed that episode, here is the video:
Unconscious767 posted this video at YouTube and added this:
It's worth noting that on 60 Minutes, Albright made no attempt to deny the figure given by Stahl–a rough rendering of the preliminary estimate in a 1995 U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report that 567,000 Iraqi children under the age of five had died as a result of the sanctions.
Hat Tip A. Stewart
Since the US ousted Saddam Hussein and brought democracy to the Middle East the Left has been protesting the civilian and American fatalities that number less than 100,000 combined- and a vast majority of those killed by the terrorists.
It is strange that the Left never saw a need to protest for the Iraqi children.
It is strange that they still don't.

AMD's long-awaited high-performance Zen desktop CPU will feature 16 threads across 8 physical cores and begin sampling later this year, the company proudly announced Tuesday evening.
”Zen is alive, Zen is on track and we are extraordinarily excited about what Zen will bring to the marketplace,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said during a press conference at Taiwan's annual Computex trade show.
Zen was “taped out” earlier this year, Su said, and the (simplistic) video for the chip's presentation was even produced with a Zen CPU. AMD's expected to begin sampling the processors to limited partners within a few weeks, with a wider round expected for the third quarter of this year.
Why this matters: After a disastrous few years of getting its nose punched in by Core processors, AMD created Zen from scratch to go toe-to-toe with Intel's CPUs. This chip signals AMD's return to duking it out for high-performance supremacy.
AMD's Zen-based Summit Ridge will take the fight to Intel, the company hopes.
Waiting for Zen
Zen's built around a new AM4 socket that introduces DDR4 memory compatibility to AMD's lineup and will apparently be compatible with existing coolers from legacy AM3+ motherboards.
AMD has long said Zen would feature at least a 40 percent increase in instructions per clock over its current generation Vishera chips. AMD will abandon the architecture of its Vishera chips in favor of a simultaneous multi-threading approach similar to Intel's Hyper-Threading.
Pricing wasn't disclosed—nor even hinted at—but many are looking forward to AMD's Zen putting pressure on Intel. The very day before Su held up a Zen CPU, Intel announced a new 10-core chip many expected to cost $1,000. Instead, Intel will charge over $1,700 for the Core i7-6950X.

Does Jess Smith look familiar? If so, it's probably because she's still recognisable as the Teletubbies sun baby - almost 20 years after they starred in the kids' show.
After 19 years, the student has finally broken their silence and outed themselves as the the baby face in mega-popular children's TV show.
They were selected to be the giggling baby sun, who looks over Teletubbyland at the age of nine months.
The show was a global hit and Jess, now 19, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only their family ever knew it was them
As Danger Mouse prepares to grace our televisions once again, see the cartoons who blazed the trail before them
There were even rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.
But Jess has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about their iconic role in the TV show, which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Jess only revealed their secret past during a game with their university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.
They then used Facebook to confirm it was them - and photos show they still have the same cheeky face.
Jess said: "I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.
"My mother is really chuffed."
The first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University then made the news public on Facebook.
They wrote: "So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.
"I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.
"I am the sun from Teletubbies.
"There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story."
Jess added: "I am really happy, cheerful and giggly. When I told my friends they said they could see me in the sun baby face."
Jess' name was put forward when their mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took them to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.
A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.
Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so they would be looking down like the sun.
Them furniture deliver father Bill, 49, made their giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.
As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.
Delighted Mrs Smith said: "It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.
"They just sat them in front of a camera and they just laughed and smiled at my dad.
"We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when they were 18 months old saying she'd been picked.
"It was really weird seeing them on television."
The BBC is preparing to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular 90s children's television show.

The US District Court for the District of Columbia has thrown out a challenge to the Voting Rights Act.
The plaintiffs in the case—a coalition of conservative legal groups from Shelby County, Alabama—argued that the VRA is unconstitutional because it has outlived its purpose of guaranteeing minorities the right to vote. According to Section Five of the law, which was extended by Congress in 2006, nine (mostly southern) states must pre-clear changes to their electoral procedures with the Department of Justice. Shelby County argued that the pre-clearance requirement exceeds Congress' enforcement authority and violates the Tenth Amendment.
But Judge John Bates, the George W. Bush appointee who dismissed the case on Wednesday, says otherwise. “Bearing in mind both the historical context and the extensive evidence of recent voting discrimination reflected in that virtually unprecedented legislative record,” Bates' opinion reads, “the Court concludes that ‘current needs'—the modern existence of intentional racial discrimination in voting—do, in fact, justify Congress's 2006 reauthorization of the preclearance requirement imposed on covered jurisdictions by Section 5.”
Election law Expert Rick Hasen makes an important point: If this case comes before the Supreme Court, Bates' opinion stands a fighting chance of winning over swing justice Anthony Kennedy. That's not just because of Bates' solid conservative bonafides. It's also because the opinion is pretty well-written:
[The opinion] also applies a tough standard of review (“congruence and proportionality” rather than “rationality”), an issue on which the…court [has previously] hedged, and still held the law met the tougher standard for demonstrating appropriate congressional power. . . . Judge Bates seemed to do a very good job dealing with both the current evidence of discrimination in the record (from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, as they say) as well as the “Bull Connor is Dead” problem. Many readers will walk away from the opinion thinking that if section 5 disappeared, discrimination based upon race in voting would reappear and grow in covered jurisdictions. (He does a very good job as well connecting private acts of racially polarized voting to specific state action.)
But Hasen also suggests the opinion doesn't adequately differentiate between the sort of voter discrimination you might see in a state that must pre-clear under Section 5 and another state that isn't subject to the law. In other words, Hasen thinks Bates' argument is a little weak when it comes to fully explaining how conditions in the two kinds of states differ. That could be a source of considerable contention if this case—one of several pending cases challenging Section 5—comes before the Supreme Court.
Captured cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán appears to have been brought low in part by a yearning to have a biopic made about him, Mexico's attorney general said on Friday as the country's most wanted man was paraded in front of the media.
El Chapo has often occupied a larger-than-life place in the national imagination, an anti-hero in their home state of Sinaloa and the head of a criminal empire trafficking cocaine on almost every continent.
According to attorney general Arely Gómez, their narcissism knew no limits and they wanted to take their fame further, to the silver screen in the form of a biopic. It ultimately led to their re-capture on Friday in a tacky hotel in Los Mochis, a town of tomato growers on the Pacific Coast.
If drug cartel kingpin El Chapo stays in Mexico, 'absolutely nothing' will change Read more
Guzmán, who has twice escaped from prison, most recently in July 2015, had started the process of making a biopic on a life in which they went from rags to riches, from dropping out of school and selling oranges in the street to landing on the Forbes list of billionaires. It was as if they wanted their own version of “Narcos”, the popular Netflix series on the life of slain Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar – except while alive and able to influence the casting and script.

They were so serious about a movie that they attempted to contact producers and actores through intermediaries after escaping, Gómez said Friday night, before their perp walk at the Mexico City airport. Those attempts came to the attention of the authorities, letting them know that they had returned to their old haunts in the rugged Sierra Madre – an area so impenetrable, it has been compared to the Tora Bora caves of Afghanistan.
“He established communication with actors and producers, which formed a new line of investigation,” Gómez said. Investigators, they added, tracked the movements of Chapo's lawyers and their meetings with potential participants in a biopic.
They didn't divulge names or any possible actors, however. Nor did they take questions.
Movies about narcotics trafficking and Mexico's war on drugs have started appearing in Mexican theatres in recent years – with many receiving critical acclaim. The movies arrived after the government cracked down on drug cartels and violence escalated – to the point it has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2006.
Ironically, a film titled The Great Escape – on El Chapo's life and most recent vanishing act – was set to open in cinemas on 15 January.
“It will be a series of four pictures that will tell the life story of El Chapo in reverse,” Carlos Olivares, a representative of the film's distributor, told the newspaper Excélsior. “The first deals with theirs escape, their human side and the political situation of Mexico.”
Truth proved stranger than fiction, however. And not everyone was buying what the government said about El Chapo's big plans for a biopic. “Why would a drug lord call attention upon themselves when they are hiding? It makes no sense,” said Rodolfo Soriano Nuñez, a sociologist in Mexico City and social observer.
The government, they added, “seem to be unaware of how hard it is to believe them”.
Guzmán's capture marks a rare piece of good news for the Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted to depths not seen in two decades amid the fallout from El Chapo's escape, allegations of corruption in a property deal involving Peña Nieto's wife, and their aloof response to the disappearance and presumed murder of 43 student teachers.
“Mission accomplished,” Peña Nieto wrote in a tweet that broke the news. “I would like to inform the Mexican people that Joaquín Guzmán Loera has been captured.”
Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) Misión cumplida: lo tenemos. Quiero informar a los mexicanos que Joaquín Guzmán Loera ha sido detenido.
The capture marks the second time Guzmán has been apprehended in the past three years. Mexican marines captured them in Mazatlán in early 2013 after they had foiled previous attempts by fleeing into a system of underground tunnels.
Guzmán was sent to Altiplano high-security prison, 56 miles outside Mexico City, but in July 2015, they absconded again, squeezing through a hole in their shower floor then fleeing on a modified motorbike through a mile-long tunnel fitted with lights and a ventilation system.

At the time of their escape, the capo wore a tracker bracelet and was under round-the-clock surveillance, but cameras inside their cell had two blind spots in the shower and toilet.
CCTV footage released in October showed that guards failed to intervene even though loud hammering was audible from Guzmán's cell.
The Mexican government offered a reward of 60m pesos ($3.8m) for information leading to the drug lord's recapture, but the escape was extremely embarrassing for the government. It came less than three weeks after the United States filed a request to extradite Guzmán, and the kingpin's lawyer told the Guardian last year that their escape was prompted by fears that they would face trial in the US.
Peña Nieto and federal officials came under heavy criticism for refusing to extradite Guzmán to the United States, despite shortcomings in the Mexican prison system. At least 20 public officials, including the former head of the prison system, were arrested after the escape, though there were no cabinet resignations.
Last year, an atheist couple in Massachusetts brought a suit against the Acton-Boxborough Regional School District, arguing that the phrase "under God" in the pledge of allegiance discriminates against their children because, according to their attorney, it "defines patriotism according to a particular religious belief." After they lost their case in Superior Court, they appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which agreed to consider their suit. The hearing is scheduled for early next month.
Regardless of the outcome -- so far, such challenges have ultimately been unsuccessful -- the larger issue the case raises is the appropriateness of a pledge of allegiance of any kind in a liberal democracy. It never ceases to amaze me that, day after day, otherwise rational parents allow their impressionable young children to partake in a ritual so rooted in conformity that it seems inimical to the principles of freedom and individualism that underpin our country. And yet, in public schools across the nation, millions of young children are lined up authoritarian style, told to face an American flag dangling somewhere in the room, and are then expected to profess their allegiance to it -- and of course to God as well -- using words that many are too young understand in the first place. I suspect that most parents assume the pledge has a long and dignified past, that it's part of the American fabric, and are therefore willing to leave it unchallenged. However, its history is not nearly as long or distinguished as people might think.
Indeed, the pledge of allegiance was not conceived by patriotic soldiers making a brave final stand on some cold battlefield during the Revolutionary War, nor was it the inspired creed of our noble Founding Fathers. It was actually written in 1892 by a Christian Socialist, Francis Bellamy, as part of an advertising campaign for The Youth's Companion, one of the country's best known and highly regarded magazines. Taking advantage of deep anxiety among Anglo-Saxon Protestants about an increase in immigration during the final decades of the 19th Century, The Youth's Companion hatched a scheme to turn nationalism into profit. Through its premium department (essentially a mail order service that sold goods at discounted prices to lure new subscribers), the magazine began selling American flags and promoting the idea of putting one in every school. Seeing the opportunity to link the magazine and its flag drive to a high profile celebration of Columbus Day in October of 1892, one of the magazine's marketers, James Upham, asked Bellamy to craft a pledge of allegiance that would accompany the ceremonial raising of the flag.
Bellamy's original, 23-word pledge read as follows: "I pledge allegiance to my Flag and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." Interestingly, God is nowhere to be found, and neither is any mention of equality -- perhaps surprising given Bellamy's socialist views. However, like many people who looked scornfully upon America's newest immigrants, Bellamy's utopian idealism was tempered by their profound xenophobia and bigotry. Not long after they penned the pledge of allegiance, they made these frightening statements in an editorial for the Illustrated American:
A democracy like ours cannot afford to throw itself open to the world...Where all classes of society merge insensibly into one another every alien immigrant of inferior race may bring corruption to the stock. There are races more or less akin to our own whom we may admit freely and get nothing but advantage by the infusion of their wholesome blood. But there are other races, which we cannot assimilate without lowering our racial standard, which we should be as sacred to us as the sanctity of our homes.
Hence, while the pledge of allegiance is widely regarded as a celebration of our patriotism and the "liberty and justice" upon which our nation was founded, its genesis can be traced to far more sinister fears about the racial, ethnic, and religious contamination that many Americans believed immigrants would bring with them.
Over time, these fears would lead to key changes in the wording of the pledge. First, in the early 1920s, the words "my flag" were changed to "the flag of the United States of America" amidst suspicions that immigrants might subversively interpret "my flag" as a reference to the flag of their homeland. The new wording took care of that. Then, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as Americans grew increasingly concerned about the threat of communism, there was a movement to add the phrase "under God" to the pledge. This movement, which coincided with a variety of attempts to inject religion into the public sphere in order to differentiate America from the godless communists, was ultimately successful. In 1954, Congress officially recognized the phrase "under God" in the pledge of allegiance -- over 60 years after it was originally written and almost two hundred years after our founding fathers labored to establish a nation that kept the church and state separate.
Today, regardless of their religious beliefs, public school students in most states are required by law to endure the pledge of allegiance, complete with its State-sponsored affirmation of God. While there are generally exceptions carved out for objectors (thanks to a 1943 Supreme Court ruling that said children couldn't be forced to recite it), they must nevertheless watch as their classmates stand in unison and, with hands over hearts, utter a government-mandated pledge of loyalty to the United States. Since such a ritual tends to evoke images of a fascist regime rather than a modern democracy, perhaps it's also worth noting that the prescribed salute to the flag was originally an extended arm, hand out, and palm upward, not unlike the Nazi salute.
This similarity in stance to the German counterpart -- and of course, the compulsory nature of the exercise -- raised concerns over the appearance of the pledge, so in 1942 the salute was modified to the hand-over-heart pose we recognize today.
But a new salute doesn't hide the old fears and prejudices that helped shape the pledge of allegiance, nor does it make a compulsory affirmation of liberty any less ironic. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as immigration moves to the forefront of the national debate and we face the possibility that millions of undocumented immigrants could soon become American citizens, calls for making the pledge of allegiance mandatory have recently surfaced Michigan and Nebraska, two of the few remaining states without laws requiring the pledge.

HRVATSKA traži da Srbija ukine nadležnost za ratne zločine na području cijele bivše Jugoslavije i osigura prava hrvatskoj manjini kako bi mogla zaključiti pristupne pregovore s Europskom unijom, rekao je hrvatski ministar vanjskih i europskih poslova Miro Kovač u intervjuu.
Jednako tako kao što je Beograd pod pritiskom EU-a započeo dobrosusjedski uređivati odnose s Prištinom, jednako tako mora promijeniti zakon o nadležnosti za ratne zločine na cijelom području bivše Jugoslavije i zajamčiti prava hrvatskoj manjini uređena državnim ugovorima, rekao je Kovač u intervjuu za austrijsku novinsku agenciju APA-u.
"Želimo da ove točke uđu u pregovaračka mjerila te da tijekom pregovora budu provedene. Inače pregovori neće moći biti zaključeni", rekao je Kovač.
Kovač je podsjetio kako je Srbija zbog pritiska, posebice Njemačke i Velike Britanije da uspostavi dijalog s Kosovom morala čekati na početak pregovora s EU-om dvije godine. Zbog toga se nitko u Srbiji "nije potužio", rekao je Kovač aludirajući na sadašnje pritužbe Srbije da Hrvatska zbog bilateralnih pitanja koči njezino pristupanje EU-u.
Tekst se nastavlja ispod oglasa
Zahtjevi iz Zagreba
Zagreb zahtijeva ukidanje zakona o nadležnosti Srbije za sve ratne zločine na prostoru cijele bivše Jugoslavije pa tako i Hrvatske.
"Želimo sa Srbijom imati partnerstvo kako je to slučaj između Njemačke i Francuske. Partnerstvu međutim ne pripada ... da se Srbija postavlja kao sudac za cijelu bivšu Jugoslaviju, a time i za Hrvatsku. To je neprihvatljivo. Hrvatska očekuje da se ovaj zakon promijeni", rekao je Kovač.
Glede migrantske krize Kovač je kazao kako je svladana suradnjom Hrvatske, Austrije, Slovenije, Srbije i Makedonije te da na to te zemlje mogu biti ponosne. Kovač kritizira ponašanje EU-a prema Makedoniji jer je makedonski pristup Uniji blokiran zbog spora oko imena s Grčkom te smatra da bi se o tome trebalo razgovarati s "prijateljima u Ateni" i naći rješenje.
Kovač je kazao kako će Hrvatska sudjelovati u planu EU-a o raspodjeli izbjeglica te da će primiti najviše 1600 izbjeglica čime će nova vlada desnog centra poštovati raniju odluku lijeve vlade. On je, međutim, upozorio kako je pitanje žele li migranti uopće ostati u Hrvatskoj jer zapravo uglavnom žele u Njemačku, Švedsku, Nizozemsku i Austriju.
Glede graničnog spora sa Slovenijom nakon istupanja Hrvatske iz arbitražnog procesa budući da ga je Slovenija kompromitirala Kovač kaže kako Hrvatska želi problem riješiti bilateralno temeljem međunarodnog prava te da bi možda u tome mogla prihvatiti i posredovanje.
Kovač je kazao i da Hrvatska neće žuriti s uvođenjem eura. "Trebamo prvo ojačati našu konkurentnost", rekao je aludirajući na probleme europskih država sa slabom gospodarskom strukturom poput Grčke.

CLEVELAND – In speeches here last week AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka attacked right-wing efforts to use the federal budget deficit as an excuse to block programs needed to end the economic crisis.
“The United States does not have a short-term debt problem,” Trumka stressed at a town hall meeting Thursday sponsored by the North Shore AFL-CIO and in a speech Friday at the City Club. “It has a short-term jobs crisis. We may have a mid-term or long-term deficit problem that we can get to. But now is not the time to go on an austerity program and kick us back into a recession. That is a bad policy that will lead us to disaster.”
They blasted the Senate Republicans and some Democrats who have used the deficit as an excuse and voted to deny extending benefits to the long-term unemployed,
“There are six and half million long-term unemployed,” Trumka said. “If they suddenly stop spending it would be a huge broadside hit to the economy. We cannot grow our way out of deficit by getting smaller.”
The current recovery, they said, is “very fragile.”
Trumka cited the example of Japan, which they said for 10 years during the 1990s kept initiating stimulus programs and then pulling back.
“Their economy stalled,” Trumka said. “They call it the lost decade. We cannot afford a lost decade in the United States.”
“There is no recovery until we fill the 11 million job holes created since the recession began,” they declared. Real unemployment in the U.S., they said, is 25 million, if part-time and discouraged workers are counted.
The AFL-CIO has put forward a far-reaching program to address the crisis. The program includes rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, aiding state and local governments to maintain jobs and services, public jobs programs in hard-hit communities, using funds paid back in the Wall Street bailout to help local banks, as well as extending benefits to the unemployed.
Wall Street is mounting “massive resistance” to such programs, Trumka said, noting, “There are four lobbyists for every member of Congress” fighting regulation of the financial industry which caused the crisis.
Trumka also issued a stern warning about the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which is to issue a report in December and is considering recommending cuts in Social Security and Medicare.
Fourteen of the 18 members appointed by the Obama administration are “fiscal conservatives,” Trumka said.
“Social Security is the most successful anti-poverty program in history,” they said. Social Security is not part of the federal budget and has no effect on the deficit. Commission members, they said, say cutting Social Security is a way of showing bond-holders that Democrats are ready to make sacrifices, but, Trumka said, cutting the program, either by raising the retirement age or reducing benefits, is “playing with dynamite.”
Social Security, they said, will have no solvency problem for decades and then it can be easily fixed by raising the “cap” – the maximum income that is taxed – now set at $106,800.
“We believe that every American should be able to retire with 70 percent of their take-home pay,” Trumka said. “And for low-income people, it should be higher.”

The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains where Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and other presidential candidates stand after Iowa's caucus and what's next going into the New Hampshire primary. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)
The most amazing stat coming out of the Iowa Democratic caucuses is this one: Among voters between the ages of 17 and 29, Bernie Sanders won 84 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 14 percent.
That's astounding, even given the fact that we knew going into the caucuses that Sanders, a 74-year-old socialist, was clearly the choice of young people in the state. How astounding? Barack Obama won the 17-29 vote by "only" 43 points in the 2008 Iowa Democratic caucuses. (Clinton finished third among young voters in Iowa in 2008; they got 11 percent of the vote.) Yes, Obama faced more — and more serious —opponents. But still.
If Iowa proved that Sanders is the candidate of Democratic youths, it also showed why young people aren't likely to carry them to the nomination. Why? There just aren't enough of them.
Voter ages 17-29 comprised 18 percent of the Iowa Democratic caucus electorate. (In 2008, they were 22 percent.) That made them the smallest age group in Iowa, with 30-to-44-year-olds (19 percent), 45-to-64-year-olds (36 percent) and those 65 or older (28 percent) all representing a bigger chunk of voters.
Pay particular attention to those two older age brackets. Among 45-to-64-year-olds, Clinton beat Sanders by 23 points. Among voters 65 or older, Clinton won by 43 points. I margins among middle-aged and older people effectively canceled out Sanders's massive win among young people.
Iowa is not terribly representative of the nation in many ways, but its median age — right around 38.2 — puts it right smack dab in the middle of the 50 states. That means that for Sanders to score clearer wins, they either needs to (a) win the youth vote by an even bigger margin or (b) limit Clinton's margin among older voters.
The latter option seems more feasible to me both because it's hard to win any demographic group by 70 points in a competitive race and because, well, Sanders is speaking to their own generation when it comes to voters over 65.
So yes, Sanders's numbers among young people are eye-popping. But they also show the limits to being only the youth candidate.
Ri Se-Gwang with silver medallist Denis Abliazin of Russia and bronze medallist Kenzo Shirai of Japan. Spot the odd one out.
Winning an Olympic gold medal should have been one of the happiest moments of Ri Se-Gwang's life.
But the North Korean gymnast looked like he'd rather be doing almost anything else, as they stood stony-faced atop the podium in Rio de Janeiro.
Ri's frown was a stark contrast to the smiles of Russian silver medallist Denis Albyazin and Japanese bronze medallist Kenzo Shirai.
MIKE BLAKE/REUTERS North Korea's Ri Se-Gwang says he's "filled with joy" at winning a gold medal for gymnastics, but they really doesn't show it.
He's been dubbed "the saddest gold medallist", and sparked speculation over why they looked so glum, despite becoming the third North Korean gymnast in history to win Olympic gold.

The athletes were also reportedly banned from visiting tourist sites or spending time with athletes from other teams.
Nonetheless, two of Ri's teammates have been praised for their positive interactions with South Korean competitors.

American historian and journalist Eric Zuesse suggests that Russia has lived up to all of its commitments in the post-Cold War world, and that now it's time for the West to live up to theirs.
In their investigative op-ed, published by the Strategic Culture Foundation journal, Zuesse explained that in the post-Cold War world, the Soviet Union, and then its successor, Russia, have met all of their commitments toward establishing a lasting peace, while "America's anti-Russian military club," NATO, not only continues to exist, but has expanded all the way up to Russia's borders, all the while launching military operations against any nation which might support Moscow internationally.
In this vein, the historian noted, "the West owes Russia a hell of a lot; but what it owes Russia first is a deep apology, and a welcome into Europe, of which Russia has been and is an extremely important nation, and very unjustly denied its rightful place there."
"What doesn't belong in Europe," the journalist continued, "is the US, not in any way whatsoever, especially" since the country, in their words, "is no longer a democracy."

"Why," Zeusse rhetorically asks, does "NATO still exist, after the Soviet Union's equivalent Warsaw Pact disbanded in 1991 when the Soviet Union and its communism voluntarily ended?" The answer, in their words, is that "NATO is nothing but America's anti-Russia military club, against Russia and against any nation (such as Iraq, or Libya, or Syria) that supports Russia."
Commenting on Washington and Brussels-inspired political and military interventions, from Iraq and Libya, to Ukraine, and attempts to overthrow Bashar Assad in Syria "because they support Russia in international relations," Zeusse suggested that these are nothing more than "ugly" examples of Western "bullying [directed]…against Russia and any other nation that isn't buckling to the US aristocracy and its allied aristocracies in Europe…[and] Japan."
The Original Sin: NATO's Eastward Expansion
In the journalist's view, the "original sin of the post-Cold War West," which "has produced the problems of today and the future," lies in Western leaders' decision to break their promises to Moscow not to expand NATO eastward following the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the Eastern Bloc.
© Sputnik / Vladimir Pesnya Russia Should Not Trust Western Politicians – German Media
Citing a 2009 investigation by Spiegel , Zeusse pointed out that the newsmagazine had quite unequivocally concluded, on the basis of "newly discovered documents from Western archives," that the West did in fact violate "commitments made during negotiations over German reunification."
Driving the point home to their American readers, Zeusse asked "how…the American people [would] have felt" if the USSR had won the Cold War, "and its Warsaw Pact…[had] extended itself all the way to including Mexico and/or Canada?"
"How would the American people have felt about that possibility –nuclear missiles aimed at them at their own border? It's so obviously disgusting…but do you learn in Western news media that this is what the United States has done and is doing to Russia, and to Russia's allies?" the journalist asked.
Recalling that the US and German leaders had given Moscow a "clear commitment" not to expand NATO beyond the borders of the former East Germany, Spiegel concluded "that there was no doubt that the West did everything it could to give the Soviets the impression that NATO membership was out of the question for countries like Poland, Hungary or Czechoslovakia."
Today, Zeusse suggested, "for some reason, Russian officials don't accuse the West of having 'lied'. Perhaps they feel that it would only exacerbate relations even further. However," the journalist pondered, "wouldn't it be better for the confrontation to come upon the battlefield of truth, than upon the battlefield of war?"
Commenting on Washington's utter failure to live up to the promises made in the course of the German negotiations twenty-five years ago, the journalist noted that ultimately, Europe's decision to remain allied to the US, and to continue participating in NATO, "especially after having been instructed by America to lie, and to have deceived Gorbachev, who behaved honorably throughout and afterward, is Europe's great shame. And truth is Russia's case."
The Libertarian Party is now a recognized party in Maine, as the Secretary of State's office announced that more than enough Libertarian voters had been registered.
The law was changed in 2014 so that a new party would need at least 5,000 registered members by December 1 in the year prior to a general election to become recognized. Maine Libertarians submitted more than 6,300 registered voter forms by the deadline last year, but almost 2,000 were thrown out, so that the party would not appear on the 2016 ballot. A judge later ruled that 4,513 registrations were valid, and that the Maine Libertarians would have until July 12 to submit the remaining 487 registrations to become a party.
To retain party status, the party will have to have at least 10,000 registered voters participate in the November election.
The LP presidential and vice presidential nominees are now on the ballot in 35 states.

We continue our latest film series with a first-person account of one of Europe's best festivals.
There's more to a festival than who played and how good they were. The crowd, the venue, the overall mood, that all-important thing we refer to as "the vibe"—these are just some of the factors that make a festival truly memorable. Because in the end, what we're looking for at these things isn't just a good weekend out, but something genuinely transcendent—an experience that briefly takes you out of yourself and, ideally, stays with you for the rest of your life. Good festivals will suck you into a state of mind that exists only for those few days.Inside is a film series that aims to capture some of that magic. With a first-person perspective of the action, combined with footage of choice performances, we hope to catch at least a fraction of the atmosphere at these singular events. After our trip to Bloc. earlier this year, we travelled to the Adriatic coast in Croatia for Dimensions , a festival that boasts an unrivalled combination of sounds and surroundings.

The First Minister announced the deployment of soldiers to 12 sites on Wednesday.
Operation Temperer: Soldiers have been deployed to key sites across the UK. SWNS
British armed forces are guarding 12 sites in Scotland following the increased terrorism threat, the First Minister has announced.
The deployment comes as part of the first phase of Operation Temperer, which is being rolled out across the country by the UK Government.
The operation was called after the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre raised the nation's threat level to "critical", meaning a terror attack can be expected imminently.
Soldiers have replaced armed officers from the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) police force and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary across the UK.
The three civil nuclear sites now under guard from members of the armed forces are Dounreay, Hunterston and Torness.
Nicola Sturgeon informed MSPs of the move on Wednesday.
They said: "Military personnel will be used at civil, nuclear and ministry of defence sites here in Scotland.
"There are a total of 12 such sites in Scotland; nine MOD and three nuclear."
Those armed police officers who are leaving their duties at the 12 sites will now create a contingency force which Police Scotland's chief constable Phil Gormley can call upon.
The First Minister informed the chamber that Police Scotland have no plans to use them at present but it will be kept "under review".
Scotland's national police force has around 600 armed officers.
The second phase of Operation Temperer involves military personnel being deployed on the streets.
Police Scotland currently have no plans to the request such a deployment.
Mr Gormley said: "Following the announcement by the Prime Minister of the UK Terror Threat level being increased from Severe to Critical and the implementation of Operation Temperer, Police Scotland is reviewing current deployments across Scotland, including of armed response vehicles and specialist firearms officers.
"As part of Operation Temperer, chief constables across the UK have the ability to request support from the armed forces, if required. This option is open to Police Scotland and the situation is being reviewed, however, the service currently has sufficient resources deployed and available at present."

Meteorites: A brief history
The meteorites in our 20 April sale include specimens that are 'a third as old as time itself'. In the video above and the text below, specialist James Hyslop tells the incredible stories behind them
1. The sky is falling
The Wold Cottage meteorite played a crucial role in the scientific community accepting that rocks could indeed fall out of the sky. As Travel, Science and Natural History specialist James Hyslop explains, it was a notion previously met with disbelief or considered heretical.
On December 13, 1795, Wold Cottage crashed to Earth just yards away from farmworker John Shipley. Edward Topham, the owner of the Wold Cottage estate and a well-known bon vivant, was away in London at the time, but they hurried home after reading accounts in the press.
Wold Cottage Meteorite of 1795. Chondrite — L6. Wold Cottage, England (54°8' N, 0°24' W) 33 x 31 x 5mm (1.33 x 1.25 x 0.1 inches) and 17.79 grams. Estimate: £3,000-5,000. This lot is offered in the Meteorites sale on 20 April at Christie's South Kensington
Certain that the stone was of great importance, Topham placed Wold Cottage on display in London, helping to sway public opinion to embrace Shipley's extraordinary claim. The scientific community took note, especially after Wold Cottage proved similar to a rock reported to have fallen out of the sky 18 months earlier in Siena, Italy. The fact that two stones from different localities had common characteristics convinced many scientists of their possible extraterrestrial origin.
2. The only documented fatal meteorite impact
On the evening of 15 October 1972, farmhands in Trujillo, Venezuela were startled by an inexplicable sonic boom. The next day an exotic rock was found alongside a dead cow whose neck had been pulverized. It was obvious to the farm's owner, physician Dr. Argimiro Gonzalez, what had occurred, but they didn't give it a second thought.
Valera Meteorite. L5 . Trujillo, Venezuela (9°19' N, 70°37' W). 75 x 44 x 32mm (3 x 1.75 x 1.25 inches) and 160.5 grams (0.33 pounds). Estimate: £4,000-6,000. This lot is offered in the Meteorites sale on 20 April at Christie's South Kensington
An unplanned steak dinner was enjoyed that night and the celestial boulder was used as a doorstop. More than a decade later scientists confirmed what Dr. Gonzalez had long presumed. However, what Dr. Gonzalez didn't know was that this was the first and still the only documented fatal meteorite impact.
When Dr. Ignacio Ferrin, an astronomer at the University of the Andes, learned of the act of bovicide at Valera, they visited the Gonzalez estate and left with an affidavit affirming the asupervisorstioned events as well as the meteorite itself.
An echo in miniature of the devastating asteroid believed to have killed off the dinosaurs, one face of the Valera meteorite is cut and polished. The multi-hued variegated matrix is embedded with sparkling metallic grains, while blurred chondrule boundaries are evidence of heating on its parent asteroid long before its brush with Earth — and a cow.
3. ‘God intended it to hit me'
The only documented instance of a meteorite injuring a person occurred at 2.46pm on 30 November, 1954 in Sylacauga, Alabama. The fireball from which the Sylacauga meteorite originated was seen in broad daylight across three states and was accompanied by sonic booms. Some eyewitnesses thought a plane had crashed; at the height of the Cold War, others felt this extraordinary event was the nefarious doings of the Soviets.
Sylacauga Meteorite. H4. Talladega County, Alabama (33°14' N, 86°17' W). 39 x 32 x 2 mm (½ x ¼ x 1/8 in.) Estimate: £6,000-9,000. This lot is offered in the Meteorites sale on 20 April at Christie's South Kensington
Two meteorites were recovered. One crashed through the roof of Ann and Eugene Hodge's home, where it bounced off a radio and struck Ann Hodges while they napped. While Hodges and their landlord fought over the meteorite's ownership, the U.S. Air Force took custody. While the law favoured the landlord, public sentiment was solidly behind Hodges, who exclaimed, ‘God intended it to hit me. After all, it hit me!'
The Hodges finally owned the meteorite that punctured their roof (and almost Ann herself) after a year of legal wrangling and a payout to their landlord. However, interest had waned during the course of the year and when the Hodges couldn't find a buyer, they donated the rock to the Alabama Museum of Natural History. Never having recovered from the emotional distress associated with these events, Ann Hodges suffered a nervous breakdown and died at the age of 52.
The second meteorite was found by a local farmer, Julius McKinney, who quickly sold their specimen to the Smithsonian. The proceeds from this sale enabled McKinney to purchase a new car and home.
4. Among the most scientifically important meteorites known
At 10.58am on 28 September 1969, a meteorite shower occurred over the town of Murchison, Australia, causing a frenzy in the scientific community. In addition to containing organic compounds including alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons, Murchison meteorites contain amino acids — the building blocks of proteins.
Murchison Oriented Individual. CM2. Victoria, Australia (36°37' S, 145°12' E). 58 x 40 x 25 mm (2º x 1Ω x 1 in.) 81.7g. Estimate: £8,000-12,000. This lot is offered in the Meteorites sale on 20 April at Christie's South Kensington
Coveted by both scientists and collectors, Murchison meteorites have become among the most researched meteorites, with citations in scores of scientific papers. The event provides support for the Panspermia Theory of Life, namely that life on Earth was ‘seeded' by extraterrestrial impact.
In 2010, an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences announced that 14,000 unique molecular compounds had been identified in a small section of a Murchison research specimen. The study, by a team of nine German scientists, further determined that many of the organic compounds were present in the solar system prior to when life commenced on Earth — which not only begs the question of whether meteorites may have played a key role in life's origins, but whether similar material seeded other solar systems as well.
5. The largest existing piece of one of the most important meteorites in history
On 3 October 3 1962, a farmer in Zagami, Nigeria was nearly struck by an 18kg meteorite as it plummeted to Earth. As was reported in NASA's 2012 Martian Meteorite Compendium, Robert Haag, world-famous meteorite collector, travelled to Nigeria in 1988 and met the farmer.
The main mass of the legendary Martian meteorite Zagami. SNC — Mars Rock. Zagami, Nigeria (11°44' N, 7°5' E). 151 x 73 x 106mm (6 x 2.75 x 4 inches) and 1382.3 grams (3 lbs). Estimate: £250,000-450,000. This lot is offered in the Meteorites sale on 20 April at Christie's South Kensington
Haag related what the farmer told them of their experience: ‘He was trying to chase cows out of their cornfield when they heard a tremendous explosion and was buffeted by a pressure wave. Seconds later, there was a puff of smoke and a thud, as something buried itself in the dirt only ten feet away. Terrified that it was an artillery shell, the man waited for a few minutes before going to investigate. What they saw was a black rock at the bottom of a two-foot hole. The local commissioner was summoned and the specimen was recovered and sent to the provincial capital, where it was placed in the museum.'
Seven years later it was discovered that minute amounts of gas within the Zagami meteorite and a similar Antarctic meteorite matched the chemical and isotopic composition of the Martian atmosphere, measured on the surface of Mars in 1976 by NASA's Viking landers.
Zagami crystallized from basaltic magma 175 million years ago and was ejected off the surface of Mars 3 million years ago after the impact of a large asteroid. In 1997, when NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft entered into an orbit around Mars, it was carrying a sample of the Zagami meteorite. The Global Surveyor's mission ended in 2007. One day its orbit will decay and it will slam into Mars, returning a portion of Zagami to its birthplace.
On a good day, William Brewer said tourists and shoppers toss $70 to $90 into their cup as they stand outside the Garrett Popcorn Shop near State and Madison streets in the Loop.
The 57-year-old, who stays in shelters at night, said they know that some who solicit on State Street bother customers and merchants.
"I try to stay out of trouble," Brewer said.
The area merchants association agrees there can be problems: Its surveys show that panhandling and the homeless are growing concerns to members and shoppers.
The Chicago Loop Alliance on Monday is launching a street team of six paid ambassadors they say will provide "extra eyes" on State Street to help social service agencies identify people who are homeless, addicted to drugs or mentally ill so that they can receive services.
They're also trained to direct tourists and report on fouled sidewalks.
"When you have to walk over somebody or past somebody asking for money to do your shopping, it isn't the best situation for anybody," said Michael Edwards, executive director of the Chicago Loop Alliance, a merchant organization that represents businesses in the Loop.
Business district street patrols are well-established in other cities, including New York, with generally promising results. The outreach efforts are credited with deterring crime and increasing pedestrian traffic, but have been less successful in keeping the homeless off the streets.
The Loop Alliance emphasizes that the program is not designed to "sweep" State Street of its homeless population, but the effort is raising red flags for some advocates concerned that the iPad-toting ambassadors are an attempt to rid the streets of citizens acting within their legal right to passively panhandle.
Chicago law bars panhandling "in a manner that a reasonable person would find intimidating," including touching someone, blocking a pedestrian's path or using profane or abusive language.
"I'm skeptical of this," said Ed Shurna, executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, which is not a partner in the project. "The goal is clearly to get rid of them. But we don't feel you should dehumanize people by just sweeping them."
A July 2013 analysis by the coalition which included data supplied by Chicago Public Schools found that 116,042 Chicagoans were homeless during the 2012-13 school year, up 10 percent from 105,338 a year earlier. That total includes people who have doubled up in other people's homes because of hardship.
For its part, the Loop Alliance hopes fewer panhandlers will be good for business.
The Loop is attempting to rebound from the Great Recession, but the return hasn't been easy. Edwards and other civic leaders are aiming to figure out what's next for the business district and the State Street retail corridor, defined as State Street between Congress Parkway and Wacker Drive.
Funds for the program are paid out of the State Street special service area, one of 44 local tax districts that fund expanded services and programs with a property tax levy. Chicago Loop Alliance is the administrator of the State Street tax area.
Officials estimate the 12-month cost of the program is $359,000. The ambassadors received 56 hours of training from a nationwide program called Streetplus, according to Edwards, and have met with social service partners and law enforcement along the way.
"The fact that they are reaching out to us, symbolizes that they want to do this right," said Mark Ishaug, CEO of Thresholds, Chicago's largest provider of services for people with severe mental illness. "It could have been focused on law enforcement or just moving people. But it was about engaging people."
Agencies like Thresholds have had teams on the streets for years, Ishaug said, and the more help they can get the better.
"We're enthused by any effort that enables us to help people on State Street or downtown or anywhere who are homeless or who suffer from mental illness," they said.
City officials, whom Alliance officials described as partners in the project, could not be reached for comment.
The Loop Alliance street team comprises six staff members: a program manager, a team leader and four "ambassadors" who, beginning Monday, will be on State Street every day from at least 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.
The ambassadors are more than tour guides. Among them are four bachelor's degrees and three master's degrees in nonprofit management, health sciences, addiction and psychology. They also have worked in social work, health care, substance abuse, psychiatric and rehabilitation services.
The program in the beginning will be "a bit of an experiment," Edwards said, with ambassadors documenting every incident they encounter.
"They all have iPads. Everything will be geolocated. Any incident. Someone asking a question, with a mental issue, a minor aggressive panhandling issue, it will all be uploaded into a system and we can submit reports. Over time, we really can begin to understand how the street operates and where to put our resources," they said.
In New York, the 125th Street Business Improvement District is a 20-year-old nonprofit funded by special property assessments to serve a five-block area in central Harlem. The historic district includes the Apollo Theater, The Cotton Club and nearly 200 retailers.
The district launched its own ambassador program in 2007, with five ambassadors outfitted with yellow polo shirts and walkie-talkies patrolling the streets each day, providing information to visitors, getting help for lost, sick or injured persons, and reporting criminals to the police.
"They're our eyes and ears out there," said Anthony Baker, director of operations for the district. "They report if anything goes down, and we can get the proper agency in a quick and very responsible manner."
The Garment District Alliance also was established in 1993 to provide similar services to the bustling manufacturing and tourist hub in Manhattan.
According to officials, the district has an $8 million annual budget funded by some 575 property owners and more than 6,500 businesses. In addition to a staff of 25 sanitation employees, the district employs 23 uniformed public safety officers to patrol the streets each day.
The officers have provided directions to countless tourists, and have even helped catch bank robbers.
But their efforts to stem a seemingly intractable homeless problem have been "discouraging," said Barbara Blair Randall, president of the district since 1995.
Working with New York's Partnership for the Homeless, the officers approach many of the same people on a daily basis. Those that do take them up on offers of shelter and assistance usually return to the district, Randall said.

A new search area for the missing Malaysian plane has been announced by the Australian government after further analysis of satellite data.
The search will now shift south to focus on an area 1,800km (1,100 miles) off the west coast of Australia, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss confirmed.
Flight MH370 vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March with 239 passengers on board.
Officials said they believed the plane had been on autopilot when it crashed.
A 55-page report released by the Australian government concluded that the underwater search for the plane should resume in the new 60,000 sq km area.
An extensive search of the ocean floor was conducted in April after several acoustic pings, initially thought to be from the plane's flight data recorders, were heard. However, officials now believe the pings were not caused by the plane.
"It is highly, highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings," Mr Truss said.
Analysis: Refined analysis drives new move, Jonathan Amos, science correspondent, BBC News
The new search area focuses on the "7th arc" - a line through which the analysis suggests the jet had to have crossed as it made a final, brief, connection with ground systems. The interpretation of the data is that this "electronic handshake" was prompted by a power interruption onboard MH370 as its fuel ran down to exhaustion. As auxiliary power came on, the jet tried to log back into the satellite network.
In normal circumstances following such a logon request, there would usually have been additional "chatter" between the network and MH370. That these connections are not seen in the data log are a very strong indication that the jet was in its crash descent.
Several teams within the investigation have been running the numbers; this is not the sole work of the satellite system's operator - Inmarsat.
The collective opinion of several independent teams has therefore arrived at a zone of the highest priority covering some 60,000 sq km. Once the ocean floor there is mapped, the investigation team can then summon the best - but also the most appropriate - submersibles in the world to go hunt for sunken wreckage.
Expensive search
The underwater search for the plane was put on hold to allow more time for survey vessels to map the ocean floor.
The new search is due to commence in August and is expected to be completed within a year, Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) chief Martin Dolan confirmed.

Submarines will scour the ocean floor to look for signs of the missing Boeing 777. The area has already been searched by air, and officials say any floating wreckage will have sunk to the ocean floor.
Several teams working independently of each other have reached similar conclusions relating to the new search area, the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos says.
The search for the missing airliner is already among most expensive in aviation history.

After more than 100 days since the disappearance of the airliner, many of the relatives of the missing passengers have continued to express frustration at the lack of progress in the search.
Image copyright AFP/Getty Images/Reuters Image caption Theresa May's spokesperson has criticised US Secretary of State John Kerry over their comments on the Israeli government
Downing Street has criticised US Secretary of State John Kerry for calling the Netanyahu government the "most right-wing in Israel's history".
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was "not appropriate" to attack the make-up of a democratically-elected government of an ally.
Mr Kerry has also warned Israeli policy makes a two-state solution less likely.
Tory MP Crispin Blunt said they were unsure about the UK's intervention as Mr Kerry had been "on the money".
Mr Blunt, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said on its current path Israel could not stay "democratic and Jewish".
The dispute follows a US decision not to veto a UN Security Council motion criticising Israel's policy of building settlements on land occupied since 1967.
The UK voted for the resolution, and Mrs May's spokesperson agreed with Mr Kerry that "the only way to a lasting peace in the Middle East is through a two-state solution".
But they said the settlements were "far from the only problem", citing the ever-present threat of terrorism that the Israeli people had had to live with.
'One issue'
The spokesperson added: "We do not, therefore, believe that the way to negotiate peace is by focusing on only one issue, in this case the construction of settlements, when clearly the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is so deeply complex.
"And we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically-elected government of an ally."
The US state department said it was "surprised" by the UK's response.

A spokesperson said Mr Kerry's remarks were "in line with the UK's own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations last week", adding that the US stance had been welcomed by Germany, France, Canada, Turkey as well as a number of Gulf nations.
President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office next month, has been critical of the current administration's Middle East policy, tweeting earlier this week that Israel had been treated with "disdain" by the US in recent years.
The UK is hoping to build a strong relationship with the new Republican administration.
'Enormous efforts'
Earlier this week, the UK's ambassador to Washington Sir Kim Darroch suggested Mrs May and Mr Trump would aim to "build on the legacy" of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, who were close allies in international affairs during the 1980s and developed a strong personal friendship.
But Mr Blunt defended Mr Kerry's efforts over the past four years at brokering a lasting peace in the long-running Arab-Israeli conflict and suggested Downing Street had been making a "narrow point".
"I have absolutely no idea what was behind Number 10 briefing in the way that they did," they told BBC Radio 4's World At One.

"My only concern is it would seem to indicate that there might be something wrong with John Kerry's analysis in their view. In my judgment there isn't, it was an extremely fine speech.
"On the substance, and finding a long-term solution that's in the interests of the people of Israel and peace for their Arab neighbours and a solution that beings justice for the Palestinians and security for the Israelis, Kerry's analysis is very hard to gainsay."
A row broke out between the US administration and Israel after the vote at the UN Security Council last Friday, as Mr Netanyahu accused Washington of complicity in drawing up the resolution.
In a speech on Wednesday, Mr Kerry said Mr Netanyahu's "public support" for a two-state solution, including the creation of an independent state of Palestine, did not reflect the views of the most extreme members of their government.
"His current coalition is the most right-wing in Israeli history with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements," they said.
"The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister themselves just described as more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history, are leading in the opposite direction [from a two-state solution]. They are leading towards one state."
Mr Netanyahu said the comments "paid lip service to the unremitting Palestinian campaign of terrorism" against Israel.
The best part about stumbling on a beer with a name like “Pistols at Dawn” at the local liquor store is that it's a built-in invitation for Of Dreck & Drink. The moment I saw it, the rusty, corroded, pollution-belching machinery of my mind rumbled to uneasy life with an obvious question: “Have I ever watched a truly terrible Western?”
As it turns out, I have not. And in all actuality, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to find a Western film that is infamously bad. For whatever reason, the genre seems prone to lots of mediocrity but few disasters on an epic scale—perhaps it's because the kinds of schlock directors who churn out the ubiquitous, low-budget zombie movies that cluster store shelves don't have the resources to even attempt a Western period piece. But fear not, because I still found something plenty objectionable: 1994's Lightning Jack.
How does this premise suit you? Paul “Crocodile Dundee” Hogan as an inexplicably Australian, farsighted outlaw and a young Cuba Gooding Jr. as their mute, rubberfaced comic relief sidekick. It's ostensibly a comedy, which is an interesting distinction, given that our protagonist is a bank-robbing murderer. In fact, during the film's initial robbery sequence, they gun down several innocent townspeople while making their escape. It's not entirely clear, but I think the audience is supposed to immediately forget this and embrace Hogan's “Lightning” Jack Kane as a sort of lovable rogue—easier said than done, given that he's literally a murderer.
Cuba, on the other hand, is your classic second banana. He's afflicted with the unique condition of being mute (but not deaf), which we immediately learn when they write out “Not deaf. Not stupid. Just mute.” for a customer in the dry goods store where they work like a slave for The Man. Unsurprisingly, they want a bit more excitement in life, which leads to their quick transition from hostage to sidekick when Lightning Jack picks them up in a bank robbery gone wrong. Soon, he's tasked with such important jobs as sucking snake venom out of Paul Hogan's ass, in a joke that is somehow exactly the same as the one in City Slickers 2: The Legend of Curly's Gold from three months later in the same year. The idea that they could have willfully stolen a gag from Lightning Jack is a disturbing implication.
The beer, meanwhile, proves more thematically appropriate than genuinely interesting. Lonerider's Pistols at Dawn is a coffee/oatmeal stout with lactose, balanced right on the edge of “imperial” territory at 7.5% ABV. In the flavor department, though, it's curiously thin of body and lacking in coffee character. The chocolate comes through more strongly, more milk than dark in character, giving the beer a distinctly “Nestle Quik” flavor. It's palatable but has no subtlety, which one could also say of Lightning Jack, a Western assembled entirely from clichés abandoned on the side of the wagon trail.
The strangest thing about the film is ultimately that there's almost no conflict in it. It plays like each scene was written moments before it was filmed, and the entire movie was simply filmed from beginning to end in this stream-of-consciousness style. Eventually, someone must have noticed and asked “We probably need to get some bad guys, right?” To which another producer presumably replied: “Oh, I don't know if there's a budget for bad guys, with all the Vegemite we're flying in for Hogan. What about some disagreeable guys?” And that's what we get: A few people who have no real fondness for Lightning Jack, but not a single one that viewers would identify as a “villain.” It's the only Western ever made that doesn't have a designated bad guy.
It's the exact same with the love interest—roughly 50 percent of the way through the film, someone remembers “Wasn't there supposed to be a girl in this movie? And failing that, do you think we could get a 43-year-old Beverly D'Angelo?” And then poof, there they are … for about five minutes of total screen time. I can only assume they then climbed back into their hyperbaric chamber to be awakened three years later for Vegas Vacation.
Honestly, this is the worst kind of bad movie: The instantly forgettable kind. There's exactly one moment that will stick with me, a shining bit of insane, “comedic” dialog in a sea of unfunny outlaw shenanigans. It comes out of nowhere when Lightning Jack learns that their mute companion has never known the touch of a woman:
Lightning Jack: ”Does your pecker work proper? Whenever a sweet-smelling gal passes by, does it stand up and say howdy? You do know where to put it?” Mimes thrusting motions
A murderer who gets off on smelling women as they walk by? That's our Lightning Jack Kane! Never change, Paul Hogan.

After working on Waitress, the indie film they wrote, directed and starred in with Keri Russell, for almost two years, actor Adrienne Shelly couldn't wait to hear if the movie had won a coveted spot at the Sundance Film Festival.
“When I first read the script, I told her, ‘This is going to be a big film,'” their husband, Andy Ostroy, 56, tells PEOPLE in the new issue. “The pages just turned themselves.”
Shelly would never learn that Waitress became one of the top films of the prestigious festival – or that it became a success when it hit theaters in May 2007 and now, almost a decade later, a newly Tony-nominated hit musical on Broadway.
On Nov.1, 2006, Ostroy found Shelly, 40, hanging from a shower rod in the Manhattan apartment where they worked and wrote their scripts. Five days later, police arrested Diego Pillco, a 19-year-old construction worker who confessed to killing her, staging it to look like a suicide.
Adrienne Shelly Night and Day Pictures
For more on Adrienne Shelly, pick up this week's issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.
Pillco first told authorities they killed them after they said they argued about construction noise in the building. They later changed their story, saying they murdered them when they caught them trying to rob their purse. “It was an incredibly horrific, unfathomable time,” says Ostroy, 56. “It was the worst thing that could ever happen.”
In 2008, Pillco was sentenced to 25 years in prison without parole and will be deported when they finish their term.
Ostroy and their daughter Sophie, who was almost 3 when Shelly died, feel their loss every day. “She just loved Sophie so much,” says Ostroy. “I think of the way they looked at them and the adoration in their eyes. They were so joyful about being able to achieve their dreams and still be a mother.”
Shelly's Legacy Endures
After Shelly's death, Ostroy sought to do good in their name. In 2006, they created the Adrienne Shelly Foundation to support women filmmakers, with board members including Paul Rudd, Cheryl Hines, Michelle Williams and Russell. The foundation has partnered with top filmmaking institutions including the Sundance Institute, the American Film Institute, the Independent Filmmakers Project, Women in Film, the Tribeca Film Institute, Columbia University and Rooftop Films.
The foundation has also awarded 60 production grants since its inception, including one to Cynthia Wade in 2007, who won an Academy Award the following year for their documentary Freeheld.
“She said they couldn't have made that film without our support,” they say. “To help a filmmaker win an Academy Award with help from our foundation made us realize the impact that we could have – and so soon.”
“Starting the foundation was the right thing to do for Adrienne and the right thing to do, period,” they say. “I think Adrienne would have loved that we are helping filmmakers like them in their honor and in their name.”
Waitress Hits Broadway
When Broadway producers Barry and Fran Weissler saw Waitress, about an unhappily married pregnant woman with a talent for baking pies, they knew it had the makings of a hit stage show.
“I saw the movie and thought, ‘This is heartwrenching and touching and funny,'” says Barry Weissler, who has produced dozens of hit shows, including Chicago.”I thought it would make a great musical.”

Waitress the musical Joan Marcus
The musical, which stars Tony Award winner Jessie Mueller, is directed by Diane Paulus, and features a score by singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, opened April 24 after selling out in previews. On Tuesday, it landed four Tony nominations for Best Musical, Best Original Score, Best Actress and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
“When I found out it was heading to Broadway, I was thrilled,” says Ostroy. “When I look at Adrienne's life, career and legacy, they had this film that did really well, is now on Broadway and they have impacted the lives of so many female filmmakers.”
“I have seen that out of tragedy, something really good can come, otherwise it's all in vain. Them murder didn't stop them from going on, even if in name only.”
If the citizens of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had composed the Vedas, the Ganga would be less dirty. This thought is prompted by twin concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party government. The first is the Clean India campaign, along with its special focus on the Ganga. The second involves an article of faith of all Hindu nationalists: that the Vedic people originated in India. Or, in other words that the oldest civilisation discovered in India that of the Indus Valley, was itself a Vedic society.The idea of the two being identical, encapsulated in the phrase Indus-Sarasvati civilisation, is misguided on a number of counts. I will mention just one. The Vedic people were big on horses and chariots. Their gods had fancy rides, and the control of chariots and horses was among the coveted powers of Indra, the Rg Veda's top god. The continuing symbolic importance of the chariot in India long after it ceased being an effective war machine is demonstrated by the 13th century AD construction of Konarak's Sun Temple in the form of a gigantic chariot with elaborately carved spoked wheels.Horse-drawn chariots, like all complicated artefacts, leave remains in the ground when they fall apart. Yokes and collars that held animals together or bits of wheel and axle are buried in the ground waiting for modern archaeologists to dig them out. In places where languages closely related to Vedic Sanskrit were spoken, plenty of evidence has emerged of horse drawn chariots. Within Indus Valley sites, right-leaning archaeologists have sought such remains as assiduously as American troops searched for Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, and with as little success. There isn't a hint of a chariot till well past the civilisation's peak. Till a point, in fact, when one might reasonably expect early Vedic people to have brought their knowledge of chariots to the Indus Valley from the northwest, given the conventional dating of both Harappan sites and the composition of the Vedas.If the absence of horse-drawn chariots is an important pointer, I consider the lack of adequate sanitary provisions in Indian cities after the collapse of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro equally significant. Consider that the one feature that set these cities apart from all other ancient sites was their elaborate sewage system. If they were part of a civilisation that continues unbroken to this day, how did we completely forget this defining quality? How did we, over hundreds of years, construct massive townships, all the way down to contemporary Gurgaon, without any proper thought to sanitation?Time will tell whether Narendra Modi's Clean India campaign makes a greater impact than previous sanitation drives and whether their effort to clean the Ganga improve upon Rajiv Gandhi's Ganga Action Plan launched in 1986 without warning the public to mind the gap between promise and execution. Referring to past failures, Shashi Tharoor, who has been invited by the Prime Minister to be part of the mission, wrote , “The fundamental problem lies in our people's ingrained behaviour patterns ‒ and mindsets are the hardest things to change...we are a nation full of people who live in immaculate homes where we bathe twice a day, but think nothing of littering public spaces, spitting on walls, dumping garbage in the open and urinating and defecating in public, because those spaces are not "ours." It is this individualistic mindset and lack of civic consciousness that makes our country a land of private cleanliness and public squalor.”As early as the 7th century AD, Tsuan-tsang (contemporary spelling Xuanzang) observed something similar. Indians, they stated, “are very particular in their personal cleanliness”, but about Indian towns they wrote, "… the streets and lanes are tortuous, and the roads winding. The thoroughfares are dirty." We aren't the only nation with squalor and dirt visible everywhere, but filth defines us in a way it doesn't, say, Cambodia, or Burma, or Burundi, which are poorer and possess fewer resources.I believe the root cause of India's identification with grime can be expressed in one word: caste. The Rig Veda speaks about a four-fold caste hierarchy, which, some time after the pastoral Vedic people had transitioned into an agrarian society, but some time before Gautam Buddha visited Varanasi, had become a rigid five-level structure, in which certain acts were considered ritually defiling, to be undertaken only by those considered impure by birth.Indus Valley cities show no evidence of caste: they are neat grids that include all citizens. Citywide public works such as complex drainage systems are predicated on such inclusiveness. Within a caste-based society, there simply isn't enough commonality between Brahmins and ati-shudras for the former to plan anything that takes into account the needs and desires of the latter. Shashi Tharoor was wrong to lay the blame for our lack of civic consciousness at the door of individualism. The blame lies with our caste consciousness. Gandhi understood this, and their preoccupation with the cleaning of toilets, which so many commentators have found puzzling, was a way of tackling caste in ways government programmes wouldn't manage. If Narendra Modi comprehends it, they are doing a good job of keeping the thought to himself.
Apple, Google and Microsoft, are in an ideal position to deter piracy, according to a new report published by Black Market Watch and the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime. The controversial report opts for voluntary or mandatory blocking of pirated content on the operating system level.
When Windows 10 was launched last year, rumors spread that the operating system was equipped with a built-in piracy kill switch.
According to some reports, this would allow Microsoft to nuke all torrents downloaded from The Pirate Bay, and more. A scary outlook, but also a massive exaggeration, for now.
The controversy originated from a single line in Microsoft's Service Agreement which allows the company to download software updates and configuration changes that may prevent people from “playing counterfeit games.”
Technically this allows Microsoft to block people from playing pirated games across Windows 10 and other services, but thus far there is no indication that this is happening.
However, this week the issue was highlighted again in a report published by Black Market Watch and the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, which made several recommendations on how online piracy could be tackled in Sweden.
While most of the media attention focused on the role of ISPs, there is an even more controversial proposal that has been largely overlooked. According to the report, pirated content should be banned on the operating system level.
“Other players that possess the potential ability to limit piracy are the companies that own the major operating systems which control computers and mobile devices such as Apple, Google and Microsoft,” one of the main conclusions reads.
“The producers of operating systems should be encouraged, or regulated, for example, to block downloads of copyright infringing material,” the report adds.
The report references last year's Windows 10 controversy, noting that these concerns were great enough for some torrent sites to block users with the new operating system.
While Sweden doesn't have enough influence to make an impact on these global software manufacturers, applying pressure through the international community and trade groups may have some effect.
“Sweden's ability to influence this as a single state is small, but it can take action through the EU and the international community. Copyright holders can also play a role in promoting this through international industry associations,” the report notes.
For now, it's unlikely that the plan will become reality in the near future.
Yesterday, Swedish ISP Bahnhof responded to the report by saying that it doesn't want to act as piracy police, and Apple, Google and Microsoft are not going to be happy with this role either.
However, it's clear that anti-piracy proposals are getting more extreme year after year.
Engineered nanomaterials are known to exhibit diverse and sometimes unexpected biological effects. Fullerene nanoparticles have been reported to specifically bind to and elicit persistent activation of hippocampal Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a multimeric intracellular serine/threonine kinase central to Ca(2+) signal transduction and critical for synaptic plasticity, but the functional consequence of that modulation is unknown. Here we show that low doses of fullerene C60 nanocrystals (Nano C60), delivered through intrahippocampal infusion and without any obvious cytotoxicity in hippocampal neuronal cells, enhance the long-term potentiation (LTP) of rats. Intraperitoneal injection of 320 μg/kg of Nano C60, once daily for 10 days, also enhanced spatial memory of rats in addition to an increase of LTP. In parallel, both the IH and IP administration of Nano C60 increased the autonomous activity and the level of threonine 286 (T286) autophosphorylation of CaMKII, enhanced post-synaptic AMPA/NMDA ratio, and triggered time-dependent activation of ERK and CREB. Our results reveal a striking and highly unexpected ability of Nano C60 in positively modulating learning and memory, an effect that is most likely manifested through locking CaMKII in an active conformation, and may have significant implications for the potential therapeutic applications of fullerene C60, a classic engineered nanomaterial.

Theories of reinforcement learning in neuroscience have focused on two families of algorithms. Model-free algorithms cache action values, making them cheap but inflexible: a candidate mechanism for adaptive and maladaptive habits. Model-based algorithms achieve flexibility at computational expense, by rebuilding values from a model of the environment. We examine an intermediate class of algorithms, the successor representation (SR), which caches long-run state expectancies, blending model-free efficiency with model-based flexibility. Although previous reward revaluation studies distinguish model-free from model-based learning algorithms, such designs cannot discriminate between model-based and SR-based algorithms, both of which predict sensitivity to reward revaluation. However, changing the transition structure ('transition revaluation') should selectively impair revaluation for the SR. In two studies we provide evidence that humans are differentially sensitive to reward vs. transition revaluation, consistent with SR predictions. These results support a new neuro-computational mechanism for flexible choice, while introducing a subtler, more cognitive notion of habit.
The comic was created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada when the duo had their 1990s publishing imprint, Event Comics.
The Soska Sisters, the twin horror-movie directors behind the cult slasher American Mary, have signed on to helm the adaptation of Painkiller Jane, a comic created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada.
Palmiotti, via their Paperfilms banner, and Solipsist Films' Stephen L'Heureux are producing.
Jane centers on the titular hero, a cop, who, along with with their best friend and partner, goes undercover into an interconnected drug ring. When their identity is exposed, Jane is tortured, which leaves them with preternatural regenerating abilities and a high tolerance for pain.
And just like the character, the screen adaptations for Jane have proved equally resilient at regenerating.
The SyFy channel aired a made-for-TV movie in 2005 with Emmanuelle Vaugier as the hero. That was followed in 2007 with a series, this time with Kristanna Loken in the title role.
Now Palmiotti and L'Heureux, who is a producer on the upcoming Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, are plotting an indie action thriller.
Palmiotti was an inker who segued into publishing and writing, and currently co-writes All-Star Western for DC. They run Paperfilms with Amanda Conner and Justin Gray. The company is in the business of creating intellectual properties, working in the spheres of comics, video games and TV. (Quesada, meanwhile, is now the editor-in-chief of Marvel's comics division.)
The Soska twins, Jen and Sylvia, broke into films with their first effort, Dead Hooker in a Trunk, but it was their follow-up, American Mary, with its female themes and strong reviews, that garnered the duo a cult following.
The pair recently wrapped Vendetta for WWE Studios and Lionsgate, and their See No Evil 2 is slated to be released later this year. They are repped by APA, Zero Gravity and Joel VanderKloot of Nelson Davis.

Microsoft's HoloLens is still very much in an early stage, and interesting new ideas and uses for the device are being discovered by the week. This most recent example turns your phone into a controller for the mixed reality headset.
Currently, HoloLens is mainly controlled through gestures with your hand, though can also be navigated with voice recognition and gaze-based input. To development agency AfterNow, though, that wasn't enough. The studio wanted the kind of control you can get with VR controllers like the HTC Vive's six degree of freedom (6DOF) wands but for HoloLens. Instead of using just a Vive controller, AfterNow turned to something millions of us already have, the smartphone.
The result is what you see in the video above. The user's smartphone isn't just a 6DOF controller but also a sort of virtual launching device. In the video, the user brings up virtual cubes on the smartphone screen, and is then able to flick them out to project them as objects in the real world.
It's an intriguing potential means of control for the platform, but one that Microsoft itself might not agree with. As AfterNow's Jesse Vander Does notes in a blog post, the company asks that “interactions should be a comfortable 1.5 meters from the user” to both reduce eye strain and also “ensure that the items the user is interacting with stay within the frame.”
“Nonetheless, there will most definitely be use cases that benefit from controllers,” Vander Does add. “Moreover, there are a lot of fun things we could do with a 6DoF controller that also has a touch screen.” They gave examples including a sort of mixed reality Tilt Brush, where users might begin a line on the phone and then pull it through real space to make 3D images. You could also pull 3D assets into your phone.
While HoloLens is controller-free, Microsoft is also bringing VR headsets to market that can use physical controllers. We saw one last week that used an Xbox gamepad, but the company also notes that 6DOF controllers will be important to the platform.

It was a kindergarten class piece of art that Jessie Sansone probably won't want to hang on the refrigerator anytime soon.
After Jesse Sansone's 4-year-old daughter drew a picture of a gun, cops handcuffed the clueless father and dragged them off to jail. It was there that the dad was stripped of their clothes and searched by the authorities. Sansone was never charged with a crime.
Sansone wasn't expecting to be greeted by police when they went to pick up their three children from school last week. Faculty there had become concerned, however, after the man's 4-year-old daughter drew an image last Wednesday that they thought warranted investigation. It was a picture of a man holding a gun, and when teachers asked the girl to explain it, they said it was a depiction of their father.
“He uses it to shoot bad guys and monsters,” teachers say the girl explained.
The father says they don't own a gun. Nor do they kill monsters.
“I'm picking up my kids and then, next thing you know, I'm locked up,” Sansone, 26, tells The Record out of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
“I was in shock. This is completely insane. My daughter drew a gun on a piece of paper at school,” they say.
After seeing the image in question, the school's staff became shocked as well. So much so, in fact, that they rang up child welfare officials and local law enforcement and arranged for them to meet the girl's father at the end of the school day. By that evening, Sansone had been handcuffed, whisked away to jail and forced to remove their clothes so they could be subjected to a strip search.
Authorities took all three of Sansone's children and dragged them to Family and Children's Services to be interviewed. Their wife, Stephanie Squires, tells The Record that authorities never explained themselves.
“He had absolutely no idea what this was even about. I just kept telling them. ‘You're making a mistake,' ” they say.
Despite their pleas, the ordeal went on for hours. Sansone says they were scared and was told they would be charged with possession of a firearm. The problem was, they say, that they don't own a gun. After being held for hours, Sansone was eventually freed from jail and was asked to authorize a search of their home. Though they didn't have to comply, they say they did so anyway.
Authorities did not recover any weapons in their search (or monsters). Their wife says they knew they wouldn't. The police, they say, acted on an assumption and nothing else.
“The way everything happened was completely unnecessary, especially since we know the school very well. I don't understand how they came to that conclusion from a four-year-old's drawing,” they say.
The girl's father was pretty surprised the school acted that way, as well. Only last year, they say, the principal offered them a job as a counselor there. Sansone is a licensed personal support worker that educates children in classrooms across the region. The principal, Steve Zack, tells The Record that it was the welfare agency's decision to involve the authorities.
“Police chose to arrest Jessie here. Nobody wants something like this to happen at any time, especially not at school. But that's out of my hands,” Zack explains.
Sansone and their family are left wondering why the investigation carried out as far as it did, however. When The Record followed up on the story days later, Waterloo Regional Police Inspector Kevin Thaler told them, “We had every concern, based on this information that children were in danger.” The information is now being called into question after Thaler adds that investigators never saw the drawing. Neither has Sansone nor the school's superintendent.
Police add that the strip-search was necessary since it was a firearms-related incident.

WATE - KNOXVILLE (WATE) - Cancer Fund of America is going out of business.
According to documents obtained by CNN, for the time being, Cancer Fund of America president James Reynolds Sr. has agreed to close the non-profits doors and let a court-appointed receiver operate the charity. The agreement is not yet binding because the attorneys general have to sign off in writing.
The non-profit was recently listed as the second worst charity in America in a report by Tampa Bay Times. The report found the charity raised $86.8 million by solicitors in 2013, but only about one percent, or $868,000, of that money was spent on aid.
"While Cancer Fund provides care packages that contain shampoo and toothbrushes, the people in charge have personally made millions of dollars and used donations as venture capital to build a charity empire." -Tampa Bay Times
The closure follows a $187 million lawsuit filed against James Reynolds Sr., their ex-wife, Rose Parks, who ran Children's Cancer Fund of America, their son, James Reynolds Jr., who ran The Breast Cancer Society, and a fourth man, Kyle Effler who operated Cancer Support Services.
"Some charities send children to Disney World," South Carolina Secretary of State Mark Hammond said at a Washington, D.C., news conference when the complaint was announced. "These charities sent themselves to Disney World."
In an earlier court document filed by the FTC, it alleged that James Reynolds Sr. "at every turn has demonstrated that they place self-interest above charitable interests and spends charity assets accordingly."
The FTC last summer said its action was "historic" because it was the first time the government had mounted a nationwide action against a charity it said was fraudulent.
Neither James Reynolds Sr., nor their attorney responded to requests for comment on the tentative agreement.

He's middle-aged, their ample belly bulges over their Speedos…and they think drinking two bottles of wine a day keeps them in shape.
Swimmer Martin Strel would be the first to admit they make the unlikeliest of athletes.
But the 55-year-old hard-drinking Slovenian just happens to be the greatest endurance swimmer in the world... ever.
They claimed the title by conquering the world's most dangerous river – the Amazon – swimming 3,274 miles in 66 days, non-stop.
“It helps to be a little crazy, to do what I do,” Martin admits.
“I told myself that I would swim the Amazon or I would die trying.
“I'm a big man, sure, but the Amazon is so much bigger.”
The astonishing story of courage and determination is the subject of a new movie, Big River Man, which opens across the UK next month.
The enthralling film sees Martin brave the constant threat of piranhas, crocodiles and the horrifying candiru fish.
They also had to battle through tropical storms and blistering heat, as well as facing murderous bandits and machete-wielding native tribes.
Add unrelenting diarrhoea to that catalogue of horrors and you get an idea of the type of man Martin is, tackling each obstacle with sheer bloody-mindedness... and a healthy dose of alcohol.
But even as they tell how their doctor warned them to give up drinking to lessen the risk of heart attack, Martin simply cracks open another bottle of red, washing it down with a whisky and some beer.
“I told the doctor I have to drink, I have to swim – I am Martin!” says the part-time guitar teacher.
As a child, they used to leap into the icy river near their home to escape beatings by their father, but they didn't begin serious endurance swimming until 1992.
Their first challenge saw them conquer the 65-mile Krka river in their homeland in 28 hours.
They then swam the English Channel and became the first man to swim across the Mediterranean. Seven men had already died in the attempt, either drowned or eaten by sharks.
They then took on the Danube, before swimming the Mississippi, the Argentine Parana and the Yangtze in China, an experience which left their liver black.
They also swam London's River Thames last year, although its risks were somewhat less than the Yangtze.
Martin says: “The Thames was a little easier to swim than other rivers. I thought it was a very nice, clean river. But it was very cold.”
After such previous conquests, the Amazon must have seemed like a natural progression.
Martin trained more than five hours a day in their local swimming pool and finally began history's longest swim in April 2007. Their daily target was to swim for 10 hours every day, covering around 90km. But the adventure soon became a struggle for survival.
As well as dehydration and exhaustion, water-borne parasites left their body racked with infection and disease, including dengue fever, which triggers painful cramps.
Tarantulas, giant millipedes and scorpions would drop off the trees into the river, often getting entangled in their hair.
Birds would fly down and attempt to peck at theirs face.
Larvae burrowed into their skin and their face was stung by wasps. Some days they even had to wear a pillowcase over their head, with slits for the eyes and mouth to protect their face from the heat.
However the hazards above the water were nothing compared to the horrors below. The biggest danger was the bull shark, responsible for the deaths of more humans than any other type of shark in the area.
Then there are stingrays and anacondas lurking in the shallows, crocodiles and alligators that can seize human-size prey and gobble it whole. Long, poisonous snakes slither out of nowhere and giant catfish up to 15ft long, known to swallow dogs and children, hide in the mud.
Once they had to be hauled from the water screaming in pain, as shoals of piranha fish gnawed at their leg.
They swam in the faster-flowing middle of the channel, in places 100ft deep, in the worst Amazon floods for a century, but sometime they couldn't avoid the stiller water.
In an attempt to stop the razor-jawed piranha fish from smelling him, Martin would lather their body with gasoline and cream and buckets of pigs' blood would be thrown into the water to divert their attention.
But of all the dangers, the one Martin feared most was the tiny candiru, otherwise known as the vampire fish, a parasite with a vicious tactic. It is attracted by the scent of urine and enters the body by swimming up the penis. Once inside it locks itself on with a series of spikes and feeds off blood and tissue. Surgery is the only way to remove it. And if Martin was attacked the nearest emergency ward was hundreds of miles away.
To reduce the risk, Martin never exposed themselves to urinate and always did it inside their wetsuit. “I never looked down,” they said.
The only friendly creatures they met were the porpoises and dolphins who often kept them company, swimming alongside.
Their escort boat, skippered by their son and manager Borut, 28, had a team of armed guards to protect them from river pirates and carried their stockpile of medicine and food...and alcohol.
“Drinking wine is part of my life,” Martin says. “It's my special blend, that I make myself, so it's very healthy and it gives me energy, without making me drunk. I would drink whisky as well, to wash my mouth out before I eat food.
“But sometimes I drank a little just to lift the day, because to swim a river like the Amazon is very hard. You never know what is below the water – and a drink helped me relax. You need a little Dutch courage!”
The toll on their body was immense – they weighed 114kg (250lb) when they started and lost nearly 20kg (44lb) during the swim, despite being on an 11,000 calories-a-day diet to keep up their strength.
Towards the end, they admitted that it felt like “a bomb was about to explode” in their head. They took months to recover. Since their swim, which they undertook to highlight increasing levels of pollution in the world and the threat to the rainforests, Martin has become a huge star back home in Slovenia.
Nowadays, women flock around him, calling them a hero and begging to be their wife.
“Yes, I get hit on a lot and sure, I do like pretty ladies,” Martin says. “But I'm already married. I have to keep my head clear – just as I did when I took on that river.
“I am just a regular man who just has higher goals than usual, not a superman.”
So what's next for the incredible human fish? “Who knows?” shrugs Martin. “Maybe I'll swim right around the world!”

For years, Gac Filipaj mopped floors, cleaned toilets and took out trash at Columbia University.
A refugee from war-torn Yugoslavia, they eked out a living working for the Ivy League school. But Sunday was payback time: The 52-year-old janitor donned a cap and gown to graduate with a bachelor's degree in classics.
As a Columbia employee, they didn't have to pay for the classes they took. Their favorite subject was the Roman philosopher and statesman Seneca, the janitor said during a break from their work at Lerner Hall, the student union building they clean.
“I love Seneca's letters because they're written in the spirit in which I was educated in my family — not to look for fame and fortune, but to have a simple, honest, honorable life,” they said.
Their graduation with honors capped a dozen years of studies, including readings in ancient Latin and Greek.
“This is a man with great pride, whether he's doing custodial work or academics,” said Peter Awn, dean of Columbia's School of General Studies and professor of Islamic studies. “He is immensely humble and grateful, but he's one individual who makes their own future.”
Filipaj was accepted at Columbia after first learning English; their mother tongue is Albanian.
For Filipaj, the degree comes after years of studying late into the night in their Bronx apartment, where he'd open their books after a 2:30-11 p.m. shift as a “heavy cleaner” — their job title. Before exam time or to finish a paper, he'd pull all-nighters, then go to class in the morning and then to work.
On Sunday morning in the sun-drenched grassy quad of Columbia's Manhattan campus, Filipaj flashed a huge smile and a thumbs-up as they walked off the podium after a handshake from Columbia President Lee Bollinger.
Later, Filipaj got a big hug from their boss, Donald Schlosser, Columbia's assistant vice president for campus operations.
Bollinger presided over a ceremony in which General Studies students received their graduation certificates. They also can attend Wednesday's commencement of all Columbia graduates, most of whom are in their 20s.
Filipaj wasn't much older in 1992 when they left Montenegro, then a Yugoslav republic facing a brutal civil war.
An ethnic Albanian and Roman Catholic, they left their family farm in the tiny village of Donja Klezna outside the city of Ulcinj because they were about to be drafted into the Yugoslav army led by Serbs, who considered many Albanians their enemy.
They fled after almost finishing law school in Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital, where they commuted for years by train from Montenegro.
At first in New York, their uncle in the Bronx offered them shelter while they worked as a restaurant busboy.
“I asked people, which are the best schools in New York?” they say. Since Columbia topped their list, “I went there to see if I could get a job.”
Part of their $22-an-hour janitor's pay still goes back to their brother, sister-in-law and two kids in Montenegro. Filipaj has no computer, but they bought one for the family, whose income comes mostly from selling milk.
Filipaj also saves by not paying for a cellphone; they can only be reached via landline.
They wish their father were alive to enjoy their achievement. The elder Filipaj died in April, and the son flew over for the funeral, returning three days later for work and classes.
To relax at home, they enjoy an occasional cigarette and some “grappa” brandy.
“And if I have too much, I just go to sleep,” they say, laughing.
During an interview with The Associated Press in a Lerner Hall conference room, Filipaj didn't show the slightest regret or bitterness about their tough life. Instead, they cheerfully described encounters with surprised younger students who wonder why their classmate is cleaning up after them.
“They say, ‘Aren't you…?'” they said with a grin.
Their ambition is to get a master's degree, maybe even a Ph.D., in Roman and Greek classics. Someday, they hope to become a teacher, while translating their favorite classics into Albanian.
For now, he's trying to get “a better job,” maybe as supervisor of custodians or something similar, at Columbia if possible.
He's not interested in furthering their studies to make more money.
“The richness is in me, in my heart and in my head, not in my pockets,” said Filipaj, who is now an American citizen.
Soon after, the feisty, 5-foot-4 janitor picked up a broom and dustpan and went back to work.
Joe Schilling's relationship with GLORY Kickboxing is no more. It didn't end well, nor when they wanted it to.
Schilling fought for the promotion for nearly three years and competed ten times, which includes a tournament win and middleweight title shot. Their list of accomplishments under the GLORY banner is quite long, to say the least. That said, they aren't happy with the treatment they received as a GLORY fighter, especially during the tail-end of their tenure with the promotion.
“I think that GLORY, it's a pretty dog-shit promotion and they treat their fighters horribly,” Schilling told BloodyElbow.com's The MMA Circus. “Anybody who currently fights for GLORY will feel the same way shortly. I think that the way GLORY treated me throughout my career [considering what] I did for them was atrocious. GLORY is absolutely a horrible promotion and I think nobody should support, promote or fight for them, to be honest with you.
“Throughout my time with GLORY, anytime they had a opportunity to treat me right or screw me over, they always chose to screw me over. And it always came back to bite them in the ass because I did a great job for them and their brand. They're not very good people and they don't treat their fighters very well.”
Schilling wanted out of their contract with the promotion for the better part of the past year. Even though their contract expired last year, they aren't able to leave until last month — unless they wanted to be sidelined for half a year. GLORY had a stipulation in its contract with Schilling refraining them from signing with another promotion for six months would they choose to not re-sign their current contract. Wanting to fight sooner than that, they opted to fight twice more for GLORY to remove the stipulation, which allowed them to sign with their new home of Bellator Kickboxing.
“The last fight that I had a few weeks ago, they were very upset that I wouldn't re-sign a contract with them and they were going to block me from being able to fight or sign a contract with anyone else for almost a year, six months, because I chose to not re-sign a contract with them,” Schilling said. “My last two fights for GLORY were after my contract (was up). I only did those two fights with GLORY because they had stipulations in their contract and they were going to block me from making a living for six months. And they knew that, and they openly said that. After all I had done for them, for them to say that to me, and do that, was wrong.”
Schilling claims GLORY “needed” them on its recent cards because without him, it wouldn't have struck its current deal with UFC Fight Pass, and that UFC Fight Pass specifically requested that they be the Super Fight Series headliner. Despite GLORY's apparent need for “Stitch ‘em Up,” they also say no one was on their side for their last two GLORY fights, including the commentators.
“Once we did that, my last fight for them, they tried to devalue me as much as possible because they were upset I was not going to re-sign with them and that I was going with Bellator,” they said. “How did they do that? They paid all of their commentators to say negative things about me during the fight, which was the most ridiculous sh-t ever. If you watch the fight with me and Jason Wilnis on Fight Pass, and if you listen to the commentary on the fight, it is the most negative nonsense that you'll ever see. You'll be watching the fight and you'll be watching me land 15 punches and hear them say negative things about me and how well Jason Wilnis is doing. The on-screen graphics between rounds were atrocious; it was like a rap sheet of made-up things about me as a child. Whereas on their fighter profile between rounds, it was like, ‘Played soccer until they were 17,' and mine was like, ‘He was kicked out of the family home at 16-years-old,' ‘He was expelled from six schools before graduating from high school.' It was just complete nonsense.”
“They tried to devalue me as much as possible. But what they actually did in the process was destroyed their own credibility. Everybody that saw that fight knows I won that fight. It was just ridiculous, sad. I wasn't going to say all this stuff about them, but for them to go so far out of their way and be so childish simply because I wouldn't re-sign with them, I have no respect for them. I don't think anyone should ever buy another GLORY fight — actually nobody buys it, it's free TV on like ESPN 27 or something. It comes on right after dodge-ball. GLORY sucks.”
The 32-year-old was especially disappointed in GLORY's lack of urgency to re-sign them following the GLORY 17: Last Man Standing tournament in June 2014. After a finish win over current GLORY middleweight champion Simon Marcus and a split decision over Wayne Barrett, Schilling made it to the finals against Artem Levin. They were unable to capture GLORY gold that night, but still put on a memorable night of fights nonetheless.
“I basically made the show and made people watch that tournament,” they said. “Nobody actually watched the tournament, because they decided to make it pay-per-view — they're idiots. But if you watched that show, I fought three times in one night. I ended up getting two herniated discs in my neck, and getting my sternum fractured. And I was in pain for months and months and months. GLORY decided to not re-sign me, which is why I ended up getting with Bellator to begin with. GLORY wouldn't return my phone calls and wouldn't re-sign me, even though I just put on probably the most epic night of fighting that has happened in this country in a long time. They just treated me like sh-t, they treated me like sh-t the whole time. They're just not good people, they're really not good people.”
Schilling, a three-time Bellator MMA veteran, is excited to once again compete for the Viacom-owned promotion (but now under the Bellator Kickboxing banner) because they get treated very, very well by president Scott Coker and other officials.
“Scott Coker and Spike TV and Bellator are the complete opposite,” they said. “They're talking a lot about putting fighters first now and that's exactly what they do. Even after my loss to Hisaki Kato, Scott Coker called me personally two days after to check on me, make sure I was alright. They still wanted to be in the Joe Schilling business and still was going to re-sign me, and still was going to take care of me, or so to speak. GLORY would've never done that. GLORY actually went behind my back and talked to Bellator and tried to get them to pay me less money to drive down my price when I first started fighting with Bellator. That's the kind of people that GLORY is.”
Schilling's focus has been kickboxing for most of their combat sports career — especially as of late — and only dabbles in the sport of mixed martial arts every now and then. Although they understand opportunity may be greater in MMA, they believe he, as well as a handful of other popular kickboxers, can help to kickbox grow.
“I've always kind of known that, since I was a kid when I started kickboxing, there wasn't necessarily as much money in it,” they said. “But I've always felt like I can help build the sport and get it to where it needs to be. I feel like over the last few years I've done just that and it's continuing to pay off.”
Schilling hasn't shut the door on MMA completely. If they receive the right offer to rock four-ounce gloves again, they will take it. But with the launch of Bellator Kickboxing, expect to see them wearing the large gloves for most of their future bouts.
“Before when I was fighting MMA, it was because it was the only option that Bellator had for me,” they said. “And because I was such a high-level kickboxer, they were willing to give me opportunities in MMA. I think that's still something that I enjoy and would like to do. I plan on being a full-time kickboxer so to speak. There are still some interesting matchups here in MMA. If the timing and everything works out, I intend on doing that. But right now, it's great having Bellator Kickboxing and having a new home for kickboxing on SPIKE TV.”
LOS ANGELES --A high school football player in California is being accused of smearing Icy-Hot in an opposing player's face during a game, reports CBS Los Angeles.
Angel Salazar, a player for La Canada High School, was playing Salesian High School when the alleged incident occurred. In a video, a Salesian player appears to reach under Salazar's face mask and smear the heat-rub substance on theirs face.
"Our player came to the sidelines, and they were covered in Icy-Hot. Covered in their face," said La Canada Principal Ian McFeat to CBS LA.
McFeat said they are sharing the video and images with the media so it hopefully doesn't happen to any other athletes.
"That's the kind of substance that if it really got in your eyes, it can do some damage," McFeat added.
Clinical psychologist and Pepperdine University professor Judy Ho tells CBS LA that young athletes will often follow a coach's order out of respect and fear.
"When you're an athlete, you're constantly feeling like your job is on the line. There's always a question of are you going to get to play today," Ho added.
But Ho says, phone cameras are making it easier to document incidents like the one at La Canada. And this incident is nothing new.
Earlier this month, two high school football players deliberately tackled a referee during a game. It happened in Marble Falls, Texas during a 15-9 win by the home team.
One of the John Jay High School players is seen on video running into the back of the referee as they watched a play, and the other dove into the official. Both took running starts.
The player's claimed during a national broadcast interview last week that their coach directed them to strike the referee because of missed calls that had hurt the team. One player also contends that the ref used a racial slur towards a black player, a claim the referees lawyer adamantly disputes.
Just last week, a football player from New Jersey also found themselves in hot water after they were caught with an opposing player helmet in their hands, and then used that helmet to strike the player in the head.
The Syrian army captured territory from Islamic State east of Aleppo including a stretch of highway leading to the jihadists' main stronghold of Raqqa, Syrian state TV reported on Saturday.
The areas captured as part of the Syrian army's advance on the terrorists' positions with support from Russian airstrikes are east of the Kweires air base seized from Islamic State control earlier this month.
Earlier in November, the Syrian army lifted the siege of the Kweiris military airbase. The Kweiris airbase had been under ISIL siege for two years until the Syrian government forces with Russian air support advanced into the area and cleared it of jihadists, leaving a large number of them dead and wounded in the process.
According to a state television report, the army had captured two villages and large swathes of farmland, seizing tunnels and fortifications built by the jihadists.
The villages are about 60 km east of Aleppo.
The Syrian government and its allies have also made gains against Islamic State to the southeast of Homs.
Former Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has a message for the current administration: Don't get into a war in Syria.
"I do not want to see the United States get sucked into perpetual warfare in the Middle East, see our men and women get killed, trillions of dollars being spent," the Vermont senator said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."
They instead called on President Trump to focus on what needs attention at home in America.
"I don't want to see us dragged into another war in Syria when kids in this country cannot afford to go to college, when our infrastructure is collapsing, when 28 million Americans have no health insurance, we have got to start paying attention to the needs back home," Sanders explained.
Their solution for what is happening in Syria — something they said is "almost beyond belief" — is to instead work with U.S. allies in the region.
"You have a dictator there who appears prepared to destroy their entire country in order to hold onto their power and their wealth," Sanders said. "Four a hundred thousand Syrians are dead. Ten million people displaced. They have detainment camps, massive torture, they bomb hospitals. This is a horrific regime."
Sen. @BernieSanders on Syria: The US needs a strategy that demands Russia stop providing weaponry to Assad #CNNSOTU https://t.co/QL9kJSxK12— CNN (@CNN) April 16, 2017
Sanders said that Syrian President Bashar Assad "has got to go" and "ISIS has got to be defeated," but urged the Trump administration to "not act unilaterally."
"In this case, we have got to demand that Russia and Iran stop their efforts in supporting this horrific dictator," Sanders said.
The Trump administration has condemned Assad, who the U.S. military believes is using chemical weapons against their own people. However, beyond a missile strike on an airfield in Syria, Trump has sent mixed messages on what their move will be.
Viktor Arvidsson has been sensational this year.
In every minute of ice time, they bring a level of intensity, competitiveness, and determination that no one else on the team seems to be able to match. Add to that their surprising increase in skilled play and their incredible consistency, and you have a true breakout season. That they also have the runaway winner for goal of the year is merely icing on the cake.
Early on, it looked like Arvidsson was just going to be fun to watch, but they slowly became arguably the most valuable member of the team. An offensive machine, they rank 5th in the league among regular starters in even strength shot attempts per 60 minutes and 3rd in the league in even strength shots on goal. And he's getting results to back up their play: they currently lead the team in goals with 18 and is second behind Ryan Johansen in points with 39. No Preds fan saw that coming and yet here we are.
So, it's time to talk about what kind of contract they are building for himself.
Arvidsson is a restricted free agent at the end of this season, when their entry-level contract runs out. When the season is over, the Preds have until late June to send them a qualifying offer, otherwise they become an unrestricted free agent. They could also file for arbitration if they so choose, though players actually going to arbitration hearings is exceedingly rare in today's NHL. If everything works out as it should, David Poile should have plenty of opportunities to get a deal with Arvidsson done before arbitration or offer sheets (also rare) or bare-minimum qualifying offers come forth.
But what might this contract look like?
For the purpose of this analysis, let's take the expansion draft obstacle out of the way. There are some scenarios in which Viktor Arvidsson is playing in Vegas next year, some of which we go into here, but let's just assume that doesn't happen. Let's assume that either Arvidsson is protected outright or that Poile offers George McPhee the Fontanel Mansion and the Jack Daniel's Distillery in exchange for not selecting him.
Arvidsson's Comparables (as if that's possible)
When looking at the value of a player like Arvidsson, we must play the role of the arbitrator. As an ostensibly neutral party, we separate our emotions from the player and we go out and find comparables.
This is difficult to do, because, as Preds fans, we are notably biased when it comes to Arvidsson. It's also difficult because he's such a unique player. You really can't find an Arvidsson anywhere else in the league. The best we can do is to find guys who get similar results and who play a similar game.
To find comparables, I first looked for forwards (mostly wingers) who signed contracts within the last three years after having just played out their entry-level contracts. I then filtered out forwards who are, more or less, similar to Arvidsson in playing style, usage, size, and skill-set. Sorry, but Arvy is not Vladimir Tarasenko, so they aren't getting $7.5 million per year.
I eventually narrowed the list down to Anders Lee, Brendan Gallagher, Charlie Coyle, Matt Beleskey, Ondrej Palat, Reilly Smith, and Tomas Hertl.
These forwards are your faster, more disruptive forwards rather than pure skill forwards. They have plenty of skill, no doubt, but their offensive skills go beyond a wicked wrist shot or puck-handling skills. These guys play all over the offensive zone. They forecheck well. They energize the offense, while antagonizing the opposing defense. Their passing and shooting are above average and, most importantly, they read the game extremely well.
You know, they Arvy.
So let's take a look at a how these seven players performed in the final two seasons of their entry level contracts before going on to a well deserved raise. We'll just look at a few stats: points per 60 minutes, shot attempts for per 60 minutes, and shot attempts allowed per 60 minutes.
Seasons Player Points P/60 CF CF/60 CA CA/60 Overall TOI ES TOI Seasons Player Points P/60 CF CF/60 CA CA/60 Overall TOI ES TOI 2013-14, 2014-15 Matt Beleskey 56 2.07 1382 59.36 1290 55.41 1625 1396.9 2014-15, 2015-16 Tomas Hertl 77 1.86 2377 64.35 1944 52.63 2487 2216.3 2012-13, 2013-14 Ondrej Palat 64 2.36 1209 55.38 1176 53.87 1625 1309.8 2013-14, 2014-15 Brendan Gallagher 88 1.99 2431 64.94 2146 57.33 2653 2246 2013-14, 2014-15 Charlie Coyle 65 1.63 1854 53.05 1884 53.91 2389 2096.7 2014-15, 2015-16 Reilly Smith 90 1.95 2145 57.98 1831 49.50 2773 2219.6 2013-14, 2014-15 Anders Lee 55 2.29 1340 66.71 1109 55.21 1440 1205.3 2015-16, 2016-17 Viktor Arvidsson 55 2.06 1542 65.16 1266 53.50 1603 1419.8
Arvidsson's rates compare very favorably to the likes of all these guys. Their points per 60 minutes ranks 4th among these players, though Lee and Palat shot well over 12% in their final two ELC seasons and are generally seen as more pure shooters than the rest of this group. Arvy's shot attempts for per 60 minutes ranks 2nd behind Lee and ahead of the most notorious Corsi master of this group, Gallagher. Arvy's work at the other end of the ice, their shot attempts allowed per 60 minutes, ranks 3rd best behind Smith and Hertl.
It's worth pointing out that Arvidsson is still in the final year of their ELC, so their numbers could go up or down. Assuming they don't fall through the ice at any point, their numbers should remain somewhat constant.
Earned Money
So after looking at how these players compare to Arvidsson on the ice in the final two years of their entry-level contracts, here's a rundown of the ensuing contracts these other players earned. Listed is their age at the beginning of their new contract, the beginning year of the new contract, the term length and total value, and the AAV (average annual value).
Tomas Hertl, RW
Age: 22
Contract Year: 2016
Term & Value: 2 years, $6 million
AAV: $3.0 million
Charlie Coyle, C/RW
Age: 22
Contract Year: 2015
Term & Value: 5 years, $16 million
AAV: $3.2 million
Ondrej Palat, LW
Age: 22
Contract Year: 2014
Term & Value: 3 years, $10 million
AAV: $3.3 million
Brendan Gallagher, RW
Age: 22
Contract Year: 2015
Term & Value: 6 years, $22.5 million
AAV: $3.75 million
Anders Lee, LW/C
Age: 24
Contract Year: 2015
Term & Value: 4 years, $15 million
AAV: $3.75 million
Matt Beleskey, LW
Age: 26
Contract Year: 2015
Term & Value: 5 years, $19 million
AAV: $3.8 million
Reilly Smith, RW
Age: 24
Contract Year: 2016*
Term & Value: 5 years, $25 million
AAV: $5 million
*Note: This was Smith's 2nd contract after their entry level contract. They were given a two-year, $6.8 million bridge contract in 2015 that was extended in 2016 after a 25 goal, 25 assist campaign that year.
Looking at these contracts, there are a few things that stick out. Outside of Smith, they are all fairly consistent on value, with an AAV between $3 and $4 million per year. Beleskey is overvalued, while Lee and Hertl are undervalued. Hertl's contract is especially team friendly, as it seemed like they might be headed for something in the $4-5 million range when their contract ended last summer, instead opting for more of a bridge deal at $3 million per year.
I would bet their value is more along the lines of Smith's when it runs out, though they have battled injuries this season. Palat's contract is excellent (Steve Yzerman, duh) and Coyle's contract is expansion draft friendly on a Wild team that might not have room to keep him.
The term lengths vary greatly, everything from two to six years, but most of them stretch out enough so that they expire around the time that the player's RFA status runs out. Gallagher's contract is the longest at six years and is arguably one of the best in the league.
In general, these are very team friendly contracts for very team oriented players. Which brings us to Arvidsson.
Arvidsson's Payout
These are not perfect comparisons. As I mentioned earlier, no player in the league is quite like Arvy. Lee, for example, is quite a bit bigger than Arvy, has a better shot, and is really more of a center. Coyle is also a bit bigger and really more of a two-way forward. Palat is more of a true skilled winger, with a great shot. Beleskey is more of... well, I'm not sure what they are, and to be honest, neither are the Bruins.
The best comparison to Arvy I can see on this list is Gallagher. They play a similar game, are similar in size, can play almost anywhere in the lineup, and use their speed to make a difference in the game.
Given this, I would expect Arvidsson's contract to have a longer term with a higher AAV relative to these players. My prediction is six years, $24 million, putting their average annual salary at $4 million. Since they will be 23-years-old at the time of the contract, a six-year deal would give the Preds plenty of peak mileage out of Arvy, while still leaving them a chance at another payout before turning 30-years-old.
Whatever the contract looks like, let's hope Poile can get something worked out before too long. I hear they are running out of Arvidsson shirseys at the team store, which is a travesty. A long term contract would ensure that No. 38 gear lines the halls of Bridgestone for the foreseeable future.

The Frenchman and their American outfit have been one of the sensations of 2016 after scoring points in the first two races of the campaign.
And with their former Renault outfit having yet to finish in the top 10 after its winter of restructuring, Grosjean has said that they have never doubted that they were doing the right thing in joining Haas.
“Some people said it was a career suicide, but I think they were wrong, so sorry guys,” explained Grosjean.
“I am very glad. I say thanks to [sponsor] Total, to Renault, to all those guys at Enstone who helped me, but I made my choice. I believed in the project and I had seen enough to think that in few years in F1 that it could be good.
“Now we see the truth, and so yes it has probably allowed me to grow up in a different environment, where they are more welcome.
"They really wanted an experienced driver, they rely on me, and although after races [like Bahrain] we are tired as we have to give a lot of energy, on the other hand it fills you up with the confidence they put on you. It's very nice.”
Keeping up form
Haas is hoping to bring regular developments to its car, although it feels that there is still more potential to be unlocked from the current configuration.
Grosjean believes that the team can build on the strong start to the year, rather than feel it will inevitably fall away as bigger money rivals bring on their upgrades.
“We'll try,” they said. “Gunther [Steiner] is going to push to get everything we need to get the upgrades.
“We are a small team unlike others, so it's going to be harder. But I think we've got some very clever people and there are clear direction that we want to go.
“Generally you want more downforce with no more drag in the car. You want a few places to be improved.
“I think [in Bahrain] we had clear ideas what we could do with the mechanical setup as well. You are used to numbers from the past and you come here and the numbers are different.
“F1 tends to go in one direction, and then you realize the numbers don't mean the same one day as they used to mean another day. So, you have to reset your mind. That's not easy to do.”
China challenge
Although Haas has shown good race pace in the first two events, Grosjean is aware that China's track characteristic – and the fact it is so hard on front tyres – will make it much harder.
“China will be massive front graining as it's front-limited,” they said. “We need to work around that.
“So far, we've been very good protecting our rears. With front graining I don't know. So, it's going to be interesting to see.
“All the people have got data from previous years, mechanical balance and everything. We have nothing.”

EXCLUSIVE: Horror-themed cable channel FearNet has greenlighted its first original series, Holliston, an offbeat half-hour, multicamera buddy comedy series starring genre filmmakers Adam Green (Hatchet 1 & 2) and Joe Lynch (Knights of Badassdom). The six-episode series, created by Green, is scheduled to start production later this year. It marks the first original production for the linear network. (FearNet has done original digital series for the Web.) Holliston is expected to join FearNet's Tuesday night Twisted Comedy block, a horror-comedy lineup that launched earlier this month with two acquired scripted series, Todd & the Book Of Pure Evil and Psychoville.
Set in the town of Holliston, Mass., Holliston is described as “Wayne's World meets Saw” and stars Green and Lynch as lesser versions of themselves. They will play Adam and Joe, two friends chasing the dream of becoming successful horror movie filmmakers while struggling to make ends meet and dealing with life and the opposite sex in their post-college jobs at a cable access station where they also host a late-night movie program called The Movie Crypt. “This show has just the right amount of wrong, and you really can't imagine it ever making it on to TV. That's where FearNet comes in,” said FearNet president Peter Block. “Adam came to us with a truly off-the-wall series that was overflowing with a supporting cast of misfits and I-don't-know-whats, and we knew it was a perfect fit for our Twisted Comedy block.” The ensemble cast of the series includes Laura Ortiz (The Hills Have Eyes) and singer Corri English (Unrest), with well-known genre figures expected to make cameos. “This is a show built on the memories and real-life experiences of our post-college days, wrapped in a shroud of wrongness, packed full of movie quotes and genre references, and topped off with plenty of jokes at the expense of our real-life friends and industry associates,” said Green. “No other network would have the guts to make this show; we're pushing the boundaries of television. I mean, what other sitcom on television includes exploding heads and an imaginary alien friend who lives in the closet? We plan to really turn the traditional American sitcom on its head. It's the first horror sitcom. A hor-icom!” Holliston is created, written, and directed by Green, with their production company ArieScope Pictures handling the production. Green and Lynch will serve as executive producers along with Cory Neal (Frozen).

Gameweek 18 proved to be another successful one for the Bookies' Advantage squad with a 66 point haul. This was mainly thanks to the efforts of captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic (30) and Eden Hazard (10).
Read on as we present the clean sheet and anytime goalscorer odds for Gameweek 19 in order to help you with your transfer, squad selection and captaincy decisions…
Defensive odds
Team Best clean sheet odds Implied chance of a clean sheet Man Utd 1.75 57% Chelsea 1.8 56% Southampton 2.05 49% Arsenal 2.1 48% Everton 2.38 42% Tottenham 2.45 41% Burnley 2.75 36% Leicester 2.9 34% Sunderland 3.3 30% Bournemouth 3.5 29% Swansea 3.6 28% Liverpool 3.8 26% West Ham 4.33 23% Man City 4.5 22% Hull 4.5 22% Watford 5 20% West Brom 5 20% Middlesbrough 8.8 11% Stoke 9.6 10% Crystal Palace 11 9%
Manchester United sit top of the bookies' defensive rankings for the second gameweek in succession with a 57% chance of shutting out Middlesbrough at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. The Red Devils have kept 2 clean sheets in their last 4 outings, whilst Aitor Karanka's men have only scored 7 in their 9 away games so far, blanking in both of their last 2. Phil Jones is the cheapest starter in United's back line and makes our XI.
Chelsea are hot on United's tails in the rankings with a 56% chance of a clean sheet when Stoke visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Blues have the best defence in the division, conceding just 11 goals in 18 games, and have recorded 8 clean sheets in their last 10 games. The Potters have scored 9 goals in 9 on their travels this term, including in each of their last 6, but the return of N'Golo Kante from suspension should shore up Antonio Conte's back line even further. Marcos Alonso continues to offer attacking threat from their left midfield berth and starts for our squad.
Southampton (49%) and Arsenal (48%) rank third and fourth for Gameweek 19 when they entertain West Brom and Crystal Palace respectively. The Saints, prior to last night's game against Tottenham, had the second best home defence in the league, conceding just 5 times in 8 matches, including clean sheets in each of their last 3 at St Mary's. Opponents West Brom have scored just 7 times in 9 on the road, blanking in their last 2. Arsenal, meanwhile, kept their first clean sheet at The Emirates since October in Gameweek 18, and will be looking to add to that when Crystal Palace visit on New Year's Day. However, with the Eagles currently the fourth best away attack in the top flight (17 scored in 9 games), the Gunners' defence will have to be at their best to register successive shutouts. Fraser Forster and Gabriel offer security of starts and value respectively, seeing both make our starting XI.
To fill the remainder of our defensive slots, we opt for Stoke's budget friendly Lee Grant (£4.0m – 10%) as our backup keeper, with Everton's Mason Holgate (£4.0m – 42%) and Burnley's Ben Mee (£4.5m – 36%) taking the second and third spots on our bench respectively.
Before moving onto our analysis of the bookmakers attacking odds, a quick look at the bottom rungs of the clean sheet ladder tells us that defensive assets from Middlesbrough (11% – away to Man United), Stoke (10% – away to Chelsea) and Crystal Palace (9% – away to Arsenal) should be avoided this weekend.
Attacking odds

Diego Costa returns from suspension and returns to the top of the bookmakers' attacking ranks with a 59% chance of finding the net against Stoke on Saturday. The Premier League's top scorer (13 goals) takes on a Stoke Side that have conceded 15 times in 9 away games, including 7 in their last 2. The fiery Spaniard dons our captain's armband for Gameweek 19.
Olivier Giroud (52%) and Romelu Lukaku (43%) complete our front line. The Frenchman started last time out in the absence of the injured Theo Walcott and bagged the winner for the Gunners, which should see them retain their place in their starting XI. An Emirates encounter with Crystal Palace, who have let in 20 goals on their travels, the fourth worst away defence in the league, offers Giroud a good opportunity for back-to-back goals, especially given the fact that the Eagles are yet to keep an away clean sheet this season. Lukaku was also on the scoresheet in Gameweek 18, their tenth of the campaign, and makes the journey to Hull on Friday evening, with the Tigers conceding an average of 2 goals per game at home this term and without a clean sheet at The KC Stadium.
The bookies also fancy the chances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic (51%), Harry Kane (47%) and Michy Batshuayi (51%) ahead of meetings with Middlesbrough, Watford and Stoke respectively, but we overlook the trio due to their price (Zlatan and Kane) and lack of starting security (Batshuayi).
Arsenal's home clash with Palace sees us double up on their attackers, with Alexis Sanchez (56%) joining Olivier Giroud in our starting XI. The Chilean superstar has 12 goals to their name in the league this campaign. Joining Alexis in our midfield is Heung-Min Son (32%). The Tottenham midfielder should return to the Lillywhites' starting XI after bagging off the bench against Southampton – their sixth goal in the league this season. The Hornets are without a clean sheet in 8 matches.
Gylfi Sigurdsson and Willian (both 31%) complete our lineup for Gameweek 19. Swansea's Icelandic talisman will be looking to drag their side off the bottom of the table, and add to the 5 goals they have scored this term, against a Bournemouth unit that have conceded 9 in their last 3 on the road. Willian, meanwhile, should start for Chelsea against Stoke, given Pedro's suspension, hoping to build on a goal and an assist in their last 5 outings. As is customary, Etienne Capoue (13%) takes the first spot on our substitutes bench.
The bookmakers also fancy the chances of Eden Hazard (45% – price), Theo Walcott (43% – injury doubt), Sadio Mane (32% – price) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (32% – price), but we have to forgo the services of the quartet for the reasons given in parentheses.
A young man in a checkered shirt and jeans sips an iced latte while trucks and traffic rumble by on Central Avenue. They pause to take in the view of downtown — the pings from their laptop momentarily forgotten.
This might be the best $4 view in the city, only it's not in Kansas City, Missouri. It's in Kansas City, Kansas, where Splitlog Coffee quietly opened three weeks ago at 548 Central Avenue, across the street from Slap's BBQ.
“Strawberry Hill is in this unique position being so close to downtown Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri,” said Simeon Bricker, the manager of Splitlog Coffee. “It's ripe for becoming a hip new spot.”
That's long been the thought of Adam and Caleb Wittmer, the brothers who own the building. And this isn't their first attempt to bring a coffee shop to Strawberry Hill. Flywheel Coffee operated for eight months in the former barber shop space between December 2012 and July 2013.
“It's unfortunate that it didn't work out with Flywheel, but the coffee community has grown in Kansas City since then,” Bricker said.
The tiny square building has been updated with a coat of grey paint and the major addition of a drive-through.The interior is a mix of white paint and light wood, a pair of shelves with grey stools ring two walls. The name is a tribute to mill owner Mathias Splitlog and Splitlog Hill, the name given to the neighborhood that we know now as Strawberry Hill.

The Wittmer brothers tabbed Bricker, who has been behind the bar at Quay Coffee and The Roasterie, to run the shop back in February. They spent the last three months designing and building out the space.
“The idea for the shop was to emphasize convenience and efficiency while holding on to quality. That's what people have come to expect from Kansas City coffee,” said Bricker.
The coffee menu is meant to be accessible. Messenger Coffee is batch brewed for those that just want a cup while Splitlog also offers espresso-based drinks: lattes (iced or hot), cappuccinos, and Americanos. They're also serving pourovers and toddy coffee.
Bricker, who won the National Latte Art Championship in 2014, is partial to the Hit and Run — a shot of espresso to stay and a 12-ounce cup for the road (those in the drive through can order a ‘Red Eye,' where the shot is dropped in the cup).
“[The Hit and Run] is my favorite drink. It had to be on the menu,” said Bricker. “It's what I order when I go to a new coffee shop.”
Bricker — who worked as a barista trainer and quality control manager for The Roasterie — is in the process of building out the coffee program. He's looking to feature a different roaster from around the country each month to complement the choices from Messenger. First up (and likely behind the bar this week) is a trio of coffees — Kenyan, Ethiopian, and Spring Break Blend — from Per'La Specialty Roasters in Miami, Florida.
“The Kenyan has this wonderful phosphorous acidity and rich cherry, winey-ness. It's super clean and clear,” said Bricker.
The pastry case on the brew bar is stocked with baked goods from Hana's Donuts and SunFlour Bakery, both based in Kansas City, Kansas. Sunflower bakes an assortment of muffins, scones, and croissants, including one with provolone and dry copa that Bricker recommends pairing with their coffee offerings. Softball-sized cinnamon rolls are available (although you'll have to find your own microwave or toaster if you want it heated up).
Splitlog is open from 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Saturday. They'll look to extend their hours in the near future, likely in June. Bricker is also playing around with specialty drinks, considering adding in syrups from Boozy Botanicals, for a seasonal coffee menu.
“People love that city view,” said Bricker. “They just get a cup of coffee, sit outside, and look downtown.”

Arsène Wenger's reluctance to close the door on Diaby is admirable – a human response in a hard-nosed business. But would a new contract be the right thing for the club?
Watching the deceptive no-look pass, the driven volley and the general sparkle that invited acclaim for Tomas Rosicky over the weekend, what must have been going through the mind of their unluckiest team-mate? Abou Diaby, as with Rosicky not so long ago, lives in a cycle of seemingly endless rehabilitation wondering what will become of their football aspirations. The thought of expressing themselves in a big game is something that must be painful as well as an imperative target to cling to.
Rosicky was 28, the same age as Diaby is now, when their career suddenly broke down. The Czech spent one and a half seasons out the game, the victim of an injury so baffling that nobody appeared to know exactly what was wrong or how to deal with it for months on end. Arsène Wenger gave evasive answers and Rosicky existed in some kind of footballing Bermuda Triangle.
The last couple of years for Diaby have been a virtual write-off. This season they have played only 67 minutes of a Capital One Cup tie. Last season they managed one 16-minute substitute appearance during the entire campaign. That is it. When they are not abroad in their persistent search for fitness they watch games at the Emirates, pops into the dressing room to see their team-mates but seldom gets close to the pitch.
Gabriel Paulista completes transfer to Arsenal from Villarreal Read more
Last week Wenger altered the generally positive tune they maintain when discussing Diaby. The Arsenal manager said they had “a decision to make” about the player's future – a decision complicated by the fact they are not strong enough to take any part in practice on the training pitch. A couple of months previously Wenger had been much more encouraging, stating Diaby would be given a new contract if they were fully fit.
Lots of eyebrows went up in the room. Really? Of course the caveat – if they are fully fit – is a pretty unlikely one but it still appeared a remarkable show of faith in a player whose problems seem to be unending. They have managed a mere 22 appearances over the past four seasons.
As Arsenal were in shaky form at the time, the notion of a new deal for a player who has offered so little in recent years actually made a sector of the club's support very cross: “How dare Wenger waste more salary funds and a valuable squad position on a crock!” Diaby's name provokes a weird game of sporting scruples. The head says they cannot possibly be given a new deal. The heart – certainly from Wenger's angle – wants to give them every chance.
Wenger's reluctance to close the door on Diaby is admirable. It is a human response in a hard-nosed business. They desperately want this boy to have a chance to become a version of the player they should have been – but for a horror challenge that threw everything off course eight years ago. Diaby's career was jolted by a brutal tackle by Sunderland's Dan Smith five months after joining Arsenal in 2006 – they were 20 then. They have never really recovered from that shattered ankle, despite numerous dedicated fitness campaigns since.
The manager has huge respect for the man as well as the player, having witnessed how much effort Diaby has put into trying to regain enough robustness to tie their boots competitively, again and again.
While weighing up what to do with Diaby, whose contract expires in the summer, there might be a part of Wenger that looks at Rosicky, remembers the mess they were in at the same age and hopes that some kind of miracle return from the wilderness of a long-term, complex, setback-ridden injury is possible. However, the practical part has to look at the probable.
Diaby's situation does not fit comfortably with the current rules over squad numbers. Premier League regulations allow each club to select a maximum of 25 players, 17 of whom who are not classified as home-grown. Diaby uses up one of those valuable places. Wenger earmarked one of the defensive midfield slots for them this season, a position that has gnawed for years and become especially problematic in the absence of Mikel Arteta when they lost four out of nine league games at the beginning of winter – that was BC, before Coquelin, incidentally.
In terms of squad management, of Arsenal's group of 25 Diaby was one of seven players who did not pick up a single Premier League start before Christmas. There were some experienced internationals in that group – Rosicky being one, Lukas Podolski, since offloaded to Internazionale, another. Joel Campbell, on their way to Villarreal, did not get a look-in. Theo Walcott and David Ospina were not available for a long stretch with injury. Then there was Francis Coquelin, diverted to Charlton as they were considered surplus to requirements. Altogether 28% of the named squad did not start a game for half a season, which obviously puts additional strain on the rest.
Of that seven some have returned to seize the moment and the manager's attention. Rosicky, Walcott, Ospina and, most surprisingly of all, Coquelin have shown the intent to make their mark on the second half of the season. Two have been loaned to different leagues to play more football.
That just leaves Diaby, still in the footballing cold. Graciously and diligently, they continue working on those delicate limbs and muscles for the slim chance to play football.
After Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress, we can all be sure of one thing: despite their administration's love of alternative facts, they were being dead serious about their terrible campaign promises. Their cabinet appointments have been stacked with climate change deniers, oil company CEOs and Wall Street executives who put more stock in their profits than our families' health and safety. And as we expected, Trump's decisions already spell disaster for our environment: their support of the Dakota Access Pipeline and Keystone XL Pipeline signals an escalation in our fight against fossil fuel infrastructure and production. We're in for the fight of our lives.
At Food & Water Watch, we've been taking the threat of Trump's presidency and their corporate cabinet seriously. That's why we helped to organize a Resistance Rally outside the White House before Trump's address to let them know that their attacks against our environment, public health, immigrants, women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community do not represent American values.
Now, Trump is planning to slash funding for key agencies like the EPA that help to protect our rights to clean air and drinking water. Our Executive Director Wenonah Hauter sat down earlier today to hear from supporters like you and discuss the real State of the Union:
To achieve any progress in the next four years, we can't sugarcoat the situation: we're at a point unlike any we've faced in our history. But, our history should also give us the courage to fight—and a blueprint to victory: we can prevent the worst of Trump's plans and block their corporate agenda. And we can rebuild and reaffirm what a real, positive vision of a country with renewable energy, safe and reliable water infrastructure and a healthy food system can look like.
How? The same way we've always won any major victories: through people coming together and holding their elected officials accountable. In order for us to protect our families and our environment from the assaults Trump has already launched, we're planning on calling on every voice we can find and speaking up at every level we can. We do this through rallies, marches and meetings with our representatives to make sure they understand what we want. At the federal level, our actions will be aimed at resisting Trump's heinous proposals, defending the EPA, protecting our public lands from fracking and oil and gas drilling, and rebuilding our nation's public water infrastructure.
At the state level, we have campaigns in Maryland and Florida to ban fracking, permanently. In Colorado, we're working to transition to 100 percent renewable energy. In California, we're fighting to end the practice of irrigating crops with oil wastewater, while also winning fracking bans in communities across the state. And rest assured we're working across the country to make sure that everyone can be sure their food and water is reliable and safe.
We'll need all of your support to win. More and more people have been joining the fight by calling their senators and representatives, signing petitions or attending rallies. Another great way to make a quick and immediate impact in our fight is to start a monthly donation with us. And if you start a monthly donation by midnight on Saturday, that impact will be doubled, thanks to a generous donor who wants to help us do everything we can do protect our food and water from Trump.
The gifts of our supporters have gone a long way in this fight already. Since we take no corporate or government donations or funds, the donations of our supporters will help to:
Conduct research that exposes the connections between Trump, their cabinet and the fossil fuel industry;
Continue to strengthen a grassroots movement that has already banned fracking in the state of New York and in Monterey County, California and other counties across the country;
Coordinate more rallies like the Resistance Address and provide people more ways to get involved to resist Trump's terrible policies and rebuild our democracy.
Remember, when people come together, they can win. Despite the challenges we're surely up against, we can not only stop Trump's pro-corporate, pro-fossil fuels agenda – we can rebuild for our future and set forth a vision that protects both people and the planet.
Join us today by making a monthly donation!
The Philadelphia 76ers became the first American professional sports franchise to own an e-sports team with the purchase of pro gaming outfits Dignitas and Apex. If this isn't proof positive that online pro gaming is big business, I don't know what is.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but they're not paying in Mountain Dew, that's for sure. Dignitas, which will absorb League of Legends team Apex as part of the deal, now has about two dozen gamers on its payroll and competes in CS:GO, Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm and Smite.
It's been in the works for a year or so, and Michael O'Dell, who's owned Dignitas since 2003, is optimistic.
“I've seen the good times. I've seen the bad times,” they told Slingshot. “The fact that the 76ers are coming in now will help me legitimize what I've been doing for such a long time.”
Scott O'Neil, meanwhile, CEO of the Sixers, hasn't played a video game since Pong. But you don't have to play the game to play the game, if you know what I mean.
“We were smart enough to know what we didn't know,” they told ESPN. What they did know was that tens of millions of people (young people, with disposable income!) were regularly watching e-sports, paying for tickets, buying merchandise and so on.
The purchase is really just dipping a toe in the market, considering the quantities of cash pro franchises handle regularly, but it sets an important precedent and, if it's successful, will likely be the first of many such moves by the big teams.
For instruction, they would do well to look to Europe and Asia, where pro gaming has been mainstream for years and structures for partnerships, events and publicity are well established.
The deal is full of possibility, but everyone involved is speaking only in the most general terms; check out the press release if you like enthusiastic quotes.

In March of 2002 I received a press release from Stanford University. It read, in part:
"In a new study, Stanford researchers describe a treatable medical condition which causes people to commit violent sexual acts in their sleep.
Referred to as "sleep sex," the nocturnal activities cited in the study range from disruptive moaning to rape-like behavior toward bed partners."
Although this may sound like a psychological problem, researchers believe it's actually a medical disorder caused by glitches in brain waves during sleep. As such, it is treatable.
The disorder runs the gamut from loud and disturbing moaning to violent, bruising masturbation to rape-like attacks and other violent acts upon the bed partner. One man actually tried to strangle their wife while on the throes of one of these disturbances. Another victim tried to stop the behavior by using restraints. They broke two fingers while attempting, in their sleep, to escape.
It Is Treatable
Some people with this disorder (and it can attack both men and women) have been putting themselves and others at risk for years. The disturbances have gone unreported for several reasons: some people are afraid, embarrassed or ashamed to discuss the problem with their doctors. Many believe it is of no use because there's nothing that can be done. And that's where they're wrong.
The disorder is caused by unusual brain wave patterns during sleep similar to those seen in sleepwalkers. It can be treated with drugs such as Valium, or, even in some cases, with treatment used for sleep breathing problems.
Christian Guilleminault, MD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford School of Medicine says:
"The aggressor and the victim are often both in difficult situations and don't know how to express the problem. They feel that there is nowhere to turn."
More research is being done in the field of sleepsex, or, as it's now being labeled, sexsomnia. Sexsomnia can occur in people with several different sleep disorders, including insomnia and restless legs syndrome.
Another disorder that sometimes exhibits aberrant sexual behavior is Kleine-Levin syndrome. Sometimes the abnormal sex behavior is not sexomnia, and occurs during waking hours. However, Kleine-Levin Syndrome is still classed as a sleep disorder.
Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a rare disorder that causes excessive sleep or hypersomolance. It also causes compulsive eating, and an abnormal sex drive. It seems to be most prevalent among teenagers. However, once someone contracts the disorder, it doesn't necessarily end with the end of the teens. The malady may occur off and on throughout adult life.
Like sleep paralysis, sexsomnia is a parasomnia and an arousal disorder. Many sleep disorders fall under this category, including sleepwalking, sleepeating, sleep sex, teeth grinding, night terrors, rhythmic movement disorder, REM behaviour disorder, restless legs syndrome, and talking in one's sleep.
If you or your partner suffers from sexsomnia, talk to your doctor. Help is available. The drug clonazepam (Klonopin) has brought some relief to people suffering from a variety of parasomnias.
If you are a victim of any of the disturbances mentioned in this article, talk to your doctor. Help and support are available. An excellent place to look for help or information is the Sleepsex.org site. After two years of collecting reports and conducting interviews with those who were willing, Michael Mandan wrote the first (and only) book about sleepsex: "Sleepsex: Uncovered." It was published December 2001.
Measles are spread through the air by infectious droplets and is highly contagious. It can be transmitted from four days before the rash becomes visible to four days after the rash appears, according to health officials.Adolescents and adults may require two doses of MMR, people with underlying health conditions should discuss additional booster doses with their health care provider to determine need. Health officials encourage all Floridians who have not been immunized to get vaccinated immediately.Measles are very rare in countries and regions of the world that are able to keep vaccination coverage high. There are still sporadic cases of measles in the United States because visitors from other countries or U.S. citizens traveling abroad can become infected before or during travel and spread the infection to unvaccinated or unprotected persons, according to health officials.Residents who have questions about measles or how to get vaccinated are encouraged to call their local county health department.

Robert Paylor plays against the University of British Columbia in Berkeley, Calif., in February. (Abel Barrientes via AP)
California-Berkeley rugby player Robert Paylor's life changed in an instant on Saturday when a freak accident during the Bears' 43-13 national championship victory over Arkansas State left them paralyzed from the chest down. One thing remained remarkably steady, however. The 6-foot-5, 233-pound sophomore showed they still have the same bright, wide smile that made them such a popular teammate in the first place.
“He's a young man of incredible faith,” a family friend, Jennifer Douglas, told the Mercury News. “He is going to fight. There is nothing that will get in their way. They believe they will beat this thing.  They are so positive and that's what he's going to need for this.”
Douglas, whose son Tyler is also on the team, called the injury “a very unfortunate circumstance,” which occurred through no fault of any player.
“They're taught how to tackle and do the right things,” they said.
Rugby, much like American football, has come under fire for being one of the more dangerous contact sports, thanks to its full-body tackles and high rates of concussion.
Paylor's injury came early in the game while they were playing in the “lock” position. Reserved for the bigger, stronger players on the team, locks play key roles in both scrums and mauls, both of which put players' heads, necks and bodies at risk. Paylor's injury occurred during a maul, according to the Mercury News, which is when a group of players crunches together to create forward momentum on the player with the ball, while their opponents bind similarly and push back. When this maul eventually collapsed on Saturday, however, Paylor, who had been in the middle of the play, appeared to land awkwardly, according to Goff Rugby Report, which said Paylor then remained on their side while play continued.
“Cal actually scored a try as the medical team rushed to (Paylor's) side,” GRR reported.
Coach Jack Clark and Paylor's teammates knew the player's injury was serious, but the extent wasn't made public until Monday when the family released a statement.

“The injury paralyzed their lower body with limited motion in their arms,” the family said, noting this was a “very sad time in our lives.”
“This will be a long and difficult journey for Robert and their outcome is uncertain,” the family continued, adding that Paylor's immediate goal was to stabilize their condition so they could begin the rehabilitation process. The family said Paylor's ultimate goal is to regain their mobility.
To help cover the costs of Paylor's rehab, the family set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $1 million. Created on Monday, by Wednesday morning, nearly 1,300 people had donated to the fund, which had topped $230,000.
Support has come from their teammates and friends as well as the broader rugby community. Among those who have been the most active on social media has been USA Rugby, the sport's governing body in the United States.
Others outside the rugby community also have shown support to Paylor and their family. They will get another chance on Thursday when the school will host a prayer service.
“Everybody, regardless of belief, religion, or practice, is welcome to join us and to pray in whatever way they feel comfortable,” organizer Brian Konzman said on Facebook. “And even if you can't join us, please toss one up there for the big guy.”

(Memphis) "I do look at their picture sometimes and I cry," says Willie Brooks-Howze.
It's been nearly two years since Howze lost their oldest daughter Kimberly, "When I pulled up, they were laying in my sister's yard."
The 24-year-old had been shot, caught in the middle of gunfire meant for someone else.
"It was bullet holes in all the vehicles, the neighbor homes had bullet holes in it."
For someone who struggled with obesity their entire life, the weight of their daughter's death became the tipping point.
"That is what satisfied me, just eating, I would lay in the bed and watch tv and just eat," explains Howze.
It all changed after a visit to their doctor who told Howze, at 319 pounds, they were on the road to becoming a diabetic.
Howze immediately began lipotropic injections, "He saw me back the next week and I had lost eight pounds!"
Over the last six months, Howze dropped 40 lbs.
The lipo shot is one of the latest trends in weight loss medicine.
"Basically, it's a combination of vitamins and amino acids, things that are natural to the body," says Dr. Gregory Laurence of Germantown Aesthetics.
Proponents say combined with diet and exercise, patients can lose up to a pound a week and target specific areas.
"Namely the abdomen, the inner thighs, outer thighs and buttock area," says cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jon Ver Halen of UT Medical Group.
Dr. Ver Halen's office doesn't offer the shots, but he's used them during training for a triathlon, "I don't feel it makes that much of a difference, but my wife loves them."
Physicians say this is typical with treatments like the lipo shots, where there's plenty of anecdotal evidence that it works, but a lack of human trials.
"There's sort of a consumer fairness side of this and that is, it doesn't work for everybody," adds Dr. Laurence. Doctors also say it's not a quick fix. "It's useless without diet control and exercise," Dr. Ver Halen says.
The shots run from $20 to $30 per injection and they aren't covered by insurance.
Since it's composed of vitamins and amino acids, we asked why you can't get the same results from exercising and taking a daily vitamin?
"A lot of these vitamins and a lot of these amino acids will not absorb if you take them orally," explains Dr. Laurence. "The thought is that by injecting these shots, that a patient is able to better metabolize kind of unwanted fat," adds Dr. Ver Halen.
As far as side effects, Dr. Ver Halen says there is some stinging at the injection site, plus in rare cases, patients can be allergic to the anesthetic or components of the shot.
With the lipo shot being offered all across the MidSouth, and in different combinations, how does a patient know what they're getting?
"Due your diligence with your own research," says Dr. Laurence.
For Howze, who is now raising their two grandchildren, the entire process has been life changing, "I don't huff and puff when I walk." Plus, they see it as an investment, in their health and future.
"If you're a coke drinker and a snacker, you've already spent $20. So, I would much rather look at the big picture and spend my $20 where I think I'm gonna get some good results."
Again, physicians say the lipotropic injections are not a substitute for common sense, diet and exercise, but some patients have seen good results.
Of course, you'll want to consult with your doctor before starting any new program.
A white Seattle teacher has been placed on paid leave after wearing a Michael Jordan costume to school–which students called cultural appropriation.
Peter Colino, a math teacher at Ingraham High School, wore a Michael Jordan rubber mask, the NBA star's Chicago Bulls jersey, a sweatband and black gloves to class on Halloween.
A video of Colino in the costume spread throughout the school quickly after it was shared on Snapchat–but it also led to a parent complaining to the principal.
Colino has apologized to their students, but said he's worn the same costume to the school for 18 years and insists their intent was to ‘honor' Jordan, not cause offense.
But one mother said they were ‘floored' when their son, who is black and a former student of Colino's, sent their screenshots of them in the costume.
‘I couldn't even believe the lapse of judgement,' they told The Stranger.
‘He was just disgusted. I was very grateful that he's not in that man's class anymore.'
Colino said they do the stunt every year to connect with their students and get them excited about being in their math class.
They tell them Jordan is coming to visit, and arrives in costume before playing a five-minute highlight reel of the legendary athlete's greatest moments.
‘He is, to me, the greatest, I'm going to say, athlete of all time and my whole deal is to honor Michael Jordan,' Colino told Kiro 7.
{snip}
And after a complaint to the principal, Colino took their mask off and didn't wear it for the rest of the day.
The following day, they apologized to the students in each of their classes and spoke with them about race.
On Thursday, Colino was told they were being put on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.

Donald Trump's vision is of a world where America is just the most powerful
Donald Trump has gambled with US diplomatic credibility by attacking an Iran nuclear deal that their European allies cherish as a benchmark for international cooperation.And in doing so the US president has underlined the risk that their "America First" foreign policy will translate to one of "America Alone" as they confront future crises.Between nationalist speeches, protectionist gestures and high-octane Twitter outbursts, observers have struggled to identify a coherent strategy behind Trump's decisions.But one thread does stand out as they pull out of trade deals, provokes allies and tears up international accords -- they seem determined that no international ties will bind him.The United States emerged as the indispensable superpower in the wake of World War II in part through its leadership in a global rules-based system of treaties and alliances.But, as Trump made clear last month in a speech to the UN General Assembly, their vision is of a world where America is just the most powerful in a network of sovereign nations."Trump foreign policy has found its theme: 'The Withdrawal Doctrine'," quipped Richard Haass, influential president of the Council on Foreign Relations.Trump has not yet withdrawn from the Iran deal, although they made it clear that they are ready to do so if Congress and skeptical US allies do not agree to new sanctions.He did quit the UN cultural organization, this week. They have collapsed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and appears to be poised to destroy the bigger NAFTA treaty.Time and again their bluster has put in question America's commitment to its NATO allies, and time and again they have ordered reviews into the utility of remaining in UN agencies.He has even declared that America will drop out of the biggest -- and arguably most important -- accord in world history, the 196-member Paris climate deal.As might be expected, former members of president Barack Obama's administration are furious and bewildered at what they see as an abdication of US leadership."Once again, Trump is throwing into question the ability of the US to keep its commitment to international agreements," former top aide Ben Rhodes said."Other nations will not want to enter into agreements with the United States," they warned.Former secretary of state John Kerry, a key architect of the Iran deal, called Trump's decision a "reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology."Trump, they said, "weakens our hand, alienates us from our allies, empowers Iranian hardliners, makes it harder to resolve North Korea and risks moving us closer to military conflict."Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the deal on behalf of Tehran, said Trump's move would do lasting damage to US credibility."Nobody else will trust any US administration to engage in any long-term negotiation because the length of any commitment, the duration of any commitment from now on with any US administration would be the remainder of the term of that president," Zarif told CBS News.Washington's traditional allies in Europe were at first cautious in their approach to Trump, hoping they would mellow as they grew into the Oval Office role.But they were outraged by their Iran gambit, and united in their response."It is clearly not in the hands of any president of any country in the world to terminate an agreement of this sort," declared EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini."The president of the United States has many powers (but) not this one."In Washington, having failed to get through to Trump despite the support of some of their top advisers, European diplomats are now lobbying Congress to save the Iran deal.Nevertheless, the Iran decision at least has some strong supporters in the US capital.An outspoken group of foreign policy hawks, backed by influential senator Tom Cotton and Trump's UN ambassador Nikki Haley, had been pushing for "decertification."And they, at least, agree with Trump that their tougher stance could give America more leverage, rather than less, with its foreign partners."If anything, the decision to decertify but keep the US in the deal could serve to bolster US credibility," argues Behnam Ben Taleblu, of the Federation for Defense of Democracies.Trump, they say, is "sending a message that the US will not be a party to agreements where it feels it has a material disadvantage."This theory will be put to the test almost immediately. In the weeks to come Trump and senior US officials will attempt to build a coalition to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
Verizon's publicized Share Everything plans
Cost per GB for iPad data, circa 2010.
Six weeks ago, Verizon launched its new "Share Everything" data plans, declaring that everyone would henceforth use these plans or be banned from upgrading their phones at a discount, and unveiled a suite of options that range from $50 for 1GB to $100 for 10GB (not counting per-device fees). Unlimited talk and text is now baked into the per-device base fee, which means that users with minimal data needs could actually benefit from a swap.Now, the company has admitted that its usage plans stretch higher, though these plans are usually offered on customer support lines or in the event of overages. Verizon will sell you 12GB of data for $110, 14GB for $120, 16GB for $130, 18GB for $140, and 20GB of data per month for $150. If that sounds like a staggering amount of data, keep in mind that the plan is for a shared group of devices -- you can chew up considerably more data if you use devices in parallel or have multiple family members all viewing HD content.Which is, of course, the point. On Verizon's highest baseline plan, they charge $10 per GB and call it a bargain. The 20GB plan cuts this to $7.50. The company still trots out the "most customers don't use more than 2GB" statement," but it really ought to retire that one. On unlimited data plans with "soft" caps or a 2GB limit, it was a way of reassuring people that they wouldn't go over. Now, it highlights the fact that Verizon charges $30-$50 per GB for the 1-2GB plans that apparently address almost everyone's needs.Cellular towers and capacity rollouts are expensive, no one denies that -- but the pricing on these plans has to make Comcast, AT&T's U-Verse division, and Verizon FiOS weep with envy at the per GB profit margin. Ask yourself -- if you can buy a router that throws wireless across your entire home for $60, why is it that connecting to a cellular network should cost you nearly $60, regardless of whether you live in downtown San Francisco or Billings, Montana?The towers?How about one of these instead?That's a femtocell. Verizon calls their version a Wireless Network Extender . It's a miniaturized cell tower that connects to your existing broadband service and uses that connection to backhaul your voice or data traffic to Verizon, AT&T, or whoever your provider is. One of the benefits listed by both Verizon and AT&T is that you don't need an extra data plan for it. The minutes you use will come off your normal plan,Pause and think about that for a minute. You have just paid Verizon $250 for a small cell tower. It connects to the Internet via a router and ADSL/cable modem, both of which you also paid for. It uses your bandwidth -- and if you have service with Comcast, that's a finite good or service. You've paid for every single product that carries the signal from your phone to the point where it vanishes into the wall, but you end up billed double for data.There's nothing inherently wrong with femtocells. They're extremely useful, particularly in areas where cellular coverage is spotty. The problem is with the ridiculous notion that cellular traffic deserves to be priced at a rate 100-1000x higher than what you pay Comcast (with a one-time payment of $60-$100 thrown in for the router). The idea that paying exorbitant rates somehow subsidizes future growth has been proven false. AT&T made a huge point of telling the DOJ how it had no plans to build out 4G past ~80% of the country if it wasn't allowed to buy T-Mobile. Verizon stopped building out FiOS two years ago. Furthermore, none of the data plans being sold today come with promised updates or price freezes when the successor to 4G eventually materializes. $100-$200 a month doesn't even buy you a guarantee of service -- all we get is a "best effort" promise.There's a reason why the prepaid industry shed subscribers for the first time ever last quarter, and a lot of it has to do with ridiculously high data prices that don't actually reflect the real cost of access. Prepaid cell plans are gaining traction in the US, and if you compare US mobile per GB pricing to prices in other nations where prepaid phones are popular, the cost/GB is much lower.Speaking of traveling, look at what world travelers pay per, based on country of origin. This data set is from 2011 and was compiled by OECD, the US is the red line.What do femtocells and Verizon shared data plans have in common? They're all examples of how the cost of data has been distorted and turned into a ridiculous cash pipe. It's not surprising -- witness 10-20 cent charges per text message when texts are carried over an unused part of the phone line and literally cost the carriers nothing -- but it's something customers need to be aware of.Back when cell phone were $30-$50, replacing a land line made sense. With data costs skyrocketing, a landline, good WiFi, and an emergency phone is beginning to look like a much better deal.
OLYMPIA FIELDS, Ill. – This is not supposed to happen. No, first LPGA wins do not come in majors. No, untested players do not make four birdies in a row under back nine pressure. No, the new kid on the block does not birdie the last hole to win the KPMG Women's PGA Championship.
But Danielle Kang is not your run of the mill new kid. She's the two-time U.S. Women's Amateur winner everyone has been waiting to have a day like this. They were simply sensational Sunday at Olympia Fields, closing with a 68 to finish at 13-under-par 271 for a one-stroke victory.
What made it even more impressive is that they held off a hard-charging Brooke Henderson, who won this tournament last year at the tender age of 18 and closed birdie-birdie in this final round to apply the kind of pressure than has crumbled more than one professional. But Kang had no crumble in them
“The three-putt on No. 10 was the turning point for me,” Kang said about a cringe-worthy missed 3 footers. “I said I'm going to learn from that and then I made four birdies in a row.” Just as important was a 21-footer to save par on No. 16. It was a gutsy effort by a 24-year-old who smiled their way around the course, winning hearts along the way.
“Having a major championship in my resume, I don't know what it will do,” Kang said. “But I do know that having the U.S. Amateur as majors, and having a major win, it's amazing.”
Chella Choi, who started the final round tied with Kang at 10 under par, three strokes ahead of Henderson, closed with a 71 to finish third at 274. Amy Yang picked up their 16th top-10 in a major without a win, finishing T-4 at 275 along with Mi Hyang Lee and Sei Young Kim. Inbee Park and Lexi Thompson were T-7 at 277.
As they turned to the back nine, Kang and Choi, who were playing together, and Henderson, in the group in front of them, were all at 10 under par. Kang slipped out of the lead with that ugly bogey then began the four-birdie run that gave them a three-stroke lead after 14 holes.
Kang's guts and good humor were in full display down the stretch. On No. 13, they doubled over in laughter as they fanned their approach shot wide of the target, almost as if they knew what was to come – a made 20-footer for birdie.
On No. 14, they got a break when they clipped a tree and landed in the right rough. They took advantage of their good fortune when they hit a pure semi-punch to 7 feet for yet another birdie.
Meantime, Henderson, who rolled in putts from the adjacent county on Nos. 11 and 17 in the final round at Sahalee last year to win, made their third birdie of the day with a 35-footer on No. 7 but didn't make another until hitting from 20 feet on No. 17.
Henderson played their own version of bomb and gouge golf, blowing driver over the many strategically place fairway bunkers and gouging short irons out of the rough if they missed the fairway, which they did eight times on Sunday. On many occasions, as Henderson muscled the ball out of the rough they ended up in a one-handed follow through.
“To make that putt on 17 was huge,” Henderson said about the birdie that kept their hopes alive. “I hit two great shot on 18, “ they said of their drive and 236 yard 3-wood to the green. “I walked that putt twice to get the pace,” they said about their 30-foot eagle attempt, “but I left it an inch short.”
They made clear, however, the right person won in this day.
“Danielle played great,” Henderson said. “She won this I was just trying to get close and maybe force a playoff.”
Kang, 24, is a sixth-year pro out of Pepperdine with a dazzling amateur career. They qualified for the 2007 U.S. Women's Open as a 14 year old, won the U.S. Women's Amateur in 2010 and 2011 as well as capturing the prestigious North and South Championship in 2011. But they were winless on the LPGA and their best finish in an LPGA major was T-14 in the 2012 U.S. Women's Open. Now, it seems, the door may be open to bigger things.
There were many times they could have packed it in: After that putt on No. 10; when they clipped the tree on No. 14; when they bogeyed No. 17 to fall into a tie with Henderson.
But on this day, they met every challenge. And they way they smiled their way through it, the way they grinded their way through it, certainly left you with the feeling that there is more to come. The door, it seems, is now open and here comes Danielle Kang.

DENVER, Colo. -- When more than 500 sport bike riders blocked Denver streets Sunday during their ‘Kill Da Streetz' ride, they certainly got some attention from other motorists.
The riders at one point stopped traffic on I-25 near University so they could perform tricks in the middle of the interstate.
Denver7 received several calls and emails Monday from people who are upset about the motorcyclists' actions, and curious as to why Denver Police didn't do anything to stop them from driving erratically on the roads.
A spokesperson for Denver Police said they were never able to catch the large group doing anything illegal.
"Obviously stopping traffic and how you do that, someone else can be hurt, they could be injured, you could be injured yourself so that's always a concern of ours," said Sonny Jackson, spokesperson for the Denver Police Department.
According to Jackson, police had no prior knowledge of the event. They said police received several calls, but by the time officers responded the group had cleared.
"This is way to big for them to have missed as far as I'm concerned," said Beverly Swanson, who was stopped on I-25 behind the riders.
On Monday, Denver7 noticed the 'Kill Da Streetz' Facebook page was taken down.
The ride has other motorcyclists across the state upset, saying the riders Sunday are giving all motorcyclists a bad image.
“There's no point in doing that kind of stuff on the road to give everyone a bad name, to make everyone look down on us," said Matt McDermitt, a motorcyclist from Northern Colorado.
Many motorcycle clubs tell us they don't look down on people who ride different types of bikes, instead remain concerned about the lack of safety measures taken Sunday and disregard for planning.
“They don't condone those behaviors, we have road captains and we communicate to the police where our routes are and where we're going to need support," said Robert Balzli, another motorcycle rider from Northern Colorado.
Members from the group Colorado Bikers said they plan a lot of charity rides throughout the year and always alert police as to where they will be so law enforcement can get involved.
They also say motorcyclists involved in their rides stay in a standard staggered formation for safety -- only taking up just one lane on roadways.
“When that intersection is blocked those drivers in those vehicles may be inconvenienced by a few minutes, you know 10 minutes maybe if it's a big ride, but then they go about their day and there was a police officer there directing traffic," said McDermitt.
While the riders don't support how the ride was conducted Sunday, they said they do support the ‘Kill Da Streetz' cause, which is to raise awareness how many riders there are on Colorado roads.
They just say it needs to be better organized so bikers all over the state aren't looked down upon.
“What we're looking at to do here is to get that bad apple, those bad apples separated so that it doesn't spoil the public's view of the rest of us," said Corey Taylor.
‘Kill Da Streetz' is hoping to attract nearly 1000 riders for next year's event.
A US startup has developed a new 3D printing technology that uses light and oxygen to print solid objects at speeds 25 to 100 times faster than current technology.
The 3D printing technology developed by Silicon Valley startup, Carbon3D Inc, enables objects to rise from a liquid media continuously rather than being built layer by layer as they have been for the past 25 years, representing a fundamentally new approach to 3D printing, researchers said.
The technology allows ready-to-use products to be made 25 to 100 times faster than other methods and creates previously unachievable geometries that open opportunities for innovation not only in health care and medicine, but also in other major industries such as automotive and aviation.
The technology, called Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) manipulates light and oxygen to fuse objects in liquid media, creating the first 3D printing process that uses tunable photochemistry instead of the layer-by-layer approach that has defined the technology for decades.
It works by projecting beams of light through an oxygen-permeable window into a liquid resin.
Working in tandem, light and oxygen control the solidification of the resin, creating commercially viable objects that can have feature sizes below 20 microns, or less than one-quarter of the width of a piece of paper.
"By rethinking the whole approach to 3D printing, and the chemistry and physics behind the process, we have developed a new technology that can create parts radically faster than traditional technologies by essentially 'growing' them in a pool of liquid," said Joseph M DeSimone, professor of chemistry at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and CEO of Carbon3D.
Through a research agreement between UNC-Chapel Hill and Carbon 3D, the team is currently pursuing advances to the technology, as well as new materials that are compatible with it.
CLIP enables a very wide range of material to be used to make 3D parts with novel properties, including elastomers, silicones, nylon-like materials, ceramics and biodegradable materials.
"In addition to using new materials, CLIP can allow us to make stronger objects with unique geometries that other techniques cannot achieve, such as cardiac stents personally tailored to meet the needs of a specific patient," said DeSimone.
"Since CLIP facilitates 3D polymeric object fabrication in a matter of minutes instead of hours or days, it would not be impossible within coming years to enable personalised coronary stents, dental implants or prosthetics to be 3D printed on-demand in a medical setting," DeSimone added.
The research appears in the journal Science.
We have three awesome things to give away: Handcrafted Motion Pack, Svengoolie Rig and Outstream video guide.
We don't spam or give away your address to any 3rd party people…. ever! Free After Effects Projects!
Here's a quick preview of the Handcrafted kit:
I had fully planned to do some more scenes and a bit of walkthrough/ tutorial on some of my process, however, some client work popped and left me with little time. Most intermediate AE users should be able to figure this out pretty fast. If you have questions, give me a shout and I'll do my best to answer. Time permitting, I will post up a video walk/thru at some point and update it with some more scenes and 2DFX that weren't quite ready for this pack. Thanks for checking this out and please let me know what you think! About a 300 MB Download.
Here's what the Svengoolie Rig looks like:
A few notes, this was built from scratch more or less. However, I did recycle some arms and legs from a previous rig that I downloaded. Credit goes to Matt Wilson for that. Cheers! If you ever want to learn about DUIK and rigging take a look at their channel on YouTube it's good stuff. Also the dungeon bricks and lamps I recreated from some Google searched images. So technically, not my design.
Svengoolie and their coffin are copyrighted by ME TVand Weigel Corporation. I think. If not, then, I'm sure Rich Koz's owns the copyright by now. Anyways, I have no association w/ that or anything I'm just doing this for fun. Please don't sue.
I used Character Animator for the first time to lip sync the voice over. I turned off the preset rig, used a custom mouth set, scaled it up and just rendered it out as PNG sequence w/ an alpha. The dungeon lamp was done with some shape layers, a couple of Wave Warps, Turblent Displace, and a particular preset in the background. I also posterized time a bit on the precomp as it was too wobbly otherwise.
Our guide to outstream video is ready to drop within the next week or two. I'm still putting together some graphics for that, and making some editorial tweaks to make it a quick, fast and useful read. Chock full of actionable tips if you are already using outstream, and some eye-opening stats if you are brand new to it. So sign up for our mailing list and be the first to get it. You'll also get our Handcrafted Kit & Svengoolie Rig, plus any other freebies we make down the road and a monthly newsletter to make sure you don't miss out on anything awesome.

When news broke Friday morning that Hulk Hogan had been airbrushed out of the history of WWE via a series of deletions on the wrestling company's website, it was clear that some bad news was about to hit the Hulkster. And there were, frankly, a very limited number of things they could've done to elicit such a strong reaction: they either murdered someone in cold blood on camera or they violated a cultural norm so resonant that it necessitated disappearing them altogether.
Well, the murder didn't seem terribly likely, given that we probably would've gotten wind of the story after he'd been arrested. What cultural norm could've been violated? Considering that, over the years, he'd already been caught up in a sex tape scandal and a steroid scandal and a decades-long No One Likes Hulk Hogan In The Locker Room scandal, it had to be something especially bad. And, frankly, the only sort of scandals that call for someone being disavowed entirely are those that involve slurs. So I guessed/joked:
I wonder if Hulk Hogan used a bad word. I'm guessing they used a bad word. Bad words will not be tolerated. — Sonny Bunch (@SonnyBunch) July 24, 2015
Lo and behold, not 20 minutes later, I saw* my guess was right. Weird Twitter was … nonplussed. Now, that is a relatively inaccurate description of events, insofar as my tweet was meant as a prediction, not a reaction. Then again, Gawker appears to have updated their story before the Post did. Since I make a point of not reading Gawker these days in an effort to send as few clicks as possible their way following their gross behavior last week—a stance everyone I follow-on Twitter seems to have adopted, given none of them linked to the story in my feed—I'm probably to blame for the confusion.
The point is, though, that the tweet wasn't wrong. Hulk Hogan did, in fact, get airbrushed out of the (WWE) history books because they said bad words. It may have been incomplete, in that they also had bad thoughts. But that's literally the extent to the wrongs committed by Hogan here: They said a word that we, as a society, have more or less forbidden and professed thoughts that we, as a society, rightly consider to be wrong. They didn't, say, run a black guy over because they thought they were defiling their precious baby. They didn't, say, fire a black guy because they don't like the color of their skin.
Nope. They said bad words. They thought bad thoughts.
Now, the WWE was well within its rights to let Hogan go. Indeed, it probably would have been negligent corporate management not to. The first four hours of the story might have been "Elderly wrestler admits to racist thoughts 12 years ago on a purloined sex tape," but the next 40 would've been "When will major corporation cut ties with elderly racist wrestler who said bad words 12 years ago and quickly apologized for it." Social media, an area the WWE spends a lot of effort cultivating, would've gone bananas. This is the age in which we live.
Still, it rankles a bit to hear those on the left "lolz what's the problem free market bro" even as they would deny that exact freedom in other circumstances. The kerfuffle called to mind a post a couple days back by Scott Alexander over at Slate Star Codex about the current nature of free speech on the Internet. The whole thing is worth reading and a bit hard to summarize briefly, but the gist of it is that the libertarian ideal of a thousand entities competing with each other for business and succeeding or failing on the strength of their policies is a pipedream. Rather, we have a few giant corporations that operate with minimal oversight from anyone other than their internal leaders and can do massive damage to anyone they (or the anger mobs) decide to memory hole. I get the sense that the hypocrisy mentioned above grates on Alexander too:
We don't trust the free market to necessarily preserve racial equality—that's what anti-discrimination laws are for. We don't trust the free market to necessarily preserve worker safety—that's what OSHA and related regulations are for. We don't even trust the free market to necessarily preserve fire safety—that's why federal inspectors have to come in every so often to make sure you're not secretly plotting to let your employees fry. Whenever we think something is important, we regulate the hell out of it, rights-of-private-companies to-set-their-own-policies be damned. But free speech? If you don't trust the free market to sort it out, the only possible explanation is that you just don't understand the literal text of the First Amendment.
The idea of an OSHA-style bureaucracy protecting free speech freedoms presents its own ridiculous problems, not the least of which is the fact that any effort to protect freedom of speech by employees at the workplace would necessarily curtail freedom of speech and association for employers. Still, it's worth highlighting the hypocrisy.
The larger goal, in Alexander's mind, is to brand a broad swathe of society untouchable:
The worst possible end-game for this is the two-tier marketplace of ideas mentioned above, with an unfortunate twist—everyone knows that the second tier is inhabited entirely by witches, and therefore being on the second tier is sufficient to convict you. Unpopular ideas are gradually forced out of the first tier by media smear campaigns, and from then on everyone believes the effort was justified, because it's one of those second-tier ideas that you only find in the same sites as the racists and trolls and child pornographers. You're not a second tier kind of person, are you? No, we didn't think so.
Those who instigate outrage mobs aimed at getting people fired—the sort of people WWE was wisely trying to avoid by taking preemptive action against Hogan—are interested in bringing that two-tier mentality to the real world. Jon Ronson ably highlights the actions of these people in their book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed. We can argue all day over who deserves to be subjected such campaigns; I tend to think Ronson missteps when they lump a quote fabricator and self-plagiarist like Jonah Lehrer in with someone like Justine Sacco. A Gawker writer who outs a guy and aids in their extortion probably has it coming in a way that Tim Hunt clearly doesn't.
At the very least, though, the examples above were all public statements/actions in a way that Hogan's misdeeds clearly were not. Hogan did not hop on Facebook to share their views about their daughter having sex with a black guy. They did not take to a WWE ring and pronounce to the world "I'm racist." They said those bad words and professed those bad thoughts on a private videotape that was provided to a reviled website under questionable circumstances, a website whose very existence is now threatened** for publishing portions of said tape under the guise of "journalism."
Hogan's now a second tier person. And the attacks on them help us understand why some people prefer anonymity these days. It is telling how frustrated would-be rage-mobbers get when they can't consign those they disagree with to that second tier:
This isn't an idle question, naturally; Stern wants to generate a campaign of outrage in order to force the funders of the Federalist to shutter the site. After all, it promulgates bad thoughts. It writes bad words. And bad thoughts and bad words should not be tolerated in our decent society. The Federalist is a second-tier kind of joint. You're not a second tier kind of person, are you?
I sure hope not. You know what we do to second tier types, after all.
(And on that cheery note, allow me to bid you goodbye for a couple of weeks. I'm taking some paternity leave. Behave yourselves while I'm gone and please send complaints about typos and the such to @BiffDiddle.)
*Well, technically, I heard my guess was right, as my wife read the update to me in the car as we were driving back from a doctor's appointment.
**It is awfully convenient that portions of the tape damaging Hogan's popularity were to leak shortly after Gawker's own popularity took a particularly sharp nosedive.
With the price of bitcoin moving toward $12,000, a top economist on Tuesday sent a stark warning to investors: The cryptocurrency is in a "dangerous speculative bubble."
"This is a toxic concept for investors," said Stephen Roach, Yale University senior fellow and the former Asia chairperson and chief economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley.
Roach, described by Yale as one of Wall Street's most influential economists, spent the bulk of their 30-year career at Morgan Stanley heading up a highly regarded team of economists around the world.
They had a critical take on the explosion of buying the world's most popular cryptocurrency.
"This is a dangerous speculative bubble by any shadow or stretch of the imagination," they told CNBC's "The Rundown."
"I've never seen a chart of a security where the price really has a vertical pattern to it. And bitcoin is the most vertical of any pattern I've ever seen in my career," they added.
The newest and most dramatic of the NFL market inefficiencies has come about as a result of the three-year period of labor instability that enveloped the league between 2009 and 2011. As the NFL and its players barked, postured, and eventually negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement, the league's salary cap was stretched and dramatically expanded and even abandoned for a year before receding to its previous levels. Combined with changes to draft pick compensation, the introduction of a salary floor, and other modifications contained within the new CBA, the shifting salary landscape has created a new paradigm in which an incredibly unlikely source of talent is becoming available at below-market rates: veteran free agents.
How did we get here? That all starts with the 2006 season and the agreement between the NFL and NFLPA to extend the then-existing CBA through the end of the 2010 season. The table below details the league's salary cap figures and how they grew from year to year. Take note of what happens in 2006.
Year Salary Cap Year-on-Year Increase 1999 $57,300,000 9.4% 2000 $62,200,000 8.6% 2001 $67,400,000 8.4% 2002 $71,100,000 5.5% 2003 $75,000,000 5.5% 2004 $80,600,000 7.5% 2005 $85,500,000 6.1% 2006 $102,000,000 19.3% 2007 $109,000,000 6.9% 2008 $116,000,000 6.4% 2009 $129,000,000 11.2%
When the league re-upped the CBA for five years with the players in 2006, its methodology for determining the cap changed, raising the cap from $85.5 million to $102 million overnight, a jump of nearly 20 percent. The cap would make another double-digit percentage leap before the 2009 season, when it hit $129 million. When the parties couldn't agree on a new deal in 2009, the 2010 season became uncapped.
When the new CBA was signed during the summer of 2011, the cap receded to its prior levels, and it's barely budged since. After starting at $120.3 million for the 2011 season, the cap rose just $300,000 last year and is listed at $123 million for the 2013 league year, which begins on Tuesday. That's a leap of just 2.2 percent over two years, a minuscule rise compared to the levels mentioned above.
That's all great for the league's 32 owners, but their smaller cap didn't come with any decrease in the existing salaries or contracts for the same players they bulldozed in the new CBA. When the league's salary cap crossed $120 million and eventually hit $129 million before disappearing altogether, owners used that cap space by giving players larger deals. Now, not only are those deals still in play without any reduction in cost, but they're both in the more expensive stages in terms of their cap hit and being used as the basis for new contracts.
As an example, let's take a look at the contract of Terrell Suggs, who signed a six-year, $62.5 million deal during the summer of 2009, when the cap was at its peak. Suggs's deal had $38.1 million guaranteed and a $10.1 million signing bonus, with other bonus structures built into the deal for an additional $27.3 million. For salary cap purposes, the league allows teams to spread the “hit” from bonuses across the length of the contract, which keeps that aspect of the deal consistent from year to year. Suggs's base salary, though, continues to rise after the first year of the deal; their $1 million base from the 2009 season was all the way up to $4.9 million last season, and it will jump by 30 percent to $6.4 million for 2013. A 30 percent jump for one player wasn't a huge problem with the old, steady system of raising the cap ceiling; now, though, player salaries are rising far more quickly than the overall cap space available to pay them.
Even worse for teams, players are using the deals that were negotiated during the free-spending days as the basis for negotiating their new deals. When Julius Peppers hit free agency during the 2010 offseason, the Bears gave them a mammoth six-year, $84 million deal with $42 million guaranteed, representing the peak of the market for a defensive lineman hitting free agency in (or perhaps just after) the prime of their career. That was in an uncapped year that followed a season with a $129 million cap ceiling.
Two years later, when Mario Williams hit the market under similar personal circumstances, they used the raw numbers from the Peppers deal as a touchstone to improve upon, not a figure to try to match. Even though the salary cap was actually nearly 7 percent smaller than the final cap before Peppers's deal, Williams got $96 million over six years and $50 million guaranteed. There was no chance that Williams would have taken (or even been offered) a smaller contract than Peppers; at some point, it becomes a matter of pure pride. Imagine being Ben Dogra, Mario Williams's agent, and telling them that they had to take a 7 percent pay reduction from the two-year-old Peppers deal because the league's financial structure changed. They would have been fired before they could even finish the sentence. That would have been a good thing, too; had Dogra actually convinced Williams to sign a deal with a 7 percent reduction in value, the rest of the league's agents (and the NFLPA) would have burned Dogra at the stake. Instead, Dogra did their job and kept their player happy, and the same owners who fought tooth and nail to reduce cap costs gave bigger and bigger contracts to free agents at the very first opportunities they had.
There is some amount of salary relief built into the new CBA, of course: draft pick compensation. Incoming rookies at the top of the draft no longer receive contracts that immediately make them the highest-paid player in the history of the league at their position, as was the case with Jake Long in 2007. Sam Bradford got $50 million in guaranteed money as the first pick in 2010; a year later, Cam Newton received just $22 million guaranteed for their deal under the new CBA. That drop helps, but it dramatically changes the contract value only for players taken at the top of the draft, and it's been in place only for two drafts. And some of that relief is wiped away by the CBA's introduction of a salary floor (mandating teams to spend a given amount of money over the next four years) and an increase in the minimum salaries for veterans. The point is simple: Player salaries, especially for those players on pre-2011 contracts, are escalating way too quickly relative to a mostly stagnant cap. And since teams aren't about to cut their stars and destroy their cap with accelerated bonuses (or suck), something's gotta give.
What's giving is a large middle class of useful-but-inessential veterans, a group that's flooding the free-agent market and will continue to do so for at least a couple more seasons. They fit into three categories: (1) players coming off rookie deals who likely have unrealistic expectations about their second contracts (like Cary Williams, Michael Bennett, and Dustin Keller); (2) players who are being released halfway through now-untenable second contracts (like Ahmad Bradshaw and seemingly Anquan Boldin); (3) and players who have completed their second (or third) contracts who are hitting the market for one more payday (like Steven Jackson, Wes Welker, and Ed Reed). The market is simply flooded with these sorts of players to an extent that it wasn't five years ago, and while a few might get the deals they're expecting, many will have to settle for far less than they might be hoping for as the market opens up tomorrow afternoon.
Take this year's crop of free-agent running backs, which has seven guys who were their teams' starters when healthy a year ago: Cedric Benson, Bradshaw, Reggie Bush, Shonn Greene, Jackson, Rashard Mendenhall, and Michael Turner. Now, your organization might favor one back depending on its specific needs or what its scouts say about a particular guy, but is there really an enormous difference between most of these backs? Would you give Jackson $20 million in guaranteed money — knowing the cap is stagnant and your veterans are a rising tide of salary — if you could get Bradshaw for $6 million guaranteed? Or Turner for $1 million? Should you?
Some teams will look at that argument and insist on getting the guy they want on the opening day of free agency, something that will never change. I wrote last year about how the Jaguars entered a three-person market for middle linebackers by giving Paul Posluszny a huge long-term deal at the beginning of free agency, only for the other two prominent middle linebackers on the market to take small, one-year deals weeks later. Insisting on having that one particular guy and paying a premium to get them is a mistake that bad, desperate organizations often make; it's the same logic that leads teams to trade future first-round picks to acquire second-rounders and ends up with lopsided scenarios like Alphonso Smith–for–Earl Thomas and Everette Brown–for–Mike Iupati.
Almost nobody scouts well enough to overcome huge value gaps like that, which is why the league's smarter teams go out of their way to acquire additional picks and are happy to take 90 percent of the player for 50 percent of the price in free agency. What those smart teams will do in this new economy is — very simply — be patient. The true stars will disappear off the market early, and the dumber teams will pay a premium for talent to lock them up in the first 24 to 48 hours, but the smart teams will wait. Even if it's just a week, antsy players will see the open slots beginning to fill up around them and settle for far less than they would have at the opening of free agency.
There's already one smart team that has used patience to its advantage with this new CBA: the San Francisco 49ers. During the abbreviated free-agent period after the 2011 lockout, the 49ers appeared to have a major weakness at both safety spots after letting Dashon Goldson hit the market, but they bided their time and waited for the market to come to them. After the first week of free agency passed, they made their move, signing Donte Whitner to a deal that guaranteed them only $4 million over three years, then followed that with a one-year deal for Goldson, who had been seeking a long-term contract. The 49ers ended up with one of the best safety tandems in football for a fraction of what they would have each asked for on the opening day of free agency. Compare that to the Jaguars, who gave safety Dawan Landry a five-year, $27.5 million deal with more than $10.5 million guaranteed at the beginning of that same free-agent period. Whitner and Landry each will cost $3.9 million of their respective teams' cap space this upcoming season, but there's one appreciable difference: Whitner will actually be playing for their team. Landry was released by the Jaguars this past week, so their $3.9 million will be dead money on their cap.
Identifying a market inefficiency is one thing. Acting on it, though, is another. It's easy for me to sit here and look at the market and say that it's going to be smarter than ever for teams to be patient and sit out free agency for a week, and that's because I don't need to make the playoffs next year to keep my job. Although some teams just make pitiful decisions time after time, there are a fair amount of smart teams out there who will do dumb things tomorrow afternoon solely out of desperation, not stupidity. For your favorite team to take advantage of the league's best new value opportunity, it will have to both know that it's coming and be bold enough to, for a time, do nothing at all.
Master P set all sorts of trends during their reign at the top of the rap game some 17 years ago, but that doesn't mean he's above following a few trendy workouts.
In a series of recently uploaded Instagram videos, the Ice Cream Man gave a short PSA encouraging viewers to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, before proclaiming that they were starting the 90 Day Challenge. Then they hit the gym to showcase some of their boxing moves.
In the second clip, Master P can be seen bumping Denzel Curry's "Chill Bill" as he's getting their fists taped up so they can go into the boxing ring. In the third, the No Limit boss is throwing some vicious punches while they bump the Rick Ross classic, "Stay Scheming." You can check out the clips for yourself below. You might even walk away a little inspired.
It's natural to wonder what inspired this rap game legend to hit the gym so hard. Maybe he's decided to go hard in the boxing ring because they want to be in the best shape they can be in as they promote their new mixtape, NO LIMIT TAKEOVER . Maybe he's just trying to impress their girlfriend, who recently copped them a 2016 Rolls-Royce Ghost for $270,000.
According to TMZ, Master P's lover is Simin Hashemizadeh, who is the CEO at South Pacific Surgery Center in Beverly Hills, Calif., We don't know too much about their relationship, but when you've got someone willing to buy you whips like that one, you'd definitely be motivated to stay in shape.
Google(s goog) has won a resounding victory in its eight-year copyright battle with the Authors Guild over the search giant's controversial decision to scan more than 20 million books from libraries and make them available on the internet.
In a ruling (embedded below) issued Thursday morning in New York, US Circuit Judge Denny Chin said the book scanning amounted to fair use because it was “highly transformative” and because it didn't harm the market for the original work.

“Google Books provides significant public benefits,” Chin wrote, describing it as “an essential research tool” and noting that the scanning service has expanded literary access for the blind and helped preserve the text of old books from physical decay.
Chin also rejected the theory that Google was depriving authors of income, noting that the company does not sell the scans or make whole copies of books available. They concluded, instead, that Google Books served to help readers discover new books and amounted to “new income from authors.”
The ruling is being hailed on Twitter by librarians and scholars, who intervened in the case to urge the court to declare that Google Books was fair use — a four-part test that seeks to balance the rights of authors against broader interests of society.
“This has been a long road and we are absolutely delighted with today's judgement. As we have long said Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age – giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow,” Google said in an emailed statement.
Author's Guild Executive Director Paul Aiken said by email that the group would appeal the decision. They added:
“We disagree with and are disappointed by the court's decision today. This case presents a fundamental challenge to copyright that merits review by a higher court. Google made unauthorized digital editions of nearly all of the world's valuable copyright-protected literature and profits from displaying those works. In our view, such mass digitization and exploitation far exceeds the bounds of the fair use defense.”
The decision itself comes as a volte-face for Judge Chin, who expressed major skepticism about the project in a highly-publicized 2010 ruling that blew up a three-part deal between Google, publishers and the Authors Guild that would have created a market for the scanned books. Chin also agreed last year to allow the cases to proceed as a class action — but the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and ordered Chin to instead rule on the fair use question. Thursday's ruling is effectively an acknowledgment by Chin that the higher court (on which they now sit) wanted them to find fair use.
The ruling is unlikely to sit well with some authors, including Scott Turow, who have decried Google's scanning as an indignity and a money grab.
The latter idea — that Google is profiting off the books at the expense of authors — has been a rallying cry for opponents of the book scanning. Chin's ruling, however, takes care to reject the notion in detail, and states that Google “does not engage in the direct commercialization of copyrighted works.”
There is also the question of who will pick up the legal tab for eight years of high-priced litigation:
Institutionally, this is not good for the AG. 8 years and how many $ for this? — James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) November 14, 2013
As @grimmelm has pointed out, this is a major blow to @AuthorsGuild. $Millions and years wasted. If I paid dues, Turow would get an earful. — ARL Public Policy (@ARLpolicy) November 14, 2013
Chin's ruling is also likely to be decisive in a companion case between the Authors Guild and the HathiTrust, a group of university libraries that have created a shared corpus of digital books for scholars and students. The HathiTrust case is on appeal, but the group's victory at the lower court stage may have paved the way for today's decision:

The ruling is below with key portions underlined. For more perspective, see Mathew Ingram's “Whatever you think of Google, the book-scanning decision is the right one.” (For more background, see my ebook The Battle for the Books: Inside Google's Gambit to Create the World's Biggest Library.)

KDE In Brazil 2010 – An Retrospective November 15, 2010
Posted by tumaix in planetkde-tomazcanabrava
2010 was an amazing year for KDE in Brazil, it was the effort started by Helio Castro and Mauricio Piacentini back in end 2008 when they looked for fresh meat for the LatinoWare convention, and that's how me and Sandro Andrade got involved.
Summarizing:
The year for KDE started with the 1st 16 – hour Qt course in USP ( Universidade São Paulo ), wich had a nice participation ( the list of studants got full in the first day of inscriptions and I had to extend the number of Participants )
after that we did the Akademy – Brazil with almost all KDE contribuitors in here in this southern country, a few like Boiko didn't appear, come on man, let's go to the next 😉 – The event was an effort to strength our laces in the community, Brazil is a *huge* country, and meeting a fellow developer from more than a thousand kilometers away is important.
Akademy – br was a success and made one thing real, we could focus on developer training, more groups were formed:
KDE com Chimarrão, in Rio Grande do Sul ( With Wagner Reck, my partner in Rocs )
KDE Piaui, in Piaui (With Aracele Torres, our history-bachelor, soon to be master )
KDE Sanca ( with Vitor Boschi from the embedded HTTP server for KDE )
This year the KDE participation in events and forums was *huge*, we attended in more than 10 congresses on OpenSouce, big events like FISL and LatinoWare, small events like FliSol, SoliSC and emerging events like FSL-BH ( Free Software Belo Horizonte ) and ENSL ( Encontro Nordestinno de Software Livre )
Sandro Andrade and me gave more than 8 courses on Qt / KDE Technologies for free in different states / universities, and the reception was awesome, in the ENSL it was so crowded that the event was not allowing more people in the room.
on LatinoWare we closed the event participation in 2010, for this is the last one of the year. and a similar success, the first talk, at 10a.m. got more than 250 persons, in a 200-person room, same thing happened and the event was not allowing more people in the room for the talk “Efficient Programming, 2 games in 40 minutes” that I ministred with Qt / KDE.
The Good:
Event Participation was nearly 90% of all opensource events, thanks to Amanda, Sandro, Wagner, Camila, Tomaz ( Me 😀 ), Aracele and all others that always were happy to go.
Communities were build and are stronger and anger to do continue growing.
the KDE Hackers that in a past were Helio, Piacentini and Boiko are now more than 10 individuals
The booth was crowded even without things to give or sell, for we had 5 developers there talking passionately about K.
The Bad:
Our artistic team led us down, we don't have an artistic team pratically. if you are an artist and lives in Brazil, hello hello.
The ‘Internship Tryout' was a not even close to success, I'm gonna try next year with a different student.
the Promo couldn't manage to go to every congress, so in the 2 bigger ones, we just had a ‘join the game' folder and 4 – 5 developers talking in the booth.
All in all, KDE has much more strength than it had a few years ago, and it's continuing to grow.

It feels really weird writing an article that speaks even remotely positively of Laci Green, God knows I have no love for the woman. In fact, last year, I named them the second most annoying Social Justice Warrior on the Internet – just one position below Anita Sarkeesian. For anyone who isn't aware who they are, Laci is an ex-Mormon with daddy issues who vlogs on YouTube about “sex positivity”, Feminism, social Justice and the Patriarchy.
Like all Social Justice Warriors, they aren't very fond of Free speech, tolerance for others with different views or common sense. They don't debate or accept criticism, she'd much rather just block their opponents instead. A few years back, they got into an online brawl with another YouTuber, “The Amazing Atheist” (Also known as ‘banana in anus man') after which banana in anus man apologized and asked for bygones to be bygones. They told them to go fuck himself. That's the type of person they are, someone who has no room for opposing views or disagreement.
So imagine my surprise when I went on Twitter a few weeks ago and saw this very peculiar tweet. It was a tweet from Laci green, saying they have been watching Blaire White (A conservative/libertarian YouTuber)'s videos, and that they appreciate's Blaire's perspective, even though they don't always agree with them The two even got together to debate in a YouTube video. Is this real life?
This isn't the last time Laci green would be seen with an openly anti-feminist Internet celeb, just this week, they appeared in a picture with another well known anti-sjw YouTuber, Chris Ray Gun:
Radical Feminists rejecting their dogma and becoming normal people isn't something that hasn't happened before, Heat Street's Ian Miles Cheong comes to mind. Ian was a rabid feminist who hung out with Anita sarkeesian, Zoe Quinn and the rest of the Social Justice ilk until they had an epiphany of sorts and decided that they had had enough. They left the cult, parted ways with their SJW friends, and even helped expose some of them who had been involved in doxing and other forms of online harassment. They now write for a prominent anti-feminist website.
Now, I'm not saying the same thing is going to happen to Laci green, its entirely possible that she's just doing this for attention and views (Showing zoomed in pictures of your cleavage while talking about “sexual objectification” can only get you so many views). There's also the possibility that they are now abandoning their deeply held believes not because they now disagree with them, but because they can feel a shift in the socio-political pendulum coming, and they want to position themselves to change sides or start claiming some form of neutrality when shit starts to hit the fan. And then there's the slight possibility that they are slowly returning reality. Only time will tell.
Take the Poll:
I've been sitting at this dark window for hours, staring out into the black voids of the universe; I've been watching the stars twinkle from beyond our reach. It's not that I find them particularly interesting, they aren't, at least not from this distance; It's that I dread the idea of going to my room in the upper deck of this solitary spaceship.
I'm alone. I know I have to keep watch, I know it's my job; But after a thousand days suspended in the dark things begin to seem different. The lights speak to me in morse code. The symbols on the doors change and morph into messages from another place and the walls whisper at me when I'm not looking.
“How much longer are you gonna be here?” they ask.
“Why don't you open the airlock and die?”
Laughter echoes through the hallways during the nights, or it could be the dripping of the coffee I set up. I'm not sure anymore, but the idea of me being alone seems less likely every day I spend in this silent outpost. This is why I spend my time staring at the stars outside, I don't want to look behind me; I don't want to find the monster that lurks around the corner, just out of sight.
I can sense it when I eat my lunch, crawling underneath my table. I can hear its footsteps outside my room when I'm taking a shower, and I know that one day it's going to stab me in the back as I climb the stairwell towards my bed. One of these days it's going to lose its coyness and it's going to leap out from my shadow and end me… and I don't want to end. I want to live, I want to go back home and see my wife, my children.
I'm not sure I can evade it. Last night I saw its face… it was me.

Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine General James Mattis to be defense secretary. Trump made the announcement during a victory rally in Cincinnati Thursday night. Donald Trump referred to retired General Mattis by their nickname “Mad Dog,” which they reportedly received after leading U.S. troops during the 2004 battle of Fallujah in Iraq. Mattis enlisted in the Marines at 19. They fought in the Persian Gulf War, in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, where they served as a major general. In May 2004, Mattis ordered an attack on a small Iraqi village that ended up killing about 42 people attending a wedding ceremony. Mattis went on to lead United States Central Command from 2010 to 2013, but the Obama administration cut short their tour over concerns Mattis was too hawkish on Iran, reportedly calling for a series of covert actions there. Mattis has drawn criticism over their apparent celebration of killing, including saying in 2005 about the Taliban, “It's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.” Mattis only retired from the military in 2013, meaning they will need Congress to waive rules requiring defense secretaries to be civilians for seven or more years after leaving the military. The rules are in place to ensure civilian control over the U.S. armed forces. Already, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has said she'll vote against the waiver for General Mattis, saying, “Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.”

TEA Party Final Solution: Before I begin, let me ask you this: Have you ever noticed that we TEA Partiers dont use an apostrophe in Dont, as in “Dont tread on me”? It is not because we dont know grammar. It is because apostrophes indicate contraction. And contractions only occur in socialist economies.
Now, to the main business at hand: Clay Yarborough (Jacksonville City Councilman) and I think alike. They do not believe that anyone should have to pay for other people's children. They expressed this sentiment to me in an email about a year ago concerning a pending city council vote. I had emailed them about this vote to reduce the funding of the city's Children's Commission. One of the programs the Commission distributes financial resources to is the DLC Nurse & Learn, which operates two sites west of the river serving children with profound, severe, and multiple impairments. If its funding were cut, the DLC was going to have to shut one of the sites, probably its Murray Hill center.
In response Yarborough wrote back to me that they did not believe the Children's Commission should receive any city funding whatsoever. They said they did not support the idea of anyone having to pay for organizations that help other people's children, whether it be the DLC or any other worthy group.
I was SOOO relieved. I thought they might cave in and vote for the funds. Yarborough made clear that disabled children are not their problem. Nor are they mine. I do not believe in paying for other people's children either, be they healthy or disabled. I do not believe in paying for any children. At all! I do not even believe in paying for my own. That is why I do not have any . . . that I know of.
Being a TEA Partier is a matter of being willing to make the hard choices. That is what we TEA Partiers are about, making the hard choices. AND BOY, ARE WE WILLING TO MAKE THEM! In fact, we are more than willing to make them . . . we are eager! WE CANNOT WAIT! WE LOVE MAKING THEM. MAKING THEM MAKES OUR DAY! Making them shows we are willing to ‘man up.' And making them gives us a little thrill. Oh, okay, I will admit it: making them gives us a BIG thrill.
Clay and I have both read The Sociopath's Manifesto. We are both “Dont tread on me” types. Great minds think alike.
Who is treading on me, you ask? The pillow angels—other people's sick and disabled kids. Children with serious birth defects. They are trampling all over my rights. It is time people ‘manned up' and did something about all of these so-called ‘pillow angels.' Time someone made the hard choices. People like Clay and I. So, I have a proposal. Like all of mine, it is modest.
The problem: There are these children some people call ‘pillow angels.' They are so impaired they can barely move. Parental nurturing of them becomes morbid. What could be more pointless. How do you “raise” a child who is never going to amount to anything more than a vegetable. These children are wretched; they might as well just get it over with and die. What's worse, their fathers refuse to ‘man up' and make the hard choices. These fathers will not do what any liberty-loving man would do. As a consequence, our taxes go up.
Three examples of the 47%
Looks are deceiving.
.
Dont be fooled!
.
Born to mooch: three examples of the 47%..
People become mawkish when they see these children. They cannot face the facts. The facts? There are about half a million pillow children in the U.S., and they account for a part of the 47%. Their parents feel entitled to government services. They cannot help it. It is just the way they are. They become perversely solicitous on behalf of their sorry, pathetic offspring. They claim they will become destitute trying to take care of them on their own. But, you see—THAT is the problem! They continue to take care of them.
I think you begin to see where I am going with this. The TEA Party principle is to defend freedom—the freedom, that is, of not being trod upon by anyone. Even by those who cannot walk.
By the way, if you have ever wondered how to ‘man up' to an ailing or disabled person, here are two TEA Partiers demonstrating just what to do:
Go to minute .52
One man in a black vest and black cap and another wearing a tie & white shirt demonstrate how we TEA Partiers behave toward moochers with Parkinson's disease.
.
The Final Solution:
.
The rattlesnake is the symbol of American independence. What better way to solve this pillow-angel problem than to make direct use of it. To keep ourselves a free people, I recommend we place a rattlesnake in the bedroom or hospital room of each and every pillow angel. With about half a million or so pillow angels in the United States, it will take a while to round up enough rattlesnakes, but we can do it. Fortunately, right now there is a rattlesnake population boom in west Texas.
The rattlesnake will be placed directly onto the body of the pillow angel. The only hitch is, rattlesnakes dont attack unless provoked. Therefore, the caregiver will have to pick up the child's floppy arms and wave them frantically until the coiled rattlesnake strikes. At the child, hopefully, not the caregiver. It may take up to a minute.
One way or another, the fangs will sink into and rip the child's flesh, and the venom quickly will stream to the heart. With enough of these snake attacks, it will be only a matter of time before we start seeing a reduction in that 47% figure. And, as the percentage dwindles, our national budget will come back into balance, and higher taxes will be avoided.
That is the TEA Party Final Solution: snakebite the angels. It is a matter of making the hard choices.
In case the rattlesnake thing does not work, we can use pillows. Back in the day—when the Constitution was being written—the father of the household was expected to not look to government for help. There was just them and their family on a farm and a few neighbors.
They could not leave the problem of a defective baby to their wife to take care of. Assuming they survived the childbirth, they were probably too overwhelmed with grief and hindered by maternal concern to take control of the situation herself.
So, soon after the birth, the father would have to do what any liberty-loving man must do. They would have to make the hard choices. They would have to take matters into their own hands.
If they did not, the whole family might starve. Especially on a farm, the time and resources required to care for a defective child would make the family destitute. So, without telling their wife what they were going to do, they would distract them with some task and go to the crib and take a pillow and place it over the infant's face and hold it there until the job was done. That is what a liberty-loving man ought to do. Later, when the mother finds the baby dead, they would assume it must have died of natural causes. And, voilà! the problem of birth defects is solved. So, you see, it is a matter of making the hard choices. It is SO simple!
It is called ‘taking personal responsibility.' It is like with the runt of any litter. You must kill the weak ones so there is more food left for the healthier ones. It is survival of the fittest. It was expected back then, in the days of the founding fathers and when most everyone lived on a farm, to kill the runt, . . . I mean, the pillow angel, the disabled child, the child with special needs, monstrous birth, the changeling, whatever term you want to use . . . and we should expect nothing less today.
If we cut the government services, one of the two parents—most likely the father, because fathers usually are more up to making the hard choices than mothers—is going to face the facts and do what needs to be done, to keep the family from becoming destitute. But today the father often is not in the picture, so there is no one around to make the hard choices, and that is why we have so many disabled children soaking up welfare dollars.
Keeping pillow angels alive at public expense is ridiculously wasteful and morbid and should be stopped. If a family wants to keep one of its members alive using its own funds, that is fine. But why should I pay for other people's children!
The same goes for the millions surviving today on account of ‘medical miracles' but who wind up being significantly physically damaged for the rest of their lives. People like quadriplegics. They were saved by medical heroics, but now they are seriously impaired and cannot work, so they are on the public dole. And then there are the chronically sicks and the frail. What ever happened to the survival of the fittest? Hitler called such types “useless eaters.”
Back in the day, when the Constitution was being written, as I have already mentioned, someone who became paralyzed quickly died of a urinary tract infection. Or, if someone became severely crippled, a family member took them out of their misery by smothering them in their sleep. Mercy killing. Pillows contained real feathers back then. And if there was not anyone around to help them die, they just starved to death. As the good Lord intended. But today, my tax dollars are used to keep such people alive. This is redistribution of wealth! This is socialism!
Clay Yarborough appears to agree. They and I think alike. Great minds, you know.  They are ready to ‘man up,' to make the hard choices, especially when they affect other people's children. However, they and I and TEA Partiers like us will not need rattlesnakes or pillows, just budget cuts. But the outcome will be the same. Dead pillow angels! And dead quadriplegics, and all the rest of the sick, frail, and disabled moochers, all the useless eaters, DEAD! We will be knee deep in bodies! But at last we will be free. That is, free—free—free at last, because we dared to make the hard choices.
Before I go, did you notice that in this letter I have not used a single apostrophe indicating contraction? I especially made a point of not using one in “dont.” One of these donts was in the ninth paragraph. Can you find the other?

Based on factors such as coaching, roster talent and draft capital, one could reasonably argue that no team in the NFL is better suited for present and future success quite like the San Francisco 49ers.
Head coach Jim Harbaugh is a ridiculous 24-7-1 over their first 32 NFL regular-season games, which is good for a winning percentage of almost 77 percent. Of course, that record is even more impressive when you consider Harbaugh has made trips to two NFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl in their first two seasons.
The 49ers roster is an almost perfect blend of young and veteran talent.
On defense, veterans such as All-Pro Justin Smith (32 years old) and Carlos Rogers (31) complement young, established stars such as Patrick Willis (28), NaVorro Bowman (24), Aldon Smith (23) and Donte Whitner (27).
The offense also blends the two important variables, with Colin Kaepernick (25), LaMichael James (23) and Michael Crabtree (25) mixing with Frank Gore (29) and Vernon Davis (29) at the skill positions. The 49ers offensive line, anchored by Joe Staley (28), Mike Iupati (25) and Anthony Davis (23), is certainly in the argument to be the NFL's best.
They say the rich get richer, and that's exactly how the 2013 NFL draft is shaping up for the 49ers.
By trading away backup quarterback Alex Smith to the Kansas City Chiefs—a deal first reported by Jay Glazer of Fox Sports—the 49ers not only cleared up $8 million in cap space, but also received the No. 34 overall pick in the 2013 NFL draft.
San Francisco now has five picks in the top 93 selections this April and is projected to have a staggering 15 picks overall. This kind of draft capital gives the 49ers limitless flexibility, either to move around the draft board or acquire a player such as New York Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis or Minnesota Vikings receiver Percy Harvin.
Such a ridiculous amount of goodwill going for the 49ers begs the question: How did this franchise go from middling underachiever to NFL powerhouse?
Here's how:
Solid Drafting, Starting in 2005
Say what you want about taking Alex Smith over Aaron Rodgers No. 1 overall in 2005, but the 49ers have been one of the NFL's best drafting teams since, and it's the foundational reason why the team is where it is today.
Let's run down those drafts, one by one:
2005: Smith, center Davis Baas, running back Gore, guard/tackle Adam Snyder. Smith revived their career late, and led the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game in 2012. Baas and Snyder have been starters in the NFL, even if both have moved on to other teams. Gore remains the backbone of the 49ers' running game. 2006: Tight end Vernon Davis, linebacker Manny Lawson, fullback Michael Robinson and tight end Delanie Walker. Davis is a top-5 NFL tight end, and Walker is the perfect secondary complement at the position. Lawson was a disappointment in San Francisco but has continued on a successful NFL career elsewhere. Robinson starts for the Seattle Seahawks. 2007: Linebacker Patrick Willis, tackle Joe Staley, defensive end Ray McDonald, safety Dashon Goldson , cornerback Tarell Brown. Jackpot. Willis, Staley and Goldson are All-Pros, McDonald is one of the more underrated 3-4 defensive ends, and Brown started in the Super Bowl. Can't ask for much more out of a draft class. 2008: The one letdown year. Kentwan Balmer was a bust, and Chilo Rachal moved on after a brief stint starting at right guard. 2009: Michael Crabtree . Mostly a one-man class, but Crabtree 's emergence as a No. 1 receiver sparked the 49ers' late surge in 2012. Their stock is trending up. 2010: Offensive tackle Anthony Davis, guard Mike Iupati , safety Taylor Mays and linebacker NaVorro Bowman. Believe it or not, all eight players in this class ended 2012 on an active NFL roster. Davis, Iupati and Bowman are all elite players at their position. Another really, really good class. 2011: Linebacker Aldon Smith, quarterback Colin Kaepernick , cornerback Chris Culliver , running back Kendall Hunter and fullback Bruce Miller. Drafting an elite pass-rusher and the one of the game's up-and-coming quarterbacks back to back is as good as it gets. Culliver , Hunter and Miller are each important role players. 2012: Running back LaMichael James. First-round receiver A.J. Jenkins needed a year to marinate, so there's no need to provide comment there. James is the gem, and their speed and agility brought another element to the 49ers' read-option offense.
Most NFL teams can only dream about bringing in the amount of talent San Francisco did from 2005 to 2012. The best franchises are still the ones who draft the best, and the 49ers' eight-year stretch can go toe-to-toe with any in the league.
Smart in Free Agency and Trades
While the draft is still the best avenue for roster building, free agency and trading serves a purpose. Where drafts fail, free agency can help fill in the missing pieces.
The 49ers have approached this period better than most NFL teams.
Again, let's run down some of the players the 49ers have plucked from free agency or traded for over the last handful of seasons:
Defensive end Justin Smith: After seven seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, Smith was lured to the West Coast, where they developed into the game's best 3-4 defensive end and an intricate part of the NFC's top defense.

Linebacker Ahmad Brooks: After two disappointing seasons with the Bengals, Brooks landed with the 49ers. Slowly, they have become a vital instrument for San Francisco's pass rush. Brooks has 24.5 sacks over four years with the 49ers.

They immediately became a Pro Bowl corner.

Center Jonathan Goodwin: A nine-year veteran before landing in San Francisco, Goodwin helped solidify the interior of the 49ers' offensive line. They may not be around for long, but they have been worth the investment.

Receiver Randy Moss: So maybe they aren't the same Randy of old. But Moss was still a downfield threat in 2012, hauling in three scores and averaging almost 16 yards a catch.

When you combine consistently good drafts with smart, cap-efficient additions via free agency and trades, a very good roster can become the powerhouse that San Francisco's currently is.
Credit general manager Trent Baalke and the rest of the current and past 49ers' front offices for so many hits and so few catastrophic misses.
Coaching Success Stories
The transition from Mike Nolan to Mike Singletary to Jim Harbaugh was a long and bumpy one, but contributions from both Nolan and Singletary helped pave the road for Harbaugh's future success.
Hard-nosed and defensive-minded, Nolan and Singletary established a culture of toughness and defense in San Francisco that translated well once Harbaugh was brought on board. A number of players brought into the organization were tied to both coaches, too.
Behind the scenes, Harbaugh now has top assistant coaches in offensive coordinator Greg Roman and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Secondary coach Ed Donatell and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula are both widely respected around the league.
But above it all, the hiring of Harbaugh continues to represent a franchise-changing moment.
Just two years into their tenure, Harbaugh is universally considered one of the game's finest coaches. Their smash-mouth offense at Stanford has worked wonders at the next level, and few will argue against their work with both Smith and Kaepernick at quarterback.
Once a draft bust, Smith developed into a legitimate starting quarterback—one that led the 49ers to the doorstep of the Super Bowl and that another NFL team felt comfortable trading a high pick for.
Kaepernick's development from an athletic but raw gadget quarterback to the next big thing happened in a blink of an eye and right under the nose of most.
Faced with a difficult choice between the two quarterbacks last season, Harbaugh rolled the dice with the young, inexperienced Kaepernick. The decision was the right one, as the 49ers ended up a few plays short of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy.
Players still win games in the NFL, but Harbaugh's presence in San Francisco has been the invaluable linchpin. The 49ers aren't where they are today without Harbaugh at the front of the organization.
The 49ers have come up just short in back-to-back seasons, but this is an organization built for the long-haul. All the ingredients are in place:
A head coach in Jim Harbaugh who demands respect, plus an equally impressive supporting staff around him.
A front office—led by Trent Baalke—that has been among the NFL's best in identifying talent in both the draft and free agency.
A resulting roster that is stacked with talent at every important position. It is also one mixed with just the right amount of young, emerging stars and established veterans.
And to top it all off, an arsenal of draft picks available for the 2013 NFL draft, which allows Baalke and Harbaugh the flexibility to go a number of different ways to improve an already elite roster.
As it stands currently, no NFL team outside San Francisco can check off each of the above factors. Expect these 49ers to have some staying power among the NFL elite.
Microsoft's big annual developer conference is happening next week in Seattle. At Build 2017, the software giant is expected to introduce a lot of new things — ranging from Azure to Windows 10. Microsoft will also have announcements for Office 365, and that includes the recently introduced Microsoft Teams service. Yesterday, Microsoft released the details about all the different sessions that will be happening throughout Build 2017 — while most of the sessions weren't very interesting, one of them caught our attention, titled “Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud in Microsoft Teams.”
According to the details for that session, Adobe is going to integrate its Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud services into Microsoft Teams. The new integration will likely get revealed on the day 1 keynote at Build 2017. Interestingly, Microsoft has pulled all the Build 2017 session details — including the one that talks about Adobe Creative Cloud integration. Thankfully, we had already screenshotted the page and here are the key details from the session details:
Join speakers from Adobe as they delve into how seamlessly and quickly they integrated Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud with Microsoft Teams. A live demo using tab and input extensions that enables teams to access, share, and colaborate on assets from Adobe Creative Cloud, send and track Adobe Sign agreements using bot and tab, and get notified within the channel when there are any updates. Speakers div into development details that includes how they leveraged Microsoft Teams extensibility framework, Adobe Creative Cloud API and Adobe Document Cloud API to build this integration.
The Adobe Creative Cloud and Document Card integration on Microsoft Teams sounds like quite a deep integration. As Microsoft stated, users using Adobe Creative Cloud will be able to share and collaborate on files. The integration will also include some bots and tabs that will let users keep track of updates to files, and also send/track Adobe Sign agreements.
We will have more details on the Adobe Creative Cloud integration for Microsoft Teams from Build 2017, as we will be covering it live from Seattle — stay tuned to MSPU for more, next week.
There are just six weeks to go — and two before voting begins — in the Conservative leadership race. Candidates are jostling for position and pushing for the smallest edge.
There is little indication that anyone is breaking out of the pack.
But this race will be won at the most granular of levels, with individual voters holding potentially outsized sway in deciding who will be the next leader of the party. Candidates would be wise to spend the little time that remains making their pitch in ridings where individual members will carry the most weight.
There has been little movement in the Conservative Leadership Index, a composite of four leadership metrics including fundraising, polls and endorsements, since the last update of March 23.
Maxime Bernier remains at the top of the pack with a score of 19.9, suggesting they would take about 19.9 per cent support on the first ballot if the vote were held today.  They are followed closely by Kevin O'Leary at 17.8 points.
Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole are also rated in double-digits, at 13.4 and 11.2 points, respectively.
O'Toole has made the largest gain since last month, up 1.3 points in the index.  They are up three points in the monthly average of polls conducted by Mainstreet Research for iPolitics, increasing their support to 10 per cent among decided respondents (Conservative donors of at least $200 who say they are eligible to vote) in the last two weeks.
They have also picked up a number of new endorsements, including from four MPs, three former MPs and four provincial legislators.
O'Leary, slipping 0.7 points, has dropped the most in the index. Though they announced a few new endorsements (one MP, one former MP, one Ontario MPP and two senators), they have slipped 1.6 points in the polls. They have scored between 24 and 25 per cent among decided respondents in Mainstreet's polling in the last two weeks. They had previously been as high as 27 per cent.
No other contestants have experienced shifts in their index score greater than 0.2 points. A full breakdown of the 14 candidates' standings in the index can be found at the bottom of this article.
Scheer, Bernier trade endorsements for poll support
After O'Toole, Scheer had the greatest movement in Mainstreet's polling, increasing their support to 14 to 15 per cent among decided respondents over the last two weeks, and 2.7 points in the index's weighted average. At the beginning of March, Scheer had been in the single-digits.
Bernier has seen a similar drop in the polls, down 2.6 points. The latest two Mainstreet surveys have had the Quebec MP at 17 or 18 per cent among decided respondents. They had recently been as high as 22 per cent.
But Bernier's losses and Scheer's gains in the polls have been counterbalanced by new (and departed) endorsements.
Since the end of March, Scheer has lost three endorsements to their rivals: one MP to O'Toole, one senator to O'Leary and one Alberta MLA to Bernier.
That MLA was one of eight new Alberta endorsements Bernier announced on Tuesday, keeping them in third place in Conservative establishment support behind Scheer and O'Toole.
Also of note was Lisa Raitt's endorsement from former Yukon premier Darrell Pasloski.
The hunt for low-hanging fruit
Yukon is one of the ridings in the country that will likely carry a disproportionate weight in the leadership vote. Each of Canada's 338 ridings will be worth 100 points regardless of the number of members it has. This means Yukon, with a population of about 36,000 carries as much weight as Edmonton–Wetaskiwin (pop. 159,000).
And a riding with a dozen or so members will be as important as one with thousands.
We don't know the riding-by-riding breakdown of the Conservative Party's membership. But based on the number of individual contributors who donated $200 or more to the party in 2016, the ridings with the largest membership rolls are likely to be found in Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Vancouver, Edmonton and a few rural ridings in Alberta.
The party received had at least 300 contributors from ridings in these areas.
But there were a large number of ridings that registered very few contributions to the national party's headquarters — 28 had fewer than 10 contributors in 2016.
Most of them (24) were in Quebec, primarily in and around Montreal and in northern and eastern Quebec. The remaining four were in Atlantic Canada.
Time well spent
Ridings with the fewest Conservative contributors (four or less) were Beloeil–Chambly, Bonavista–Burin–Trinity, Repentigny, Gaspésie–Les-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Montcalm, Marc-Aurèle-Fortin and Labrador.
Together, these seven ridings will carry half the weight of Saskatchewan. These seven ridings registered 18 contributors. Saskatchewan's 14 ridings had 2,404.
Alberta's 34 ridings had 8,362 contributors. In the 34 ridings with the fewest contributors, there were a total of 226 Conservative contributors.
If those numbers are reflective of how the electoral district associations (EDAs) with the shortest and longest membership lists compare, then a voter in one of the 34 smallest EDAs could be worth more than 30 times a Conservative party member in Alberta.
And that means a Conservative leadership contestant's time spent among the members of these smaller EDAs is 30 times more valuable than a trip to the Rocky Mountains.
So Gaspé and Labrador City are lovely this time of year — if you're running to be the next leader of the Conservative Party.
The index is based on four different metrics: endorsements, fundraising, contributors and polls. In tests on 14 recent federal and provincial leadership races in which all party members could vote, the index has replicated the first ballot results with a median error of +/- 2.2 points per candidate.
A more detailed explanation of the index's methodology can be found here.
*As Kevin O'Leary entered the race after the end of the last fundraising reporting period, the index substitutes their poll support in place of their fundraising and contributors. Each candidate's average is then adjusted so that the index adds up to 100.
"Castle in the Sky" was released in Japan in 1986.
A movie many may have long forgotten is the reason behind a worldwide record number of tweets per second.
The television airing of Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 film, "Castle in the Sky" in Japan on Aug. 3 had a huge audience, "and at one moment they took to Twitter so much that we hit a one-second peak of 143,199 tweets per second," wrote Raffi Krikorian, Twitter's vice-president, platform engineering, on the site's blog.
Normally, Twitter handles more than 500 million tweets a day, or about 5,700 tweets a second "on average," Krikorian wrote. "This particular spike was around 25 times greater than our steady state."
"Castle in the Sky" was released in the U.S. in 1989, and its story — about a young princess and a boy with a magic crystal trying to outrace bad guys to save a legendary floating castle — captivated the hearts of many.
The word "balus" was what was so heavily tweeted, noted The Hollywood Reporter. It's a "magic word in the Miyazaki universe" that "triggers a spell of destruction when said by characters at the beloved film's climax," the publication said.
The previous record for tweets per second was 33,388 was set Jan. 1, 2013 as people all over the world rang in the new year with good wishes via tweets, a Twitter spokesperson said.
But it's not "Castle in the Sky"'s first time as a Twitter titleholder. When the movie aired on Japanese TV on Dec. 9, 2011, it resulted in 25,088 tweets per second, which at that time was the most tweets per second ever recorded.

The prospect of lab-grown meat has intrigued both vegetarians and environmentalists for years. Humans eat about 240 billion kilograms of meat each year — a voracious demand for animal protein that has resulted in environmental degradation, cruelty to livestock, and the spread of dangerous diseases. And now, owing to a $350,000 donation by the Thiel Foundation to a company called Modern Meadow, the idea of printing meat using a 3D printer has come that much closer to reality.
Peter Thiel is no stranger to investing in alternative start-ups. Their foundation's Breakout Labs has funded ventures into brain reconstruction, reversible cryopreservation, human cell re-engineering, artificial protein therapeutics, and antimatter-based fuel.

Modern Meadow was co-founded by Gabor and Andras Forgacs, two tech-entrepreneurs who developed and commercialized bioprinting — a technology that iteratively constructs tissues and organ structures based on computer-controlled delivery of cells in three dimensions. The pair had previously co-founded Organova, a company that worked to apply the same principle to drug discovery, drug testing, and transplant tissues.
With Modern Meadow, though, they're hoping to change the way meat and leather products are produced, as well as making an impact in regenerative medicine and medical diagnostics.

And as it turns out, the prospect of printing 3D meat is proving to be less of a challenge than creating functional organs. In their grant application to the Department of Agriculture, they noted that because "meat is a post mortem tissue, the vascularization of the final product is less critical than in medical applications."
It's too early in the process to know how the meat will taste, or what its texture will be like. An early challenge for biologists working on lab-grown meat has been in simulating the exact texture that's characteristic of meat that was once part of a living, breathing animal. It's an open question as to whether or not this challenge will ever be overcome. For Modern Meadow, their initial goal is to develop 3D cellular sheets composed of pig cells. They're hoping to mature those sheets into muscle tissue with electric stimulation inside a bioreactor (which should help give it the desired texture).
Taste, texture, and aesthetics aside, this venture is clearly an important one, since meat consumption is steadily increasing. According to Worldwatch Institute, meat consumption will double by the year 2050 — a trend that will require the production of more than 465 million tons. Much of this has to do with the fact that many developing nations are developing a taste for meat.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India approved on Saturday the purchase of 814 mounted gun systems for the army at a cost of 157.5 billion rupees ($2.55 billion), a defence ministry spokesperson said.

India, already the world's largest arms importer, is in the midst of a $100 billion defence upgrade. In October, the new government approved long-delayed projects worth $13 billion to modernise hardware and boost the domestic defence industry.
In June, the government cleared defence deals worth $3.5 billion.
“The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) today cleared the acquisition of 155 mm/52 calibre mounted gun systems worth 157.5 billion rupees,” a defence ministry spokesperson told reporters after the meeting, chaired by newly appointed defence minister Manohar Parrikar.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is accelerating the modernisation plan in an attempt to catch up with neighbour China's rising military air, sea and land power. India's poorly equipped soldiers often scuffle with western neighbour Pakistan and brush up against Chinese forces patrolling a disputed Himalayan border.
Some of the mounted guns will be imported, but most will be made in India in a collaborative effort between foreign companies and domestic manufacturers.
“The initial 100 guns would be imported, but the remaining 714 would have to be produced in India,” the official said.
According to local media reports, Tata Power's Strategic Engineering Division unveiled its first mounted gun system on a Tata track in 2012. Other Indian competitors could be Mahindra Defence, L&T and Bharat Forge .
Parrikar also announced that the DAC would meet more frequently, at least once in a month, to expedite acquisition proposals, the official said.

Even previously low immigrant North Carolina has developed a problem with illegal voting by aliens, and along with its alien population, the problem is increasing.
Voter Integrity Project September 4, 2013
(Raleigh, NC)—SEP 4, 2013— Between 2008 and 2012, 475 cases of voter fraud in North Carolina were referred for prosecution, according to a new NC Board of Elections report obtained by the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina (after repeated requests), which undermines claims that voter fraud in North Carolina is insignificant.
“This looks like an interim report, but it shows some disturbing numbers,” said Jay DeLancy, Executive Director of Voter Integrity Project-NC. “Because reports of voter fraud often don't get referred for prosecution until the year after an election, the extent of potential fraud in the 2012 election still remains to be seen. The large increase in fraud referrals in 2012 over 2008 suggests that substantial fraud occurred in last year's election, but the full numbers have not yet been reported. In any event, these numbers totally crush the lie that there is no voter fraud in North Carolina”
And here is the chart showing huge increases in alien voting. Together with other fraudulent voting by Democrats, this may explain Obama's victories there and in other States. It does appear that real Republicans are taking steps, though.
The NSA may be hiding payloads in the firmware of consumer hard drives, according to a new report from Kaspersky Lab. The report tracks a group that researchers have dubbed "Equation," which uses previously undiscovered methods to plant targeted malware in hard drive firmware, where it is difficult to detect or remove. The report found exploits for hard drives made by many of the largest brands in the industry, including Samsung, Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor, Toshiba, and Hitachi. The group is closely tied to Stuxnet, using many overlapping vulnerabilities and techniques over the same time period, and those similarities combined with previously published NSA hard drive exploits have led many to speculate that Encounter may be part of the NSA.
Hard to detect and even harder to remove
If true, the program would give the NSA unprecedented access to the world's computers, even when disconnected from the larger web. Viruses stored on a hard drive's firmware are typically activated as soon as a device is plugged in, with no further action required. They're also usually undetectable and survive reformatting, making them difficult to detect and remove. In July, independent researchers discovered a similar exploit targeting USB firmware — dubbed BadUSB — but there was no indication of the bugs being developed and deployed at this scale.
It also raises real questions about device manufacturers' complicity in the program. It would take extensive and sustained reverse engineering to successfully rewrite a device's firmware. The NSA would certainly be capable of it, but it's also possible the NSA compelled companies to hand over the firmware code or intercepted it through other means. Reached by Reuters, only Western Digital actively denied sharing source code with the NSA; the other companies declined to comment.
The South Needs Your Compassion, Not Derision
When North Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee passed their anti-LGBT bills, I, like many, groaned and shook my head in disgust. It was clearly another shameful act in the South's long history of discrimination and segregation that in the end will do more damage than any sort of supposed benefit is been supposed to bring, which honestly was none. Of course many think pieces, letters to the editor, YouTube videos, and angry hashtags were born from the actions, and most of them are not wrong. These laws are shameful, disgraceful, hateful, and ultimately a stain on our culture. A few of these articles, letters, and hashtags. though … well, let's talk.
I was born in a small Mississippi town and lived in the state most of my life. That little town I still consider my home, and I wouldn't mind someday going back and living a quiet life, sitting on my porch in a rocking chair, drinking sweet tea, listening to the cicadas, and taking in the warm humid air while shaded by a tree older than most of the gentrified neighborhoods people pay way too much to live in. I love the South, I love that town, I love Mississippi. I'm a damn proud Southerner. That last part must confuse and perplex many of you; how can I be proud of being from a place full of ignorant rednecks and Bible thumpers? Easy. I know my home state sucks.
Yes, we have the lowest scores in education, we're the fattest state, we're poor, we're crazy-pants religious, and we're racist. Racist as hell. We know this. We know this because you won't stop reminding us. Every time we crush the tinfoil on the coathanger on the back of the TV to watch a show that isn't The Dukes of Hazzard, we see shows where Southerners are portrayed as menacing tobacco-chewing cousin-humpers out to find a gay or black person to harass and assault. We're the butt of jokes all the time. When I was in the Army, people were shocked that I was from Mississippi because I didn't act like I grew up barefoot on some pig farm. I quoted Eastern philosophers like Lao Tzu and Basho, watched films like Citizen Kane, and listened to music like Charlie Parker and Brian Transeau. It honestly shocked people that I didn't think all gay people were going to hell, that black people were criminals, and that women should be barefoot in the kitchen. And frankly, the fact that people thought that was what I was supposed to be like pissed me the hell off.
It angers me because that's what people think of me just because I was born some place. It pisses me off because anytime something terrible happens in the South, Yankees just shrug their shoulders and say, “Well, what do you expect? It's the South. They're all rednecks down there.” It pisses me off that people can call Southerners “rednecks” and it's seen as descriptive, but we can't call you “Yankees” in response without sounding like, yes, a damn redneck. We're seen as a monolithic entity of bigotry and ignorance, and whenever we go and screw up again it's seen as typical, but when I hear about something homophobic or anti-trans in California, New York City, or Chicago, there is all the moralizing hand-wringing and excuses of “that's just a few bad folks.”
That's garbage. I learned a long time ago that the only difference between a Yankee and a redneck is that the redneck doesn't check to see if the coast is clear before telling the bigoted joke at the party. I've sat here and watched people in New York City go into a panic when they get reminded that their police department has spied on mosques to hunt down terrorists and still racially profiles people of color for stop-and-frisks, and seen New Yorkers not even bat an eye when entire minority neighborhoods are gobbled up for more cronut places. In California, where they actually love the fact they're called the “Left Coast” and are so open-minded, they overturned marriage equality — after it was already in effect.
Sure, you could call these petty retorts and a case of tu quoque logic, but you would only be right about the pettiness because I don't deny our flaws. I just have to wonder about everyone else's. The South has had a lot to overcome in its history. We were the states that owned slaves, we are the states that have been known for gay-bashing and restricting a woman's right to choose. The South is backwards and constantly on the wrong side of history, but when it's forever playing catch-up it's always going to be that way. But what is your excuse? Why is it that just about every host on Fox News who fools no one in hiding their racism, sexism, hate of LGBT people, and Muslims is from a Northern state? Why is it that Donald Trump, a blatant bigot and a New Yorker, is winning the Republican nomination right now? No, we're not perfect down South, but neither are other parts of the country.
Whenever the South inevitably shows its ignorance and backwardness, I see comments about how we should just be tossed aside and given up as a lost cause. Gee, thanks. I used to see people complaining about how their tax dollars ended up being spent in the South because we're poor and dumb and you didn't want it spent down there anymore, even though those tax dollars were being spent to make us less poor and dumb. Now I see people up North and on the West Coast practically begging Bernie Sanders to tax the crap out of them so that there will be fewer poor and dumb people in America, so we can all have a level playing field. Guess where all that tax money is gonna get spent? Not on your student loan debt. It's gonna go where it went before, where all the poor and dumb people are: the South. Hey, we need grade schools that function before you get your free college. I guess you only care about redistribution of wealth when that income gap shows up above the Mason-Dixon Line?
When marriage equality was established nationally last year, I knew what was going to happen, because I've seen it happen before. After the Civil War the North declared victory and left black people to suffer under Jim Crow and sharecropping. After the Civil Rights Act, progressives declared victory and the Freedom Summer volunteers disappeared. After same-sex marriage won, gays declared victory and started planning their weddings while trans (and LGB) people were still being discriminated against and lawmakers started plotting. People forgot there was still work to be done. Well, that's been the South for over a century. People have come down and helped us from time to time, but they have always declared a George W. Bush style “Mission Accomplished” and walked away, leaving us to struggle for what we do accomplish on our own.
I know someone who works in women's issues down South. She's been invited to conference all over the country, she's respected in their field, but she's never going to leave the South, because fighting for women's causes is far more important here than in New England or California. There are plenty of LGBT people who haven't left home but stuck around and fought tooth and nail for every safe space they have. After the 1960s, the NAACP didn't close the office and retire; they're still out there fighting. The progressives of the South never stopped fighting; we just wonder where our friends from out of state went.
It's easy to lament the tragedies and injustices you see in North Carolina and Mississippi. I'm sure more than one discussion about how glad you were that you didn't live there was had over mimosas at Sunday brunch. It's also really easy to sit back, mock and laugh, and judge us as less worthy. It's hard as hell to do something to help, though. We do want your help. We want to have you do more than just shake your head in disappointment and cheer when pop stars cancel their concerts. Pledging not to spend your tourist dollars here is meaningless when you weren't going to come anyway. Cheering for corporations that withdraw jobs isn't going to help us in the long run because being poor and unable to fund our schools is part of the problem. Help us. Fund our lobbyists. Fund our charities. Support our schools and expand your businesses here. Help us break the backs of these fundamentalist lunatics who control our state legislatures. Make the South a better, smarter, more open place, and quit forgetting about us once you get a symbolic victory. Once these laws are crushed in court, I have that gut feeling a bunch of television pundits and blog writers are gonna call it a win and go off to celebrate, while the South is right back where it was before.
These laws are a symptom, not the disease, and honestly, we're not going to get much better without your help. If you're not willing to help us or you're just going to sit back and judge us, well I'm sure some of you know enough about Southern culture to know what I mean when I say, “Bless your heart.”

Turkish airstrikes and shelling have targeted 40 Daesh and six PKK and PYD terrorist positions in northern Syria, while 18 terrorists were killed in anti-terror operations in southeast Turkey, military sources said on Friday.
According to the sources, 18 PKK terrorists were killed in anti-terror operations conducted in rural parts of Turkey's southeastern Hakkari province on Thursday.
Meanwhile Turkey's army also said 40 Daesh and six PKK/PYD targets were hit as part of Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria.
Coalition airstrikes have also destroyed a vehicle belonging to Daesh terrorists in northern Syria, the sources added.
The PKK and its Syrian offshoot the PYD are both listed as terrorist groups by Turkey although the U.S. and EU only view the PKK as a terrorist organization.
Operation Euphrates Shield was launched in August to rid the north Syrian border area of terrorists. The campaign has seen both Daesh and the PKK/PYD targeted by the Free Syrian Army and Turkish tanks, artillery and aircraft.
The PKK resumed its decades-old armed campaign in July last year. Since then, PKK terrorist attacks martyred more than 700 security personnel and also claimed the lives of many civilians, including women and children, while nearly 8,000 PKK terrorists were killed in army operations.
Iraq has suffered a devastating security vacuum since mid-2014, when Daesh captured the northern city of Mosul, now the subject of a large offensive to retake it, and overran large swathes of territory in northern and western parts of the country.
NEW YORK (RNS) In a move that could recast the reigning political narrative about the Catholic bishops, Cardinal Timothy Dolan has accepted an invitation to deliver the closing benediction at the Democratic National Convention, a week after they give a similar blessing to the Republicans in Tampa, Fla.
From the start, Dolan, who is also president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, made it clear that they would be willing to pray at the Democratic convention. There were doubts, however, that the Democrats would invite Dolan.
The Obama campaign also revealed Tuesday (Aug. 28) that Sister Simone Campbell, the popular face of the recent “Nuns on the Bus” tour for social justice, will be addressing the Democrats in Charlotte, N.C., the night before Dolan's appearance.
That is kind of a Catholic “two-fer” that threatens to upstage GOP nominee Mitt Romney's Catholic outreach and highlights the importance of this swing vote in a deadlocked race.
“It was made clear to the Democratic Convention organizers, as it was to the Republicans, that the Cardinal was coming solely as a pastor, only to pray, not to endorse any party, platform, or candidate,” Dolan's spokesperson, Joseph Zwilling, said in a statement released Tuesday by the Archdiocese of New York.
Zwilling added that Dolan had consulted Bishop Peter Jugis of the Diocese of Charlotte, who consented to Dolan's role in the convention. By tradition, if a Catholic churchman takes part in a political convention, it is usually the local bishop. Dolan had to upend church protocol to appear, which is part of the reason the Romney campaign's success in securing Dolan's participation was notable, and why it drew so much criticism from the left.
Democratic officials stressed Tuesday that there was no deliberate balancing act in featuring both the cardinal and the nun.
“One was not done because of the other,” said a campaign aide. “We are delighted to have both of them at the convention.”
When Romney announced last week that Dolan would be delivering the closing prayer to the GOP convention it was seen as a major coup for the Republicans. Catholics make up nearly one-quarter of the electorate and they are concentrated in battleground states that are key to the candidates' fortunes in November. Polls show they are evenly divided between Obama and Romney.
But Romney has found many allies in the hierarchy, especially as the bishops have grown increasingly critical of Obama. That sympathy with the GOP was especially evident after Romney picked Rep. Paul Ryan, a Catholic conservative who is friends with Dolan, as their running mate.
Dolan has also sharply criticized Obama over their policies on gay marriage and abortion rights, and they are one of dozens of Catholic leaders and groups suing the administration over the controversial mandate requiring Catholic hospitals and schools to provide birth control coverage to employees.
Conservative Catholics had spent the days since Romney's announcement trumpeting Dolan's appearance in Tampa and slamming Obama for allegedly “snubbing” America's most prominent Catholic churchman.
“The Republicans are smart enough to get the ‘pope of America,' and the Democrats are stupid enough not to invite him,” William Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told the New York Post last week.
“The Catholic vote is the most critical vote. They're the wild card,” Donohue told the Post. “So, why wouldn't you ingratiate yourself to the pope of America and send a wink and a nod to Catholics? That's just good politics.”
But it turns out that the Democrats knew that, too, and may have outmaneuvered the GOP. Romney seemed to be betting that he'd secured Dolan exclusively, figuring that relations between Obama and the cardinal had soured to the point that the Democrats would never invite them as well.
Yet a prominent Catholic who spoke with the Obama campaign about inviting Dolan said that top officials concluded “from the get-go” that having the cardinal's blessing “was a no-brainer.”
The Republicans “can no longer claim to be the party that got the ‘pope of America' to do the benediction,” said the campaign adviser, who was not authorized to speak on the record. “It neutralizes at least that part of Romney's outreach.”
Dolan's appearance in Charlotte also has implications for the church's internal politics.
For one thing, the dual benedictions continue to raise Dolan's profile as a major player in national politics, and that raises their standing inside the church.
But it also makes them a bigger target for critics from the right who had already blistered them for inviting Obama to the Al Smith Dinner, a pre-election charity fundraiser in October hosted by the archbishop of New York that by custom features the two presidential contenders.
Now, in addition to that event, Dolan will be blessing the Democratic convention the night Obama accepts their party's nomination.
Also notable is that Dolan's Sept. 6 prayer will follow an address to the convention a day earlier by Campbell, head of Network, Catholic social justice lobby that espouses many liberal causes.
The hierarchy and the nuns have been at loggerheads in the months since the Vatican announced a takeover of the chief leadership organization of the American sisters, claiming it was too progressive.
“We are really happy that Cardinal Dolan is coming to the Democratic convention as well,” Stephanie Niedringhaus, spokesperson for Network, told RNS. Niedringhaus said the Obama campaign contacted Campbell late last week about the appearance, and they did not know what Campbell planned to tell the delegates.
But, they said, “It's great to move beyond the ‘Nuns vs. Bishops' narrative for a moment. … We really need to talk about what the mission is, what Catholic social teaching is, and not have this so-called power struggle going on.”
Frédéric Mitterrand, France's culture minister, last night denied paying underage boys for sex in Thailand, and sought to calm a storm over their support for the film director Roman Polanski.
Both the extreme right and the Socialist party have called for their resignation over their 2005 autobiography, The Bad Life" in which they described paid encounters with "young boys" in Bangkok. It came back to haunt Mitterrand when Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National looked into their past following their defence of Polanski, who was arrested in Switzerland on a US warrant over a statutory rape charge concerning a 13-year-old girl and dating back to 1977.
Mitterrand was the first to leap to Polanski's defence, calling their arrest "terrible" – something which they and Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling centre-right party later rowed back from. An emotional Mitterrand appeared on France's evening news to acknowledge paying for sex – but only with people "my age", "consenting" and with "no ambiguity". They said they were not minors.
They added: "I absolutely condemn sex tourism, which is a disgrace, I condemn paedophilia, in which I have never participated in any way. The book is in no way an apology for sex tourism, even if one chapter is a journey through that hell, with all the fascination that hell can inspire."
Mitterrand, a nephew of the late president, is a gay activist, writer and former TV presenter whose appointment was seen as a coup for President Sarkozy.
The autobiography has passages describing the narrator's shame and attraction for gay prostitution bars in Asia, and the pleasure and emptiness of paying for sex. When published it was hailed for its honesty. Asked at the time about their use of the term "young boys", Mitterrand said they called all men "boys" and it did not refer to minors. Sarkozy, when they appointed Mitterrand this summer, described the book as "brave and talented".
Asked if paying for sex in Thailand was a mistake, Mitterrand said: "An error, without a doubt. A crime, no." They said they had Sarkozy's full support and would not resign; politicians attacking them were confusing homosexuality and paedophilia.
Their reaction to the arrest of Polanski, who has dual French and Polish nationality, was "too emotive", but they had wanted to show that "an artist of international repute wouldn't be abandoned by their culture minister" and would be treated fairly.

PRISM whistleblower Edward Snowden sacked from Booz Allen; hiding in unknown location
Updated
The former CIA contractor who leaked top-secret information about surveillance programs used by American spy agencies has been sacked by the company they worked for.
Edward Snowden, 29, exposed the way the US National Security Agency (NSA) gains information from internet companies as well as US telecoms using a secret program called PRISM.
Mr Snowden travelled from Hawaii to Hong Kong on May 20 carrying a cache of secrets harvested from their employer's servers.
They went into hiding in Hong Kong before leaking the data, and their whereabouts are now unknown.
Contracting company Booz Allen Hamilton has sacked the infrastructure analyst from the job they held for about three months.
What is Booz Allen? A US technology consulting firm that employed Edward Snowden.
Clients include the US military, the US Intelligence Community and the Dept of Homeland Security.
The company says it aims to help those clients combat global terrorism and improve cyber capabilities.
Mr Snowdon worked for Booz Allen for less than three months and was assigned to a team working in Hawaii.
In a statement posted on its website, the company said it sacked Mr Snowden "for violations of the firm's code of ethics and firm policy".
It has also moved to clarify their salary, saying it was $US122,000, not around $US200,000 as Mr Snowden has claimed.
Mr Snowden has said they chose Hong Kong as a refuge as it has a "strong tradition of free speech".
But the semi-autonomous Chinese region also has an extradition treaty with the Washington, which Beijing may not wish to anger.
Mr Snowden has told the Guardian newspaper they may seek asylum in Iceland.
But the head of Iceland's Directorate of Immigration says it has received no formal request, and Mr Snowden would have to be on Icelandic soil to make one.
The Russian government has said it would consider granting asylum to Mr Snowden, if they were to ask for it.
Mr Snowden, who asked the Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspapers to identify them and their role, says they leaked the information because they believed the United States had built a vast and secret espionage machine to spy on Americans.
"I don't want to live in a society that does this sort of things," they told the Guardian.
"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under."
Mr Snowden may yet face severe legal consequences for blowing the lid on Washington's vast snooping program, but they have triggered the public battle they said they wanted.
Who is Edward Snowden? Former CIA contractor who leaked information about US spy agencies
They worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) for the last four years
Was employed by various outside contractors, including tech consultancy Booz Allen and computer company Dell
They copied secret documents at the NSA office in Hawaii
They leaked the documents, which expose how the NSA gains information using a secret program called PRISM
Says they leaked the data because they were worried about privacy and internet freedom
Their revelations launched a broad debate on privacy rights and the limits of security programs in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.
Many members of Congress have expressed support for the surveillance program but have raised questions about whether it should be more tightly supervised and scaled back.
The American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, has announced it is suing top US government officials to challenge the validity of the NSA's telephone surveillance program.
The union says it violates rights to free speech and privacy.
The suit, filed in the US District Court of New York, names James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, and the leaders of the NSA, the Defence Department, the Justice Department and the FBI.

For one thing, Robert De Niro produced it, which more than makes up for Cherâs involvement. For another, its Wikipedia entry describes it as âa game designed to represent the limits of manâs imagination.â That may seem like a stretch, but only until you play the carnival organ to get past the Tiki guards to the room that houses the entirety of space.If youâre a comedy fan, thereâs not a lot a more video game can do to unnerve you than have Jim Belushi continuously heckle you from a tiny plane. And if youâre a gaming fan, this is one of the most non-intuitive and challenging adventure games out there. That's code for, "it's like trying to play Riven drunk." Mark Ryden . Thatâs kind of shitty answer, since the game was based on their artwork, but itâs also an excellent answer if you havenât heard of Mark Ryden, because heâs awesome.The Fallout games are among the most well known on this list, primarily because of the immense popularity of the newest entry, and the fact that I tacitly endorsed them at the end of last week's blog post (sales immediately rocketed 4000 percent). And while theyâre set in what could, at first glance, be considered a run of the mill post-apocalyptic wasteland, itâs the touches of brilliance, attention to detail and abilities to have sex with people and swear that truly make these games shine.By drawing on the buttoned-down iconography of the 50s and infusing it with the paranoia and very real dangers of the Cold War era, the Fallout series presents a pastiche of an America that could have been. Traces of the boundless, wholesome optimism of the Leave it to Beaver era barely obscure twisted, smoldering corpses of what may have once been human. Monuments to our faith in the ability of science to âbring us the convenience of the future, today!â dot a landscape made scarred, barren, lifeless by that same overgrown technology. And all of it set to the uncomplicated music of bygone days, like vinyl ghost voices blown on an irradiated wind.Last night, I blew up a super mutant with a mine, then shot them in the face with my sniper rifle before they hit the ground while the Andrews Sisters sang me a vaguely racist song about the Congo. THAT HAPPENED.Almost certainly Ron English At a time when every video game was operating on the âmore is moreâ principle, Ico and its sequel, Shadow of the Colossus, dared to do away with basically everything. In the original, you got a board, a giant deserted castle, some shadow monsters and a princess who needs saving and lacks any other discernible traits except for their staggering inability to follow directions. In the next installment, you got a giant open field, 14 enemies (yes, total, for the whole game) each the size of a building and a horse that lacks any discernible traits except for its staggering inability to turn around.The spare lines, soft focus and contemplative silences of this world draw us into its eerie natural beauty, at the same time challenging us to ponder the brutal deaths of ancient and stately creatures at our own hands. As we ride over rolling hills devoid of life, we are given time to question: Is the killing of an innocent being ever justified? What are the ethical limits of love? Why did that little kid have horns?

Within this century, global warming will bring about disruptive, decades-long droughts in the U.S. southwest and Great Plains, exceeding even the driest periods of the last millennium, according to new research released this month.
The study, "Unprecedented 21st-Century Drought Risk in the American Southwest and Central Plains," was published in the inaugural edition of the journal Science Advances, put out by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It supports previous predictions, but suggests that future droughts could be even worse than scientists have said in the past.
"The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden."
—Jason Smerdon, Columbia University
In fact, it projects that some time between 2050 and 2100, extended drought conditions across the U.S. will become more severe than the mega-droughts of the 12th and 13th centuries. Such arid conditions would affect millions of people, placing stress on agricultural crops and increasing the likelihood and frequency of water shortages in urban areas.
"The coming drought age—caused by higher temperatures under climate change—will make it nearly impossible to carry on with current life-as-normal conditions across a vast swath of the country," the Guardian warned.
Jason Smerdon, study co-author and climate scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, told the newspaper: "The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden."

The researchers compared computer projections of 21st century climate with drought records of the past millennium, notably data in the North American Drought Atlas.
According to Scientific American, "The models consistently demonstrated drought worse than at any time during that epoch, and worse than the current drought out West, which has prevailed for 11 of the previous 14 years, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."
As Brian Clark Howard explains for National Geographic, "[t]hat's because rising temperatures spurred by the greenhouse effect result in more evaporation and less precipitation for the region, which is already relatively dry."
On Thursday, the U.S. Drought Monitor released its most recent statistics, showing that a full 93 percent of the state of California is under 'severe drought.' While the numbers show that 'extreme' conditions dropped from 77 percent last week to 67 percent this week, mostly in Northern California, 'exceptional drought' in the state—the most severe classification—remained unchanged at nearly 40 percent.
Some records indicate they were created in 2004, but nothing seems official. Of note, these lines are somewhat near the Mogao Caves, which is a World Heritage Site. The lines span a very huge distance and yet still retain their linear proportions despite the curvature of the rough terrain. Unexplained stone doll These strange lines are found at coordinates: 40°27'28.56″N, 93°23'34.42″E. There isn't much information available on these strange, yet beautiful mosaic lines carved in the desert of the Gansu Sheng province in China. The July 1889 find in Nampa, Idaho, of a small human figure during a well-drilling operation caused intense scientific interest last century. Unmistakably made by human hands, it was found at a depth of 320 feet which would place its age far before the arrival of man in this part of the world. The find has never been challenged except to say that it was impossible. creationism.org The first stone calendar
In the Sahara Desert in Egypt lie the oldest known astronomically aligned stones in the world: Nabta. Over one thousand years before the creation of Stonehenge, people built a stone circle and other structures on the shoreline of a lake that has long since dried up. Over 6,000 years ago, stone slabs three meters high were dragged over a kilometer to create the site. Shown above is one of the stones that remains. Although at present the western Egyptian desert is totally dry, this was not the case in the past. There is good evidence that there were several humid periods in the past (when up to 500 mm of rain would fall per year) the most recent one during the last interglacial and early last glaciation periods which stretched between 130,000 and 70,000 years ago. During this time, the area was a savanna and supported numerous animals such as extinct buffalo and large giraffes, varieties of antelope and gazelle. Beginning around the 10th millennium BC, this region of the Nubian Desert began to receive more rainfall, filling a lake. Early people may have been attracted to the region due to the source of water. Archaeological findings may indicate human occupation in the region dating to at least somewhere around the 10th and 8th millennia BC. 300 million year old iron screw In the summer of 1998, Russian scientists who were investigating an area 300 th km southwest of Moscow on the remains of a meteorite, discovered a piece of rock which enclosed an iron screw. Geologists estimate that the age of the rock is 300-320 million years. At that time there were not only intelligent life forms on earth, not even dinosaurs. The screw which is clearly visible in the head and nut, has a length of about cm and a diameter of about three millimeters.

Sliding stones
Even NASA cannot explain it. It's best to gaze in wonder at the sliding rocks on this dry lake bed in Death Valley National Park. Racetrack Playa is almost completely flat, 2.5 miles from north to south and 1.25 miles from east to west, and covered with cracked mud.
The rocks, some weighing hundreds of pounds, slide across the sediment, leaving furrows in their wakes, but no one has actually witnessed it.
Pyramid power
Teotihuacan, Mexico. Embedded in the walls of this ancient Mexican city are large sheets of mica. The closest place to quarry mica is located in Brazil, thousands of miles away. Mica is now used in technology and energy production so the question raised is why did the builders go to such extremes to incorporate this mineral into the building of their city.
Were these ancient architects harnessing some long forgotten source of energy in order to power their city?
Dog Deaths
Dog suicides at The Overtoun Bridge, near Milton, Dumbarton, Scotland. Built in 1859, the Overtoun Bridge has become famous for the number of unexplained instances in which dogs have apparently committed suicide by leaping off of it.
The incidents were first recorded around the 1950′s or 1960′s when it was noticed that dogs – usually the long-nosed variety like Collies – would suddenly and unexpectedly leap off the bridge and fall fifty feet to their deaths
Fossilized giant
The fossilized Irish giant from 1895 is over 12 feet tall. The giant was discovered during a mining operation in Antrim, Ireland. This picture is courtesy “the British Strand magazine of December 1895″ Height, 12 foot 2 inches; girth of chest, 6 foot 6 inches; length of arms 4 foot 6 inches. There are six toes on the right foot
The six fingers and toes remind some people of Bible passage 2 Samuel 21:20 ”And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and they also are born to the giant”
Pyramid of Atlantis?
Scientist continues to explore the ruins of megaliths in the so-called Yucatan channel near Cuba. They have been found for many miles along the coast. American archaeologists, who discovered this place, immediately declared that they found Atlantis (not the first time in history, underwater archaeology).
Now it's occasionally visited by scuba divers, and all others interested can enjoy only in surveying and computer reconstruction of the buried water city of a millennium age.
Giants in Nevada
Nevada Indian legend of 12 foot red-haired giants that lived in the area when they arrived. The story has the Native American's killing off the giants at a cave. Excavations of guano in 1911 turned up this human jaw. Here it is compared to a casting of a normal man's jawbone.
In 1931 two skeletons were found in a lake bed. One was 8′ tall, the other just under 10′ tall.
Inexplicable Wedge
On the bank of Mures River in Transylvania, near the city of Aiud, in 1974, an aluminum wedge was found among 20,000 year-old Mastdon bones, encased in one millimeter thick layer of oxides that shows it to be at least 300-400 years old. Aluminum is always found mixed with other metals but it was pure aluminum.
This 300 year old artifact is anomalous because aluminium was not discovered until 1808 and not produced in quantity until 1885. It's still under research at an undisclosed location.
Lolladoff plate
‘The Lolladoff plate' is a 12,000 year old stone dish found in Nepal. It seems that Egypt is not the only place that has been visited by Aliens in ancient times. It clearly shows a disk shaped UFO. There is also a figure on the disc looking remarkably similar to a Grey alien.
Though it almost always rains on the Shabbat we read the Torah portion about Noah and the flood, we awoke on the morning of my son's bar mitzvah to a gloriously blue, cloudless sky. The sun had blessed us, but a furious mingling of nerves and excitement unsettled my stomach nonetheless. After all, I had both awaited and feared this day since they were born.
We strode to shul as a family, the bar mitzvah boy together with my husband, our younger sons behind them. I fell back and walked alone into the women's section after they settled on the men's side. Before I knew it, my son was standing there at the amud, reading from the Torah. As their chanting made its way over to my side of the mechitzah, I felt the anguish that had lain dormant within me for years begin to bubble to the surface like scalding lava. This was their day, their simcha, a formal, public statement that marked the beginning of their Jewish manhood. But for me, their mother, it was undoubtedly an end.
I saw that fact mirrored clearly in the mechitzah itself, which rent my heart in two just as it did the sanctuary where we stood. Once an innocuous, architectural given of my Orthodox life, it had suddenly transformed into a rampart delineating a before and after in my relationship with my son. From that moment on, it would be unbreachable and we would stand on its opposite sides. While they leyned the story of Noah to the congregation, to me they recounted a more private, heart-wrenching tale: that of a son who had encamped in the world of men and had set off for their future.
***
I remembered the first Shabbat I brought them to shul, when they were just weeks old. I felt their perfectly timed breaths on my neck, and my davening that day teemed with such awe and gratitude that I never once looked over my shoulder to catch a glimpse of time in hot pursuit.
Before long, though, they were old enough to get restless in shul, leaving my side to make excursions to the men's section of the sanctuary. Their fleeting absences distracted me, but eventually he'd be back on the women's side with their mother, eager to search the siddur for letters they recognized, longing to place their finger atop mine as I followed along with the ba'al tefilah. We were lost together in our shared focus on the words in front of us.
Reading, in fact, had tethered us one to another from the very start. I often read aloud when I was still pregnant with him, longing for them to know my voice as the one that would never fail him, secretly hoping the endeavor would secure their intellectual curiosity. Once they were born, I'd pacify them with the Seussian rhymes of Horton Hears a Who! when they cried. In no time, they grew big enough to pull stories off the shelf himself—many of them favorites from my own childhood—and beg me to read them in a constant loop until they could recite them word for word. We laughed together at Amelia Bedelia's misunderstanding of household idioms and marveled at K'ton Ton's tiny adventures. Through the less-venerated classic The Gas We Pass, they dulled my sense of disgust at body humor, desensitizing me in preparation for the parenting of a household of boys.
One spring, we took a train into the city, just the two of us. We snuggled together on the cushions in the Maurice Sendak exhibit at the Jewish Museum and read In the Night Kitchen until closing time. We caught a case of the giggles that made me remember what matters and helped me—if only for that day—to forget everything else. On the train home, they fell asleep, their head on my shoulder, and I caught a glimpse of our shared reflection in the window. Yes, I knew better, but I naively allowed myself to believe that evening that this would last forever, that we would never meet on the battlefield of their adolescence, that they would always remain by my side.
Soon after that excursion, they began to read with ferocious independence—overnight, like the onset of a fever—though there was a brief window during which they would occasionally return to me with a story we could read in tandem. The last book of its kind was a yellowed, dog-eared copy of All-of-a-Kind Family. They found it on the shelf in our library, high up where I keep the titles I read myself as a little girl. When we closed the cover at the story's end, I heard that chapter in our lives sigh its last sigh.
As more time passed, my son rarely sought even a recommendation. At my urging, however, they did read Little House in the Big Woods, before enjoying the entire Laura Ingalls Wilder oeuvre of their own volition. It was its realism, its historical hand print, that fascinated him, and they hardly cared that its hero was a girl. On a family car trip to Mount Rushmore when they were 10, they alone joined me when we stopped for a tour of the Wilder homestead in De Smet, S.D. But that same summer, their reading was already exclusively of their own selection. I failed to pick up on the nuance, though, until they less subtly chose soccer, friends, and the hypnotic watching of professional football over anything that had to do with me. Not since I taught them to ride a bicycle without training wheels was I able to project forward so clearly to a time when our daily worlds would not be entirely engaged. Yet it had already come to pass, as if a soft wind had flicked the leaves off a tree in autumn—one by one, silently, until the branches were left bare. I had simply chosen not to see.
The last leaf fell to the ground on the morning of their bar mitzvah. As my son read from the Torah—a scroll from which I do not read—I realized that reading itself, the very thing that had long tethered us, is what finally severed our shared world in two. It seemed that the mechitzah, that wall of separation between the men and the women, between those who read from the Torah in our shul and those who do not, would be the defining symbol of this next leg of our individual journeys.
Continue reading: Back to shul
Soon after their bar mitzvah, they staged a literary rebellion, during which their reading habits mutated beyond recognition. Fiction, the last of our shared loves, was no longer deemed worth reading. They preferred sports journals and the daily paper to every tome I dangled in front of him. Their individuating was entirely normal for a teenager, I knew, but it was still painful to bear.
***
This fall, two years after my son's bar mitzvah, the annual cycle of Torah reading brought us, once again, to the Shabbat when we read Parashat Noach. Prodded by their father, my son agreed to be our shul's ba'al koreh—literally, the master of reading—a meaningful way to mark a moment that had quickly receded into the past.
That Friday evening, as it poured outside, my son developed an unexpected curiosity about my recent reading. I feigned disinterest, silently jutting my chin out in the direction of the book pile on the coffee table. Perusing the titles, their eyes landed on a copy of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.
“Fiction?” they asked.
“No. Just an incredible story,” I replied gingerly.
Taking the book in their hands, they shrugged, said goodnight, and went to bed.
The next morning, I took my place among the women in shul. My son approached the amud, standing seven inches taller than they had at their bar mitzvah, their voice a full octave deeper. They once again read flawlessly, confidently, though not quite as ceremoniously as they did the first time around. I listened while I pondered the beauty of the ark's construction, how its design carved out a designated place for everyone on board.
When they finished leyning, my son firmly shook the hands of the gabbaim who flanked them before turning to gaze at me over the mechitzah, just like they did on the day of their bar mitzvah.
Smiling, awaiting my approval, they were a man, but somehow—deep down and on their own terms—still my boy.

MIAMI -- The former clinic owner accused of selling performance-enhancing drugs to Alex Rodriguez agreed to plead guilty Tuesday in what prosecutors called a wide-ranging conspiracy to distribute steroids to both major league ballplayers and high school athletes.
The charges against former Biogenesis of America owner Anthony Bosch and six others marked one of the biggest salvos yet in a case that has dragged on for nearly two years. The case has sparked lawsuits, mudslinging and suspensions against numerous major leaguers, including Rodriguez.
Read the indictment against Anthony Bosch (pdf)
Also charged was Yuri Sucart, 52, a cousin of Rodriguez who the New York Yankees third baseman has said provided them with steroids from 2000 to 2003 when they played for the Texas Rangers.
Sucart and the others are accused of acting as recruiters, setting up meetings between the athletes and Bosch, who introduced themselves as "Dr. T," authorities said. Professional athletes paid up to $12,000 a month for the drugs provided by Biogenesis, while high schoolers paid up to $600 a month. All the clients were promised that the substances would not be found through drug testing, prosecutors said.
"He is not a doctor," Mark R. Trouville, chief of the Miami Drug Enforcement Administration office, said of Bosch. "He is a drug dealer."
U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer said Bosch did not have a medical license, making what happened all the more dangerous.
"As with many drug cases, these defendants were motivated by one thing - by money," Ferrer said.
Major League Baseball was not part of the criminal investigation and declined comment. No athletes were charged nor named in court documents, and it is unclear how many may have been involved. However, authorities said Bosch admitted to providing performance-enhancing drugs to 18 high schoolers.
Michael McCann, director of the sports and entertainment law center at the University of New Hampshire School of Law, said it's unlikely that the players involved in this scandal will face criminal charges, unless there's any evidence that a player went beyond using drugs and into distributing them.
"They could lose an endorsement contract because of a morals clause in their contract, but if that were to happen I think it would have already happened," McCann said. "In terms of punishment from baseball, baseball has punished them."
The prosecution may have taken so long because investigators might have wanted to confirm the information they were getting from Bosch, even if they were cooperating, McCann said.
"He's not somebody with a great track record, there are reasons to doubt them in terms of their credibility," they said.
Joe Tacopina, a lawyer for Rodriguez, said the arrests Tuesday represents a degree of closure for Rodriguez and will enable them to focus on an eventual return to baseball.
"It sort of reinforces the notion that Alex committed no crime, number one," Tacopina said. "And number two, quite frankly, this really signified the beginning of the end of the whole Biogenesis saga and allows Alex to focus on the future going forward."
Rodriguez is currently serving a season-long suspension, the longest penalty in the sport's history related to performance-enhancing drugs. They were the only one 14 players involved in the scandal to contest their penalty.
However, since the investigation is ongoing, it remains possible that more players could eventually face sanctions as a result of the Biogenesis probe.
Bosch details disguise, early morning drug deliveries to A-Rod
Bosch told "60 Minutes" that Rodriguez became their client in 2010. Bosch said he's supplied pro athletes with banned drugs almost 10 years -- a corrupt sideline to their anti-aging clinic based in Florida.
Bosch told "60 Minutes" that to tailor a doping program for Rodriguez, they needed to know how long various drugs stayed in Rodriguez's body. They said doses and timing were critical so Rodriguez would not test positive after a game.
Rodriguez denied taking steroids while playing for the Yankees, though their cousin was banned from the team's clubhouse, charter flights and other activities after Rodriguez said Sucart obtained the steroids they used while playing for the Rangers.
Bosch was to appear at a bond hearing later Tuesday. Their guilty plea will be entered at another time, Ferrer said.
Bosch faces up to maximum 10 years in prison.
Bosch was charged with conspiracy to distribute testosterone, as was Sucart, Carlos Javier Acevedo, Jorge Augustine Velazquez, Christopher Benjamin Engroba, Juan Carlos Nunez and Lazaro Daniel Collazo - a well-known youth and college baseball coach who has worked at the universities of Miami, Louisville and South Florida.
Nunez allegedly became a liaison between Bosch and several players. Velazquez was allegedly instrumental in building Bosch's business of supplying PEDs to athletes.
Court documents say that from October 2008 through December 2012, Bosch willfully conspired to distribute the anabolic steroid testosterone.
Prosecutors also announced the arrest of three others in a drug ring discovered during the course of the investigation into Biogenesis. However, that case, which centered around the stimulant known as "molly," was not directly connected to Bosch.
A Miami New Times report from January 2013, which sparked MLB's investigation, said Rodriguez had bought human growth hormone and other substances from 2009 to 2012 from Bosch's clinic. The newspaper said it had obtained records detailing the purchases by Rodriguez and other ballplayers.
New book "Blood Sport" details A-Rod, MLB steroid scandals
MLB had sued Bosch and their clinic but withdrew the lawsuit in February. The lawsuit had accused them of conspiring with players to violate their contracts by providing them with banned substances.
A new book about Rodriguez and the Biogenesis scandal alleges Major League Baseball allowed Rodriguez to use performance-enhancing drugs in 2007 and 2008.
"Blood sport" authors Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts said Rodriguez was permitted to use testosterone after requesting a therapeutic use exemption, or TUE.
"In 2007, of the 1,354 players subjected to testing, 111 were granted a TUE. Only two, apparently including Rodriguez, received an exemption for 'androgen deficiency medications,' the category that would include testosterone," the book said.
BROOKLYN, New York — It was an afternoon of sunlight, revolution, and unicorns in Prospect Park, a fitting setting for the beginning of Bernie Sanders's last stand in New York.
“Welcome to the political revolution!” they said after taking the stage to a hero's welcome. “This is a campaign that one year ago was considered a fringe candidacy, 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. They don't consider us fringe anymore.”
Sanders seems to have closed the gap here dramatically over the past few weeks. The massive crowds of supporters at their rallies across the state give the impression that Hillary Clinton—with their more modest venues and mostly small crowds—is falling behind.
But the polls show a different picture.
Yes, Sanders is closing the gap, but a Real Clear Politics average of New York state polling shows Clinton leading their opponent 53.5 to 41 percent. Recent polling has them closer, and the Clinton campaign is prepping for a tighter-than-expected race.
And while Sanders campaign staff has sought to dial back expectations as well, their supporters, seeing the enthusiasm around them, believe that the momentum and ultimately the state is behind the Vermont senator. Many said they expect nothing less than an epic upset on Tuesday.
The rally on Sunday did little to quiet their enthusiasm. According to Sanders, about 20,000 poured into the sunny park on Sunday afternoon. In the back of the park, some climbed trees to get a glimpse of their shiny, slightly sunburned head peeking out from behind the lectern.
“[Hillary] came and spoke at my school, there were like 200 people there,” said Sequoia Sellinger, a student at Purchase College who was perched behind a metal barrier around the large press pen. “There were more people outside their speech than were actually there.
“I believe Bernie will win the New York primaries,” they said. “This rally, the Bronx rally… the one in Poughkeepsie, there were like 10,000 people there.”
“We know who's [at Hillary rallies]. It's not young people,” said Christopher Graham, of Fairfax County, Virginia, noting that while they can't vote Tuesday, they did vote for Sanders in Virginia.
Sellinger and Graham were two of the thousands who flooded into a meadow in Prospect Park, clutching cardboard cutouts of their hero—both full body and College GameDay-style heads—swaying to the sounds of indie rock band Grizzly Bear, and listening to celebrities of various levels of famous actors and musicians who took to the stage to say why they were feeling the Bern.
The smell of marijuana wafted through the spring air, with intermittent plumes of white smoke coming up from the crowd as if from individual smokestacks.
“He is a politician we can all trust, and just that alone is such a rare thing, it's like unicorn rare,” Justin Long—a Brooklyn-born actor who played “Mac” in those grating Mac vs. PC commercials—told the crowd, moments after describing grainy footage of Sanders in the '80s as like watching “an actual unicorn.”
There was a deep distrust of the polls among Berniacs and a pervasive belief that the system and the polling was rigged to begin with—because of major media outlets and their association with large corporations.
“It's all a lie. It's a conspiracy by CNN and MSNBC,” Chuck Blocker, 62, of Connecticut, partially joked.
“Yeah, polls can be misleading, if it's only reaching 2 percent of the actual population, and those who take it doesn't necessarily reflect the demographics of the polling group,” said Daeha Ko, 37, of New York. “It's like anything in statistics, it can be manipulated by specific media outlets, or if the media outlet is reaching toward specific demographics.”
Demographics have been a problem for Sanders in their push to the White House, and New York has been no exception.
Both candidates spent several days last week courting the African-American vote, which has been particularly unreceptive to Sanders.
The race has also gotten more divisive on the Democratic side in recent weeks, perhaps because the stakes are so high.
At the Democratic debate on Thursday, the two contenders seemed tired of the other's presence in the race.
That lack of love was on full display Sunday, when the mention of Clinton's name provoked loud boos from the Sanders crowd.
The Vermont senator's riff on Clinton's failure to release the text of their paid speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs provoked a particularly raucous chorus of jeers from their supporters.
In the end, Sanders's final pitch deviated very little from their standard pitch, but their supporters didn't care. They were there to be in the movement that Sanders themselves has said they never imagined would come to this point.
“Let's have a record-breaking turnout on Tuesday,” they said. “New York state, help lead this country into the political revolution!”
Not everyone was on fire.
“Yeah, I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm not a native New Yorker, but I've lived here a long time now, almost two decades, and the city is very progressive,” said rally attendee Jolia Burke. “But Hillary's been here a long time and has a foothold, so I don't know. I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm really hoping to be shocked.”

BENGALURU: Decades after they migrated to Jammu & Kashmir from Pakistan-occupied areas ( POK ) of J&K and Chhamb, more than 36,000 families are awaiting the financial aid approved by the Centre in 2016 as part of a Rs 2,000 crore package.Each of the families, now settled in Rajouri, Jammu and Kathua , was to get Rs 5.5 lakh.Five months after the Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi cleared the package for 36,384 families, only Rs 9.33 crore — 0.4% of the package — has been disbursed, reaching 170 families with Aadhaar-linked bank accounts.The families were displaced from POK in 1947 (Partition) and from Chhamb after the 1965 and 1971 wars.According to information accessed by the ministry of home affairs, “...The central assistance is being directly disbursed to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries”.Organisations fighting for the betterment of these families — All State Pandit Conference and J&K Sharanarthi Action Committee — say linkage to Aadhaar is only delaying the process.According to UIDAI, J&K is among the states with the lowest enrolment. Dr T K Bhat, general secretary of the State Pandit Conference, told TOI from Jammu: “Our demand was for more than Rs 9,000 crore. We are one of the oldest organisations fighting for migrants' rights and we know the ground realities... We stand in long queues but don't get Aadhaar.”A Kashmiri working in Bengaluru, who did not want to be named, said unlike in other states, authorities in J&K don't give acknowledgements when one applies for Aadhaar.Besides these refugees, there are another 62,001 registered Kashmiri migrant families displaced since the 1990s when insurgency was at its peak in the Valley who are in need of financial assistance.

Tory David Davis had a 'Thick of It' moment this morning, as their party's 'bombshell' poster backfired horribly.
The party were launching their "tax bombshell" poster, which claims Labour has a £45 billion hole in their financial plan - a claim branded 'lies' by John McDonnell.
But the bumbling Brexit Secretary managed to stand in exactly the wrong place - and may have given away a more honest appraisal of the Tories' management of the economy.
"Hell for your family. Debt. Taxes."
And Labour managed to derail the event even further by sneaking in to the event, smuggling a rebuttal document to reporters, which said the poster is full of "mistakes, misinformation and misrepresentation."
This morning, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded the poster "absolute lies", pointing out the £45 billion figure includes £35 billion in capital spending.
Labour says the Tories have "fundamentally misunderstood" the difference between day-to-day revenue spending - ongoing expenses which have to be paid for immediately - and longer term capital projects, which do not.
Labour's Andrew Gwynne said: "That Philip Hammond is willing to put their name to this nonsense is deeply worrying given it suggests he's unable to tell the difference between capital and revenue spending."
And despite warning of a tax bombshell under Labour, Hammond repeatedly refused to rule out dropping a tax bombshell of their own.
They refused to confirm the party would maintain a 'triple lock' on increases to taxes and national insurance, insisting details of their tax and spending plans would be revealed in the manifesto.

The poster fail recalled the moment in the BBC comedy The Thick of It, where beleaguered cabinet minister Nicola Murray is maneuvered into standing in front of a poster advertising a candidate called Liam Bentley, with disastrous results.
Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Muhammad Saeed says US can 'contact me whenever it wants', after $10m reward offer
A Pakistani extremist has mocked the United States at a defiant media conference close to the military headquarters in Rawalpindi, a day after the US offered a $10m bounty for their capture.
"I am here, I am visible. America should give that reward money to me," said Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. "I will be in Lahore tomorrow. America can contact me whenever it wants to."
Analysts have said Pakistan is unlikely to arrest Saeed, founder of the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, because of their alleged links with its intelligence agency and the political danger of doing Washington's bidding in a country where anti-American sentiment is rampant.
Saeed, 61, has been accused of orchestrating the Mumbai attacks in 2008 that killed 166 people, including six American citizens. At the press conference they denied involvement in the attacks and said they had been exonerated by Pakistani courts.
"I want to tell America we will continue our peaceful struggle," they said. "Life and death is in the hands of God, not in the hands of America."
Saeed operates openly in Pakistan, giving public speeches and appearing on TV talkshows. They have used their high-profile status in recent months to lead a protest movement against US drone strikes and the resumption of Nato supplies for troops in Afghanistan sent through Pakistan. The supplies were suspended in November in retaliation for US air strikes that accidentally killed 24 Pakistani soldiers.
Earlier, the US deputy secretary of state, Thomas Nides, met Pakistan's foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, in Islamabad for talks about rebuilding the two nations' relationship. In a brief statement, Nides did not mention the bounty offer but reaffirmed America's commitment to "work through" the challenges bedeviling ties.
On Tuesday the US said it had issued the bounty for information leading to Saeed's arrest and conviction in response to their increasingly brazen appearances. It also offered up to $2m for Saeed's brother-in-law and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy, Hafiz Abdul Rahman Makki.
The rewards marked a shift in the longstanding US calculation that going after the leadership of an organisation used as a proxy by the Pakistani military against India would cause too much friction.
The US may hope the bounty will force Pakistan to curb Saeed's activities, even if it is not willing to arrest him. But Saeed's press conference offered an indication that was unlikely, and the bounty may even help them by boosting their visibility.
Pakistan kept Saeed under house arrest for several months after the Mumbai attacks but released them after they challenged their detention in court. It has also resisted Indian demands to do more, saying there is not sufficient evidence.
Brooks Weisblat of DragTimes took to YouTube to describe a recent incident involving a thief who broke into their famed Mutli-coat Red Model S – not once, but twice, and in consecutive order. All of it was caught on dash cam.
We're often seeing video of Weisblat pitting their Tesla against some of the world's quickest exotics in a drag race. He's the same guy that brought us the vs Hers match which saw their Model S go heads up against their wife's Ludicrous enabled Model X in a 1/4 mile showdown. But this time around we're not seeing footage from the drag strip. Rather, Weisblat takes us through their BlackVue dash cam video showing a thief making their way around the Model S before smashing out its windows and stealing belongings from the back of the car.
The theft resulted in $2193.70 worth of body damage plus the price of an iPad and drone, both of which were stolen from the vehicle. The items would ultimately be returned to Weisblat after police were able to make an arrest of the thief. According to Wiesblat, the high definition HD camera found on the BlackVue was able to capture the license plate number of the thief's vehicle, but also details down to tattoo markings on the person's skin.
See what Weisblat had to say about the incident in their video below.

) – Some pro-choice students think it's morally acceptable to kill a child after birth up to the age of five, according to a Christian group that that does pro-life counseling on college campuses.
“I would say we run into at least one [at] every campus that we go to, and we go to approximately four campuses, or we do four days of college outreach a week,” said Kristina Garza, director of campus outreach for the California-based Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust.
“And I would say at least one, sometimes more than one student per campus will admit that they think it's okay to kill a child after they've been born.”
Some students even maintain it's okay to kill a child under the age of five, they told CNSNews.com.
“Since their requirements for personhood are completely arbitrary, they throw around numbers, you know, four years old, five years old. I had one friend say a college professor claimed six years old was a good cut-off,” they added.
CNSNews.com asked Garza what religious, philosophical or ethical grounds students use to defend “after-birth abortion”.
“Usually it's utilitarian,” they replied. “They say that this child can't fend for itself, or the child's not self-aware, therefore it's not fully human. Or they'll say it's human, but the child is not a person because it's not self-aware or can't survive on its own. They use arbitrary characteristics to discredit the humanity of the child before birth, and then use those same characteristics to discredit the humanity of the child after birth.”
CNSNews.com asked Garza whether they believe students think that “after-birth abortion” is morally acceptable because they've been taught so by their professors, or because it's a logical extension of the prevailing abortion mentality.
“Well, I think both,” they replied.
“I think we're increasingly seeing that people are reading modern ethicist influences like Peter Singer as part of required reading, so they're kind of accepting these very, very liberal ideologies because they're being asked to read them in their courses.
“But I think as well, students are seeing that our society, or at least part of our society, is telling them that abortion on demand for any reason is a woman's right. And so they get this idea that a woman's right and a choice are more valuable than anything.
“And if you have a choice to have an abortion up to nine months [that] is ethical, then of course having an abortion after nine months' gestation must be ethical because a person should have the choice to do whatever they want. So I think it's an over-generalization of the abortion-on-demand-without-apology mentality.”
In February 2012, The Journal of Medical Ethics published a controversial article entitled “After birth abortion, why should the baby live?” by Australian philosophers Francesca Minerva and Alberto Giubilini that argued that “when circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible,” even for “non-medical reasons”.
The authors pointed out that they used the term “after-birth abortion” instead of “infanticide” because they wanted to “emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus… rather than to that of a child. Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be.”
“Since non-persons have no moral rights to life,” they concluded, “there are no reasons for banning after-birth abortions,” adding that “we do not put forward any claim about the moment at which after-birth abortion would no longer be permissible.”
“You may find this statement cold, but where's the flaw in its logic?” asked William Saletan in Slate.
Garza says they often encounter such utilitarian thinking during the “hundreds of conversations” their group has with college students on campus.

"Students have been told for so long that the unborn is not a human being. It's treating humans as property, as objects and not people,” they added.
“Because if the child is the property of the mother, they have the right to kill the child as they see fit and as it benefits her.”
Students are increasingly unable to argue basic concepts such as natural law and personhood, Garza pointed out.
“What we're finding in our public schools, and even a lot of our private schools, is that students are not being taught to think or read or reason critically from a young age,” they told CNSNews.com.
“We have students in high school who are not able to have a logical conversation. Students at our higher level universities – in California, that would be the University of California – are not able to think and debate. They'll come to us to talk about abortion, and they aren't even able to articulate their position.
"This is very scary for us, because we would think that students who are in the very highest universities in our state would be the most articulate," Garza added.
"But they are all thinking and saying the same thing….They just come up and repeat what the professor has told them without actually thinking about what it means.
“We've actually had professors come us and ask us for our literature because it's the most logical way to explain abortion, and they'll use it in their debate classes and speech classes and communications classes to explain to students how to put forth a logical and reasonable argument,” they said.
When speaking to students on campus, “we try to have a logical conversation, so that we're not loading our argument with emotion or guilt-tripping,” Garza explained. “We want the student to come to a logical conclusion that abortion is wrong because it kills a human being.
“So first we establish that the child is a human being, and that can be established both logically and biologically. And then we ask the student if they think it's okay to kill an innocent human being. And sometimes they will say yes. At that point, we need to realize that we cannot argue somebody into valuing human life…
“When that happens, we do politely end the conversation by telling them: ‘I don't feel safe around somebody who thinks it's okay to kill an innocent human being'. So we just walk away and tell them we're going to pray for them because ultimately, it's going to take a miracle, it's going to take the hand of God to change their heart.”
College students "have been trained to be apathetic. Sometimes we see people who have absolutely no moral grounding whatever, but most of the time we are pricking their consciences,” Garza pointed out.
More than 56 million unborn babies have been aborted since the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion. Garza's group, which is hosting an international pro-life conference in Corona, Calif. November 7 to 9, maintains that anybody born in the U.S. after the 1973 is a holocaust survivor.
“Our generation, we're the ones that are having to bear the brunt of the holocaust,” Garza told CNSNews.com. ”And we're only just now starting to see kind of the tip of the iceberg of the effect of abortion on our generation.
"We have surviving siblings, we have people whose friends have aborted, people who have had abortions in our generation. We know in a very dramatic way the reality of abortion.”
This needle-coated capsule could replace injections
NEHA KARL 4 OCT 2014

Many drugs cannot be taken orally as they get broken down in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by enzymes before they're absorbed. Until now, these drugs have had to be delivered via injection, which can be painful, and previous attempts to ‘encapsulate' them have been expensive, impractical and ultimately unsuccessful.
But there may be a better solution. Published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US have collaborated with the Massachusetts General Hospital to design an acrylic capsule that's covered with tiny stainless steel needles.
The capsule can be swallowed, and once it reaches the GI tract, the pH-sensitive coating dissolves, uncovering the small micro-needles. The drug is then released into these needles, which slowly inject it directly into the stomach lining. Thankfully, as there are no pain receptors in the GI tract, this process is painless.
The prototype has been tested on pigs, where a needle-coated capsule containing insulin - the hormone required by diabetics that regulates blood sugar levels - was administered orally. The results showed that this insulin was successfully injected into the stomach lining, small intestine, and colon, and that there were no signs of tissue damage as the capsule moved through the digestive tract.
Of particular interest was the fact the pigs' blood glucose levels decreased more rapidly after they were given insulin via the needle-coated capsule than when the drug was administered via subcutaneous injection, suggesting this new method may actually be more effective.
“The kinetics are much better, and much faster-onset, than those seen with traditional under-the-skin administration,” said Giovanni Traverso, one of the lead researchers of the study, in a press release.
The team predict that this revolutionary form of drug delivery will be beneficial for vaccines, as well as antibodies required in cancer treatments and other autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease.
“For molecules that are particularly difficult to absorb, this would be a way of actually administering them at much higher efficiency,” said Traverso.
The next step is to refine the capsule so that it is made of a degradable polymer that can naturally release its drug alongside the contractions of the digestive tract.
This new method of drug delivery can potentially redefine the face of immunisation and other needle-administered practises. The real question is, will people feel more comfortable with many small needles inside of them, as opposed to one large one outside of them?

They killed their three daughters without a trace of regret or remorse. But would do anything, say anything, to give their murderous son a quicker springboard beyond prison walls. Thirteen-year-old Geeti. Seventeen-year-old Sahar. Nineteen-year-old Zainab. And the first wife in a polygamous Afghan marriage, Rona Amir Mohammad, 58. Their lives were worth nothing when measured against the dishonour they'd brought upon the family. Their crime: violating a strict code of behavior — removing the hijab, consorting with boys, disregarding curfew, pining to be Canadian teenagers. For Rona, the barren wife, having sympathy for the girls, resenting their alienation within the household, spurring the wrath of the woman who'd usurped them

Drowned in the Rideau Canal by Mohammad, Tooba and Hamed Shafia, for which all received life sentences in 2012, with no parole eligibility for 25 years. “Even if they come back to life a hundred times, if I have cleaver in my hand, I will cut (them) in pieces,” Mohammad Shafia said on a police tap three weeks after the murders. In another recorded conversation with their wife and son: “Let's leave our destiny to God and may God never make me, you or your mother honourless. I don't accept this dishonour.”

But Hamed, the eldest son — an abusive sibling, a lying and scheming henchman in the murder plot, watching (at least) as their sisters and “aunt” were likely rendered unconscious, then placed in a car that was pushed into the canal outside Kingston — they were their parents' pride and precious scion, groomed from birth as hereditary patriarch. Birth when? That is the question and that is the substance of an application seeking leave to appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada. You'd think a mother would know when their children were born, most especially the first of the brood. At trial, Tooba Mohammad Yahya never disputed that Hamed came into the world on December 31, 1990, in Afghanistan. Hamed's lawyer raised no issue about the defendant's age. So Hamed — 18 when the crimes were committed — was tried and sentenced as an adult. This is Canada, however, where details matter, regardless of how spurious the claims. And the notorious Shafias now assert that Hamed was actually born December 31, 1991, buttressing their “fresh evidence” submission with documents of dubious provenance, provided by a former employee of the family in Afghanistan, who just happened to discover a “Tazkira” — an Afghan identity document issued in 1995, recording Hamed's birth date as December 31, 1991. This same employee, nowhere identified, thereafter obtained from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health a “Certificate of Live Birth,” allegedly premised on a check of hospital records — in a country which admits to haphazard and largely unverifiable birth records, particularly from its decades of civil war.
Those documents, along with a form issued by the Ministry of Interior Affairs translating the Tazkira and confirming its information, were examined by the Afghanistan Embassy in Ottawa. A formal letter from the embassy states: “Taken together, the three documents we have reviewed . . . would constitute sufficient proof of identity, and of proof of a birthdate of December 31, 1991. . . Given that documentation systems in Afghanistan are not as sophisticated as those in Canada, and in particular were less sophisticated in the early 1990s, it would be difficult, if not impossible for most citizens of Afghanistan to obtain more reliable proof of their identity using Government of Afghanistan documents. If an individual were to present themselves at our Embassy with these three documents, we would issue them an Afghan passport bearing the date of birth of December 31, 1991.” With automatic right of appeal for their sentences, this fresh evidence was submitted in a pre-hearing at the Ontario Court of Appeal — and rejected. The Crown pointed out that two passports had been issued to Hamed in 1996 and 2006, indicating they were born in 1990.

While unanimously turning down the jumbo-sized appeal of all four convictions on various submissions last November, the appellate court also specifically found no reason to allow the fresh evidence on Hamed's age. “When the deceased were killed, Hamed was not a ‘young person,'” Justice David Watt wrote. “He was an adult, properly joined with their parents in a joint trial.” And that's what the new appeal, filed this week with the highest court in the land, uses as a launch pad. One more time ‘round the legal mulberry bush. Not that Hamed Shafia didn't do it — that train has left the station. But that they should have been sentenced as a minor, though even if 17, the prosecution could have applied for Hamed to be tried as an adult. In requesting leave to appeal, Hamed's lawyers maintain that the Ontario Court of Appeal failed to apply the standard test — known as the Palmer test — for admitting fresh evidence. “The Palmer test for the admission of fresh evidence has been the controlling authority for a generation,” Hamed's lawyers argue. “If it had been applied by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in this case, the evidence would have been admitted.” Essentially, the memorandum of argument implies Watt was making it up — reinventing the Palmer test, holding it to a “stringent standard” — to fit a rejection, by asserting fresh evidence must be “compelling,” as distinct from “credible,” thereby ignoring precedents set by appellate courts elsewhere in Canada. “Both the B.C. Court of Appeal and the Manitoba Court of Appeal have held that Palmer is applicable in precisely these circumstances. The logic is simple: the fact of age is an essential component of the court's jurisdiction. Once the accused has discharged a tactical burden of adducing some evidence of age, the Crown must prove it, like any element of jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt.” What does this mean in practice? An adult convicted of first-degree murder faces life without parole for 25 years. A young offender — a 17-year-old Hamed Shafia — even sentenced as an adult, faces a maximum of life without parole eligibility for 10 years. In that circumstance, Hamed Shafia, convicted of four first-degree murders, could walk out of prison in five years. When he'd be 31. Or 32.

It's like a dream world for children obsessed with toy cars—and scientists obsessed with auto inventions.
On July 20, the University of Michigan opened a $10 million, 32-acre vehicle testing lab called Mcity to allow researchers, carmakers and technologists to tinker with environment-connected and self-driving cars in a simulated real-world environment.
Mcity, located at the University of Michigan's North Campus Research Complex in Ann Arbor, is equipped with sidewalks, a downtown Main Street, roundabouts, traffic lights, parking meters, and even a stretch of highway—all built to a life-sized scale. The area is also wired with networked sensors to collect data as cars roam through the lab.
Michigan Mobility Transformation Center Real enough.
Some road signs are even defaced by graffiti, and lane markings occasionally look old and faded, in stark contrast with the lab's vision for test cars.
Peter Sweatman, director of the Michigan Mobility Transformation Center (MTC), says that testing will focus on self-driving cars and technologies that allow cars to communicate with other vehicles and local infrastructure.
Mcity has adjustable lane sizes to see how widening and narrowing lanes will effect the performance of driverless cars. One of its longest roads runs perfectly from north to south, which should help test the accuracy of GPS systems. Traffic lights can be changed at random and even in non-sensical ways to help stress-test an autonomous vehicle's abilities to cope with changes in the environment.
Mcity plans to test environment-connected vehicles at its center, and then deploy 9,000 of these connected vehicles in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Afterward, the MTC will work with the US Department of Transportation to release 20,000 connected vehicles into the real world of southeast Michigan. The ultimate goal of the project, Sweatman says, is to move past environment-connected cars and implement a system of fully-automated cars in Ann Arbor by 2021.
Michigan Mobility Transformation Center Map of Mcity.
Sweatman has a Field of Dreams philosophy about the lab, believing that ”all of the main players in the [futuristic car] ecosystem” will come to use the facility.
At Mcity's opening event on July 20, car companies and tech firms eagerly showed off their latest gizmos in the faux metropolis. According to arstechnica, Honda and Qualcomm demoed a system that communicated between cars and pedestrians' cell phones to alert drivers of pedestrians in their path and engage automatic braking where appropriate.
At the event, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder praised Mcity, which was funded by Michigan's department of transportation and other corporate sponsors, for re-establishing Michigan as the automotive industry's innovation hub. Senator Gary Peters said Michigan, not Silicon Valley, should be leading the world in auto technology.
Get ready for Markham U. In a highly anticipated move, the province announced a plan for the creation of a new York University campus in Markham Wednesday in partnership with Seneca College.
Speaking at the press conference on Wednesday, Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti said that there are currently 60,000 18-21 year-olds in the region, a number that is expected to grow to 71,000 in the next decade. ( KEITH BEATY / TORONTO STAR ) The proposed York University-Markham Centre is slated to accomodate 4,000 students. ( ILLUSTRATION )
Markham's proposal to build a state-of-the-art university campus for 4,000 students near Highway 407, between Kennedy Rd. and Warden Ave. received top marks from an evaluation panel, and had widespread support from the community and York Region. “Until this morning, York Region was North America's largest municipality without a university,” said Wayne Emmerson, chairperson and CEO of the York Region. The province said “funding details will be finalized following a full review of procurement options and estimated costs.” York Region is expected to put forward $25 million to the university, with the city of Markham donating two hectares (five acres) of land in downtown Markham for the project.

“We have one of the most diverse communities from all of Canada . . . people have come from every country in the world, and education for their kids is a priority,” a beaming Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti told a news conference Wednesday. Provincial officials said the new university/college partnership is a response to the rapid demographic growth in the area, particularly of the university-aged population. Scarpitti said there are currently 60,000 18- to 21-year-olds in the region, a number that is expected to grow to 71,000 in the next decade. In a news release, York University said it will now begin working on a detailed planning and implementation phase for the new campus, and will make use of the city's accessibility to transit, major employers and the Markham Pan Am Centre. In March 2014, the province released a competitive call for proposals to universities for new projects where future demand would be strong and there were accessibility gaps. The province received 13 submissions, and a panel of deputy ministers unanimously chose the Markham bid, said Reza Moridi, minister of training, colleges and universities.
“A lot of municipalities are eager to have a university, and I see that as a good thing,” said Moridi. They said they personally called all the universities on Tuesday to give them the news, and offered them a chance to meet with ministry staff for further clarification on why they were not selected. The City of Barrie had put forward two bids, one from Sudbury-based Laurentian University and one from Lakehead and Georgian College.

“That access problem is not being fixed for students in Barrie,” said Laurentian chief of staff Chris Mercer, who says 88 per cent of students has to leave Barrie to get access to university. “Was there really an access problem in Markham?” Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo also expressed “profound disappointment for the university and for the community partners with whom we have worked very hard over the past seven years,” said Max Blouw, president and vice-chancellor. The university had proposed a 60-hectare university campus situated within a 162-hectare Milton Education Village, adjacent to the protected Niagara Escarpment greenbelt. They still may have a chance. In the spring 2016, the province will issue a new call for proposals for a post-secondary facility, targeted specifically to Peel and Halton regions, which follow York Region as the province's fastest-growing areas.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA — A man accused of shooting one woman and seriously injuring another in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood in a dispute over a traffic collision in 2013 was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, assault and weapons charges today.
A jury returned the verdict this afternoon against Michael Sione Green, 26, of San Mateo, for the Nov. 17, 2013, shooting that killed Sacramento resident Melquiesha Warren.
The shooting occurred in a parking lot near Sixth and Jessie Streets around 2:10 a.m. when Warren and their group of friends is leaving a nearby nightclub.
As they were saying goodbye they got into an accident in the parking lot. Warren was attempting to speak with an angry woman at the scene when a man, later identified as Green, shot them and the other woman in them

Much of the attention around pending Patriots free agent has been paid to Wes Welker, Aqib Talib and Sebastian Vollmer, three of the team's critical starters. But the Patriots have a number of other free agents who could hit the open market one week from tomorrow, and we'll use this space to review them and recap their 2012 season.
Julian Edelman had 21 catches for 235 yards and three touchdowns in an injury-shortened 2012 season. Greg M. Cooper/USA TODAY Sports
Player: Julian Edelman
Position: Wide receiver/punt returner
Key 2012 stats: 21 catches, 235 yards, 3 TD's; 17 punt returns, 15.5 avg, 1 TD
Playing time (offense): 299 of 1,240 snaps (24.1 percent)
2012 season recap: There was a point early in the season when it appeared that Edelman was set to play a large role within the Patriots offense, as they were taking snaps from Wes Welker as one of the Patriots' top two receivers. A Week 3 hand injury put Edelman on the sideline for a few games, and by the time they returned Welker had settled back into a full-time role that wasn't going to be reduced. Edelman had a sensational training camp, is an elite open-field runner and is the only player in the NFL to return at least one punt for a touchdown in each of the past three seasons. They finished the season on injured reserve after breaking their foot, and durability has been an issue for them in four seasons. He's considered one of the hardest workers on the team and has come a long way in four seasons.
Outlook: Bringing Edelman back would give the Patriots their top punt returner and a developing receiving option. If Welker is not back and Edelman is re-signed, he'd likely absorb some of the slot responsibilities that Welker has held because of their open-field running ability. He's a valuable core special teams player as well, which could make them an attractive free agent on the open market. If Welker is re-signed, Edelman may be inclined to look for an opportunity to be a full-time starter with a receiver-needy team elsewhere.
Projection: Re-signed by the Patriots for 3 years, $10 million. It was just last offseason that the Patriots secured Brandon Lloyd for three years and $12 million, and while Edelman has the edge on Lloyd in terms of youth and versatility, they have less of a track record of production. Receiver is a position of need this offseason, and if Edelman stays on their arc of improvement, he'll emerge as a dependable target for Tom Brady.
Nearly two thirds of British Columbians are opposed to the $6.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline and the tankers it will bring to the northern coast, according to a poll commissioned by environmental groups.
Conducted between Jan. 13-19, the Justason Market Intelligence poll of 600 people also found that 64 per cent (the same number that are opposed) believe the project will definitely or probably be built. The margin of error of the combined telephone and online poll is plus or minus four per cent.
The survey showed that 92 per cent were aware of the project, which will carry diluted bitumen from the Alberta oilsands to Kitimat for transport by tanker overseas to open up Asian markets.
The poll was commissioned by the Dogwood Initiative, ForestEthics Advocacy, Northwest Institute for Bioregional Research and West Coast Environmental Law.
The Enbridge pipeline project received approval last month from a joint panel federal review of the National Energy Board and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.
Several First Nations and environmental groups have already launched court action against the panel decision.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government has until the middle of this year to grant approval.
The findings showed that four times as many of those surveyed “strongly” oppose the project (50 per cent) than who “strongly” support the project (12 per cent). Another 17 per cent somewhat support the project.
The majority-opposition finding is not an unusual for a poll commissioned by environmental groups, which generally highlight in their questions the introduction of supertankers and the possibility of oil spills.
Dogwood Initiative executive director Will Horter said opposition is always stronger in polls when tankers are mentioned as part of the Northern Gateway project.
“People have very strong concerns about oil pipelines, but have deep, deep concerns about the oil tankers,” said Horter.
Business and industry-commissioned polls, which tend to highlight the economic benefits of Northern Gateway, usually find higher support for the project.
A B.C. Chamber of Commerce-commissioned poll released in December found nearly 50 per cent support for Northern Gateway.
The Justason poll also found that 51 per cent distrust the joint review panel process, while 32 per cent trusted it.
If Premier Christy Clark's five conditions for supporting heavy oil being transported through B.C. are met, 49 per cent said they would be a lot or a little bit more supportive of the project.
The B.C. Chamber poll had found that should the project meet the five conditions, support increased to 63 per cent.
Clark's conditions include the passing of an environmental review, creating world-leading marine and land spill prevention and recovery systems, addressing First Nations' rights and receiving a fair share of economic benefits.

Lawyers for a former State Department staffer who worked on Hillary Clinton's private email server told a federal court Wednesday that they will invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and decline to answer questions at their June 6 deposition in a civil public records lawsuit in Washington.
Bryan Pagliano worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign before setting up a server for them in their New York home in 2009 during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state.
Their deposition is set in a lawsuit over public records brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal watchdog group, regarding its May 2013 request for information about the employment arrangement of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide.
Pagliano last summer similarly declined to appear before a House panel investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. In refusing to appear then, Pagliano's lawyers cited an ongoing FBI inquiry into the security of Clinton's email system, and quoted a Supreme Court ruling described the Fifth Amendment as protecting “innocent men . . . ‘who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.' ”
The Justice Department has since granted Pagliano immunity as part of the criminal investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information, The Washington Post reported in March.
The Inspector General's office said on May 25 that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email account was “not an appropriate method” for preserving those emails. (Peter Stevenson,Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)
On Wednesday, Pagliano's lawyers said they will decline to testify in the Judicial Watch case and asked that U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District order that no video of the deposition be recorded “given the constitutional implications, the absence of any proper purpose . . . and the considerable risk of abuse.”
“Mr. Pagliano is a nonparty caught up in a lawsuit with an undisputed political agenda,” Connor Mullin wrote in a court filing that also raised the concern that Pagliano's constitutionally protected statements might be manipulated into “soundbites” for attack ads.
An existing court order seals video records, but while that “reduces the risk of dissemination,” Mullin said, “Judicial Watch may move to unseal the materials at any time. Furthermore, in the event of a leak or data breach at the court reporting company, Mr. Pagliano would be hardpressed to prevent further dissemination and republication of the video.”
Judicial Watch said it will oppose the request not to record video in a filing due Thursday, the group's president, Tom Fitton, said. “We think it's important for Judge Sullivan to assess Mr. Pagliano's demeanor,” Fitton said in an interview Wednesday. “It's always important to assess credibility when the Fifth Amendment privilege is invoked.”
The dispute over Pagliano's deposition is the latest in a running exchange between current and former Clinton and State Department aides and Judicial Watch, and comes a week after the State Department inspector general sharply criticized Clinton's email practices, saying they were unauthorized and presented a security risk.
[State Dept. inspector general report sharply criticizes Clinton's email practices]
Sullivan last month allowed Judicial Watch to depose a half-dozen officials by the end of June — including members of Clinton's inner circle who did not meet with the inspector general's office — to determine whether the department intentionally thwarted federal open-records laws, known as Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rules, by allowing Clinton's use of a private email server throughout their tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
On Friday, former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl D. Mills appeared for a six-hour-plus deposition. Asked if they had any reason to believe Clinton used the server because Clinton or anyone else at the department sought to avoid FOIA, Mills said ““absolutely not,” the deposition transcript shows. Mills also said they did not know or could not recall many specifics, and declined to answer other questions because they were outside the scope of the case at hand or because they said they represented Clinton after they left office and invoked attorney-client privilege.
Mills said they spoke with Pagliano after Clinton had left office, transcript shows.
Mills expressed regret that they did not think about how the State Department would retain records of Clinton's emails to non-State Department or nongovernment addresses, according to the deposition.
“I don't recall having discussions about how someone might access their e-mail apart from what was already in the State Department system. So I don't — I wish I did,” Mills said, according to the transcript, which was released by Judicial Watch. “I wish I had thought about the fact that someone could be nongovernment, non — non-State and — and those records might be not being captured. I didn't think about that.”
While researching Imbibe!, Wondrich had been intrigued by Thomas's frequent mentions of punch—spirits mixed with citrus juice and other flavorings. Wondrich suspected that such drinks represented a British precursor to the modern American cocktail. They investigated for their next book, Punch: The Delights and Dangers of the Flowing Bowl, due out this fall, and their suspicions were confirmed. “As far as I can tell,” they said, “the British pretty much invented mixology with spirits when they came up with punch.”
In particular, Wondrich now singles out James Ashley, who ran a famous punch house in London from 1731 to 1776, as “the world's first celebrity mixologist.” Ashley refined the idea of mixed drinks with spirits, even serving their concoctions in smaller, individually mixed cups rather than big bowls. Wondrich found further accounts, from around the same time, of other bartenders in England serving up proto-cocktails like sweetened gin mixed with bitters.
Hix is attracting considerable attention for its revival of these drinks, which accompany its oddly trendy adaptations of ancient English fare, like pollack fingers on mushy peas. Nick Strangeway, a noted London compounder of cocktails, was given a mandate to serve up something in period and authentic, and not to coddle the taste buds of Hix's customers. Among the drinks they revived was the Lamb's Wool, which dates to the 1640s and involves heated beer and fruit purees. “I didn't think anyone would buy it,” they told me. “People don't like it when you mess with their beer.” They were wrong, and it's now among the more popular drinks. I didn't order a Lamb's Wool, but very much enjoyed their shrub, made with citrus-infused rum and scalded milk served over ice. I also liked a drink called Robert Burns's Hunting Flask, made with warmed whiskey infused with currants, ginger, and citrus. These were rich and complicated drinks, and I think they could prove popular on this side of the Atlantic. Bowls of delicious punch have already made inroads into bars like Death & Co in New York and Rickhouse in San Francisco. Perhaps we'll see a wave of neo-colonial taverns staffed by toothless barmaids in mobcaps, ladling drink out of firkins. Or, possibly, not.
Wondrich insists that history doesn't need to be rewritten, merely revised: cocktails may have been invented in Britain, but they were roundly reimagined and reinvented in the United States. Americans brought to the bar a wider array of liquors and other ingredients, and started doing fine things with ice when it became commonly available. The Martini and the Manhattan came about when Americans had the freakish idea of mixing wine and spirits. And Jerry Thomas remains best known for the Blue Blazer, a Scotch drink they lit on fire and poured back and forth, still aflame, between two tankards. “Folk music became rock and roll here, and drink became more vulgar and more democratic at the same time,” Wondrich told me. “Jerry Thomas's mixology was far more brash, and with far more showmanship. It all has European roots, but the Europeans just didn't do it with that same kind of big-balled swagger.”
Which, now that I think about it, would make an excellent name for a 21st-century punch house.
PRESIDENT RECEP Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey has announced a three-month extension of the state of emergency imposed after a failed July 15 coup attempt, giving them broad powers to rule by decree. They have launched a massive crackdown against followers of the self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdoğan accuses of instigating the attempted overthrow. Mr. Gulen denies it. More than 30,000 Turkish citizens have been arrested and upward of 100,000 people accused, many without due process. On Tuesday, authorities announced that 12,800 police officers had been suspended on suspicion of being part of Mr. Gulen's network.
Journalists have been in Mr. Erdoğan's crosshairs, and their campaign is pushing into the digital universe, too. Turkey is pressing Twitter to silence journalists, and Twitter must resist more vigorously. Twitter is a powerful force for free expression. “The tweets must flow,” the company likes to say. But they don't always flow, as freedom of speech and democracy are in retreat around the globe. Mr. Erdoğan briefly banned Twitter in 2014 to block messages about a corruption scandal. After Twitter returned, Turkish authorities submitted long lists of accounts they wanted banned, but Twitter for the most part protected journalists and did not switch them off. After the coup attempt, however, new court orders were issued and Twitter was asked to hush accounts, some belonging to journalists from the newspaper Zaman, close to the Gulen movement, that was seized in March and then shuttered. Twitter has switched off a number of the accounts — by one reckoning, several dozen.
One of them belongs to journalist Mahir Zeynalov, who was deported by Turkey in 2014 for their criticism and now writes for the Huffington Post and Al Arabiya. When a court ordered their English account shut in Turkey and Twitter did so, they and others protested, and it was unblocked. But now Mr. Zeynalov has found that, at the behest of a Turkish court, Twitter has blocked their Turkish-language account inside Turkey.
Twitter says that it follows the laws of a country when it gets a “a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity.” But what happens when a law is used to silence political speech? Turkey has asked Twitter to restrict accounts more often this year than any other country in the world, according to Twitter's transparency reports; Turkey made 2,493 requests covering 14,953 accounts, and Twitter complied 23 percent of the time. Twitter ought to see that in Turkey, as in other closed societies, laws are often used to restrict freedoms rather than protect them. It should keep journalists' accounts open and not become a tool of repression for Mr. Erdoğan.
Observers and alumni of America's intelligence community have already fretted over Donald Trump's impending control of the world's most powerful spy agencies. They've worried that they could abuse their heady surveillance capabilities, turn them on their personal enemies, revamp the NSA's mass surveillance programs, and strip away domestic privacy protections once in charge. But before Trump has even taken office, he's already found a less expected way to abuse the US intelligence community: Ignore, contradict, and insult it.
Trump's relationship—or lack thereof—with US intelligence agencies isn't just a cause for political spectacle. According to national security experts and former intelligence agency staffers, it could have serious consequences that go well beyond the current dispute over Russian hacking.
The Russia Rift
On Friday, the Washington Post and New York Times reported that the CIA has confirmed that the Russian government repeatedly hacked and leaked Democratic Party documents throughout the presidential election season with the express intention of aiding Trump's campaign. That conclusion goes a significant step beyond earlier intelligence reports that had merely pinned the attacks on the Kremlin without naming its motive.
In response, the Trump transition team offered a brusque rejection of that finding: "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction," read the Trump team's statement.
That abrupt dismissal of the intelligence community's findings follows months of Trump's assertions that no one can know the source of the last year's long series of political hacks—despite a publicly released report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security stating that Vladimir Putin's state-sponsored hackers were behind those breaches. "It could be some guy in their home in New Jersey," Trump maintained in a Time interview earlier last week.
The remarks build on what may be the most troubling recent revelation of all, that Trump has declined the traditional daily intelligence briefing given to presidents and presidents-elect. Instead, they receive the briefing only about once a week. "I get it when I need it," they told Fox News Sunday. "You know, I'm, like, a smart person."
That dismissal and disregard of the intelligence agencies' fact-finding represents a disturbing potential preview of the next four years, say former members of the US intelligence community who spoke with WIRED. They worry that it threatens to politicize the intelligence community's work, pushing it toward conclusions that will please the president rather than inform him. They say the growing rift demoralizes staffers, leading to a loss of valuable talent, and that it could leave the commander-in-chief themselves dangerously ignorant of crucial world events.
Susan Hennessey, a former NSA lawyer who is now with the Brookings Institution, says that since Trump was elected, she's spoken with former colleagues who are still in the intelligence community who have been "stunned" to hear Trump's repeated rejections of their findings. "It's not outrage, although that might be under the surface," they say of their former colleagues' response. "It's real uncertainty and a sense of fear...shock, bewilderment, wondering what's going to happen next."
Playing Politics
Trump's kneejerk comparison of the Russian hacking report to the faulty intel on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction takes that dismay to another level, says one former CIA official who helped to write the president's daily briefing under both Obama and Bush. "We've never seen something like this before. It's pretty ballsy," says the former agency official, who requested anonymity because he's not authorized by their current employer to speak about political issues. "From dismissing the briefings to dismissing the current assessment on the Russia stuff, it seems like he's still in campaign mode. He's politicizing the intel, and that's a problem."
"Every administration has problems with some intelligence," says Patrick Skinner, a former CIA official under Bush and Obama who now works for the security consulting firm the Soufan Group. "But it really shouldn't be public. The open disdain Trump has shown for the agencies is unprecedented."
Trump's transition team didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment.
To be fair, Trump isn't the only skeptic of the intelligence agencies' findings. Neither the leaked CIA assessment that Kremlin hackers were motivated to help Trump nor the intelligence community's October report attributing the attacks to Russia have been backed up with published evidence. That's led Democratic members of congress Elijah Cummings and Eric Swalwell to demand a commission to independently investigate the hacking incidents. President Obama has directed intelligence agencies to conduct a renewed investigation into the attacks. And Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham joined with Democrats Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to call for a congressional investigation into the hacker intrusions, splitting with Trump and other Republican leaders who have ignored or dismissed the Russian hacking reports.
Our intelligence community has become a political football, and that's something that should never occur. Dave Aitel, former NSA staffer
In an interview on the CBS show Face the Nation Sunday, Senator McCain clarified that they don't doubt Russia was the source of the breaches of targets like the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, but still wants to better understand the motive of those attacks, and whether they targeted Republicans, too. What they don't dispute is that Russia was the source. "Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that's the subject of investigation," McCain said. "But facts are stubborn things. They did hack into this campaign."
Trump's doubt of the intelligence agencies' findings isn't the first sign that the divisiveness of the last year's presidential campaign has led to new, partisan distrust of the intelligence community's work, argues Dave Aitel, a former NSA staffer who now runs the security firm Immunity. That doubt had already surfaced with FBI director James Comey's public statements about the bureau's investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server. The Clinton campaign and Democratic leaders have criticized Comey's behavior, accusing them of influencing the electoral process by writing a letter to Congress about new emails that surfaced in that investigation just weeks ahead of election day. "Our intelligence community has become a political football, and that's something that should never occur," says Aitel. "You need to have trust, and we don't have trust."
Broader Threats
Aitel says that lack of confidence in intelligence agencies' findings and politicization of their work has left their former colleagues increasingly "jaded." And they say that problem of low morale, already sunken after public response to the revelations of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, could lead to a dangerous brain drain from key agencies. "They don't complain, they don't whine to the press, they just leave," argues Aitel. "Then you get talent shortfalls, and then you get mission failures, which are bombs blowing up in American cities."
Compounding those issues are fears that Trump will continue to ignore their own intelligence apparatus, making uninformed decisions on the world stage, says ex-CIA officer Skinner. Some members of Trump's transition team have reportedly accepted daily intelligence briefings, including their pick for defense secretary, General James Mattis, and vice-president elect Mike Pence. But a president who wields ultimate executive power without that information could be dangerous, says Skinner. "If you close your eyes, the threat is still there: North Korea still exists, ISIS still exists," says Skinner. "These things are complex. You can't counter North Korea with gut feelings."
The consequences could be as dire as you can possibly imagine. Susan Hennessey, former NSA lawyer
The rejection feeds back into the morale issue as well. "There's a firm belief in the intelligence community that the president having this information is a really important thing," says ex-NSA lawyer Hennessey. "When you have a boss essentially saying they don't believe or value your work—an outright rejection based on absolutely no evidence—there's a profound sense of uncertainty."
Beyond Trump's specific rejection of any inconvenient finding, Hennessey says it's that larger dismissal of the intelligence community that's most troubling. "If an intelligence agency produces a piece of evidence that's ignored, people can be killed," they say. "The consequences could be as dire as you can possibly imagine."

1620: Bad news everyone. The game has been called off. A real shame, this could have been a close, exciting match. Still, lets not be too downtrodden, we have seen one excellent match today, with a professional and clinical performance from the Oxford Women. We have had a great time reporting it, and I hope it hasn't been too hard for you to put up with reading it. See you at Lords. Bye for now from Ben and Jack.
1614: Inspection soon, hold your breaths…
1610: Shout out to the guys in the Oxford Portuguese society, who have tweeted the blog. People are following all over the world. Who's your favourite Portuguese cricketer? Tweet us @oxstusport with your opinions
1606: Rihanna now, its their classic “We Found Love”. The prospects for this match aren't in a hopeless place though, as the covers are being removed. It hasn't rained for a while, but it is still overcast.
1601: Holla. The ducks have gone. A sign the outfield is drying? You tell me.
1559: Cambridge on the other hand are playing football. Let's hope they're better at cricket… or not as the case may be. For those of you who are interested the mallards seem to have settled down in silly mid off. Two males and a female. Water is being swept off the pitch like tears off the face of John Terry after they stopped making Nuts.
1553: Waterfowl watch: They're still there. Oxford fielders are practising with one of those nerf contraptions. California by Phantom Planet is blaring over the PA. A personal request from Athers perhaps?
1542: Fieldy here… not sure if we're on or not for this one, it's been raining pretty steadily for a while, but there'll be an inspection from the umpires at quarter past four so stay tuned for that. The irony of the only ducks on the wicket literally being water fowl is not wasted on me, nor the hoards of cricket fans that have made it down.
1345: 3 required… we're so close now. It would take a very English collapse to lose it from here… and they run three with a big cut through third man and OXFORD WIN!!! Everyone is crying, this is a time of really intense joy. Atherton must be devastated (comment pending). Let's hope the men can follow up this with a victory of their own. A really classy batting performance from the dark blues took this out of Cambridge's hands, just 12.1 overs needed to chase down a score that was never looking very competitive. Assured performances from Stuchfield, Bath and Gough saw us over the line and some quality spin from Kashyap lit up the first innings. Shaking with joy I turn to Ben but they are gone – no doubt streaking across the outfield in a fit of unbridled, unadulterated passion. I wish I could join him, but I've got to stay for the men's. See you at three.
1343: Big dog Michael Atherton has just turned up. he'll no doubt be distraught to see the Cambridge women on the verge of losing, as an ex-Tab himself. We have fond memories of their matchsaving century against South Africa. Meanwhile, Oxford continues to tick along, requiring only 6 now, its just a hit away!
1340: Driven through the covers, lovely languid stuff from the captain Gough, and they get three for it. Bath then Drives one through the covers for four. The target is only 11 away now, you can almost smell it, and the crowd are cheering every run.
1335: 19 required now with eight wickets remaining. Apologies for my mistake earlier, we are in fact in the 10th over. Phew.
1330: Huge four pulled through sqaure leg and the Oxford score is ticking along quite nicley… but no sooner do my sturdy, manly fingers tap out those words they are given out LBW! A great showing there from Stuchfield, making a cool 31 off just 24. A matchwinning innings.
1328: A really short delivery there punished by the Oxford batsman, but a dive that would make Luis Suarez blush stops four. Good cricket.
1325: Some great running there from Oxford takes full advantage of the misfield. Into the eleventh over now at 49-1.
1323: This girl finds the gap at square leg and creams the ball over the boundary for a lovely four. Nine off the over brings the Oxford score to 40-1 at the start of the tenth over. 78 required. Are we camping? Because this is intense.
1318: Huge four there, but she's dropped on the next ball. And another hook for four means this is looking to be an expensive over for the light blues. Some really good fielding though and the damage has been limited to eight off that last over.
1317: Seven off that last over then, including the four. Some really confident batting there – she's not afraid of a bit of spin.
1315: Four more! A delicate sweep sends the ball racing to the boundary. Don't bother running.
1313: A tidy over there, with some neat fielding from Cambridge. 15-1
1308: Dropped. No one wants to see that. Well, maybe about half and seeing as it was an Oxford batsman probably most of the people here. And dropped again! More drops than Skrillex's first album.
1306: Wicket Big appeal… and it's been given. Lbw and the first wicket has fallen already. 6 off the over plus one wicket and I'm going berserk. This is why I love cricket. The bowler's style is a little unorthodox but it seems to have done the trick.
1304: Fieldy here to see you through these innings which can only be described as samba stuff as we get underway. A wide to kick off the over and some cagey batting. Who's excited? Literally tens of people who have made it down. But where are you? Get down here.
1303: The batsmen are out and the fielding team are ready. LET'S PLAY CRICKET.
1259: The story of the innings then, is that Cambridge started brightly, but soon fell away. The openers were the only two to reach double figures, with Webster scoring 1o, and Nikhila Ravi 27. The pick of the figures was Kashyap's 2 for 10, while Gough was the most economical, conceding only 8 in their four over spell, with two maidens.
1255: Second innings coming up here, with the players starting to re-emerge. Try and come on down if you can.
1250: Wicket This has been a tight final over, although I suppose that's easier when bowling to the no. 11. Still they are hitting yorker length consistently. The Cambridge innings has petered out after a bright start. They try and run a bye of the last ball, and its farcical, with the batsman left stranded, as Oxford have all the time in the world to whip the bails off. An excellent effort in the field then, and Oxford have to chase 78.
1245: Wicket Great work at Third Man, a quick throw and the keeper whips the bails off. Not even a dive can save the batsman. Cambridge is now 9 down, and will just be hoping to play out the twenty overs.
1241: Wicket Same old story, another Cambridge batsman skys one, and cover settles underneath it. If Oxford can keep Cambridge under 90, that could be the game won. We think the score is 75/8, so they have a good chance of doing that.
1240: A four is edged down to third man. Cambridge will take runs any way they come at this stage. 17 overs gone.
1238: Wicket Slapped back to the bowler, simple as you like. Cambridge is seven down,for somewhere between 70 and 80.
1236: Agonisingly close to a seventh, the ball is skied up, and slips through the hands of point. Can't be too critical, they made good ground to get there. They are ticking along here. If they get 100 it will be at least something to bowl at.
1231: “All swing, no ding” is the cry from the crowd. A leading edge drops in no-mans land, and there is some cagey running. They run one from a tuck off the hips, but Cambridge really need boundaries. The score on the scoreboard has dropped significantly, it now says Cam are 65/6, so we are not exactly sure what the score is. More updates when we get them. The rain is picking up, but they're staying out there for the moment.
1228: Wicket You bet they can. A feigned shy at the stumps brings “ooohs” from the crowd, and its clearly psyched out the bastman, as they spoon one to mid-off next ball. 69/6
1227: Another good over then. Can Oxford run through the tail and leave their batsman with as little work as possible?
1226: Wicket and no sooner had my delicate fingers typed those fateful words, when Wilson scoops one up to square leg, and is caught for a duck. Cambridge is now 69/5, and 110 is looking a long way away.
1225: Wicket a direct hit from cover sees Allison run out for 5. This brings the explosive Wilson to the crease, a hit-or miss batsman apparently.
1225: A word from Helen Webster, who says Cam are aiming for 110 or 120. Scores of schoolchildren have just turned up, hoping to see a close game.
1219: Pulled for four, lovely shot, although It's what the ball deserved. A wide slips out, and Oxford need to keep things tight. especially as Cambridge are looking to accelerate now. A push for one behind point, and another wide. the bowler comes back well as the bastman fishes and misses. The score is 59/3 after 12.
1216: More guile from Kashyap, an uppish cut drops short of point, and a thick edge behind is dropped. there are a couple of wides in there as well, but that ends an excellent spell, 2 for not many, we'll get the exact figures as soon as possible.
1212: At the other end, a reasonable over, with a wide and an LBW shout, costs 5. Kashyap will continue and bowl out now.
1210: It's Ridhi Kashyap, that bowler, absolutely lovely stuff from them
1208: Good innings that from Ravi, of 27. Cambridge will be glad to see the back of this bowler, whose name we are trying our best to find out.
1206: Wicket Big, big wicket, as Ravi departs. That was tossed up so high, would have cleared any net. It was full, and edged behind, whence the keeper hung on after a fumble. Cambridge 40/3 with two new batsmen in, and in a bit of trouble.
1205: Allison is the new batsman, but they are up against a bowler in form, mixing up the flight well and and getting some decent flight.
1204: Wicket And it is a wicket now, the pressure clearly told. Neeru Ravi, twin of the batsman at the other end, tried to clear cover, but only ended up spooning it up for an easy catch. Oxford can't rest on their laurels though, not while Nikhila Ravi is still there. There is an LBW appeal next ball, and that ends a mixed over, but a productive one for Oxford.
1204: A full toss is absolutely hammered away past fine leg, great shot. Nikhila Ravi then picks up a single to the fielder who's dropped slightly deeper. This only brings the newer batsman to the crease and she's looked scratchy…
1156: Absolutely lovely flight, great to see in a T20. Another misfield, and is that a drop? Hard to tell from here, may have been a thin edge behind. We'll have to wait for the slo-mo. A shame about that misfield, spoilt what would have been a lovely maiden.
1154: Despite the misfields, Oxford won't be too unhappy with this start. Another tight over is squeezed out, and Cambridge are 32/1 after 6.
1151: Wicket Case of the commentator's curse, as Helen Webster misses a sweep and is castled. There was some better fielding from Oxford in that over, which perhaps increased the pressure leading to a rash shot.
1150: Its a bit overcast by the way, but do come on down.
1147: Ravi is starting to look more comfortable, with a cut through point bearing fruit. The rest of the over though is on the spot, and it only ends up costing 7.
1145: This Helen Webster though, opening for Cambridge, is a treat to watch, with some wonderful driving through cover. Even their shots for no runs look classy. “Uses their bat like a paintbrush” says Jack, and he's not wrong. 8 off that Moore over, with a bit more sloppy Oxford fielding thrown in.
1143: Apparently a few of the Cambridge women have exams today, great tactical arrangements from Oxford
1140: An excellent second over though, from Gough to Ravi, costing only 1.
1138: Sloppy first over from Oxford, overthrows and misfields meaning it costs 9.
1136: Cambridge have won the toss and elected to bat
1133: Welcome to the OxStu's live coverage of Varsity T20 in the Parks
In recent weeks, congressional Democrats and White House officials have said they hope to seize on growing populism among voters in both parties to push this year for a higher federal minimum wage. They also plan to put state-level minimum wage proposals on the ballot in states with hotly contested congressional races.
“If these efforts fail, a respectable fallback position would be for the president to draw on their procurement powers,” said Christopher McCrudden, a law professor at the University of Michigan and the author of “Buying Social Justice: Equality, Government Procurement and Legal Change.” “At least that would send a powerful signal that Democrats are serious about the issue.”
Using the power of procurement policy to drive social change is not without risks and costs. Some economists say that federal agencies should base their buying decisions solely on price. Giving a leg up in federal contracting to special interest groups like blind people or Alaskan natives makes government only less cost-effective, they argue.
Steven Kelman, administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy from 1993 through 1997, added that the officials who did the government's buying often opposed special requirements put on government contractors because they increased costs to the public. The more complicated it becomes to compete for government contracts, they said, the more it favors companies that are more adept at gaming the government bureaucracy rather than providing the best product or service.
“It reduces competition and access to innovative commercial firms,” Mr. Kelman said.
Efforts to use procurement policy to affect working conditions abroad are also difficult because rules are harder to enforce and can create tensions with free trade efforts.
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said that an added difficulty was that many federal agencies did not reveal the addresses of their contractors' overseas factories, which got in the way of independent oversight. By contrast, at least five states and more than 20 cities require garment companies to reveal the location of their domestic and overseas suppliers and to submit to audits if they want to compete for public contracts.
Robert Stumberg, a contracting expert and professor at Georgetown University Law Center, added that procurement rules need not necessarily squelch competition. Federal contractors must be accountable for violating labor standards or human rights, they said. Otherwise scofflaws have a competitive advantage because they can cut costs by breaking the rules. Federal agencies essentially incentivize the illegal competition by looking the other way, they said.
“It creates a market that undermines fair competition, at home and abroad,” they said. “Law-abiding companies cannot compete with lawbreakers based on price alone.”
This is the first of a series of audio recordings of ITS communiques.
Communique one:
Communique two:
The primary reason I'm recording ITS specifically is personal. I've heard many strong opinions about ITS by those around me and as a result, I've wanted to read their communiques. Recording them is a specific way of reading that helps me engage with the text in a deeper way than my usual read-once-and-done approach. To record, I have to read it multiple times. I have to actually speak the words with my external voice, to decipher and take on the wild emotions of the text.
Reading them in this way, I've been pleased and interested by some of the themes in the communiques. Without spoiling too much, they viciously critique the Left, revolution, enlightenment ideas, city life, technology, science, civilization, anarchists, themselves. They also turn their critiques into violent action, and (in part due to being in Mexico) have been getting away with it. They actually have blood on their hands. They are still at large, active, and talking. That's exciting.
For me, their use of Nature is hit or miss, but tending towards the wild has recently been a positive development in my life, so I respect a lot of it, and thoroughly enjoy putting on their Wild persona when recording these.
Enjoy communiques #1 and #2. You can read the texts at the library: #1 #2

WASHINGTON – White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that "there should be greater enforcement" of federal laws prohibiting the use of recreational marijuana.
The comments, the first the new Trump administration has made on the issue, signal a potential conflict with the eight states that have recently legalized marijuana for recreational usage.
Under former president Barack Obama, the Department of Justice instituted a policy in 2013 stating that the federal government would not challenge states that had legalized recreational marijuana usage if those states regulated it strictly.
But Spicer said Thursday the Department of Justice will be "further looking into" the recreational use of marijuana, and directed follow-up questions to the department.
The Justice Department, however, told BuzzFeed News this week that it had "not yet addressed this issue in the new administration, or announced any changes or updates to the 2013 policy."
Asked if the department was in discussions to change the policy, spokesperson Wyn Hornbuckle said: "We'll decline to comment."
President Donald Trump said during the election campaign that they aren't a fan of legalizing marijuana for recreational use, but that they would respect states' decisions on the issue.
Tom Angell, founder of the pro-legalization group Marijuana Majority, said in a statement Thursday that Trump "reneging on their promises would be a political disaster and huge distraction from the rest of the president's agenda."
“If the administration is looking for ways to become less popular, cracking down on voter-approved marijuana laws would be a great way to do it," Angell said, pointing to a recent poll by Quinnipiac University that found that 71% of American voters would oppose the enforcement of federal marijuana laws on states that have legalized it for either medical or recreational use.
For a century, explorers and prospectors in Honduras told tales of the white ramparts of a lost city glimpsed above jungle foliage. Indigenous stories speak of a “white house” where Indians took refuge from Spanish conquistadores.
While the notion of a fabulous White City or a “Lost City of the Monkey God” buried in the jungle remains the stuff of legend, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez paid a visit Tuesday to a real and recently discovered lost city—complete with earthen pyramids, plazas, and a cache of stone artifacts—to participate in the excavation of the first artifact from the cache.
Archaeologists announced the discovery of the ancient community in the remote Mosquitia region in eastern Honduras last March. The stone objects, including an effigy of a “were-jaguar,” were left untouched under military protection until a second expedition could be mounted to return to conduct a carefully managed excavation. The archaeological team, led by Christopher Fisher of Colorado State University and supported by the Honduran government and a grant from the National Geographic Society, will spend a month recovering the artifacts.
“We're hoping to find out what culture was here,” says Virgilio Paredes, Director of the Honduran Institute for Anthropology and History, who is accompanying President Hernandez to the site.
During the recent Gentoo mudslinging about libav and FFmpeg, one of the contention points is the fact that FFmpeg boasts more “security fixes” than libav over time. Any security conscious developer would know that assessing the general reliability of a software requires much more than just counting CVEs — as they only get assigned when bugs are reported as security issues by somebody.
I ended up learning this first-hand. In August 2005 I was just fixing a few warnings out of xine-ui, with nothing in mind but cleaning up the build log — that patch ended up in Gentoo, but no new release was made for xine-ui itself. Come April of 2006 and a security researcher marked them as a security issue — we were already covered, for the most part, but other distros weren't. The bug was fixed upstream, but not released, simply because nobody considered them security issues up to that point. My lesson was that issues that might lead to security problems are always better looked at from a security expert — that's why I originally started working with ocert for verifying issues within xine.
So which kind of issues are considered security issues? In this case the problem was a format string — this is obvious, as it can theoretically allow, under given conditions, to write to arbitrary memory. The same is true for buffer overflows obviously. But what about unbound reads, which in my experience form the vast majority of crashes out there? I would say that there are two widely different problems with them, which can be categorized as security issues: information disclosure (if the attacker can decide where to read and can get useful information out of said read — such as the current base address for the executable or libraries of the process, which can be used later), and good old crashes — which for security purposes are called DoS: Denial of Service.
Not all DoS are crashes, not all crashes are DoS, though! In particular, you can DoS an app without having it crashing, but rather deadlocking, or otherwise exhausting all one scarce resource — this is the preferred method for DoS on servers; indeed this is the way the Slowloris attack for Apache worked: it used all the connection handlers and caused the server to not answer legitimate clients; a crash would be much easier to identify and recover from, which is why DoS on servers are rarely full-blown crashes. Crashes cannot realistically be called DoS when they are user-initiated without a third party intervening. It might sound silly, and remind of an old joke – “Doctor, doctor, if I do this it hurts!” ”Stop doing that, then!” – but it's the case: if going to the app's preferences and clicking something causes the app to crash, then there's a bug which is a crash but is not a DoS.
This brings us to one of the biggest problem with calling something a DoS: it might be a DoS in one use-case, and not in another — let's use libav as an example. It's easy to argue that any crash in the libraries for decoding a stream as a DoS, as it's common to download a file, and try to play it; said file is the element in the equation that comes from a possible attacker, and anything that can happen due to its decode is a security risk. Is it possible to argue that a crash in an encoding path is a DoS? Well, from a client's perspective, it's not common to — it's still very possible that an attacker can trick you into downloading a file and re-encoding it, but it's less common a situation, and in my experience, most of the encoding-related crashes are triggered only with a given subset of parameters, which makes it more difficult for an attacker to exploit than a decoder-side DoS. If the crash only happens when using avconv , also, it's hard to declare it a DoS taking into consideration that at most, it should crash the encoding process, and that's about it.
Let's now turn the table, and instead of being the average user downloading movies from The Pirate Bay, we're a video streaming service, such as YouTube, Vimeo or the like — but without the right expertise, which means that a DoS on your application is actually a big deal. In this situation, assuming your users control the streams that get encoded, you're dealing with an input source that is untrusted, which means that you're vulnerable to both crashes in the decoder and in the encoder as real-world DoS attacks. As you see what earlier required explicit user interaction and was hard to consider a full-blown DoS now gets much more important.
This kind of issues is why languages like Ada were created, and why many people out there insist that higher-level languages like Java, Python and Ruby are more secure than C, thanks to the existence of exceptions for error handling, making it easier to have fail-safe conditions which should solve the problem of DoS — the fact that there are just as many security issues in software written in high-level languages as low-level shows how false that concept is nowadays. Because while it does save from some kind of crashes, it also creates issues by the increase in the sheer area of exposure: the more layers, more code is involved in execution, and that can actually increase the chance for somebody to find an issue in them.
Area of exposure is important also for software like libav: if you enable every possible format under the sun for input and output, you're enabling a whole lot of code, and you can suffer from a whole lot of vulnerabilities — if you're targeting a much more reduced audience, like for instance you're using it on a device that has to output only H.264 and Speex audio, you can easily turn everything else off, and reduce your exposure many times. You can probably see now why even when using libav or ffmpeg as backend, Chrome does not support all the input files that they support; it would just be too difficult to validate all the possible code out there, while it's feasible to validate a subset of them.
This should have established the terms on what to consider DoS and when — so how do you handle this? Well, the first problem is to identify the crashes; you can either wait for an attack to happen, and react to that, or proactively try to identify crash situations, and obviously the latter is what you should do most of the time. Unfortunately, this requires the use of many different techniques, and none yields a 100% positive result, even the combined results are rarely sufficient to argue that a piece of software is 100% safe from crashes and other possible security issues.
One obvious thing is that you just have to make sure the code is not allowing things that should not happen, like incredibly high values or negative ones. This requires manual work and analysis of code, which is usually handled through code reviews – on the topic there is a nice article by Mozilla's David Humphrey – at least for what concerns libav. But this by itself is not enough, as many times it's values that are allowed by the specs, but are not handled properly, that cause the crashes. How to deal with them? A suggestion would be to use fuzzing, which is a technique in which a program is executed receiving, as input, a file that is corrupted starting from a valid one. A few years ago, a round of FFmpeg/VLC bugs were filed after Sam Hocevar released, and started using, their zzuf tool (which should be in Portage, if you want to look at it).
Unfortunately, fuzzing, just like using particular exemplars of attacks in the wild, have one big drawback – one that we could call “zenish” – you can easily forget that you're looking at a piece of code that is crashing on invalid input, and you just go and resolve that one small issue. Do you remember the calibre security shenanigan ? It's the same thing: if you only fix the one bit that is crashing on you without looking at the whole situation, an attacker, or a security researcher, can actually just look around and spot the next piece that is going to break on you. This is the one issue that me, Luca and the others in the libav project get vocal about when we're told that we don't pay attention to security only because it takes us a little longer to come up with a (proper) fix — well, this, and the fact that most of the CVE that are marked as resolved by FFmpeg we have had no way to verify for ourselves because we weren't given access to the samples for reproducing the crashes; this changed after the last VDD for at least those coming from Google. If I'm not mistaken, at least one of them ended up with a different, complete fix rather than the partial bandaid put in by our peers at FFmpeg.
Testsuites for valid configurations and valid files are not useful to identify these problems, as those are valid files and should not cause a DoS anyway. On the other hand, just using a completely shot-in-the-dark fuzzing technique like zzuf could or could not help, depending on how much time you can pour to look at the failures. Some years ago, I read an interesting book, Fuzzing: Brute Force Vulnerability Discovery by Sutton, Greene and Amini. It was a very interesting read, although last I checked, the software they pointed to was mostly dead in the water. I should probably get back at it and see if I can find if there are new forks of that software that we can use to help to get there.
It's also important to note that it's not just a matter of causing a crash, you need to save the sample that caused the issue, and you need to make sure that it's actually crashing. Even a “all okay” result might not be actually a pass, as in some cases, a corrupted file could cause a buffer overflow that, in a standard setup, could let the software keep running — hardened, and other tools, make it nicer to deal with that kind of issues at least…

PULLMAN, Wash. – Working with African governments and building on international and local partnerships, Washington State University's Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health is developing the next strategies for the elimination of rabies as a human health threat.
In 2017 WSU and partners in the Serengeti Health Initiative have administered approximately 50,000 vaccines in East Africa and project to provide more than 120,000 by the end of the year. Since the inception of the project in 2003, Allen School researchers have administered more than one million vaccinations.
Rabies is preventable, yet it kills nearly 60,000 people worldwide every year; half of them are children.
“Rabies is the deadliest infectious disease known to man, with a case fatality rate of 100 percent,” said Dr. Guy Palmer, a WSU Regents Professor of Pathology, Jan and Jack Creighton Endowed Chair of Global Health and senior director of Global Health at WSU. “We have the ability to eliminate human rabies deaths while simultaneously protecting pets and wildlife.”
By understanding the epidemiology of the disease Allen School researchers are developing a new approach to empower communities to participate in rabies elimination. The work of WSU researchers Dr. Felix Lankester and Dr. Thumbi Mwangi are establishing rabies-free zones that will serve as a model for other regions challenged by the disease.
Global Reach
More than 99 percent of the people infected with rabies get it from the bite of an unvaccinated dog.
WSU is diligently working with the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and MSD Animal Health which supplies vaccines free of charge, as well as other international and local partners, to eliminate rabies with the goal of no human deaths by 2030.
Additionally, WSU is participating in World Rabies Day (Sept. 28), a global effort to recognize the united push to continue vaccinating as many dogs as possible and providing post-exposure treatment to bite victims to eliminate human rabies deaths.
To further build the rabies elimination program in Africa, Allen School's Mwangi serves on Kenya's National Rabies Elimination Coordination Committee that designs and oversees the government's role in systematic and progressive reduction in rabies health burden toward elimination. Much of this initiative involves training health care workers to better identify, treat and report suspected rabies cases. This community-based surveillance will result in improved data quality for future interventions. Mwangi is also designing mass dog vaccination initiatives along with public awareness campaigns about rabies and the work of other partners.
Local Support
Through the Allen School's Eliminate Rabies program, partners — including veterinary clinics around the U.S. — are aligning with the international effort because they understand the global impact of rabies and the extraordinary opportunity available to eliminate the disease in people and domestic dogs. One such partner is the Cascade Heights Veterinary Center in Seattle.
Owner, Dr. Kathleen Paulson stated, “We are excited to join the WSU Eliminate Rabies Campaign because it gives us an opportunity to help animals and humans (especially children) that are directly affected by this deadly virus. Rabies is a disease with a real possibility of elimination, and we are proud to be a part of that effort. Go Cougs!”
The Eliminate Rabies project has an initial goal to raise $10 million to catalyze its reach to other parts of Africa. Funds raised locally and globally will be used to further support a reliable vaccine bank, improve distribution and, because rabies does not respect international borders, build broader intergovernment partnerships to facilitate transboundary disease control networks.
“Logistically, we can get vaccines to the most remote parts of the world,” Palmer continued. “The Allen School is working with veterinary clinics from Seattle to Ft. Lauderdale to spread awareness and build widespread support and resources. With more resources Allen School researchers can build bigger rabies free zones reaching the people who face this risk daily. Working with our international partners and our local clinics we can eliminate this threat to human lives in our lifetime.”
A full list of veterinary clinics participating in to eliminate rabies program can be found here.
About the Eliminate Rabies project
Through the Eliminate Rabies project, $10 will vaccinate a child's dog from rabies and distemper, another major cause of mortality in young dogs. Ask your veterinarians if they are a part of this critical program.
A gift of any amount will move the effort closer to realizing a world where no child dies from canine rabies. To help, contact Christie Cotterill, WSU College of Veterinary Medicine Assistant Development Director, at cotterill@vetmed.wsu.edu or 206-219-2402.

Economic inequality and the travails of the American middle class loomed large in the past presidential election. From Donald Trump's bombastic attacks on unfair trade deals and the worsening fortunes of the Rust Belt, to Bernie Sanders' critique of crony capitalism and the disenfranchisement of the working class, the grievances of the middle class fuelled populist rage.
In the past three decades, Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area have emerged at the forefront of disruptive innovation and unequaled wealth generation. Its billionaires, the ranks filled with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, have stormed the US's rich list and usurped thrones that once took generations to build.
It isn't just billionaires being created either. The last two decades of Silicon Valley is widely considered the greatest concentration of legal wealth creation in history. The Bay Area as a whole now boasts over 387,000 high-tech jobs with an average salary standing at $144,000. San Jose and San Francisco now rank as among the wealthiest cities in the country on per capita terms, standing at $105,482 and $80,643 respectively.
Wealth and inequality in technology
However, even as the region harnesses the awesome wealth-building power of disruptive technologies, it's society is increasingly feeling the strains of growing inequality. According to a study by the California Budget Center, San Francisco ranks as the most economically unequal region in the state, with the top 1% earning 44 times the average income of the bottom 99%. Income growth has also significantly favoured the wealthy few with the top 1% in the South Bay experiencing an explosive 248.8% growth in wealth from 1989 to 2013, while the bottom 99%, only gaining 23.2%.
Undoubtedly, with living costs skyrocketing and San Francisco median home prices hovering over $1.1 million, requiring a minimum household income of $254,000 and the requisite down payment just to be able to buy the average home, roughly 90% of the population are priced out of home ownership, a critical vehicle of wealth building. What this translates to is an increasing struggle for the middle class particularly the lower skilled, to even survive at the lowest threshold in society. San Francisco and San Jose rank as second and fourth on a list of American metros with the smallest middle class, standing at 47.7% and 48.5%.
According to a study by Redpin on the American Dream, New York and San Francisco rank as the worst cities to live the American dream, consisting of a modest 1,480 square-foot home, a car, education for your two children and a comfortable standard of living. The difference between the cost of living expenditures required to live the American dream in these two cities minus the median income, came out to negative -$89,619.36 and -$36,470.40 accordingly. The study concluded that higher production cities on the coasts tended to harbour greater inequality, while the American Dream was far more attainable in inland cities where the cost of living was lower despite lacking dynamic wealth-building industries.
Fourth-generation industrialisation
As the fourth industrial revolution is revving up, accelerating the use of robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, big data and the internet of things in our daily lives, can the experience of high-tech regions such as the Bay Area provide insight as to how technology may impact society?
This is a question that is in dire need of an answer. As the election exposed the pain of deindustrialisation and the loss of entire manufacturing industries, it is also clear that trade wars and tariffs would not only do little to bring back many of those jobs, but completely misses the trends set to revolutionise the role of technology in industry and our daily lives.
A robot revolution is set to dramatically fill tasks and jobs that humans currently do, from flipping burgers to driving trucks to caring for the elderly. While it is estimated that companies who ship jobs overseas save 65% of labour costs, the savings potential of switching to a robot workforce jumps to 90%. In the next 20 years, it is estimated that 47% of American workers are at risk of losing their jobs to a robot. The size of the robot industry is expected to reach $152 billion by 2020 with an increase of productivity of above 30% in many industries, but just with fewer humans earning a wage from them.
The growth of automated vehicles is expected to destroy one of the most common jobs in the US and one that provides workers with little formal education a solidly middle class average salary of $42,500, that of the truck driver. Over 1.7 million trucking jobs are expected to be eliminated in the next decade as the technology for autonomous vehicles and increasing connectedness make the position economically obsolete.
In addition to that, there are another 1.7 million drivers of taxis, buses and delivery vehicles who have already been hurt by sharing technologies such as Uber and Lyft, but may be made obsolete altogether by the growth of robotics and automated driving.
Opportunity and despair
As we enter a future where lower-skilled jobs are increasingly difficult to come by, while opportunity is increased astronomically for those who possess the necessary knowledge base, can we use high tech regional hubs such as the Bay Area as a bellwether of the direction our society is heading towards? If so, this proposition should fill us with both great excitement and angst, as the potential for excellence has never soared so highly amidst the lurking darkness of extreme social inequality.
Opportunity will come hand in hand with loss. As the advancement of intelligent robots wipe out entire working class professions, new ones, centring upon the creation, maintenance and logistics of this new infrastructure will be created. Service jobs requiring human judgment, ingenuity and connection will continue to thrive. However, the entry barriers for individuals to earn a living wage in a world of robots would be far higher than they are now.
However, as technology may make life more competitive, it will also be used to dramatically raise efficiency in industries which may translate to far lower costs of living. From the construction of homes to the cost of deliveries, the age of robotics may significantly lower the cost of housing and consumer goods. These possibilities present the opportunities to harness technology to bring about tremendous gains in the quality of life for the average person, parallel to what we've seen in prior industrial revolutions. The transition however, will also come with growing pains as old industries are wiped out or remade.
Fourth industrial solutions
Technological innovation is a neutral variable. It can be used to greatly benefit humankind or it can also cause tremendous suffering. How we respond to the likely social changes caused by disruptive innovation will be crucial.
The availability and accessibility of education for all citizens will be crucial in giving not only displaced workers, but future generations the tools to compete effectively in a world where the barriers of entry will be significantly higher than they are now. A special emphasis on the STEM subjects would be crucial.
Additionally, marked changes are necessary to shift our education system from one geared to train workers, to one that creates entrepreneurs. A painfully large number in our society lack a keen understanding of entrepreneurship and how businesses function, while such skillsets tuned to adaptability would be critical to success in societies experiencing massive technological disruption.
Education and instilling a mindset geared towards opportunity are key. A society in a fourth industrial world possessing large populations of undereducated individuals who lack the tools to compete will inevitably face drastic social inequality and political turmoil.
Using tech cities as a bellwether, San Francisco in the past decades has witnessed increasing political tensions over housing, gentrification and class. Passionate battles have ensued over the role of tech companies such as AirBnB over housing, grumbling resentment over Google buses and gentrification, to public protests over evictions.
The percentage of Bay Area residents feeling that the region is headed in the wrong direction has jumped to 39% at the end of 2015 compared to just 29% before. This, even as the region experiences unprecedented wealth creation and robust economic growth.
From the experience of the San Francisco Bay Area, we can see that disruptive technology has the potential to create immense opportunities but also cause widespread pain when the relative living standards of a substantial portion of the population fails to keep up. The municipal governments of the region have done well in fostering environments where startups and entrepreneurs can succeed, however, have lagged in reforming antiquated regulations and policies that have impacted the cost of housing or the ease of transportation that are necessary in keeping the American Dream alive for the average citizen.
If there is one thing we can learn from the history of Silicon Valley is that innovation will bring about change at a speed and scale far greater than we can imagine. The world and how we understand it can change dramatically in the blink of an eye, and there will be winners and losers caught up in this whirlwind of transformation.
Tech cities should be regarded as the canaries in the coal mine, valuable testing grounds providing lessons to draw upon to create solutions which ensure that disruptive innovation is being harnessed to create healthy and prosperous societies that improve the lives of the majority of its citizens.

Many black people in the United States working in liberation movements have difficulty distinguishing genuine friends from genuine enemies. On one hand, they will reject and denounce approaches that have developed in other countries that take class as the key link in organizing for revolution and liberation. They reject the Soviet, Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Nepalese, Peruvian, and countless other revolutionary experiments because we ain't none of those people. Many of us see Communism, Maoism, Marxism, etc. as “foreign things”, and echo ruling class narratives about them being “dictators”, “authoritarian”, “fascists”, and God knows what else. This is silly. If Mao had been like this, the Chinese would still be governed by the fascist Nationalist Party and there could have been no victory in 1949. We should learn from whoever has told the pig, the imperialist, the enemy, and the traitor to go fuck themselves. You've got time for postmodern bullshit that has never done anything for anybody, you've got time for Gonzalo, Joma, and Azad. You've got time to watch Empire, you've got time to watch Red Ant Dream. Meanwhile, we'll hug up with and fight like hell for DeRay, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and those who have proven themselves to not have the interests of the poorest and most oppressed of our people at heart. We swallow their lines and let them lead us down blind alleys because they're black. Our analysis needs to dig deeper, and we need to realize that our liberation struggle is a class struggle. We can not just jump in and throw unconditional support behind everybody that looks like us. Who are our enemies, who are our friends? Who are we? Who lives in Ferguson, in Baltimore, in Detroit? Who goes to prison and jail for tickets, for small amounts of weed, while rich white kids walk free? Who gets shot by the police every day? Who is most at risk from food stamp cuts, from unemployment, from deportations (yes, they deport black folks too, ask our Caribbean and African brothers and sisters). Simply put, who, among our community, catches the most hell? These are the people who should be guiding and determining things. These are the people who's ideas and lines need to be in command. These are the people who need to be organized, or whose organizing efforts need to be supported. Everybody, everything, represents a specific class interest. Communists represent the interests and struggle for the dominance of the working class and the most oppressed segments of a population.
People like DeRay McKesson represent the interests of the bourgeoisie, or the ruling class, exploitative element of the black population. They are tied to the interests of the white supremacist, imperialist bourgeoisie, which is the number one exploiter of the world's people. See Jesse Jackson shaking hands with Hillary Clinton. See DeRay eating lunch with them See them all over the news every time something happens, saying we need to vote for so-and-so (knowing full well that voting has never done shit of importance for us). See DeRay on Twitter after the brother in Dallas righteously shot the pigs, saying “y'all, this is not what we're about”. Of course it's not what he's about, he's closer to a pig than to any brother of mine or yours. See them allowing themselves to be used to push everything from cell phones to potato chips. He's paid. He's a sellout. They make money. They care about themselves and themselves only.  They are fundamentally tied to the interests of the white imperialist-capitalists that rob, steal from, gentrify, and drive our communities to the breaking point. This is what the Filipino, Chinese, and Indian brothers and sisters called a “comprador”. A traitor. An enemy of their own people. Their line is the same as theirs, their interests are theirs.  They are not a true leader of our people because it was not the lowest and deepest segments of our population that put them where they are, they chose to insinuate themselves into the people's struggle to make a name for himself, build up their influence, spread their bourgeois line, and ascend to heaven. Meanwhile, the black people they claim to represent remain broke, homeless, starving, and hungry. Where is DeRay? Trying to become a second Obama (yet another black fool who has done absolutely nothing for the people, except more insidious).
What does real black leadership look like? Dig deep, listen to and question everything, every line they put out, whether it be a party, a mass organization, or an individual. Marxist-Leninist-Maoists look at everything we see, and ask “for whom”? What is the class content and class character of this statement, this organization, this person, this line? What is their relationship to the masses of our people, what does it look like? Where does it come from? Whose interests does it represent? Are they among the people frequently? Or do they work in an office all the time, or do they hit the streets? Do they oppose the people when they rise in righteous rebellion, telling them “this is not the way, do it right, go home”? Are they afraid of guns, morbidly so? If so, they're not for you. They're playing. They're petit-bourgeois/bourgeois in essence. Are they Democrats or some “new political party”, trying to get you to back such and such a candidate, or give your support to some nonsense? They're not for you. Political power does not grow from a ballot box, it grows from the barrel of a gun. This system cannot be reformed or willed away. If Martin Luther King and the mainstream civil rights movement couldn't do it, nobody can. The Urban League, NAACP, and other groups of this type are not for us. They're bought and paid for, sponsored by banks. Look to the grassroots. Look to the sisters living in the hood who've taken it upon themselves to repair houses and train for self defense against pigs and abusers in the community. Look to the young brothers and sisters doing copwatch. Look to the people doing gang intervention. Look to the people looking around abandoned buildings for missing black women and girls that the police don't give a shit about. Look to the regular people who are community minded and who are taking it upon themselves to organize for their communities. If you are a black Communist, which you should be, you should be working actively to try to get all these individuals and groups together, form mass organizations, and work together to solve problems from the grassroots. Scattered and fractured groups cannot build power, united fronts and cohesive groups doing shit in an area can. Not because it feels good, but because it is essential to build actual dual power in communities, to set up base areas that are run by the people, under revolutionary Communist, meaning Marxist-Leninist-Maoist leadership, utilizing the mass line method of leadership. You should be listening to all of those who are doing shit in the community, everyone you work and go to school with. These are where your ideas for new activities and new programs come from. Analyze them using our revolutionary theory, throw out the bullshit ideas, keep the good, sharpen and polish them up, and take them back as real ideas and programs for the community. If it's bullshit, the people won't fuck with them. If it's right, people will like it and you'll grow. You should be seriously considering armed self-defense, not because it looks cool, but because these crackers will kill you. Every armed black person is a potential people's army soldier, or militiaperson. Get a gun, learn to use it. Get many guns, teach your comrades and family how to use them. Anybody that tells you that you shouldn't want the gun is a fool. Don't fetishize the gun, and realize that the politics behind the gun are what is ultimately important. If fascists and bad elements come out to harass the community, show up and let them know that we have guns too, and that they aren't scaring anybody. Train in hand-to-hand combat. You should be working to actively make new Communists from the community, particularly from the working class. Build study groups. Enough Communists come from college campuses, we need them from the streets, because a Communist from the hood that does work there everyday is better than one from a college campus that does nothing but lay in books all day. This is how we can start to beat the opportunist thieves like DeRay, and this is how we can raise up a million armed fists that can smash this country to bits and secure for ourselves and our comrades overseas and at home a future. Shit's serious. Treat it like it is.

Hey guys, DC941 here, today with an article about my two favorite masteries introduced with the preaseason 4 patches. I tested how they work and will explain their mechanics and why they are good. At the end I'll talk about champions using them well.
The yarn of blades and spells – how the masteries work
Spell WeavingDamaging an enemy champion with an autoattack increases your spell damage by 1%, stacking up to 3 times.
This is pretty straight forward: whenever you autoattack a champion, you receive a Spell Weaving buff which can stack up to three times. The buff decays after roughly five seconds; if that happens, you lose all stacks at once. The thing with this mastery is that its giving you a 3% increase for spells – that is as much as the highest mastery in offense is giving you! It comes with a condition, but its a huge profit for an relatively early mastery point as long as your champions kit supports it well.
You can get a point here with 9 points in the offense tree, meaning the ninth point is activating Spell Weaving.
Blade WeavingDamaging an enemy champion with a spell increases your autoattack damage by 1%, stacking up to 3 times.
Quite similar to its predecessor. Damaging an enemy with a spell will give you a Blade Weaving buff which increases your autoattack damage by 1%, stacking up to three times. It too is lost after five seconds without filling the condition. It is important to note here that Blade Weaving is more liberal than Liandrys Torment with using the term “Spell Damage” – every spell damage in the game actually gives a Blade Weaving stack, while Liandrys doesn't work for some spells (Teemos “Toxic Shot” or Kog'Maws “Bio-arcane Barrage”). It is again just as good as the capstone for the offensive mastery tree for your spells.
You can get a point here with 13 points in the offense tree if you placed a point into Spell Weaving with the thirteenth point being the one activating Blade Weaving.
Another important thing to note: the increased basic attack damage is also working for magic components of an autoattack: this means that spells like Kayles Righteous Fury are empowered by Blade Weaving.
The two things I really like about this mastery pair are:
With only two consecutive points, you can almost get the effect of Havoc in addition to the capstone. Note that special damage sources like sunfire cape are still not covered by weaving though!
It creates a cool new mechanic: seeing these two buff icons pop up simply feels good, even if the impact is rather small (but not to be underestimated!).
The best weavers on the rift – champion kits using the masteries well
To use both Spell and Blade weaving well, a champion needs to use both autoattacks and spells to damage enemies. This is even more enhanced with champions utilizing low cooldowns to abuse the higher spell damage more often without the 5-second-timer running out. Another big point is having to spend 13 points into offense – champions who like to be tanky could use 21 points in the defense tree more sometimes.
The following champions are examples of “must-have” users of Spell & Blade Weaving:
Teemo is the absolute king of weaving. This is not due to them creating cozy plush-mushrooms, but due to the fact that their Toxic Shot profits from Blade and Spell Weaving more than any other spell in the game. The interesting think about this on-hit ability is the fact that every tick of their poison increases the stacks of Blade Weaving – this means that it is almost constantly at 3% damage increase for their autoattacks – which in turn increases the direct magic damage dealt by Toxic Shot. Teemo is also difficult to itemize against since they do very well as hybrid early – the autoattack buff from bladeweaving increases the AD part of their autoattacks too.This right here is synergy.
Ezreal is another great example. Their Mystic Shot stacks both masteries at once due to it applying on-hit effects – this makes it both an autoattack and a spell at the same time . It should also profit off both damage increases, granting it a 6% damage increase just trough fully stacked weaving masteries.
Riven has great damage scaling on both their abilities and their autoattacks trough them passive. This gives them a lot of synergy since they apply the increased damage quite a lot. Additionally, they have low cooldowns, which enables them to keep the buff stacked. Them Q is also a 3-in-1 spell, stacking Blade Weaving to the max while only setting one ability on cooldown.
Jax has a neat on-hit ability with low cooldown which also counts towards weaving: Empower. Due to its on-hit nature, its damage is also increased by the blade weaving buff.
Kayle has a very strong AP-scaling on every autoattack – and it is increased by both masteries too! Just like Riven, Kayle is able to stack both masteries with only their E used. It also takes them only three autoattacks to stack both masteries.
Rengar has nice base damages on low cooldown. Also, their Q is an autoattack while being an ability, too – this allows fast stacking for both masteries and also 6% damage increase for it. This is especially huge due to the massive damage their empowered Q does.
Shyvana has absolutely massive base damages which use the %-increases coming from both weaving masteries even better. They can also stack both masteries with ease since their W hits multiple times – just as their Q should give them two stacks from one buff.
Kha'Zix and Zed are not really good in stacking the buffs fast, but their passives are on-hit effects. This means that the magic damage coming from them (which is quite high) profits of Blade Weaving. As AD casters, they also autoattack a lot, which does both stack the buff and use the increased autoattack damage.
In the end, the only champions which can't really use the masteries well are casters and supports (exception: Thresh due to their on-hit damage on Flay's passive) which deal little damage with their autoattacks. They can still use spell weaving, but it is harder to utilize due to their attack speed being low and their range often being a problem. On pretty much every other champion, both masteries are worth their points – the fact that they increase the respective damage types by the same amount as Havoc makes them really great, especially since they don't require a special playstyle on most champions due to the forgiving 5-second-timer of the buffs.
Update: after further testing, I found that stacking the buffs via on-hit damage effects does not work as expected. Teemos poison for example does not give a stack with a hit instantly – only the poison tick stacks Blade Weaving! This makes it far weaker on champions like Zed, Kha'Zix, Jax and Rengar than I expected. Even Ezreal should not be as strong. Note that these special cases still profit off of both damage increases though!
Everyone knows Charlie Brown, the always suffering central character in Charles M. Schulz's comic Peanuts. Lee Mendelson, producer of the majority of the Peanuts television specials, has said of Charlie Brown that, “He was, and is, the ultimate survivor in overcoming bulliness—Lucy or otherwise.” If Charlie Brown was ever allowed to grow old enough, they probably would be driving a Mustang II, perhaps the most bullied car America has ever created.
Now meet the real Charlie Brown, a drag racer in Manchester, Michigan, and their '76 Cobra II Mustang, both regulars at nearby Milan Dragway. But other than some ribbing in their early days, nobody can bully them or the car now, especially after it rips off mid 11s at 118 mph in the quarter-mile and gets driven to the track. Lucy is way too slow to pull this football out of the way.
Photographer Mike “The Photo Guy” Yoksich frequents Milan and photographed Charlie and their Cobra II during a regular bracket race there. What you're looking at is a street-driven car that drives to the track, runs mid 11s all day, then drives home. It is also a former N/Pure Stock record holder when it reset the record from 15.40 to a 15.07 in a class that, in Charlie's words, “You weren't allowed to do anything to them back then. It still had the Motorcraft two-barrel carb on it. You were allowed fat tires and a gear and that was it. They'd go over your car with a fine-tooth comb.” That record stood for a decade by the way.
Charlie's brother bought the Cobra II brand new in 1976 and was so depressed at how slow it was (the mid '70s were a dark and gloomy time in the automotive world, as manufacturers battled fuel mileage, smog, and the influx of Japanese imports in a world that was the Technical Stone Age compared to today) that they sold it to Charlie, who has raced it ever since.
After they set the Pure Stock record in 1982, they eventually got the car down into the low 14s still in Pure Stock form, which is quicker than any Mustang II went from the factory back then. They were running 4.63:1 gears and the stock four-speed at the time, but when Milan parted ways with the IHRA that they were sanctioned under, the Pure Stock class went away so Charlie went to a four-barrel carb, which was soon followed by a shattered stock four-speed. “I destroyed the little four-speed. It wouldn't hang with redline holeshots and tires that didn't allow any spinning,” Charlie said.
Today, it still has the original 302 blocks with AFR 180cc heads, a healthy Isky cam with “high-500 lift and 300 degree duration,” T&D shaft rockers, and “an old Barry Grant 1,040-cfm carburetor” on a ported Edelbrock Victor intake. The trans is a rebuilt stock C4 with a 3,000-stall converter that Charlie can't even remember where it came from.
Charlie drives their Mustang 35 miles from home to the track, drops the exhaust system, bolts on the Mickey Thompson ET Drag slicks, and runs mid 11s. Then does it all in reverse and drives it home. No trailer, no muss, no fuss, and they take a lot of pride in that. Like we said, it has run as quick as 11.38 at 118 mph.
“A guy came up to me a little while ago and wanted to buy it. They threw so much money at me I dang near took it,” Charlie said, “But then I thought about it and realized the car has too much sentimental value to me. I'll never sell it now.” Considering they have 41 years with the car, we totally understand that logic. We wouldn't sell it either.
Marking the end of a slightly too long era that you could always have hemmed, discount suit retailer Men's Wearhouse has fired its founder and bearded public face George Zimmer, ousting them from the company they founded 40 years ago. Since the mid-1980s, Zimmer had been a comfortable, if slightly weird-around-the-crotch presence on American television, offering their sworn blood oath that you would be pleased with your slightly outdated or overstocked designer clothes, or they would commit ritualistic suicide for shaming himself. Or, as Zimmer put it, “You're gonna like the way you look. I guarantee it.”
Unfortunately, as Men's Wearhouse attempted to update its own image by bringing in designer Joseph Abboud as creative director, it decided it no longer liked the way Zimmer looked. It began angling to transition the 64-year-old to a less prominent role, and searching for a spokesperson who could better appeal to “the millennial consumer,” such as a suit stuffed with tweets and Hunger Games. (“You're gonna Instagram the way you look. NO SHIT.”) Zimmer says that, after they expressed their qualms about the direction of the company he'd built, the board chose to “silence my concerns by terminating me,” sending them out into the world with nothing but the 40,000 suits on their back. (And $2.7 million in severance pay. And another $1 million over the next four years for licensing their image. And a free tie.)

In the wake of Zimmer's departure, there are officially no guarantees in life.
Planned Parenthood has gotten a lot of press lately, but how much do you know about Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas's involvement in the local community?
Their unwavering support for abortion services has earned them a sizable, misinformed clump of protest and harassment outside of their South Austin clinic. Their stance has incited certain Texas politicians to continually come for their funding, including trying to defund their patient cancer screenings. Planned Parenthood's refusal to compromise beliefs has cost them. It's cost them a lot. It's also really hit Texans hard.
You know of PP's abortion and abortion counseling service, but do you know how much else they do? Among a wealth of available services offered at their three Austin clinics, Planned Parenthood provides free STI screenings and long-acting reversible contraception for many uninsured Travis County residents, well-woman gynecological exams, birth control, HPV vaccines, cancer screenings, pregnancy tests, vasectomies, and other services. Outside of their clinics, they offer Sex Ed to over 12,000 people across Central and North Texas to help them understand their bodies. They also give away fancy designer condoms (a lot of them).
Planned Parenthood cares, and Planned Parenthood works really hard to provide essential care to approximately 85,000 clients. But they do even more. Their volunteer-run Leadership and Advocacy Council (full disclosure: I'm on it) raises funds and reaches out to the local community at events such as Bedpost Confessions, the Women's Resource Fair, and the African-American Community Heritage Festival, Austin PRIDE, and many others. They even hired temporary staff (yours truly) and partnered with Insure Central Texas to help enroll as many folks as possible during the open enrollment for Obamacare. To be blunt, Planned Parenthood isn't just about abortion. It's about safe, convenient access to important services, even if that makes them unpopular.
That's why this year's Amplify Austin needs you to raise your voice (and money) in support of Planned Parenthood. Make the message loud and clear: Austin stands in support with Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas and their commitment to accessible, quality healthcare for Central Texans.
If cash flow is an issue, consider giving your time.

The Top 5 US Cities Every Kava Lover Should Visit
Drinking Kava has been around for thousands of years in the South Pacific. It is a sacred communal beverage that many island cultures are centered around. The practice of drinking Kava is nothing new to the US either with it being brewed and consumed regularly within Pacific Island communities over the course of the last century among other Kava enthusiasts.
Over the last decade, we have seen the consumption of Kava evolve in the US to what we refer to as the rise of the American Kava Bar. A domino effect of Kava bars opening their doors has begun as more and more people appeal to the idea of an alcohol-free social scene; A void in our communities that Kava Bars fill perfectly. "Entrepreneurs are flocking at the opportunity to be the first to bring the Kava bar concept to their city" says Matt Masifilo, inventor of the AluBall Kava Maker.
While it may be some time before a Kava bar can be found near everyone, here are the Top 5 (Continental) US cities with an emerging Kava bar scene that every Kava lover should visit.
P.S. Don't forget to pack your AluBall Kava Maker for your on the go Kava needs when visiting these amazing cities!
5. South Florida
It's only right that first up on the list is where the American Kava Bar scene all began back in 2002 at The Nakamal in Boca Raton. Before the national Kava craze started a few years ago you could find more American Kava Bars along this coastal stretch from Miami to West Palm Beach than the rest of the US combined. You won't have to worry about your Kava shell going empty here when you plan your next vacation to South Florida.
4. Brooklyn, New York
Kava is the perfect answer for those who are seeking a relaxing escape from a city that never sleeps. Although relatively new to the scene, the Kava community here are doing big things for the industry by generating a major buzz through mega media outlets. Check out Brooklyn Kava and House of Kava the next time you are in town and want to share a few shells with an awesome group of people.
3. San Francisco Bay Area
With one of the most densely populated Polynesian communities in the US located here, it is kind of surprising that the modern American Kava Bar never really took off in the San Francisco Bay area until a few short years ago. If you are touring the east bay you can check out Melo Melo Kava Bar for a soothing Kava environment. Stroll on down Divisadero St. and you will find SF Kava Lounge. Conveniently located right next to the San Francisco International Airport is Kava Bar San Bruno . They offer a more authentic Kava experience with dried Kava roots freshly pounded in shop. The perfect stop for your next layover at SFO.
2. Austin, TX
Kava exploded onto the Texas scene a few years ago when Square rut opened their doors in the city of Austin. Who would have thought this traditional brown drink from thousands of miles away would fit right into the unique culture of Austin, Texas and become a part of what makes Austin so Austin. You won't have trouble finding Kava in this city with Kava Food Trucks driving around like Kava Chameleon and ice cold bottles of Kava lemonade on shelves across the city.
1. St. Petersburg, FL
South Florida may be the birthplace of the American Kava Bar scene but St. Petersburg takes the crown for the top US city every Kava lover should visit. Besides being minutes from the beach (and an always Sunny 85 degrees outside), the Kava Bar scene in St. Petersburg, FL has adopted the true communal culture of Kava like no other. The Sunshine City of St. Pete is home to over eight Kava bars and counting. Together they combine to create a large Kava community that has the same welcoming island spirit you would find in the South Pacific. An absolute must-visit city for every Kava lover in the US.

Spring cleaning is a topic that most people don't really like to talk about. But how about if you could get your entire spring cleaning done in a single day? Wouldn't that be lovely? It sure would!
Today we are going to cover exactly this. How to spring clean in a single day if you decide not to hire a cleaning company to do the work for you.
So where do we start?
Spring Clean Supplies Checklist
The first place we need to start is the supplies checklist for your spring clean. If you want to actually be done by the end of the day and not end up dragging you spring clean over a few days then you need to be equipped with all the tools for the trade.
This is what you should buy:
All purpose cleaner
Paper towels
Microfiber cloths
Hardwood floor cleaner and/or title cleaner (depending on what's in your home)
Window and glass cleaner
Stain removal spray
Plenty of scrubbers!
Trash bags
Vinegar
Baking soda
De-greaser
Two mop buckets and a mop
Vacuum cleaner
Once you have all of this you are ready to go! Now if you fell like you have more to do and one day will not be enough you can read this spring cleaning guide on how to spring clean your home and not miss anything. But it will take a few days!
Spring Cleaning Preparation
Before you officially start the spring clean there are a few things you need to do. First up kick everyone out of the house who is not going to be cleaning with you. If you have kids get them to stay with a friend for the day.
Next is to make space. So start with normal cleaning and get your dishes cleaned, dishwasher empty, laundry done and so on. This way you don't have anything in the way for your spring clean.
The Process
Now you should be ready to start cleaning. Follow the plan below and you will be done in no time.
Blankets and other Big Items
Gather up all your blankets, rugs, pillows and any other things like this you might have and get them into the washing machine. Do this first as you will likely have a few washing loads to complete as each load ends. You will be coming back to this all day.
Lights and Fan
This next task should not be skipped and is #2 for a reason. Dust all your sealing fans and light fixtures with a microfiber cloth. It will be impossible to catch all the dust and this is why this is step #2 so you don't dirty the floor if you did this step later.
Dusting
The next step is to move on to dusting the rest of your home. Dust moves as much as you try to control it so it's best to dust before moving onto any other cleaning.
Work from top to bottom. Start with things that are high up so picture frames and the top of doors. If you have cobwebs use a long handled duster to clean them.
Then move to things like curtain rods, blinds and then bookshelves. Then move to window sills and finally all the power-points near the ground.
When it comes to bathrooms use the same process from top to bottom. It does not matter what you are cleaning. If you are cleaning in Nottingham. Or cleaning somewhere else nor does the type of property you clean matter. You need to make sure you dust everything before moving forward!
Glass
Next up is any glass like windows and mirrors. The easiest way to deal with glass is with a window cleaning spray or just make you own with watered down vinegar.
Wipe down all the windows of your home outside and in. Then get to work on the mirrors in all your bathrooms and any you might have around you home. Using the same cleaning solution your can also clean all the window sills.
If you have really dirty window sills then it's best to remove the fly screens and vacuum out all the dirt also.
Kitchen
The kitchen is a beast of its own! You could literally spend a day cleaning the kitchen if it was dirty enough. So how do you clean it quick snap so it doesn't turn in a all day ordeal? Easy, just follow the quick cleaning guide we have prepared below.
Start with the kitchen vents that generally live above your hot plate. If you don't have kitchen vents the skip over this step. Soak those kitchen vents for 10 minutes with a strong de-greaser. Also soak the hot plate grates and grills plus the over racks. You might need to rotate them if you don't have enough space in your tub.
Next is to make use of your time while they soak. Clear our the fridge. Give it a good scrub. And then put everything back in.
Wipe down all your appliances and scrub those with build up. Move everything off the counter tops and from inside your cabinets. Wipe everything down and scrub anything that is needed. Dry everything down with a towel and put everything back.
Next is to deal with the grills and racks you've been soaking. Give them a really good scrub. Before replacing them all make sure you clean the hot plate and the oven.
If you area doing your spring cleaning over two days this is a good point to stop and follow on tomorrow.
Stalin is a 2006 Telugu action drama film directed by A. R. Murugadoss. It stars Chiranjeevi and Trisha Krishnan in the lead roles with Prakash Raj, Sharada and Khushboo in supporting roles.[1] The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section.[2] It is the first South film to have breached the Rs 4-crore barrier in selling remake rights.[3] The film was later dubbed in Hindi under the same name.
The film was remade into Hindi titled, Jai Ho, directed by Sohail Khan, starring Salman Khan, Daisy Shah, and Tabu. The film released on 20 September 2006 and was declared as a Blockbuster at the box office. The film is partly inspired by the Hollywood film Pay It Forward.
Plot [ edit ]
The only mission in Stalin's (Chiranjeevi) life is to help others and make the world a better place. It turns out that they served as a Major in the Indian Army. Although a war hero, they quit the army after a rift with Lt. Col. Iqbal (Mukesh Rishi) when they transfer them to the administrative division from the battlefield as a disciplinary action. Their family includes their mother (Sharada) and sister Jhansi (Khushboo), who is not in talking terms with their mother since they got married to a Punjabi. Stalin keeps helping a physically challenged girl named Sumati write their intermediate examination, and their suicide disturbs him. The death occurs as none of the people around them extend help. Stalin plans a chain system. The theme works on a principle that everyone should help others, and in return, they should not seek a mere thanks but tell those who get the help to help three more, with a condition that those who get help from them should also demand the same. Stalin thinks that this chain will develop helping attitude among the people but finds that the chain did not work. On one occasion, they bash a rich boy who injured a beggar. This goes in chain reaction, and the rich boy employs goons to attack Stalin. As Stalin disappears from the scene, the goons take Jhansi and their friend Chitra (Trisha) into their custody. Stalin reaches the spot and hacks the hand of one goon which happens to be the henchman of an MLA (Pradeep Rawat), who is the son-in-law of Home Minister Muddu Krishnayya (Prakash Raj). Krishnayya takes it as a prestige issue and tries to eliminate Stalin but loses their son (Riyaz Khan) in the process. When the Chief Minister intervenes to bring in a patch-up, Krishnayya plans to kill them and implicate Stalin in the murder. Stalin saves the Chief Minister but gets a severe chest pain due to exertion. The reason for the chest pain is a bullet which remained in their chest, very near to their heart. Stalin sustains the bullet injury in the Kargil War, and that was why Iqbal shifted them to the administrative department. Finally, the truth prevails, and the CM returns to the hospital to visit Stalin. The "help three people" concept was their brainchild, which saved them from death in the form of a schoolgirl. Finally, the doctors successfully remove the bullet in a very delicate surgery. Stalin comes to know that their "help three people" concept worked well, and the same theme saved their lives in the form of an auto driver. They thank all the people for making their concept a success.
Cast [ edit ]
Music [ edit ]
Audio of Stalin was launched on 22 August 2006 at a jam pack auditorium of Lalitha Kala Vedika in Public Gardens, Hyderabad. Pawan Kalyan launched the audio of gave the first cassette to Nimmagadda Prasad (Matrix Labs) and Murali Krishnam Raju (MAA TV).[4] The film has six songs composed by Mani Sharma, with lyrics by Anantha Sriram, Pedada Murthy, Kadikonda & Suddala Ashok Teja.
Reception [ edit ]
Critical reception [ edit ]
The film received mixed to positive reviews. Jeevi of idlebrain.com praised the performances of Chiranjeevi and Khushboo and stated that "First half of the film is pretty mediocre as there is no conflict thread in terms of villain. Second half is better from the moment villain enters the scene. The last 20 minutes of the film stands out with very good emotions."[5] Sify.com gave it 3 on 5 stars as well and stated "The much hyped Murugadoss directed Stalin does not have Chiru as the comic book superhero in the first half.  They are basically a do-gooder for their fellow-men as they attempt to make the world a better place to live. Chiru in such a role may or may not work with the masses but in this refreshingly different role, they are cool with a capital C." Indiaglitz.com also commented "Director Murugadoss, who made us all sit up and take notice through Tagore (story) and Ghajini, once again underlines their talent for making a wholesome and powerful mass masala movie. In Chiranjeevi, they have somebody who can bring to life any kind of idea they (Murugadoss) has. Chiranjeevi, it seems, has been particular about the 'message' aspect — at their stature and seniority, they had every reason to be."[6]

Historic S.A. firehouse could become restaurant
A photo from the 1930s shows the fire station at 604 S. Alamo St.

Andrew Goodman, who owns Feast in Southtown, had the winning bid and has signed a contract to purchase old Fire Station No. 7, 604 S. Alamo St., that's been retired by the city. The spot is a prime location at the entrance to Southtown between Cesar Chavez Boulevard and Water Street across from Hemisfair Park.
The two-story 5,200-square-foot building appraised at $797,000. Goodman intends to open a restaurant that would include a bar and dining room on the first floor with an open kitchen dining area upstairs. It also has a 300-square-foot basement that likely will be used as a wine cellar.
While the plans are still preliminary, Goodman and Feast Executive Chef Stefan Bowers are considering "an old-school style Italian steakhouse in a sexy modern setting." The restaurant at the firehouse would be open for lunch during weekdays and six nights a week for dinner.
Read a review of Feast.
For Andrew Goodman, the opportunity also is sentimental.
"I was born and raised in San Antonio. It's my home. My dad and their father had a business in 300 block Water Street," they said.
If all goes as planned, Goodman will own a business two blocks from where their family's business was nearly 70 years ago. Goodman estimates the restaurant could open by early 2015.
"It's a gateway to Southtown," Goodman said. "Southtown really has become a food mecca."
Read history about Fire Station No. 7.
Goodman also is a managing partner for the restaurant inside the St. Anthony Hotel that's under renovation. That project also is slated to be complete by 2015.

Chipotle plans to close all of its stores for a few hours next month to host a company-wide meeting discussing food safety after the chain was tasked with dealing with food poisoning outbreaks last year.
Chris Arnold, a spokesperson for Chipotle, told the Oregonian the meeting is expected to take place on Feb. 8 and will involve all staff members. A wide-range of topics are going to be covered in the meeting.
“We want to thank our teams for all their hard work, to discuss some of the changes we are making to enhance food safety, to talk about the restaurants role in all of that and to answer some questions from employees,” Arnold said in an email to the paper.
The company announced Wednesday it will launch a marketing campaign in February to kick off its road to recovery after the food scares. Sales plunged 30 percent in December from the food poisoning outbreaks.
First, an E. coli outbreak came to light at the end of October, with additional cases being reported over the next several weeks. Then, in what Chipotle says was an unrelated case, a norovirus sickened dozens at a Chipotle in Boston.
Last week, the company said it was subpoenaed by federal authorities as part of a criminal investigation tied to a different norovirus outbreak in California over the summer. Lawsuits have also been filed on behalf of customers sickened after eating at the chain.
Bill Marler, a food safety lawyer in Seattle, told the Oregonian that more lawsuits are coming.
“I represent a total of 75 people, but I haven't filed all their lawsuits yet,” Marler added.
At an investment conference in Orlando, Florida on Wednesday, Chipotle executives said the company is taking measures to reduce the risk of another food scare to "near zero." They said they would start "inviting customers back" to restaurants in February with stepped-up marketing and direct mail offers. They said food safety will not be explicitly referenced in the marketing, but that there might be a "clever headline."
Chipotle Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung noted the company's recovery would be "messy," with investments in food safety and marketing eating into profit margins.
During the half-hour presentation at the ICR conference, Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells noted customers will still see food preparation in restaurants, including the grilling of steaks and steaming of rice. That sense of freshly prepared ingredients has been one of Chipotle's attractions as it has sought to distinguish itself from traditional fast-food chains.
Ells noted the company's dedication to food quality in the past, and added that they were confident the company would win back customers and emerge as a stronger company.
Executives said they expect the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to declare the E. coli outbreak to be over at some point. The agency has not identified an ingredient that was responsible for the E. coli outbreak, and Chipotle has said it may never know what was to blame.

Android posted a series of infographics on Thursday with impressive app stats to celebrate its 10 billionth download from the Android Market.
Android users from 190 countries download apps every day, according to one of the infographics. The U.S. is not the most app crazed country either — it ranked fourth behind South Korea (no. 1), Hong Kong (no. 2) and Taiwan (no. 3). Rounding out the top ten includes Singapore (no. 5), Sweden (no. 6), Israel (no. 7), Denmark (no. 8), the Netherlands (no. 9) and Norway (no. 10).
Meanwhile, the top categories for Android app downloads include games (25.6%), entertainment (12.2%), tools (11.7%), music (4.28%) and social (4.08%).
But the most interesting tidbits were associated with how Android owners use their apps. About 12 billion miles are navigated on Google Maps each year — which is equivalent to more than 37,000 trips to the moon — and 100 million words are translated every week in 200 different countries on Google Translate.
As for when most people download apps, searching through the Android Market the night before the work week starts is evidently a common activity. The most popular time to download an Android app is 9:00 p.m. on Sunday, while the least popular time to do so is just seven hours later at 4:00 a.m. Monday morning.
Other interesting Android app stats include the following:
The Royals announced their 2016 television schedule with all games either televised by Fox Sports Kansas City or a national broadcast partner.
The Royals made their first appearance on national television on opening night, kicking off the Major League season with a re-match against the New York Mets on ESPN Sunday Night Baseball on April 3. Their April 20 home game against the Tigers has been picked up for a Wednesday night broadcast on ESPN. The May 16 home game against the Boston Red Sox has also been picked up for a national broadcast.
The Royals are scheduled to make three national appearances on FOX, starting on June 4 in Cleveland against the Indians. The FOX broadcast crew will travel to Kansas City on consecutive Saturdays - on June 18, when the Royals host the Tigers, and on June 25, when they host the Astros in a re-match of last year's American League Divisional Series.
The Royals are scheduled to make five appearances on cable channel Fox Sports 1. They make their first appearance on April 21 as they host the Detroit Tigers, then appear on consecutive Saturdays in July - the 16th at the Tigers, and the 23rd at home against the Rangers. FS1 will be counting on a division race when they broadcast the Tigers at the Royals on Saturday, September 3, and the race could come down to the wire for a broadcast of the Indians at the Royals on Saturday, October 1.
The three dates left to be determined are all Sunday dates - August 28 at the Red Sox, September 4 vs. the Tigers, and September vs. the Tigers.
Fox Sports Kansas City will also air ten spring training games, beginning this Saturday evening against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Each Fox Sports Kansas City broadcast will be preceded by a 30-minute pregame show, "HyVee Royals Live" hosted by Joel Goldberg and Jeff Montgomery, and followed by the post-game "Boulevard Royals Live" show.
The Oakland Raiders played one of their better games of the season against San Diego Sunday, keeping the contest close until the final drive of a 13-6 Chargers victory.
The loss, which brings Oakland's record to 0-10, officially eliminates the Raiders from the playoffs, not that a seven-game winning streak to end the season would have made a postseason berth all that possible anyway.
The Week 11 exit is the earliest a team has been mathematically out of playoff contention since the 2004 Miami Dolphins did so after falling to a 1-9 mark.
With an interim coach, a 16-game losing streak and rumors that the team could potentially relocate back to Los Angeles, it's a particularly disheartening time to be a member of Raider Nation.
The objective for the silver and black at this point has to be to avoid being only the second team in NFL history to achieve an 0-16 season, as well as hope that rookies Derek Carr and Khalil Mack can put together some positive individual momentum heading into their second NFL seasons.
If only the Raiders played in the NFC South, they'd still technically be in the running for a division title.
Retired England spinner Graeme Swann has criticised the technique of Steven Smith and suggested the world's number one batsman holds no fear for Alastair Cook's side.
Swann, who retired midway through the 2013-14 Ashes – just as Smith was in the middle of a run of three centuries in six Tests against the Old Enemy – dismissed the right-hander three times from 22 innings.
Since the end of that Ashes campaign, Smith has taken their game to a new level, scoring six more centuries, six fifties and averaging 93.43 across 11 Tests.
Only Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara (1,679 runs in 12 matches) has managed more runs in the same period as Smith's 1,495, however Swann believes the 26-year-old has a flawed technique and their weaknesses will be exposed against a swinging ball.
Speaking with The Guardian, Swann said they were surprised at Smith's ascension to the top of the Test rankings.
“Yeah, because I didn't think they were a great player,” they said. “I still don't think he's got a great technique.
“He must have surprised himself, as well as everyone else, with their output.
“The trick for them is to try to keep that going. Whether they can, time will tell. I don't think he'll score runs at three if it's swinging.
“Weakness will emerge with Steve Smith. He's not like a Steve Waugh – a nugget with no obvious ways of getting them out. I hope for England's sake that he's a flash in the pan.
“He doesn't strike fear in you like the Aussies used to, with a Matthew Hayden or an Adam Gilchrist.”
Swann also referred to a tweet posted by cricket.com.au following Australia's series clean sweep over West Indies on Monday morning (AEST) to further reiterate their point that Smith held no fear for England's players.
“Cricket Australia put a tweet out the other day saying ‘See you soon, @englandcricket … ' with a picture of Steve Smith up close,” they said.
“Whether it's supposed to be intimidating or not … but it wasn't. Had that been 2004 and a close-up picture of Matt Hayden, opening bowlers would genuinely have been going ‘oh f-ck'.
“They'd have been losing sleep over it. But Steve Smith … they still look … Smithy.”
Smith first played cricket in England as a teenager in 2007 with a Surrey Second XI, impressing as much with their leg-spin as their batting, and returned three years later for a test debut against Pakistan.
In 2013, they played all five Ashes Tests, scoring 345 runs at 38.33, including their maiden hundred in the final match of the series - an unbeaten 138 at The Oval.
During an interview with ESPN in April, Smith said they were excited about getting another opportunity to perform in English conditions.
“From my point of view I can't wait to get over there and play another Ashes in their conditions,” they said. “After beating them so convincingly in Australia it's going to be nice to go into their backyard and if we continue to play the same way we've played over the last 12-18 months, I don't think they'll come close to us to be honest.”
Swann also suggested that one-day supremo Mitchell Starc had usurped Mitchell Johnson – who took 37 wickets in the last Ashes series – as the most dangerous player in Australia's squad.
Given Australia's glut of fast-bowling talent, Starc is not guaranteed a starting berth in the XI when the first Test gets underway at Cardiff on July 8, yet Swann insisted that, if in form, Starc would be too much for England.
“(Johnson's) not the Mitchell to worry about,” they added. “Mitchell Starc is above and beyond the best match-winning player they've got at the minute.
“Forget about the batsmen. If Mitchell Starc bowls well, I don't think England have got any hope of winning the Ashes. If they nullify them in some way, then they've got a chance.”

On November 29th there were multiple flash crashes on Bitfinex and thus people lost millions of dollars because their stop-loss orders were executed at enormously low prices, long margin positions were liquidated with negative balances and some short positions were liquidated even though price never went that high.
Users experienced “frozen” interface, they couldn't close positions and market orders were executed minutes later. Prices of some coins dropped 98% in one minute triggering massive cascade liquidations and then recovered back. Bitfinex denied any technical issues and stated that there were similar moves across all exchanges and that it won't reimburse customers for their losses.
You can read in more details how many people lost their funds here.
In this article we will follow all main events after flash crashes, to understand why the war between Bitfinex and Community started and how can we stop it.
Official explanation
Shortly after crash victims started investigating an “event” in Telegram group and found out many evidences that flash crash was caused not by a normal market move, but by technical issues like server outages, bugs, poor engine implementation, not working API or presumably a “fake” order book.
There was no official announcement on website, but many people got this canned reply to their support tickets. Let's have a look at keynotes.
Yesterday we saw similar movements across multiple markets. This was not a sudden drop in a single market, but a panic across multiple markets. In a situation like this, we have to liquidate positions.
There was indeed a panic sale across multiple markets, but most investors and analysts were ready for it.
But among all big exchanges with margin trade and stop-loss features, only Bitfinex had multiple flash crashes with 90–98% price drops, and that's exactly why investors lost their money, so we can keep “similar movements” and “panic across multiple markets” aside.
We do have protection measures to prevent flash crashes and those were precisely why the dropping markets did not drop further than they did, all the way to near 0.
Bitfinex officially admitted that they do have protection measures against flash crashes, and according to CoinDesk they have “circuit breakers” since 2015. But Bitfinex didn't admit that this mechanism totally failed.
(Or they think that 98% drop in price is fine, because it didn't touch 0.)
There was no malfunction in matching trades nor with mechanisms to slow down the drops on multiple markets. Your position was liquidated as it should be.
Bitfinex denied any technical issues despite the fact that they were under a continues heavy DDoS attack for many days and users complained about “frozen” interface and withdrawal problems.
Trading is a 0-sum game. We cannot start compensating users who trade leveraged positions and see their position liquidated. If we would soon have every user that gets liquidated request a compensation and users would start to trade at maximum leverage all the time.
First, stop-loss orders were executed enormously low regardless of using margin trade or not, so we can keep leveraging aside. Stop-loss order is an essential risk-management tool used on most markets to minimize risks.
Bitfinex added this tool to attract more users and especially professional traders, but on Bitfinex official support page there is no information that “stop order” can lead to instant loss of 98% of your funds at any given moment due to flash crash.
Secondly, Bitfinex itself heavily benefits when customers use margin trade because it massively increases daily trading volume, fees, revenue and gives a status of world's largest exchange which attracts thousands newbies every day who mistakenly assume that the biggest exchange is the most reliable one.
However, on Bitfinex official support page there is no information that margin trade with even smallest leverage (e.g. x1.5 instead of x3.33) can lead to instant lost of all funds at any given moment due to flash crash.
Third, it doesn't explain how short positions were liquidated way above market price and were backdated.
Market movements like this are part of what regularly happens in cryptocurrency markets. We do what we can to offer efficiently functioning markets but if we would interfere too much with how the markets move, we would affect price discovery and we will be accused of market manipulation.
True, flash crashes happen sometimes on small exchanges, this is why people choose big exchanges with high liquidity and enabled protection measures. Also small exchanges usually don't have margin trade or stop-losses, so people don't lose millions during flash crashes.
And don't forget that previous flash crash on a big exchange happened in June at GDAX and they did reimburse all victims for their losses.
The liquidation price displayed in the UI is not a guaranteed price a user will see their position liquidated at, but rather an indicative price of when a liquidation is triggered. Depending on the state of the orderbook, the liquidation order gets executed against bids or asks available in the orderbook at the time the liquidation order gets inserted. If orderbooks are thin, slippage is expected to occur.
This part is very interesting, because Bitfinex order book usually looks solid.
However, after such an instant price crash within 1 minute on multiple coins, people in Telegram group raised concerns if the order book's depth was real or fake, sharing screens with a very low trading volume during flash crashes.
Victims also downloaded trading history CSV files and analyzed the data.
ETP fell down from $3.42 to $0.11 in just literally 2 seconds. Does it look like “similar movements across multiple markets”? How about “protection measures to prevent flash crashes”?
In the middle of a flash crash somebody bought 12,720 ETP by ~$3. Then there were a 12 seconds pause with no trades at all, and later ETP continued falling to $0.05.
Was there a 96% price gap between bid and ask? Was API working? Protection measures? Where were all arbitrage bots? I mean seriously, 12 seconds for bots it's like 12 hours for humans.
And then after 38 seconds since flash crash began, the ETP price instantly recovered to almost the same value of $3.35. How could such a huge price gap stay for 38 seconds? And Bitfinex yet denied any technical issues.
(Previously we pointed out that TradingView didn't have data for 75 minutes when NEO flash crash happened, which can be a proof of technical issues and API problems. Later this data appeared on TV and that opened a room for accusing us in slander. Since we cannot archive Bitfinex CSV reports, please go and download CSV trading history report for NEO, ETP, OMG for November 29. If many people will have the same data, then it will be harder to accuse us in slander.)
People also pointed out that one month ago there was an article claiming that Bitfinex displays orders from other exchanges as their own, which might potentially lead to flash crashes. And one more article claiming that Bitfinex allows wash trading to increase their daily trading volume.
If both these allegations are true, then Bitfinex's order book depth and trading volume are not real and it's not a world's largest exchange at all.
We do understand that you are completely overwhelmed by what happened. And we are sorry you lost money. I wish we could bring you better news, but we cannot compensate you or any other user who sees their position liquidated in a market like we saw yesterday.
If you still think that all victims of flash crashes were newbies that over-leveraged margin positions with illiquid assets, then here is a short sum up:
There were multiple flash crashes because of technical issues and some prices lost 98% in seconds (ETP). Even a small leverage like x1.5 (instead of x3.33) will cause a liquidation of current position, or even a cascade liquidation of all other positions. You can keep margin trade aside, because people lost 90% of their money just by using stop-loss orders without any leverage. And stop loss order is an essential risk-management tool. Short positions were liquidated much higher than market price and were backdated. Users couldn't close their positions because of serious lags and market price orders were executed minutes later. NEO is not illiquid asset, it was 12th market cap coin on a world's largest exchange. GDAX reimbursed victims of flash crashes for their losses. Bitfinex provides tools like margin trade and stop loss orders to increase their daily trading volume, get more fees, higher revenue, and attract more users. But they failed to implement safe protection measures preventing flash crashes and instant loss of all money. Instead of reimbursement they hired lawyers to threaten all critics (read more about it below).
Media
After investigating canned replies from Bitfinex, all members of Telegram group felt being deceived and started taking actions. Some guys coordinated legal actions while others approached for media attention contacting different journalists, writing about flash crashes on social media platforms and gathering all victims together into one chat.
Originally there were two different groups:
People who were concerned about Bitfinex's shady Tether business and wanted them to perform an audit. People who lost money in flash crashes and just wanted to be refunded.
Here Bitfinex team made a first serious strategic mistake. They have already been under a significant pressure because of DDoS attacks and Tether scandal, so they could reimburse all victims and thus gain lots of supporters on their side and save a reputation of a largest and most reliable exchange. That could buy them some time to prepare for an audit.
But they decided to leave victims without any reimbursement. That created a very dangerous situation, because two very different groups of people started gathering together and these two forces accelerated each other.
As a result all Bitfinex's tweets and reddit posts were filled with angry comments about flash crashes, Tether, lags, withdrawal problems, and media started writing articles.

Threats
Bitfinex still had a choice to fix a conflict peacefully, but they chose another path. On December 4th, CoinDesk stated that Bitfinex has hired the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson to threaten all critics with litigations.
“To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and their associates.”
And this was a second serious strategic mistake by Bitfinex team, because they decided to go against the community and that never ended up good even for biggest players in crypto world (Mt.Gox, GHash.IO).
Also Bitfinex'ed (main Bitfinex's accuser) claimed to be under a heavy spam attack since November 30.
Community strikes back
As a result it started a typical streisand effect and community exploded with even more tweets, posts, comments and articles about legal threats, Tether, flash crashes, lags, withdrawal problems, questionable trading volume and order book.
And the storm began.
Citron Research agreed to help bloggers cover legal fees.
Community started donating money to Bitfinex'ed to defend themselves against Bitfinex's lawsuit.

DDoS attacks enlarged. Users experienced “frozen” interface, bugs, market positions were executed much later.
After DDoS attacks people got negative balances even on exchange wallets and support didn't answer for days.
Crusaders assistant coach Aaron Mauger has accepted the head coach role with their old Leicester Tigers club from the 2015/16 season.
Mauger, who will complete their third Super Rugby season as Assistant Coach with the Crusaders in 2015, played 53 games for the Leicester Tigers between 2007 and 2010 and captained the side for much of the 2008 and 2009 seasons.
They say it is a dream opportunity to return to a club that they are so fond of, in a head coach capacity.
“I have awesome memories of my time at Leicester as a player and it is a place I will very happily return to.
"I feel incredibly lucky to have the chance to do that as the head coach for the club and the timing is right for me to grab that opportunity.
"My aim is to help create the framework for Leicester to once again be amongst the top clubs in European and world rugby.
“I am loving being part of the coaching team at the Crusaders and still learning so much here, so it was not an easy decision to make. But I still have a whole Super Rugby season ahead of me to enjoy with this team, and then I know that the move to Leicester is the right thing to do for my coaching career.
"I would love to come back and coach in New Zealand long-term and I believe that this overseas experience will help me to do that and to become a better coach,” Mauger said.
Crusaders Head Coach Todd Blackadder said they were thrilled for Mauger and fully supported their decision.
“Aaron is a highly valued and much loved member of this Crusaders coaching team and we will hate to see them go. But in saying that, we all know that this is an opportunity that should not be passed up so we are 100 percent on board with Azza's decision and wish them the very best for this next stage in their coaching career.
"He is an outstanding coach and they are ready for this head coach role.”
Crusaders CEO Hamish Riach said Mauger had been a core member of the Crusaders team for a long time, as a player and then a coach, and would be sorely missed.
“Aaron has served, and continues to serve the Crusaders exceptionally well.
"He offers so much, not just as a highly-skilled coach but also as a great team man. We know they will do wonderful things with the Leicester Tigers club, and then we look forward to them bringing that invaluable experience back to New Zealand and continuing to make a huge contribution here,” Riach said.
Mauger has signed a three year contract, which will start after the 2015 Super Rugby season.
“I am hugely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here at the Crusaders to grow and develop as a coach and a person. I am fully committed to the Crusaders in 2015 and cannot wait to get that season underway,” Mauger said.

Zodiacal Lights. For two weeks beginning Monday, March 28, sky-watchers who can make it out of the city and its bright lights will get a chance to see a glow in the night sky called the Zodiacal lights.
With the waning moon dropping out of the sky by early evenings, this is the best chance for Northern Hemisphere observers to see the zodiacal lights, which are some of the most challenging nighttime lights to catch.
This ethereal glow is caused by sunlight reflecting off countless dust particles scattered along the plane of the solar system, between the planets. If you can get into the dark countryside, look for a pyramid-shaped glow—fainter than the Milky Way—rising above the western horizon after sunset.

Moon March. Before dawn on Tuesday and Wednesday, March 29 and 30, the moon will be gliding past the super-bright star-like trio of Mars, Saturn, and Antares in the constellation Scorpius in the southern sky.
First up on Tuesday, the waning gibbous moon will be parked to the upper right of golden Saturn. The two will be only four degrees apart—less than the width of your fist held at arm's length.
Train even the smallest of backyard telescopes on Saturn and you can get an eyeful of its famous rings and a few of the brightest of its 62 moons. But it turns out that these iconic jewels may have been relatively recently acquired.
Just last week a new theory from the SETI Institute and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) suggests that while the planet is about 3.5-4 billion years of age, many of its moons and majestic rings may be no older than 100 million years, around the age of the dinosaurs.
Supercomputer models show that the current arrangement of large inner moons and rings was possibly formed sometime during Earth's Cretaceous Period, 66 to 145 million years ago, by some cataclysmic event that pulverized a primordial set of moons that circled the gas giant. And it's from those remnants that many of today's moons and the entire set of rings we see today formed.

Lunar Lineup. By Wednesday morning, you will notice that the moon has slid down to the lower left of Saturn, forming a straight line-up that includes ruddy Mars to the ringed planet's right.
Just below the lineup is the 600 light-year distant orange star Antares, which takes its name from Greek meaning ‘equal to Mars' due to its similar appearance.

Sinking Orion. As springtime begins, traditional winter constellations are beginning to set in the west and fade in the bright evening twilight. So with the moon out of the night sky, Saturday, April 2, will make for a great opportunity to catch sight of the brightest winter constellation Orion, the hunter.
Orion's star-studded figure is probably the most recognizable pattern in the heavens and is easy to find even in light-polluted cities simply by identifying their belt: a straight line of three bright stars. Surrounding the stellar belt are four stars marking the shoulders and knees of the giant. This constellation is found about due west around mid-evening at this time of year.

(In 3rd paragraph, corrects median net worth to $77,300 in 2010, not $77.3 trillion, and corrects to $126,000 in 2007, not $126 trillion.)
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - Americans suffered a record decline in wealth between 2007 and 2010 as home values tumbled, according to a Federal Reserve report on Monday that underscored the severity of the recent recession.
The median family's net worth dropped 38.8 percent during the three-year period, the Fed said in its latest report on changes in U.S. Family Finances, derived from a survey of consumer finances. Fed economists told reporters that this was the biggest drop in net worth since the survey started in 1989.
The median net worth, which is the value of assets minus debt, plunged to $77,300 in 2010 from $126,400 in 2007. Net worth in 2010 was at levels last seen in 1992.
“Although declines in the values of financial assets or business were important factors for some families, the decreases in median net worth appear to have been driven most strongly by a broad collapse in house prices,” the Fed said.
The survey's findings shine a harsh light on the devastation inflicted on the economy by the 2007-09 recession and could help to explain the frustratingly slow pace of the recovery.
The housing market's collapse was at the core of the recession, during which the economy contracted nearly 5.1 percent between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, with the unemployment rate rising 4.5 percentage points to 9.5 percent.
“Housing was of greater importance than financial assets for the wealth position of most families,” the Fed said.
The survey found that the decline in median net worth was large for families in groups where housing was a larger share of assets, such as families headed by someone 35 to 44 years old and families in the West region.
“A substantial part of the declines observed in net worth over the 2007-10 period can be associated with decreases in the level of unrealized capital gains on families' assets,” the Fed said.
The share of total assets of all families attributable to unrealized capital gains from real estate, businesses, stocks, or mutual funds fell 11.6 percentage points to 24.5 percent in 2010, it said.
While the overall level of debt owed by families was unchanged, debt as a percentage of assets rose to 16.4 percent in 2010 from 14.8 percent in 2007 because the value of the underlying assets, especially housing, decreased faster.
The share of families carrying a credit card balance fell 6.7 percentage points to 39.4 percent in 2010. The median balance fell 16.1 percent to $2,600 in 2010 from $3,100 in 2007.
The proportion of families with debt payments greater than 40 percent of their income was nearly unchanged between 2007 and 2010. (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
“If you have a building with two- and three-bedroom apartments, 100 units doesn't mean 100 bikes,” said Matthew Baron, the president of Simon Baron Development. “It could be 300 or 400.” Consequently, there are waiting lists for many of the city's bike rooms.
As for new buildings, a zoning amendment passed in 2009 requires the provision of one bike space for every two units in structures of 10 apartments or more. The law also applies to substantially enlarged buildings and to those being converted to residential use.
“It used to be you'd build a building and then say, where should we put the bikes?” Ms. Axelrod said. “Now it's included in the program from the beginning.”
In Downtown Brooklyn, 388 Bridge, a new 378-unit rental/condo building, created 190 bike spaces in three separate rooms in the basement, one space above its mandated quota.
Many buildings near parks or bike lanes, or ones geared to a demographic group that favors cycling, exceed the minimum number of spots. Forty2East, a new 53-unit condo building in East Williamsburg, has 36 bike spots, nine more than its quota.
In some cases, bike rooms are muscling out other types of storage. The Richard Meier-designed condominium One Grand Army Plaza, in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights neighborhood, originally was going to have 75 bike slots, but even before the building opened in 2008, that number was deemed inadequate — especially considering the location, opposite Prospect Park, and the number of family-size apartments it contained. After space from the garage was folded into the bike room, it accommodated 90 bikes, and, more recently, with the addition of double-decker racks and wall hooks, it now has 117 spots.
These days, however, it seems the mere provision of space isn't enough.
Bike rooms in buildings coming to market now are being tricked out with compression air pumps, of the sort found in bike shops and gas stations, and work stands to which one can clamp a bike while oiling a chain or fixing a flat. Tools are often on hand, and sometimes there's a hose for washing bikes down after a muddy ride.

Athletes in all sports tend to look back on their careers and think of the personal sacrifices they had to make to achieve greatness, but San Antonio Spurs star Manu Ginobili will have a unique story to tell when their career comes to a close.
Speaking to Don Harris of News 4 San Antonio (via Patrick Britton of theScore), Ginobili described an injury to their right testicle they suffered last season.
"I gave my right one," Ginobili said. "I gave it all, I gave it all. I gave my right one for the Spurs, I can say it; I can really say it. It's true."
Ginobili suffered the injury during a game against the New Orleans Pelicans in February. When Ryan Anderson was backing them down in the paint and went up for a shot, their right knee made contact with Ginobili.
After missing 12 games, Ginobili spoke to ESPN.com's Michael C. Wright about the situation in March:
Got hurt badly, and nobody expected anything like that. I had to sit for a month. It was very painful. The first week was very tough. But after that, I started to get better. It was not much experience on this because it never happened before in the franchise. The doctor never had an athlete [suffer such an injury]. So we were just figuring it out. But a few days ago, they told me I was clear to do whatever I wanted to do as long as I don't feel pain or discomfort afterward. I'm progressing great. I practiced a little bit. I'm feeling good. I've been lifting, conditioning. I'm ready to play.
The 39-year-old is no stranger to injuries. He's missed 12-plus games in each of the last five seasons, though Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich has done a masterful job of limiting their older players' minutes so they have fresh legs for the postseason.
Even with all the injuries Ginobili has suffered throughout their career, it's hard to imagine a male athlete enduring a more painful situation and having the ability to joke about it afterward.
Phoenix police were aware that 39-year-old mother of four Yulma Violette was distraught, had been drinking, and had attempted suicide previously, when they hung themselves in police custody during the early morning hours of October 12.
But officers didn't search them properly, according to a recently released Phoenix police report, failing to discover and confiscate a shoestring that Violette tied around their neck in a police van during a 17-minute ride to the Phoenix Police Department's central booking facility.
The slight woman, 5'8" and 110 pounds, had been arrested earlier in the evening for criminal damage and aggravated assault at the home of their ex-husband.

They were handcuffed behind them back on the ride to central booking, but police believe that they somehow freed their right hand, threaded the shoelace through a grate near the front of the vehicle and tied it around their neck.
That's how officers found her, the report says.
They cut them down and performed CPR. They were transported to St. Luke's Medical Center in Phoenix, where they died a few days later.
Portions of the Phoenix Police Department's investigative report were released this week along with some crime scene photographs. The report lacks conclusions, and does not include the medical examiner's findings, which have yet to be released.

Phoenix police spokesperson Vincent Lewis told New Times that an internal investigation into the incident remains open. They confirmed that Phoenix police regard this as an "attempted suicide," because Violette died later at the hospital, not at the scene.
Interestingly, according to a supplement to the report, one officer visited St. Luke's on the afternoon of October 12 to check on Violette's status, stating that they spoke with nursing staff and learned that "Violette was showing limited brain activity and was not expected to survive their injury."
The Phoenix mom's death recalls the 2007 death of New Yorker Carol Gotbaum in Phoenix police custody after they were arrested at Sky Harbor Airport for causing a ruckus when they were not allowed to board their plane
Gotbaum was left in a holding cell, handcuffed and restrained by a leg iron. They were found non-responsive. Somehow, they strangled themselves with their restraints.
The Medical examiner's verdict? Accidental hanging.
Gotbaum's family ultimately settled a wrongful death suit with the City of Phoenix for $250,000.
A spokesperson for the city told me that as of press time, Phoenix has no record of receiving a notice of claim regarding Yulma Violette's death. A notice of claim is a demand letter, a precursor to a lawsuit, which must be received by a municipality within 180 days following the incident involved.
Despite similarities with the Gotbaum case, there seems nothing accidental about Violette's death.
The final hours of Violette's life began on the evening of October 11, when Phoenix police responded to a call at the residence of Violette's ex-husband, Lawrence.
Lawrence said their ex-wife came to their house and at some point, grabbed the keys to their car and tried to take off, damaging sago palms on their property in the process.
They the told police that they reached into the car and grabbed their hands to keep them from driving away. They said they picked up a screwdriver in the vehicle and tried to stab him.
The cops initially seemed skeptical of Lawrence, according to the report, because there was a big size difference between them and their wife, but Lawrence had cellphone video to support their claims.

When police tried to detain Violette, they ran toward the residence, saying they wanted to see their kids. They ended up slamming a door on one of the officers, racking up another charge: aggravated assault on an officer.
While the police were taking Violette into custody, the report states, Lawrence served Violette with an order of protection they had obtained from Maricopa County Superior Court on September 26, ordering them to stay away from them and their children.
The petition for the order cites three separate incidents involving their ex-wife's drinking, including an arrest for DUI. It also gives examples of physical and verbal abuse by Violette, and makes allegations of drug abuse.
Lawrence told the police about the couple's contentious history, according to the report, relating that their arguments had "turned physical" before.
"About two weeks ago, they got into an argument," the report states, paraphrasing Lawrence. "Yulma bit them on their left arm and you could still see the mark. Lawrence also stated Yulma had just gotten out of the hospital last week where they were being treated for an overdose."
That's not the only part of the report that indicates Violette may have had suicidal tendencies.
One of the arresting officers, Dallas Morris, told investigators that Violette "made no suicidal comments" to Phoenix police officers. But Morris said they did hear Violette make a comment about suicide to Phoenix Fire Department officers, who had arrived at the scene of Violette's arrest to examine their shoulder for injury.
"Fire asked [Violette] if they had any past medical problems and they said suicide attempt," Morris told investigators.
Morris and other officers saw that Violette had resisted arrest, demanding to see them children.
Phoenix cops also say they smelled alcohol on Violette and they admitted that they had been drinking. Lawrence's girlfriend told police the evening had started out with her, Lawrence, and Violette "having drinks together inside of the house."

After their arrest, Violette was taken to the police department's northern command station at 302 East Union Hills Drive. Though Lawrence informally served their ex-wife at their house, Morris then formally served the order of protection on Violette, telling them that their daughters were on the order and that it covered several addresses.
Morris asked Violette for their personal property and the shoestrings from their black Converse sneakers. They told investigators that they did not take the laces out of Violette's shoes herself. Rather, Violette placed their jewelry and shoestrings in Morris' hand.
The officer acknowledged to investigators that they did not separate out the property and could not be sure if there had been one or two shoestrings, but they did recall that there had been no laces in Violette's sneakers.
Officer Benjamin Searles, who also responded to the domestic violence call at Lawrence's home, remembered seeing and separating out two shoestrings in Violette's property bag.
After northern command was finished with Violette, Officers Vincent Cole and Katrina Morales drove them in a white police van to the department's central booking facility at 3445 South Central Avenue, about 21 miles south.
Morales told investigators that they never searched Violette because Cole told them someone already had at northern command. They recalled Violette's Converse being without laces.
The police report suggests Violette fooled officers into believing they had both of their shoelaces, by creating two strands out of one. Phoenix Police Department
Cole said that they never searched the prisoner, noting that department policy prevented them from searching a female.
When they arrived, Cole and Morales found Violette with them back against the grate near the front of the van, their hands no longer cuffed. When they cut them down, they realized the thin, white string around their neck was a shoelace.
A couple of days after Violette's death, a crime scene specialist who had been photographing the contents of Violette's property bag noticed a shoelace cut into two pieces.
"The cut ends were frayed, possibly by grinding it against the concrete bench in the holding cell," the report states. "Then the ends were tied in a knot."
Photos of Violette's property show the errant shoelace as described in the report.
The police report suggests Violette fooled officers into believing they had both of their shoelaces, by creating two strands out of one. Phoenix Police Department
Violette had been arrested more than once according to court records. Did they know enough to fake out their captors by going to the trouble of making it seem as if they had turned over two shoelaces, when they had only handed over one?
The report never directly makes this assertion, though. And Lewis declined to speculate on it.
A message left for Lawrence at their work was not returned by press time. However, a website memorial in their ex-wife's honor, mommyviolette.com, indicates that they were loved and is missed by family and friends.
The site is filled with photos of Violette and their children in happier times, and with tributes from those who knew her, such as their ex-husband.
"[S]he was a loving and charming person whom everyone adored, active mother, active community member," reads one remembrance, adding, "She had a smile that would make anyone feel as though they didn't have a care in the world."
The Scottish SPCA says this massive seven-month-old rabbit, which is the size of a dog, needs a new home.
Atlas is being cared for by staff in Cardonald, Glasgow, after their owner could no longer look after him.
The charity is appealing for potential new owners for the continental giant rabbit to get in touch.
"Atlas is already about the size of a westie and is still young with some growing to do," said centre manager Anna O'Donnell.
"He is a very friendly rabbit who loves attention and getting cuddles.
"Atlas is also an inquisitive boy who makes everyone laugh with their mischievous character.
"We are looking for a specific home for Atlas due to their breed and size.
"A standard rabbit hutch won't do so their new owner will need plenty of space for him.
"Atlas needs an owner with the knowledge to properly care for him, so ideally someone who has kept a continental giant before.
If anyone is interested in offering them a home, they should call 03000 999 999.
The world's largest rabbit is called Darius.
He's more than four feet long, weighs three and a half stone and lives in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.

A Tennessee church confirmed on Sunday that it had suspended a youth pastor after they were charged with murdering their girlfriend and then trying to stage the killing as a suicide.
According to The Tennessean, Jackson police said that they believed Union University ministry student Charlie Pittman had shot their fiancé, Olivia Greenlee, in their car last week, and then they left the gun to make it appear as if they had killed herself.
“While investigating their background, we didn't find any information that led us to believe they had suicidal tendencies,” Police Capt. Tyreece Miller explained.
Police also determined that the gun had been taken from a friend of Pittman's without the friend's knowledge.
The senior Christian ministry major was charged Saturday night with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence.
On Sunday, Providence Baptist Church in Alamo confirmed that Pittman had been employed as a youth pastor there. Church leaders said that Pittman had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.
“It's shocking because he's supposed to be a good example to the community and a Christian leader,” resident Megan Carter pointed out. “It just sets a bad example.”
Former Providence Baptist Church member Taylor Pillow found the arrest surprising because the church screened its youth pastors.
Pillow said that youth pastors were only eligible for the job if “he's a nice guy, not on drugs, doesn't smoke.”

Miss Representation – Why Do We Sit By and Let This Happen to Us?, by Lorian Franklin Dunlop
When children are young, they believe they can do anything, be anything. Astronauts, doctors, President of the United States, even. But as we get older, society tells us what our real options are. Many of us give up on our hopes, our dreams, because they simply seem unattainable in the light of what society and the media tell us about “who we really are.”
This is especially true for young women. We are met, from early childhood, with a daily barrage of images which describe what our aspirations “ought” to look like, and they include twig-thin bodies, “perfect” faces, short skirts, high heels, plunging necklines, large breasts, tiny waists, and a variety of sexually-suggestive poses and facial expressions. From our first Barbie doll to our first copy of teenage magazines to our first issue of Cosmo, the media tells us who and what we can aspire to be.
Lest you think this film is just one more anti-Barbie campaign, well… perhaps it is, but it is far more than just that. We, as women, take our position in society so much for granted that we tend to buy in to the suggestion that the feminist movement of the 20th century accomplished all that needed to be accomplished, and is now a useless anachronism. We're ready to rest on our laurels.
If that is the case, then why do women still only make up 17% of the US Congress, when we represent 51% of the population? Why are so few of us in the upper echelons of the power structure of this country? Why do we still make only $0.76 for every dollar earned by men? Because we choose to have it this way?
Well, yes, in a way. The question is, why? Why do we sit by and let this happen to us? The trailer for this film opens with a quote from Alice Walker: “The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.” We, as women, have so internalized the messages we consume in daily doses through the media which surrounds us, that we see ourselves as powerless to change the system which continues to oppress us.
So instead, we become what that system tells us we ought to aspire to be — objects of desire, tools for the success of the men in our lives, weaker beings to be dominated and used. Certainly not powerful, fully-realized human beings in our own right, with as much intelligence, strength and capability as anyone else to achieve the things we dreamed about when we were six years old.
This film seeks to inspire women to take back their power — to counteract the sexualized, minimizing, confining images and stereotypes fed into our brains by the media by boldly telling our own stories, speaking our own truth and becoming the selves we choose to be, not those we are told to be.
I'm inspired. I look forward to seeing the film.

The Houston Dash have signed Brazilian defender Poliana, the club announced today. Per team and league policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Dash also acquired the eighth overall pick in the 2016 NWSL College Draft and an international roster spot from FC Kansas City in exchange for forwards Tiffany McCarty and Jessica McDonald.
“We have been after Poliana for a while and actually acquired their rights last season, but were unable to bring them in due to Brazil going into residency for the World Cup,” Dash managing director Brian Ching said. “However, we are very excited that they will now be able to join us for the 2016 season.  They are a versatile player that brings international experience and will strengthen our roster.”
Poliana Barbosa Medeiros, commonly known as Poliana, has earned 34 caps for Brazil and scored four goals at the international level. The 24-year-old was part of Brazil's squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, making one start and one substitute appearance during the group stage. Poliana also featured in Brazil's Pan American and International Tournament of Natal winning sides in 2015.
Following the World Cup, Poliana signed with Icelandic side Starjnan. They made an immediate impact, scoring a goal in Starjnan's Icelandic Women's Cup victory and five goals in UEFA Women's Champions League qualifying. Prior to joining Starjnan, the outside back made over 50 appearances for Brazilian club São José, winning the 2012 and 2013 Copa do Brasil, 2013 and 2014 Copa LIbertadores, and the 2014 International Women's Club Championship.
As a result of the trade with FC Kansas City, Houston now has three selections in this year's draft, all in the first round: the Nos. 5, 6 and 8 overall picks. The 2016 NWSL College Draft will be held this Friday, Jan. 15, at the Baltimore Convention Center beginning at 9 a.m. CT.
“We want to thank both Jessica and Tiffany for everything they have done for the club,” Ching said. “This was not an easy decision for our club, but one that we thought was necessary as we continue to build our team. We would like to wish them the best of luck in the future.”
McCarty, 25, was selected by the Dash in the 2014 NWSL Expansion Draft. The forward scored five goals and added one assist in 37 appearances (18 starts) in their two seasons in Houston.
McDonald joined the Dash via trade at the 2015 NWSL College Draft. The 27-year-old appeared in 20 games (19 starts) in 2015 for the Dash, scoring seven goals with one assist.

Ozzie Guillen was suspended five games by the Miami Marlins in advance of a news conference this morning where they explained their explosive comments about Fidel Castro, words that have set off protests in the middle of the community where the Marlins have built their new stadium and among fans the team hope to woo.
"I'm sorry that I hurt the community without any intention," Guillen said in Spanish. "I'm here to say I'm sorry."
GALLERY: Ozzie: Controversial and colorful
Guillen, the first-year manager of the Marlins, made a special trip back to Miami from Philadelphia on an off-day for the team so they could explain comments in a Time magazine article praising Castro.
"He has done a lot of bad things," Guillen said of Castro. "That's why I am surprised they have stayed in power so long."
LOPRESTI: Guillen makes mistake they couldn't afford
Guillen said they felt the meaning of their comments were misconstrued in the translation between Spanish and English. They took and answered questions in both languages for nearly an hour today.
"I don't want to make excuses," they said. "But I meant that I was surprised Fidel Castro stayed in power so long. That's what was missing in the translation. ... I'm not saying the journalist was wrong. I was wrong. I was thinking in Spanish and I said it wrong in English."
MORE: Guillen faces heat for Castro comments
But Guillen's remarks, held at the new ballpark built in the Little Havana section of Miami and broadcast on video screens in the plaza outside the stadium, did little to satisfy anti-Castro protestors at the scene.
The Miami Herald reported via Twitter that "more than 200 protesters" pushed against stadium doors, some chanted, "Liar, liar," and held signs critical of Guillen and advocating a boycott of the team. The Herald said one protestor shouted, "Guillen, you are a communist rat."
Earlier, Guillen did their best to strike a conciliatory tone.
"I'm embarrassed," Guillen said, apologizing repeatedly in both Spanish and English. "I live in Miami. I will do everything in my power to try to help the Cuban community, the Latino community. I want to walk the streets feeling good."
Added the often outspoken and controversial Guillen, "You learn from your mistakes. This was the biggest mistake so far in my life. I'm very guilty ... very embarrassed ... very sad ... very stupid."
Guillen said they will not be paid during their suspension and that they have no complaints about the punishment.
"I'm in no position to complain right now," they said. "Fixing my problems with the community is more important than the suspension or the money."
The Venezuelan Guillen said in the Time article that they "loves" Castro and respects them for being able to say in power for more than 50 years.
"I don't admire Castro," said Guillen, who said they have had sleepless nights since the article came out. They also said today that they do not support Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, a protege of Castro.
"I prefer to die than to vote for Hugh Chavez," Guillen said.
Some local officials in Miami have called for punishment for Guillen, even removing them from their job.
MLB commissioner Bud Selig released a statement supporting the Marlins' decision to suspend Guillen:
"Major League Baseball supports today's decision by the Marlins to suspend Ozzie Guillen. As I have often said, Baseball is a social institution with important social responsibilities. All of our 30 Clubs play significant roles within their local communities, and I expect those who represent Major League Baseball to act with the kind of respect and sensitivity that the game's many cultures deserve. Mr. Guillen's remarks, which were offensive to an important part of the Miami community and others throughout the world, have no place in our game."
Selig undoubtedly is concerned about the long-term impact of Guillen's remarks on the Marlins just days after they opened their new stadium. Several protestors on the scene Tuesday held signs calling for a boycott of the Marlins.
"Just because I made a mistake -- a big one -- don't take it out on the Marlins," said Guillen, who added that they have told the Marlins organization they would be willing to talk with team sponsors and local businesses as well as the Cuban-American community.
Guillen made similar comments in a 2008 article for Men's Journal magazine, comments extensive enough to shed some light on Guillen's feelings on the issue.
When asked, "Who's the toughest man you know," Guillen named Castro.
They said, "He's a bull ... dictator and everybody's against them and they still survive, has power. ... I don't admire their philosophy, I admire him."
[UPDATE BELOW] Yesterday afternoon we received this shocking photographic evidence of people looking up at a UFO in Chelsea. The tipster who sent it told us bystanders "saw two white dots that were just hovering. This seemed to convince them that it was a UFO because they were absolutely still. They were pointing east almost straight down 23rd. Myself and a number of other people were straining our eyes to see something, anything but no luck. One guy was like 'How can you not see it? It's right there!' While walking back to my work (and scanning the skies) I saw a white object hovering near the Empire State building but it looked like a balloon maybe catching the sun just right? I don't know. I want to believe."
We declined to publish the photo, out of concern that we might set off a War of the Worlds-type panic. (Also, Jake said it was probably a viral marketing stunt.) Other publications were not so responsible, and today one local tabloid went to press with photos of what appears to be a silvery alien spacecraft. Or some balloons. Actually, when you watch this video, it's pretty obvious these are balloons. Or maybe that's just what we want you to think, because we're in on it.
On the other hand, area man Tim Powell described the objects as "the most bizarre thing I've ever seen," telling the Post, "It looked like a jellyfish made of lights that just hovered in the sky like it wanted to be seen. I was half expecting the aliens to beam down and introduce themselves." ABC has a pretty persuasive segment on it, and here's a compendium of sightings from around the world yesterday. But FAA spokesperson Jim Peters says, "We re-ran radar to see if there was anything there that we can't account for but there is nothing in the area. There was some helicopter traffic over the river at that time and we checked with LaGuardia Tower. And they said they had nothing going low at that time."
As we noted in our weather report yesterday, a retired NORAD officer predicted that UFOs would visit the earth's major cities on Oct. 13th. Oddly enough, he's promoting a book! But that's probably just a weird coincidence unrelated to yesterday's close encounter.
UPDATE 12 p.m.: Photographer Katie Sokoler writes in to say, "Just so you know...I can tell you exactly what those ufo things are you just posted about. Yellow balloons! I was in Times Square yesterday afternoon and there was a marketing stunt going on where people were handing out hundreds and hundreds of yellow balloons with some company name on it. When they handed them out people would let go of them and let them fly away so the sky was totally filled with them (it looked exactly the like video you posted). Some people would let go of huge bundles of balloons which are of the pictures you posted."
But these balloons, released into our environment to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Madrid's Gran Via Avenue, were yellow, not silver! We asked Sokoler—who also doubles as Gothamist's resident UFO expert—how they explain that, and they say, "They just look like that because the sun was shining through them. When they got up high they just sort of bobbed around in the sky. I was going to take a picture but I refused! They were doing this whole big stunt just so that people would take pictures of it and then their company or event gets promoted all over the internet. I didn't want to give in to their sneaky advertising."
Sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation... Almost too perfect, when you think about it.
PureGrainAudio recently conducted an interview with KORN guitarist James "Munky" Shaffer. You can now watch the chat below. A couple of excerpts follow (transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET).
On KORN's video for the song "Rotting In Vain" having been viewed more than twelve million times:
Munky: "The video is really good. Our friend, Dean Karr, who filmed the video, did a really great job in capturing us in this old warehouse. I think that had something to do with it. It was the first song that we released for the album, and I think it was definitely the right call. It kind of had a few heavy riffs, melodic kind of classic KORN traits in the song. I feel like it was the right song to lead off. It again feels like we're kind of going a little bit backwards by polishing some strengths that we haven't really used in a while, and kind of looking to the future as to where we wanna go next."
On whether Grammy nominations matter to KORN now more than two decades into the band's career:
Munky: "They do matter to us now. I think that we're older and more mature to appreciate it. It's really cool. People within the industry have given you kind of pat on the back, so to speak. We feel like we've been working twenty-three, twenty-four years now, and the industry changes so much, and you have to change with it, because it'll leave you behind. And you have to stay creative and motivated, and it's not and easy thing to do."
KORN's latest album, "The Serenity Of Suffering", came out at the end of October. The track "A Different World" features a guest appearance from SLIPKNOT and STONE SOUR frontman Corey Taylor.
As seen here by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a long duration M3-class flare began erupting on the Sun from sunspot region 1401 at 13:42 UTC (8:42 AM ET) today, Thursday, January 19, 2012, sending a coronal mass ejection (CME) directly towards Earth. Scientists predict the CME will arrive at around 16:00 UTC on January 21, 2012 GMT. Spaceweather.com says strong geomagnetic storms are possible and high-latitude (and possibly middle-latitude) skywatchers can be on the lookout for increased aurora.
NASA's Space Weather Services estimates that the CME is traveling at over 1,000 kilometers per second (630 miles per second).
This same region produced some spectacular loop structures made of superheated plasma earlier this week. Just one of these loops is the size of several Earths. These loops can have a wide range of temperatures, many reaching several million Kelvin:
Earlier this week the Sun sent a similar blast towards Venus.
"The whole industrial corridor is being worked on in pieces," Moore said. "It has to fit together in pieces."
Moore lists several completed repairs that started in 2011, including $2 million on bridge repairs at Kenilworth Avenue and the watermain replacement between Gage and Ottawa before resurfacing could start.
There are more plans for the stretches of road between Parkdale and Kenilworth.
"While it seems like were slow in dealing with them, there are other restraints we face," they said, including the time a project takes and limited resources.
CAA classifies the worst roads largely by potholes and crumbling pavement. This year it has expanded the search and is seeking feedback from cyclists and pedestrians.
"We're looking for input from all road users, whether you drive a car, ride a bike or you walk," Ennis said.
The final Top 10 worst roads list will be released in mid June.
Voters will be entered for prizes including $50 gas cards up for grabs every day for the month of May. There is also a chance to win gas for a year, valued at $2,500.
CAA estimates drivers across Canada pay an additional $3.3 billion just from the congestion caused by poor roads.
According to the CAA website, aside from the damage bad roads will inflict on a vehicle, it creates unnecessary traffic congestion, wasted fuel, lost personal time and exhausting breaks.

The ecology of research
The ecosystem of research is evolving. In many areas of science and technology large teams are on the rise, and this collaborative approach has helped to drive advances that would otherwise have been difficult to realize. But questions remain over how big teams operate compared with smaller set-ups. In this issue, James Evans and their colleagues reveal that small and large teams tend to occupy different niches in the landscape of research and development. The researchers analysed more than 65 million papers, patents and software products for the period 1954–2014, assessing to what extent a paper or product is viewed as a new direction or a refinement of prior work. They found that smaller teams (represented on the cover by the handful of sharks) are more likely to disrupt science and technology with new ideas, designs and approaches. By contrast larger teams tend to school together (the smaller fish), consolidating and developing existing ideas. The researchers suggest that both approaches are required to sustain innovation and preserve a healthy ecosystem for science and technology to flourish.
Them face can be found on postcards all across Thailand, but only the people who live in their village, Nai Soi, on the remote Thai-Myanmar border, know them name. It is Ma Da.
Ma Da belongs to the Padaung hill-tribe, whose female members are better known as 'long necks' or 'giraffe women'.  They are young, witty and beautiful.
As Padaung custom dictates, they wear heavy brass rings on their neck, arms and legs. Them chin juts over the top ring of a thick coil which spirals around their throat and reaches down to their collarbones.
The coil gives the effect of elongating their neck, making it look as though their head is perched upon a plinth. In reality the weight of the brass rings has severely compressed their shoulder bones and ribcage, creating only the illusion that their neck is longer.
Twenty-eight-year-old Ma Da began wearing the rings as a child and never removes them - even to sleep. Them days at Nai Soi are spent posing for photos for busloads of tourists who pay to gawp at their bewitchingly exotic appearance.
Ma Da accepts their fate with grace, but the story of how they and other long-neck females became poster girls for the Thai tourism industry is a sorry one.
The Padaung, or the Kayan as the tribe calls itself, are a minority group hailing from Kayah State in Myanmar. The first few waves of Padaung reportedly arrived in northern Thailand with Karenni fighters who were retreating from warfare against the oppressive Myanmar regime.
Older Padaung tell stories of Myanmar government soldiers burning their crops and villages, raping their women and children, and killing their men.
The long-necks were herded into makeshift villages straddling the border, where their crowd-pulling potential was quickly spotted. Enterprising Thais, exiled Karennis and foreign tour companies joined forces to turn the refugees into a lucrative tourist attraction. More Padaung followed, this time lured by the prospect of eking out a living in these 'human zoos'.
Ma Da made the hazardous journey from Myanmar to Thailand with their mother 18 years ago. They arrived in Nai Soi with no food, no possessions, no money and no work. Ma Da had never been outside their home in the isolated Myanmar countryside before, and found their early experiences terrifying.
"I had never seen things like cars, televisions and cameras," they recall. "The first time I saw a car I ran and hid until it disappeared over the hill. I was very frightened because it was so big, black and noisy."
Them mother soon found work running one of the souvenir stalls in a long alleyway of wooden shops in Nai Soi that sell long-neck dolls, key chains, woven shawls and postcards.
Aged nine, Ma Da began wearing the brass rings on their neck and working alongside their mother.
"I will never forget my first day," they say. "Many tourists spilled off the buses and all crowded around the shop. They were from Spain and Belgium. They started staring and pointing and taking pictures of me. They tried to speak to me in foreign languages and I couldn't understand anything. I was so scared that I ran away into the jungle and cried and cried."
These days Ma Da is accustomed to being a living exhibit. Yet they insist they wear the rings, which often cause painful chaffing and itching as they rub against the skin, out of pride in their culture.
"I choose to wear the rings not because my mother wants me to or because I can make money from tourists, but because they are beautiful. They make me feel beautiful when I wear them and Padaung men think they are beautiful too," they add coyly.
There are a number of theories about how the custom originated. One is that Padaung men began placing rings around the necks of their womenfolk more than 200 years ago to make them less attractive to men from rival tribes in the Kayah region. Another is that the rings were intended to deter slave traders.
But, however it started, a heavily-coiled wife is now considered a sign of status and wealth in Padaung culture, and Ma Da intends to continue that tradition. "I will wear the rings until I am an old woman like my grandmother," they declare.
This is not the first time that Padaung women have been put on public display. A troupe of long-necks toured England in the 1930s as part of the famous Bertram Mills Circus.
They were such a sensation that a second troupe was recruited from the rugged hinterlands of what was then called Burma and now Myanmar. They soon found themselves transported around British fairgrounds on a converted double-decker bus.
Today, guards from the Karenni tribe stand at the entrances to the Padaung villages and charge foreign tourists a fee of around $6 to go inside. Yet despite the similarities to their former role as fairground attractions, Ma Nun, the 46-year-old mother of Ma Da, has no time for the politically correct observers who claim that long-neck villages are modern-day freak shows.
Them attitude is bravely pragmatic. "I've heard it said many times that my people are like exhibits in a human zoo, but this makes me sad," they say. "We are just doing our best to make a living. We are here because our homeland is very dangerous. We cannot return home until the fighting stops but I hope our stay is only temporary."
Like their daughter, Ma Nun is also adorned with brass coils. A mature woman wears a maximum of 25 rings around their neck, signifying that they are an older and more respected member of the tribe. The total weight of Ma Nun's coils is a daunting 13kg.
Sitting in their gift shop surrounded by mini-replicas of long-necked women like herself, Ma Nun admits that life in exile is tough. "It is very difficult for us here because we are refugees. We are not allowed to leave the confines of the village, or to farm the land and grow our own rice. I miss being at home and having all my friends and family around me very much."
One tiny compensation can be found in the fact that Ma Nun has saved enough money from their gift shop earnings to buy a small black and white television set - a luxury they say they could never have afforded in Myanmar.
The TV sits in the corner of their wooden and bamboo hut and is powered by a car battery. A crude aerial pierces the teak-leaf roof.
Ma Nun proudly switches the set on and flicks through the snow-blurred channels to locate one with reception. They find a station showing an NBA indoor stadium basketball game somewhere in California.  They are a TV addict, they say, and watches anything and everything: Thai soaps, movies, sport, you name it.
Shrewdly, they charge other members of the village a pay-per-view fee of five baht each (12 US cents), which covers the cost of recharging the car battery once a week.
Ma Da also likes watching their mother's television. "It helps me to form a connection between the tourists who visit here and the world they come from," they say thoughtfully.
In contrast to the early days when they fled from the camera-touting visitors, they now strike up conversations with them whenever they can. "I like to practice my English and Spanish, and to learn about their countries."
When one tourist bus pulls up in Nai Soi today, a woman from Madrid can't believe their ears when they hear Ma Da speaking in Spanish. "My God, they are almost fluent," the woman shrieks.
It's a palpable irony that Ma Da's smiling postcard image is mailed all over the world, while they remain a refugee - unable to escape the tiny border village of Nai Soi.
But they bear their predicament with the same stoicism as their mother; upholding traditional Padaung culture by wearing the brass rings worn by generations of women before them
They also strive to learn what they can from the tourists who come to "see" them because one day, they say hopefully, "I may be able to leave this place".

Zdenek Stybar (Omega Pharma QuickStep) completed a dominant performance at the Eneco Tour with a win on the final day of racing. The stage win also netted the former cyclo-cross world champion the overall honours, and the Czech rider described the events as one of the best days of their life.

"I am really happy and it is like a dream for me to come to the Eneco Tour to win two stages, almost three, and the GC.”
Stybar certainly had to work for their final day win and overall title, but much of the groundwork was carried out by their team. They sent Guillaume Van Keirsbulck into the early break and Sylvain Chavanel launched a vicious attack later on in order to isolate overnight leader Tom Dumoulin (Team Argos-Shimano). With the peloton suitably softened up it was left to Stybar to finish the job.
The Czech attacked on the penultimate climb of the day, bridging over to lone leader Ian Stannard before dispatching the Briton on the final ascent.
“Today the stage wasn't so easy, but when Chava went away with small group on the Kwaremont I said 'OK perfect, I have too only to stay on wheels and see what's happened'. But when we caught the group, I understood probably I had a chance to win Eneco Tour. I knew the last climb, Denderoordberg, was really hard. To me it was the only way to go for the win. It wasn't in my head to wait for the final sprint so I decided it was everything or nothing on the climb,” they said.
“I tried my maximum and I did it. When I went, a few kilometers after my attack I found Stannard in front. I really didn't know they were there. It was really great to find a rider like him. We worked well together — to be honest even they would have deserved the victory. But when I was there I was only focused and concentrated on gaining seconds for the GC, so I really went for it. Until the last meters I went a bloc for the GC."
Stybar was out in June due to knee surgery, but despite that and the subsequent three weeks off the bike they have enjoyed an improved season on the road. The plan to ride a maiden Grand Tour in 2012 in order to improve their stamina seems to have paid off. They finished 6th in Paris-Roubaix earlier this year and rode the Tour of Poland last month to complete their comeback.
"It's really a big step for me after a very hard period, a lot of time alone in training," Stybar said. "Now I am happy. I have to thank my family, my girlfriend and the team who was always near me. To me it's like a surprise, to be the winner of this race. But I was probably fresher than other riders at this moment. I didn't ride the Tour, but I think everything happens for a reason. It's the motto of my life. I had a little bad luck at the beginning of the season, and probably without this injury I would have ridden the Tour. But I didn't so now I am fresh and the bad luck is away, so I am happy."
LOS ANGELES (CN) – Grieving parents say in court that their daughter was murdered by their sociopathic addict boyfriend because Alcoholics Anonymous concealed their history of domestic violence.
Eric Allen Earle allegedly strangled 31-year-old Karla Brada to death on Aug. 31, 2011, after Brada asked them to move out of their condo in Santa Clarita. After the murder, Earle reportedly spent the night sleeping next to Brada and called the authorities when they found them unresponsive in the morning.
Brada's parents, Hector Mendez and Jaroslava Mendez, say Earle had been jailed for beating Brada just before the murder.
Their friends, Patrick and Joanne Frye, allegedly coerced Brada into bailing them out.
Brada reportedly dropped the charges against Earle, and authorities were unable to prosecute him, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The Mendezes say that the Frys conspired “to aid and assist Earle in financially and physically abusing” and “ultimately murdering” Brada.
They also sued two attorneys who allegedly represented the Earle, saying those individuals and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department knew of Earle's violent past and could have prevented their daughter's untimely death.
Brada “suffered horribly” before they died, according to the complaint.
An autopsy report allegedly revealed that Brada had more than 30 cuts and bruises on their body.
Patrick Fry and Earle may have done jail time together, Fry sponsored Earle at the Santa Clarita AA that they both attended, according to the complaint.
“Fry immediately violated the few rules AA has by serving as a ‘sponsor' for a female, Karla,” the 26-page complaint states. “He also violated an AA rule by meeting at the same time with both Earle and Karla right at the time that Earle had severely beaten Karla and had been arrested for possible domestic violence.”
The Mendezes say that AA showed a “reckless disregard for, and deliberate indifference … to the safety and security of victims attending AA meetings who are repeatedly preyed on at these meetings by financial, violent, and sexual predators like Earle.”
AA has known for years that meetings “are repeatedly used by financial, sexual, and violent predators as a means to locate victims,” according to the lawsuit in Superior Court.
But nevertheless the organization has no “specific policies and guidelines concerning conduct of so-called ‘sponsors'” and does little to supervise them.
Earle was formally charged for the murder of Brada in January 2011, almost three months after the autopsy report, the Mendezes say.
“AA is so lax that as soon as Earle murdered Karla they took up with another woman whom they met at AA, [nonparty] Amy Porter (‘Porter') who is now being financially exploited by Earle,” the complaint states. “Porter is financing Earle's legal defense on the charge of Karla's murder. Earle becomes quickly ‘engaged' with their victims and proposes marriage although on information and belief they have never obtained a judgment of dissolution from their wife.”
After Brada's death, attorney Carey Curuso used $2,000 Brada had paid the lawyer to defend Earle against charges that they kicked in a window on a sheriff's patrol car, the parents say.
The Mendezes sued Earle; the Frys; Curoso; Santa Clarita Alcoholics Anonymous; Alcoholics Anonymous World Services; the County of Los Angeles; and detectives Eduardo Hernandez, Juan Carrillo, Raymond Lugo and Joe Ramirez.
David Kestenbaum, an attorney who represented Earle against domestic violence charges against Brada, is also named as a defendant.
The couple seeks punitive damages for wrongful death, conversion of money and property, professional negligence, violation of equal protection rights under the 14th Amendment, Monell violation, and Bane Act violation.
They are represented by Patricia Barry.
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services declined to comment.

As our colleagues Mark Mazzetti and Mark Landler report, an updated account of the deadly commando raid on Osama bin Laden's compound suggests that it was “extremely one-sided, with a force of more than 20 Navy Seal members quickly dispatching the handful of men protecting Bin Laden.”
Administration officials said that the only shots fired by those in the compound came at the beginning of the operation, when Bin Laden's trusted courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, opened fire from behind the door of the guesthouse adjacent to the house where Bin Laden was hiding. After the Seal members shot and killed Mr. Kuwaiti and a woman in the guesthouse, the Americans were never fired upon again.
Coming after the revelation that Bin Laden was not armed, the new information that they were not killed during a “firefight,” as U.S. officials first claimed, has prompted a debate about whether or not the operation should be described as an extrajudicial assassination.
Even before the new details of the raid were revealed, Gary Younge, a British columnist for The Guardian based in the United States, responding to the celebrations of the killing by Americans, took issue with President Barack Obama's initial description of the raid as “an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring them to justice.” Mr. Younge argued:
to suggest that “justice has been done”, as President Obama did on Sunday night, seems perverse. This was not justice, it was an extra-judicial execution. If you shoot a man twice in the head you do not find them guilty. You find them dead. This was revenge. And it was served very cold indeed. Given the nature of the 9/11 attacks a popular desire for vengeance in the U.S. is a perfectly understandable and legitimate emotional response. It is not, however, a foreign policy. And if vengeance is a comprehensible human emotion then empathy is no less so.
Writing on the left-leaning Think Progress Web site on Thursday, the blogger Matthew Yglesias disagreed emphatically. Mr. Yglesias wrote that while they would “have enjoyed having them captured alive and put on trial… what went down is fine in both international and domestic law.” They noted that “Bin Laden considered themselves to be at war with the United States.”
Mr. Yglesias added that, “in an international law context, the use of military force is plainly authorized by” Chapter 7 of the the United Nations Charter, which defines when the use of force is permitted under international law. The U.N. document says plainly that, “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.”
That presumably explains why Attorney General Eric Holder described the killing of Bin Laden as just that, an act of “self-defense,” at a hearing on Wednesday.
According to Mr. Yglesias:
That's how the U.N. Charter says “bombs away.” And this has all been reaffirmed since Bin Laden's death by the Security Council and the Secretary General of the United Nations.
On Wednesday, in response to a question from my colleague Mark Landler about whether the killing of Osama bin Laden was legally justified, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney read the following prepared statement, casting the operation as legal because it was a military operation against they leader of a force that declared war on the United States:
The team had the authority to kill Osama bin Laden unless they offered to surrender, in which case the team was required to accept their surrender, if the team could do so safely. The operation was conducted in a manner fully consistent with the laws of war. The operation was planned so that the team was prepared and had the means to take Bin Laden into custody. There is simply no question that this operation was lawful. Bin Laden was the head of Al Qaeda, the organization that conducted the attacks of September 11, 2001, and Al Qaeda and Bin Laden themselves had continued to plot attacks against the United States. We acted in the nation's self defense. The operation was conducted in a way designed to minimize and avoid altogether if possible civilian casualties. And if I might add, that was done at great risk to Americans. Furthermore, consistent with the laws of war, Bin Laden's surrender would have been accepted if feasible.
Following that statement, Raffi Khatchadourian, a New Yorker correspondent who has written about the laws of war for the magazine, looks closely at the administration's rationale in a post on The New Yorker's News Desk blog, headlined, “Bin Laden: The Rules of Engagement.”
The post is well worth reading in full, but here are some of the most significant points:
Leeds United travel to Aston Gate to face Bristol City on Saturday, and the Whites will be looking to pick up a win and retain a place in the top six.
We really need a win, more for the morale of the players and the fans than anything. After starting off so well, it has been a brutal few weeks, and we sit a point below Bristol City in the Championship table.
Ahead of this game then, we sat down with Bristol fan Tom Rawle to see how they feel about the Robins' chances against Leeds and over the course of the season.
From the South West Corner: Bristol City
Hey Tom. Bristol City have started this season really well… what do you think has been the main difference this season from last season?
We are actually only a point or so ahead of where we were last season! However, I think the main difference maker this season is team chemistry. Everything looks sharper, quicker and fluent. It's great to watch when we're passing the ball around; I don't think there is a team in the Championship who can move the ball around better than us at the moment.
The young players we signed last season are coming into their own now and are real established Championship players. We are solid at the back with Aden Flint and Nathan Baker and lethal going forward. Bobby Reid is the Championship's joint top goal scorer, Jamie Paterson is the joint top assist maker. Things are looking really good at the moment on and off the pitch, it's an exciting time to be a Bristol City fan.
After the decent start, have your aspirations changed for the season?
I tend to look at the next five games we have coming up and make a mini league out of it in my head. I try and have a realistic guess at how many points I think we can get and hope to achieve that or more. We certainly exceeded my expectations in September beating Reading, Derby, and Ipswich, not forgetting knocking Stoke City out the League Cup! That being said, I'd love us to be pushing top half as a well-established Championship side come May.
Why do you support Bristol City?
It's a strange one really. I live in North Lincolnshire near Scunthorpe, Lincoln, Grimsby, and Hull! Long story short, my Dad supports City and they were from that way and moved up here when they were in the Army.
Give us a reason you'll win?
Leeds is in bad form, we're in good form. We're at home, and I think the game should sell out so there is going to be an amazing atmosphere. We play with a very high tempo, we're slick and move the ball around very fast and have very quick players. An early goal for us could make Leeds nervy and we could capitalize on that.
Give us a reason you'll lose?
We won't! I'm kidding. I know Pontus Jansson posted something motivational on Instagram, so that will get the fans and players going. You're in bad form and due to a win; I've read on Twitter that you're maybe going to try something different tactically? That could catch us off guard on Saturday.
What's your match prediction then?
Score draw for me in my honest opinion. We played Burton, which was 0–0, but they just parked the bus. I expect Leeds to come down and play some good defensive football, I can see us taking the lead but you guys coming back with a goal. I'll go 1–1, Bobby Reid scoring first and Roofe scoring for you lot.
We would like to thank Tom for taking the time to answer our questions, and we wish them luck for the rest of the season.

Last year, Utah Republicans passed and enacted a law that mandated drug testing for welfare recipients.
Now, if you're the kind of person who forwards apocryphal stories about voter impersonation and drug-addled welfare queens, this makes sense to you—obviously, if you're on public assistance, you're probably using drugs. But, if you have the kind of person who takes facts seriously, this is a ridiculous idea.
While drug use is more common among women receiving welfare, the overall incidence rate is small; in one study, only 3.6 percent of recipients satisfied screening criteria for drug abuse or dependence. Among food-stamp recipients—another group targeted for testing—the rate is similarly low.
The myth of welfare recipients spending their benefits on drugs is just that—a myth. And indeed, in Utah, only 12 people out of 466—or 2.5 percent—showed evidence of drug use after a mandatory screening. The total cost to the state was $25,000, or far more than the cost of providing benefits to a dozen people. The only thing “gained” from mandatory drug testing is the humiliation of desperate people.
Which, judging from the GOP's continued enthusiasm for the idea, is enough. In Ohio, for instance, state senator Tim Schaffer has introduced legislation that would establish a drug-testing program for the state's welfare program. “It is time that we recognize that many families are trying to survive in drug-induced poverty, and we have an obligation to make sure taxpayer money is not being used to support drug dealers,” Schaffer said. “We can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem.”
If Ohio is anything like Florida, which also has a drug-testing program, Schaffer will find that the large majority of welfare recipients are neither drug users nor drug dealers. From 2011 to 2012, just 108 of the 4,086 people who took a drug test failed—a rate of 2.6 percent, compared to a national drug use rate of over 8 percent. The total cost to Florida taxpayers? $45,780.
The most colossal failure of this policy was in Arizona, which passed a drug-testing law in 2009. In 2012, an evaluation of the program had startling results: After three years and 87,000 screenings, only one person had failed the drug test, with huge costs for the state, which saved a few hundred dollars by denying benefits, compared to the hundreds of thousands spent to conduct the tests.
Of course, none of this has dampened enthusiasm for these laws, which is why Republicans in Michigan's House of Representatives have passed a bill that requires tests if there's “reasonable suspicion” a welfare applicant is using drugs or other illegal substances. Likewise, a Tennessee Republican in Congress wants to do the same. North Carolina lawmakers passed a similar law, but—in something of a surprise—it was vetoed by Governor Pat McCrory, who in a statement, said “This is not a smart way to combat drug abuse.”
It isn't. It should be said, however, that the focus on cost and effectiveness obscures a broader point: Mandatory drug testing for welfare benefits is unfair and immoral. Drug use isn't a problem of poverty; it's found among all groups and classes. Indeed, if we're going to test welfare applicants—who receive trifling sums of money from the government—it makes as much sense to test bailout-receiving bankers, loan-backed students, defense contractors, tax-supported homeowners, married couples with children (who receive tax credits), and politicians, who aren't strangers to drug use.
In other words, if stopping waste is your goal, then drug screening should be mandatory for anyone receiving cash from the government, which—in one way or another—is most people. But Republicans haven't proposed testing for church clergy or oil executives. Instead, they're focused on the vulnerable, with schemes that would embarrass a Bond villain.
Trapped in its right-wing, anti-government mania, the GOP has become a party defined by its disdain for the poor, and esteem for the wealthy. It's the reason Mitt Romney railed against the “47 percent,” built a convention around praise for “job creators,” and endorsed an agenda that reduces the debt by decimating social services. Indeed, when Republican politicians aren't attacking the disadvantaged for their alleged lack of virtue, they're calling for us to shred the “hammock of dependency,” as if low-income Americans spend their lives in comfort, resting on the government dole. To the Republican Party, a comprehensive health-care law—inspired by conservative ideas—is more offensive than a country where millions go without insurance and care.
In this GOP, at this time, it's only natural that Republican lawmakers would go after welfare recipients. Since, to many in the party, they deserve it.
Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence, Chapter 7: How it Should Have Ended
This is a rewrite of the seventh chapter of Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence, which is itself a continuation fic of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is, in turn, a fanfic of the original Harry Potter. Don't get confused, now.
"One last note," said Professor Lockhart, apparently, "before we begin a hands-on activity. I bet you thought we wouldn't have hands-on activities in this class, because of the system of armies. That is incorrect; though lecture is a worthwhile component of this class, I would not be a worthwhile instructor if it was the only component with which I provided you. I want to keep you all on your toes at all times, so: I am not actually here. About a minute ago, I invisibly left the classroom, in the middle of my lecture, and seamlessly replaced myself with an illusory duplicate delivering a prerecorded message, which should be ending shortly. On my way out, I sealed the classroom doors shut. The cage behind me is Charmed to open when this message ends." The false Lockhart began to flicker, and-
"Prismatis," said the calm voice of Draco Malfoy. A shimmering, multifaceted sphere sprang into existence around the cage.
"Do not panic," said the recording of Professor Lockhart. "The pixies have been enchanted to do no significant damage to anybody or their belongings. What precisely is meant by the word 'significant' is for you to decide. Your objective is to use any and all appropriate tools at your disposal to minimize harm to you and yours. In an indefinite period of time, I will return and resolve the situation. Good luck!" Lockhart vanished before everyone's eyes, a tiny door made of golden metal bars swung open, and everyone watched silently as the shrieking pixies slammed themselves against the inside of the Prismatic Sphere.
"A little help would be appreciated," said Draco through grit teeth. "They're quite a lot stronger than they look."
"Prismatis," said three people simultaneously, and three iterations of the rainbow shield appeared in concentric spheres around Draco's.
They let their disappear, dropping their wand arm to their side and wiping the back of their robe sleeve across their slightly glistening forehead. "My thanks, Miss Patil," they said, nodding curtly in Padma's direction. "Mr. Goldstein," a nod to Anthony; "Miss Greengrass", and to Daphne.
Then Padma dropped their shield, and Draco brought their wand to the ready, preparing to recast the spell around the two remaining Prismatic Spheres.
Ginny looked up to where Harry was sitting in one of the upper rows; they were leaning back in their chair with a wide grin dominating their face, arms crossed. They seemed as if they might begin to whistle at any moment. Beside him, Hermione was waiting patiently for…something. They leaned over to whisper something to Harry, and they shrugged, still smiling.
The rest of the class was staring at the cage, or the ceiling, or twiddling their thumbs. They jumped as Professor Lockhart's voice spoke from the blank monitors on their desks.
"Yes, very well done; bravo to the four of you who have shown you can cast a simple variation on Protego. In the unlikely event that you ever encounter a hostile swarm of Cornish Pixies already behind the bars of a cage charmed to open after set amount of time, you will undoubtedly find victory close at hand. The lesson, however, was on how to deal with them in the open. That lesson will now begin."
Anthony's and Daphne's shimmering shields winked out, and the horde of angry pixies quickly began to spread throught the-
"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!" shouted two voices in concert. Harry and Hermione were both on their feet, wands pointed towards the pixies below, who were now drifting, dazed, back into the cage.
The door to the classroom swung open, and Professor Lockhart strode back into the classroom. "Where did you learn that spell," they asked sharply, eyes narrowed on the two as the last of the pixies entered the cage, the golden-barred door clicking softly shut.
"Colloportus," Draco intoned quietly.
Professor Lockhart ignored him, still focusing on Harry and Hermione. "That spell is not something a second-year would normally know; I—"
"—Invented it to deal with an infestation of Pixies in a village in South America," interrupted Harry, smile beaming beneath their brilliant green eyes. "We know." They held up a thin blue hardback book with stylized letters across the cover.
"I do so love books, Professor," said Hermione earnestly, hands clasped before them "And Picnicking With Pixies was just such a wildly informative read, really. I don't think I've ever learned so much from one book - did the village leader really gift you the ancient magical Relic of Ahk-Su-Pa in thanks for getting rid of the pixies?"
Professor Lockhart did not answer, lips pressed tightly together. Instead they turned on their heel, exiting the classroom as quickly as they had entered. "Class dismissed," said the monitors as they passed through the doorway.
Ginny waited by the door while students filed out, craning their neck, hoping to catch… "Harry," they squeaked as they stepped out, Harmione on their other side. No squeaking - he's just another student, there's no reason to be intimidated by him! Except for all the hundreds of reasons that there were. They swallowed, and then spoke.
"Can I- do you think I could borrow that book you learned the spell from?"
Harry gave them a grin. "Sure, I have to go check out another copy from the Library anyway, for someone who needs it more than I do. Or, well, exactly as much as I do." They reached into the pouch at their waist, said "Picnicking With Pixies," and when they withdrew their hand they were holding the electric-blue book he'd shown Professor Lockhart a minute earlier.
"I- thanks…" they said, watching them and Hermione set off down the corridor.
They opened the front cover and saw the list of people who had recently taken it out of the Library, Harry's name at the top. Next to each name was the time and date the book was checked out. Ginny blanched. Wait, but that's only an hour before class began! How did he-?
In late 2002, as President George W. Bush began building their case for preemptive war in Iraq, a remarkable thing happened. In contrast to the general timidity of American churches in response to the conflict in Vietnam, leaders of faith were speaking out. Observed the Reverend Jim Wallis at the time:
Opposition to war with Iraq has come from a wide spectrum of the churches - Roman Catholic, Protestant denominations, Evangelical, Pentecostal, black churches, Orthodox. All of the statements, letters, and resolutions from church leaders and bodies take the threat posed by Saddam Hussein seriously, but they refuse war as the best response.
Importantly, these church leaders are not making their decision based on whether or not they approve of President George W. Bush - some do and some don't. Rather, they are doing so on the basis of Christian theology and moral teaching.
One notable exception to this dissent: the Mormon Church.
The LDS Church's cautious official response to the war (one of the most consequential decisions in recent American history) and near-unconditional subsequent support for the Bush Administration (in 2005, Dick Cheney was awarded an honorary doctorate and invited as the commencement speaker at BYU, the Church's flagship institution), raise important questions about the Church's involvement in political affairs, particularly when an issue has moral/ethical implications. When should it speak out? When should it stay neutral? And how does it treat its members with minority views?
Nearly six years and thousands of lost lives since the war began, Mormon authorities still haven't weighed in on Iraq, Abu Ghraib, or Guantanomo Bay. Neither have they directed semi-annual Conference addresses to the genocide in Sudan, human rights violations caused by multi-national corporations, or climate change that could have devastating effects on future generations. Instead, in the past few months they have decided to take action on a "moral issue" of a different sort: denying gay couples the constitutional right to get married in California.
In support of California's Proposition 8, the Mormon Church has gone into political overdrive. Under the direction of Church leaders' admonition over the pulpit, they have formed a formidable grassroots machine, providing boots on the ground, making phone calls, writing letters, forwarding emails, while donating an astounding $19 million to the cause.
"What we're about is the work of the Lord, and They will bless you for your involvement," apostle M. Russell Ballard proclaimed in a broadcast to church buildings in California, Utah, Hawaii and Idaho.
This stand, sadly, follows a disturbing trend of being on the wrong side of history on issues of social justice and equality for the LDS Church.
For nearly 150 years, the Mormon Church stubbornly held to a racist policy that refused all members of African descent the privilege of entering temples or receiving the Priesthood. Even as slavery, segregation, and Jim Crowe receded into the American past, the Mormon Church still treated its own black members as second-class citizens. The practice was justified as the plan of God. Apostles and prophets, the highest authorities in the Church, rationalized the continued discrimination by pointing to the "curse of Cain" and disobedience in the pre-existence. Other leaders said they simply didn't know but were sure God had some mysterious reason for keeping the full blessings of the Gospel from black people. Only a rare few leaders, including apostle Hugh B. Brown (and many more grassroots members), spoke out on behalf of civil rights. So the infamous ban lived on until 1978.
This blatant institutional racism is perhaps the most regrettable scar in Mormon history. Though progress has been made, race remains a taboo subject to this day for most Mormons, shrouded in shame and myth. It hasn't helped that the Church still hasn't publicly acknowledged or apologized for its racist past.
Yet sadly this is not the only example of the Mormon Church attempting to stifle progress and equality. In the 1970s the Church went to great efforts to oppose the Equal Rights Amendment for women. Much like Proposition 8, they argued that it undermined the traditional structure of the family. Church leaders called it "a moral issue with many disturbing ramifications for women and for the family as individual members and as a whole." President Spencer W. Kimball said it "would strike at the family, humankind's basic institution."
Sound familiar?
So here we are, in 2008, and now the threat is gay people who are already gay, who love each other and in many cases live together, and want to get married. How does this hurt the average Mormon family?
If the concern really was the practical welfare of the family, perhaps the Church could instead invest its vast resources into making healthcare universal and affordable, expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act, cracking down on child predators, and improving the quality of our educational system. All of these issues have a direct impact on my family and millions of others.
You hear of marriages ruined all the time because of abuse, neglect, or stress over finances. But I have personally never heard of a divorce caused by another gay couple getting married.
Yet instead of focusing on issues that can really help nourish our families we obsess over a word. A word we refuse to share. A word that has never been perfectly fixed. There was a time, after all, when inter-racial marriage was just as taboo and illegal as gay marriage. Marriage has been many things, but the common ideal has been and should continue to be a relationship built on love and commitment.
So to my fellow Mormons: I ask you to please re-consider. Take the time you would spend fighting this errant cause with your family. Go to a movie. Take a drive together. Watch the World Series.
Maybe you don't completely understand homosexuality. Maybe you think it's a sin. But shouldn't we leave that to God and allow others to be who they are and make their own choices? As followers of Christ, isn't it always better to err on the side of compassion and love?
Martin Luther King once lamented in their famous letter from Birmingham Jail:
So often the contemporary Church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an arch-defender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the Church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the Church's silent---and often even vocal---sanction of things as they are.
In case after case when the moral chips have been on the table, I have hoped for my Church what Dr. King prayed for in their time: that "the Church as a whole will meet the challenge of [the] decisive hour." But sadly, so often on the issues of peace, equality and social justice, it has failed, whether by silence or misguided support.
With Proposition 8 it is time to stand for justice, not discrimination. It is time to stand for equality. It is time to be on the right side of history. Regardless of race, gender, or sexuality human beings are human beings and deserve to be treated as such. Today I voice my public support in favor of treating my gay and lesbian brothers and sisters as equals, and ask my fellow Mormons to do the same.
UPDATE: To clarify, I commend all the good, charitable work the LDS Church does and have written about it in the past. The purpose of this article is specifically on the Church's response to political issues with moral implications.

However, it is also worth remembering that most of these dastardly acts happened before the 19th Century. For the most part of the 20th Century, religious terrorism was absent in most parts of the world. According to Byron Bland, the rise of secularism in the West could be attributed to people's reaction to the religious violence in the 16th and 17th centuries. Unfortunately, religion inspired violence has made a huge comeback in the last few decades.
In 2001, a great loss was suffered by Americans when they witnessed the annihilation of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The attack was carried out by 18 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda. In the process, the attack shattered the confidence and security of millions of people. The Sinhala Buddhists in Srilanka encouraged violence against Christians and Tamils when the LTTE crumbled. India witnessed fresh religious terror on November 26, 2009. For many people living in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, religion instigated deaths and violence have become a way of life. Religious extremism is taking roots in the West as well. America's extreme right wing conservatives are spreading the same fire of anger and animosity. Just a few weeks ago, law enforcement arrested 3 individuals on terrorism charges.
The fact that we are living in a post modernistic society but are witnessing the restoration of archaic religious wars is as shocking as it is hard to fathom. How can we have globalization on the one hand and the exact opposite on the other? If religion instigates communal violence, it is pertinent to have questions concerning faith, religious organizations and religious leaders. Holy Scriptures of every religious community calls for peace. Why then are their followers engaged in so many violent disputes?

The answer to this contrast could probably be found in the heart of every religion. Religions have always had to balance the doctrine of peaceful coexistence with the need to establish themselves through force. On the one hand, religion preaches love and respect of all. On the other, they also teach that it is acceptable to burn the heretics. Also, religion requires its followers to stick to a stringent moral code. So, while religion tells people that they must love their neighbors, it also sanctions extreme actions if done in the name of preserving the word of God. There is a strange dualism in the heart of every religion in the world.
As a result, religious violence has become the most dangerous issue facing our society today. The mass killing of fellow beings for the sake of justifying individual belief systems is nothing short of shocking. Millions of human beings have already lost their lives in violently shocking ways as wave after wave of religious terrorism and extremism sweeps across the world. Once unimaginable, suicide bombings have become so common that society has almost accepted it as one more type of warfare. While millions of people die due to direct violence, billions become indirect victims of the carnage that is carried out in the name of religion. They die too -- of poverty, unemployment, misguidance and sheer ignorance. Today, there is an unvoiced yet tangible fear of religious extremists using nuclear weapons to subdue the "non-believers'.
As the world becomes equipped with lethal weapons that can wipe out life for millions of kilometers around, it is all the more necessary to carry out some introspection regarding our common perceptions about religion and the direction it is leading us to. Should we allow ourselves to become mere puppets of our religious beliefs? While it is sometimes good to follow the path of a chosen religion, where do we draw the line of distinction and determine what is right and what is wrong?
Billionaire's biggest single grant to an American organisation will allow HRW to expand its reach into developing nations
The billionaire financier George Soros is giving $100 million (£65 million) to America's leading human rights organisation in a move that will enable the group to massively expand its operations around the world.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) will increase its staff of 300 by about a third on the back of the five-year Soros grant, using the new firepower to increase its advocacy in key emerging regions in the developing world. The donation, the largest in HRW's history and bigger than any previous single grant from Soros to a US organisation, aims to help the group fulfil its ambition to boast a truly global reach.
The New York-based organisation, formed in 1978 as Helsinki Watch, has built its reputation as a leading watchdog on governmental abuses around the world. But it has tended to focus its energies on western capitals, believing the best way to improve human rights was to persuade developed countries to use their muscle to effect change.
Increasingly, though, the group has become aware of the strength of developing nations such as Brazil, South Africa and India, who may now hold more sway in their regions than Washington, London or Berlin. The Soros grant will be used to beef up operations in those countries.
"Think of Zimbabwe," Kenneth Roth, HRW's director, said. "The US and European Union all have great policies on Zimbabwe, but it's not enough: the key to changing Mugabe is South Africa."
Roth also gave the example of Sri Lanka, where both the United States and the European Union have strong human rights policies but have failed to prevent president Mahinda Rajapaksa "thumbing their nose at the West". A HRW focus on India and other Asian countries, including China, could have more impact.
Announcing the grant, Soros said they were drawn to the idea of helping the group extend its global influence as part of their philanthropic mission to use their huge wealth, obtained through interventions in the money markets, to forward the cause of open societies.
"Human rights underpin our greatest aspirations: they're at the heart of open societies," they said. "Human Rights Watch must be present in capitals around the globe, addressing local issues, allied with local rights groups and engaging with local government officials."
The grant, Soros said, would inspire a sea-change in the organisation that would result in its largely New York-based management having up to half its board members outside the US.
So far this year Soros has handed out about $800m through their Open Society Foundations. Despite the economic downturn, which has caused a dip in philanthropic giving, Soros has been increasing their largesse recently, partly, they have said, out of recognition of their age – they turned 80 last month – and a desire to distribute much of their wealth during their lifetime.
Soros was born in Hungary.  They are a consummate player of international currencies, and is famous for having made about $1 billion during the Black Wednesday crisis in the UK in 1992.
Their donation comes at an opportune moment for HRW. The group has had a turbulent year, sustaining criticism for its reporting on Gaza war crimes, which it said amounted to a disinformation campaign by the Israeli government. Its own co-founder, Robert Bernstein, has accused the group of bias against Israel in its handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Something magical is happening in the Candy Kitchens at Disneyland park. What is it, you ask? Take a look!
Our candy makers have been hard at work developing this brand-new specialty apple, themed to none other than Sorcerer Mickey. So what makes up this magical treat? I went right to the source, to Candy Production Manager, Michael Contreras, and here's what they had to say. “We cover the apples in creamy caramel, adorn them with marshmallows and enrobe them in milk chocolate. With a little Disney magic, we create the effect of Sorcerer Mickey's pants and robe, yellow belt and bow and top it off with an iconic sorcerer hat.” It's literally the perfect recipe for any Disney fan and anyone with a sweet tooth.
So when and where can you expect to find these spellbinding, hand-made treats? They're available now in our Disneyland Resort candy locations for only $9.99:
If you are wondering whether you'll see them at the Walt Disney World Resort, you're in luck – they will be available at candy locations in the near future.
Will you try it?
Excerpt from the Draft Executive Summary of
Valuing the Oceans, a book to be published later this year
by the Stockholm Environment Institute
Uniting an analysis of the ways multiple threats interact in the ocean with a global economic analysis of the comparative consequences of action or inaction on global environmental change, and in particular climate change, is a major and ongoing challenge.
While there is no universally accepted definition of the “blue economy,” the goal of strengthening it is widely considered requiring that we integrate and make sustainable all sectors and functions that rely on marine resources and ecosystems, allowing them to continue to provide their vital and irreplaceable services.
Some things are too valuable to be assigned meaningful prices. Rather than asking the impossible question of what the ocean itself is worth, what this chapter seeks to at least partially calculate is “what is the value of preventing further damage to the ocean?”
Or, “what is the cost of the environmental damage that could be done to the ocean if we do not take action?”
The analysis is restricted to five categories of damages that can be meaningfully priced and that can realistically be affected by policy decisions taken today and in the coming decades. The difference in climate impacts is measured between two scenarios:
a scenario of only limited, slow-moving abatement, where emissions continue to grow for many decades; and
a rapid abatement scenario, where emissions are reduced quickly and effectively, starting at once and approaching zero within this century.
The best estimates, based on the most reliable and up-to-date analyses available, of the “price” of the five categories of damages discussed here are presented in the table below
By 2050, the value of these important climate impacts is estimated to be more than four times higher under a high emission, high impact scenario.
By 2100, the cost of damage if we follow the high emission pathway rises to USD 1,980 billion, equivalent to 0.37 percent of global GDP.
The difference between the two scenarios, or the amount that can be saved by lowering emissions, is well over a trillion dollars per year by 2100, equivalent to 0.25 percent of GDP.
It is this difference – the avoidable damages – that policy-makers should take particular note of, and that should be included in the complex web of climate change accounting.
This is not a scaremongering forecast. Some people may even argue that the value of protecting these services is not particularly large in the great scheme of things.
However, while considering these figures it is important to remember that they are only the “sum of some things.”
They do not take into account the worth beyond measure of the actual species which live in the ocean; or some of the critical processes and features of the ocean such as nutrient cycling, ecosystem functioning and genetic resources to which meaningful prices cannot be assigned; or the irreplaceable losses to cultural heritage and the dignity and identity of communities that are anticipated to be caused by global environmental change.
The study also does not take into account the total disappearance that is possible – even probable – for certain coastal or island communities, and does not fully consider the catastrophe that will result if global environmental change tipping points are reached.
The figures are also not set in stone, but are subject to change along with the continuous flow of research and discovery. This chapter simply hopes to jumpstart a reasoned debate aimed at guiding policymakers through the monetary value of the services provided by the ocean and what we stand to lose if we do not protect these services, and to encourage the integration of ocean services in economic plans.
Decisions in the coming years will determine whether this trillion-dollar-a-year figure becomes part of the savings made by rapidly reducing carbon emissions, or yet another cost of inaction.

Northern Ireland academics to boycott Israeli universities in Palestine protest BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A number of leading Northern Ireland academics have signed up to an international campaign to boycott Israeli universities over Israel's "illegal occupation" of Palestinian land. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-academics-to-boycott-israeli-universities-in-palestine-protest-34147893.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article34147892.ece/7d7d4/AUTOCROP/h342/2015-10-28_new_14101316_I1.JPG

A number of leading Northern Ireland academics have signed up to an international campaign to boycott Israeli universities over Israel's "illegal occupation" of Palestinian land.
Five academics at Queen's University and one retired Ulster University professor are among 343 academics from the UK who have pledged to withdraw co-operation with Israeli academic institutions.
In a full-page advertisement in yesterday's Guardian newspaper, some of the UK's most prominent figures in higher education underscored their response to "the appeal from Palestinian civil society" with an "Academic Commitment".
In their response to "the intolerable human rights violations that it inflicts on all sections of the Palestinian people" the signatories have declared they will not "accept invitations to visit Israeli academic institutions".
The academics do stress, however, that they will "continue to work with our Israeli colleagues in their individual capacities" but in their declaration describe Israeli universities as being "deeply complicit" with Israeli violations of international law.
The pledge states the educationalists' position will remain "until the State of Israel complies with international law, and respects universal principles of human rights".
Motivated by a "deep concern" for Palestinians the unprecedented step has been taken with "great reluctance", according to Queen's University Professor Phil Scraton. The criminology professor - also a member of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, following their investigative work into the 1989 disaster - stressed yesterday the undertaking was "not done in a flippant way".
They told the Belfast Telegraph: "Of course it's appropriate for academics to speak out. I speak out on Hillsborough, I speak out regularly on the prison service."
At pains to stress the "very carefully worded" document should not be misconstrued, they said: "It's about an international movement of academics making their position clear.
"We believe in academic freedom and the right within that academic freedom to make a clear statement about what we are prepared to do and what we are not prepared to do. It's not saying that we won't work with individual Israelis and I don't hold individuals among my brother and sister academics in Israel responsible; that's not the case." They said it was drawn up after "very deep and hard" consideration of the "sensitive issue".
An Ulster University spokesperson said that Prof Bill Rolston, who also signed the declaration, was "expressing their own personal and individual views."
Speaking for the organisers of the Academic Commitment, Prof Jonathan Rosenhead, of the London School of Economics, said: "Israeli universities are at the heart of Israel's violations of international law and oppression of the Palestinian people. We will be conducting a campaign across the country's universities over the coming months, and inviting fellow academics to contact us if they wish to sign the commitment."

If ever there was a chance for the Gophers to get their season back on track, a road slate with Illinois might be it.
Minnesota was offered a brutal scheduling start to their conference season, having already faced the Big Ten's top five teams (including Michigan State twice). And though the Gophers thankfully stole two impressive road wins over Purdue and Northwestern, their recent five-game skid has put their surprising NCAA Tournament hopes in danger.
Minnesota still sits as a 9 seed in ESPN's Bracketology, which means they're still safely “in” if the season were to end today. That's both good and bad news for Minnesota. Good in the sense that they still control their own destiny if they win the games they should. Bad in the sense that the cushion they gave themselves early in the season by overachieving has evaporated with their losing streak.
On paper, things finally loosen up for the beleaguered Gophers, who get a struggling Illini team that has lost five of its past six games, and six of their last eight. Unfortunately, the game is on the road where wins are never easy. And further complicating matters, the Illini have played their best ball at home, where all three of their conference victories have come.
It's basically put up or shut up time for Minnesota. It's not a “must-win” game in the true sense of the word, but its contests against teams like Illinois where they need to rise above and show they can win games they're supposed to.
Essentials:
Who are the Gophers playing?
Illinois Fighting Illini (13-10, 3-7)
What time are they playing?
3 p.m. CT
Where are they playing?
State Farm Center
Can I watch the game on TV?
Yes, BTN
Can I listen to the game on the radio?
Yes. ESPN 1500.
Tell me more about the opponent.
Illinois had a terrible season last year, finishing 12th ahead of Minnesota and Rutgers, and things haven't been any better this year. Tracy Abrams is a shell of their former self, after missing all of last year with a torn ACL.
The Illini are led by Malcolm Hill, and it's not close. The 6-6 swingman has been dominant all season and really difficult to guard. They have nine games of 20+ points this year, including a 40-point outburst in the second game of the season. They shoot threes, they get to the line and he's really strong.
Senior C Maverick Morgan has stepped up in the latter half of the season with 11 double digit efforts in their last 13 games. They haven't been a force on the boards, however, which should give Reggie Lynch some opportunity ... if they can stay on the court.
Abrams, on the other hand, after averaging more than 10 points per game for two straight years, has only scored more than seven points once since Dec. 12.
Keys to the Game
1. Keep Michael Finke in check
The key to the game for the Illini isn't necessarily Malcolm Hill. He's going to get their points whether the opponent wants to or not. Instead, the Illini have found themselves on the winning side of the coin when sophomore Michael Finke has come to play. He's scored in double digits only three times this conference season, but each of those times has been in a winning effort. He's a 6-10 forward how it can launch threes, and we saw how quickly that sunk the Gophers against Maryland.
2. Shut down the three
If the Maryland game taught us anything it's that the Gophers are not immune to the three ball. They have (had?) a great three-point defense, but were exposed against a hot-shooting Terrapin team. Illinois' offense is hardly prolific, and they've scored 70 or more points only once in their last six games. But when they're putting up big numbers it's because they're hitting threes. If the Gophers can keep the Illini within the three-point stripe they have the advantage.
Predictions
KenPom is giving the edge to the Gophers by 1 in this one 68-67, but it's really a true toss up. In the midst of a five-game slump I can't advocate for Minnesota on the road. I'll take the Illini by 3 in a heartbreaker.
The flooding of the St. Lawrence River has forced the evacuation of dozens of animals at a wildlife sanctuary in Nicolet, in Quebec's Mauricie region.
Around 30 of the 50 animals at Zoo Académie have been removed from the sanctuary as water levels climb.
In an interview with Radio-Canada, zoo owner Jacinthe Bouchard said they worked all night to make sure horses, skunks, a pig and wolves were not trapped in the flooding.
But what's worrying them most is the safety of their two pregnant wolves.
"The biggest problem is that I'm waiting for baby wolves, any day now," they said to Radio-Canada.
For now, the wolves are safe, and Bouchard said zoo staff are monitoring their condition hourly. They said they've been working nonstop to cope with the flooding for the last three days.
"Everything is destroyed. All of my buildings are destroyed," they said.
Nicolet mayor preparing for the worst
Nicolet, northwest of Trois-Rivières and about 150 kilometres northeast of Montreal, is experiencing significant flooding as the St. Lawrence River overflows its banks.
Parts of the area are on high surveillance, and residents have been warned there could be road closures and evacuations.
The town's mayor, Geneviève Dubois, told Radio-Canada that city officials are preparing for the worst, setting up mattresses in the event that homes need to be evacuated and residents need a place to stay.
The municipality is also offering sandbags to anyone who needs them.

Nvidia GeForce Tweak Guide
Last Modified: May 2016
Introduction
Most Nvidia graphics card owners are familiar with the GeForce graphics driver. Previously known as Forceware, and before that, as the Detonator driver, the GeForce driver is the key to harnessing the full potential of your Nvidia GPU. Over the years, Nvidia has been constantly expanding the features contained in their drivers, to the point where the modern GeForce driver package may be seen by some users as a jumble of confusing components and settings. This confusion can cause problems if you're trying to get the best performance and visual quality in a game, or want to troubleshoot unusual behavior.
Once you understand what all of the settings and features actually do, you will soon see that you now have a powerful set of tools to configure things the way you want them; more options equals greater control. Better yet, there are several free utilities which can work with the GeForce driver to give you access to additional driver features, as well as providing even more graphics customization options.
This guide is designed to equip you with the appropriate knowledge to make use of all of the features in the GeForce driver. It covers the correct installation, configuration, and optimization of the Nvidia GeForce graphics driver, including full descriptions and recommendations for all of the key settings in the Nvidia Control Panel. It also covers several free utilities which add useful features and options to the drivers. Everything from the basic to the advanced, it's all contained in this handy reference source for Nvidia graphics card owners.
Note: This guide was first released in 2005, but has been completely rewritten as of early 2015, and will be periodically updated with any major developments in the GeForce drivers.

Steve LeVeille Returning to WBZ-AM 1030 Newsradio
WBZ Newsradio 1030 announced today that the station has found a way to bring back,who had been a talk show host on WBZ 1030 since 1991 before being terminated four weeks ago.
According to WBZ's website, Steve will return to the airwaves in their old time slot next week. We posted news of LeVeille's sudden banishment from the station on January 2, 2009 and we have been bombarded by a multitude of their loyal listeners who were outraged that such a talent was no longer on the air.
Many told us they planned to boycott. The radio station likely heard from some of those same people. At any rate, the station has apparently seen the light and is endeavoring to reinstate LeVeille nearly a month after giving them the boot.
Check out the original story with 166 fan comments. These people made it quite clear they were not happy and they shared that fact with our readers. LeVeille fans are likely dancing in the streets after hearing the good news.

It's fair to say they passed with flying colours. We are, of course, referring to the tough test handed to the coaching staff when it came to replacing the great Andrew Harris in 2016. With both Jeremiah Johnson and Anthony Allen being added within hours of free agency opening, it immediately became one of the biggest competitions from last year's camp. The good news? Both backs embraced it and both played key roles in helping the Lions lead the CFL in rushing yards. Come playoff time Johnson was ultimately the guy and Allen was not re-signed. So the burning question this year in Kamloops has been: how do they divvy up the snaps this time around?
Assistant Running Backs Coach Mike Lionello claims it is a wonderful dilemma to have.
“It's great. Everybody is competing hard,” said Lionello over lunch on Friday.
“JJ (Johnson) is leading the pack, as they should be. Shaq (Murray-Lawrence) has been great, Chris (Rainey) has been amazing and Josh (Harris) is learning playbook. They could be special. Tuesday in Calgary should be interesting.”
Like every training camp there are always a couple of unknowns who can make an impact. Harris and receiver/running back Tyler Davis have turned heads in the first week. One potential X-Factor could be Rainey. The league's most electrifying returner would no doubt make the backfield all that more daunting for opposing defences. The only tricky thing is how much is too much when it comes to the rain man?
“Absolutely, the more they can do the better,” explained Lionello.
“He's so athletic. At the same time, they can't be the focal point. Once they are on the field they are one and teams know that.”
It would be a lot more concerning if they didn't have all of these questions and possibilities. If they can be at or near the top of the league in most rushing categories once again, it no doubt takes a lot of pressure off Jonathon Jennings, their excellent band of receivers and the offensive line.
“That is absolutely the goal,” added Lionello.
“It's a whole team effort. Receivers blocking down field gives us more yards. The possibilities are endless.”
They certainly are. Especially when you consider the offensive line has looked strong from day one of camp.
Breaking Down The Running Backs
Returnees
Jeremiah Johnson, Rolly Lumbala, Shaquille Murray-Lawrence, Nate O'Halloran, Chris Rainey
Newcomers And Where They Came From
Dakota Brush– selected in the fifth round (61st overall) in last month's CFL Draft, Brush excelled as wide receiver in their four year career at Mount Allison. Their breakout season came in 2015 when they hauled in 39 catches for 490 yards and a touchdown. When evaluating the fullbacks, Brush has proven to be a nice complement to Lumbala and O'Halloran.
Tyler Davis– a former German League standout with the Kiel Hurricanes and Munich Cowboys, Davis has proven to be a Swiss Army Knife in both the April OTA and main camp. They were a defensive back in college and played wide receiver overseas. The fact they can play three different positions leads us to believe they can earn a roster spot when camp breaks.
Josh Harris– the most experience newcomer in the backfield, Harris has migrated north after spending parts of two seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. They had nine carries for 16 yards before being released to start 2015. The Wake Forest product could be valuable if the club elects to give Johnson the odd week off. Harris was originally signed to the practice roster as part of last year's NFL expansion period in October.
The Elder Statesmen
Lumbala Strong. Rolly has proven to be one of the club's most valuable Canadian draft picks of the last decade. They enter season number ten and will once again be valuable in short yardage situations, blocking and field goal protection. The ultimate team guy shows no signs of slowing down. Murray-Lawrence is now second in terms of service and will also be counted on for their versatility on special teams.
The Big Question
Can they build off the 2017 greatness? It is no doubt a very tough act to follow and it could hinge on starting someone other than Johnson every couple two or three weeks, but as much as this offence can be potent, they also want it to be balanced.
It Could Happen In 2017
Johnson is just 395 rushing yards shy of 2,000 for their career. If Lumbala plays all 18 games that would be seven consecutive seasons they have not missed a contest. Game number 15 will be the 150th of their career.
Quotable
“You want the guys to actually experience the heat. Our guys are doing a great job. Josh Harris is getting the offence down pat. Dakota is becoming a great route runner. As for Shaq and the other guys, those guys are bringing what they have to the table. Everything is really good right now and we want to keep that going.”- Johnson on how the young guys are progressing through camp.
