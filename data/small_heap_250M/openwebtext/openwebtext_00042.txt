As it turns out, philosophy is a lot more useful when you're out in the real world rather than in a classroom.
May, 1968.
Thousands of young Parisian students crowded the streets, chanting slogans, waving banners, and shouting for the release of scores of political dissidents and activists who had been arrested and imprisoned weeks earlier. As night fell the would-be revolutionaries barricaded the Latin Quarter, determined not to end the occupation until the government met their demands.
The evenings that followed were full of excited speculation. The revolutions that had changed Russia, China, and Cuba had finally arrived in France. The exploitation of the poor and working class had finally reached its boiling point and glorious uprisings would surge across the country and perhaps even the world.
But it was not to be.
The leaders of the protesters agreed to compromises with the French government, and the striking students and workers returned to their universities and their factories. The promise of change had been betrayed, and many were left to wonder if the prophecies of a brave, new world were ever true at all.
This was the birth of Postmodernism.
Who Thought It Up
While rooted in concepts pioneered by such philosophers as Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Camus, the most formative event of the young philosophy came in the disillusionment following the failed strikes of 1968. Many of the protestors, young socialists and anarchists had been confident that revolution was inevitable – that all history had been leading up to this very conflict where new forces would sweep away the old. When these protests ended, not with a bang but a whimper, many concluded that there was no overarching path of history.
Of course, it gets more complicated than that.
As you'll soon discover, the entire point of the philosophy is that it's not so much “about” something as it is a rebellion against everything – this definition included. Keep that in mind, it'll make things clearer as we forge ahead.
What It's All About
No Meta-Narratives
“Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives . . . The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language…”
Jean-Francois Lyotard, “The Postmodern Condition”
Since the dawn of time, humanity has been attempting to discover a system to make sense of life, the universe, and everything. Where did we come from? Where are we going? What's the final conclusion of our species' existence? Many religions provided a grand picture of a struggle between good and evil, culminating in an apocalypse. Others have claimed that history can be boiled down to the battles of concepts and philosophies. Still others have asserted that it's about a struggle between social classes.
Who's right?
According to Postmodernism: Nobody.
Nothing guides the course of history and, at the end of the day, stuff just “happens”. Chaos and random chance, often so small we'd never notice it, are responsible for the way the world is. Now that doesn't just apply to history, it applies to our entire worldview. If there is no real way of categorizing or measuring history, there's no real way of categorizing or measuring anything. Sexuality is probably where we see this most pronounced, with the idea that there are no distinct “sets” of people. Straight, gay, bisexual – all of that fails. What you are is what you are, and trying to make yourself (or anyone else) fit into some grand scheme is as pointless as it is impractical. Life is just too complex to be hacked down into neat little pieces.
Deconstructionism
“In old times, you see, a man who wanted to educate himself . . . [he] would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historians and philosophers . . . all the intellectual work that came in his way. But in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation.”
-Leo Tolstoy, “Anna Karina”
While by no means the founder of Postmodernism, French thinker and literary critic Jacques Derrida was certainly one of the men who helped make it what it is. In a 1963 paper Derrida began to point out what he believed to be a chief failing in our ability to truly understand the meaning of anything. Our thoughts, our theories, our perspectives – all of it was based on faulty presuppositions. He called this process “deconstructionism”.
At its most basic, “deconstructionism” holds that meaning (of anything) is given, rather than inherent. In other words, something can only be considered “strong” when compared to something that's “weak”. That might sound simple, until we start taking into account that “strong” and “weak” both have a host of different meanings when applied in different contexts. What makes a building strong is not what makes an argument strong and certainly not what makes a man strong. Even worse, we all have vastly diverse opinions on what makes a man “strong”. Are we talking about strength of will or strength of character? And what is strength of character? Heck, even the term “deconstructionism” can be deconstructed.
Pluralism
“Things are set up as contraries that are not even in the same category. Listen to me: the opposite of radical is superficial, the opposite of liberal is stingy; the opposite of conservative is destructive. Thus I will describe myself as a radical conservative liberal . . . Beware of those who use words to mean their opposites. At the same time have pity on them, for usually this trick is their only stock in trade.”
–R. A. Lafferty, “The Flame is Green”
It's not unusual for folks to accuse Postmodernism as not really being “about” anything, and more than likely you'd get Postmodernists wholeheartedly agreeing with that. If Postmodernism had to be about something, it's about skepticism – rebelling against the tyranny of definitions and structure. Arriving in an age when the clash of cultures was already underway, Postmodernists argued that one shouldn't be forced to choose between conservative vs liberal, or left vs right, or Eastern vs Western, or communal vs individual. With so much chaos many concluded that it was impossible for anyone to claim a monopoly over truth, and frankly, why should one have to choose? If one person chooses to live a life of simplicity and another person chooses to pursue decadent luxury, who can say which is better? So long as people are free to choose, does it even really matter?
Postmodernism, you have to remember, didn't grow out of a need to make sense of the world but out of a failure of the world to make sense. That might sound infuriatingly vague, and again, you wouldn't be wrong. Rather than trying to think of the philosophy as instructions on whereto go, try to think of it as a guide on howtogetanywhere. The pieces will start to fall into place, and all of that leads to the concept of…
Acceptance
“The preceding merely defines a way of thinking. But the point is to live.”
-Camus, “The Myth of Sisyphus”
So where do we go from here? If nothing can be absolutely known, and if there's no absolute truth, how on earth are we supposed to do, well, anything? The Postmodernist answer is simple: Choose.
French philosopher Albert Camus, who contributed heavily to Postmodernist philosophy, argued that life simply does not make sense. That even if there is meaning, our ability to comprehend it will always be lacking. But life isn't a means to an end, it is the end. We have to go to our graves “unresolved”, but with the knowledge that we experienced as much as we could. Definitions, categorization, grandiose pictures of how the universe is supposed to be – all of that only keeps us from being all that we can be. Claiming to have figured out the world only keeps us from figuring out ourselves. Leave definitions up to someone else.
Postmodernism is still young as philosophies go, and while there's no shortage of criticisms being lobbied at it, the advantages of the concept can't be denied.
You're given the freedom to make yourself whatever you want to be. You want to eat breakfast on the roof or move to Bali to work as a professional pearl-diver and handbag salesman? Well who's to say that you shouldn't? Radical skepticism might not provide any answers, but what it does give us is options.
What It Means To Us
With all the radical doubt and relativism that goes into Postmodernism, some might be tempted to write off the whole philosophy as deeply pessimistic. And while there may be something to be said there, “cynical” is just one way of seeing it. As a way of living life it could just as easily be painted as new and exciting.
The philosophy smashes through centuries of preconception on what the world is supposed to be, and provides us with a fresh appreciation for everything. What is art? What is music? What is healthy? What's balanced? What's noble?
If a how-to book on life is what we're searching for let's be clear: Postmodernism doesn't have the answer for us. Unlike other philosophies, Postmodernism doesn't attempt to present a set of final conclusions about the nature of the universe but rather, a place to start. In this modern world, full of conflicting ideas and truths, we need a way to effectively engage with all of them and do with them what we will.
We have to open ourselves up. Every new idea, every new experience, every new interpretation could have some kind of value. More often than not, the folks who claim to have it all figured out are the most clueless of all of us, and it's going to take skepticism, tolerance, and a healthy sense of adventure to get through all the highs and lows. Always be reinventing yourself. Always be looking for something new and take joy just in the fact that you're looking.
Life's a rollercoaster: Are you going to spend your time trying to figure out the mechanics behind it or just enjoy the ride?
Required Reading
The Myth of Sisyphus: and Other Essays by Albert Camus – While not entirely a Postmodernist himself, Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus offers us many of the principles that the philosophy was built upon. Calling for a revolt against the absurdity of life, Camus provides stirring challenges to rise up and live it to its fullest.
Writing and Difference by Jacques Derrida – Postmodernist literature is notoriously difficult to read, and Jacques Derrida's collected work is no different. Still, for the bold (or masochistic) reader Writing and Difference provides the key points of Postmodernism's critique of the world we live in and how little we truly understand it.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams – There are plenty of books out there which will try to tell you what Postmodernism is, but precious few that are able to show you that philosophy in action. One such exception is the madcap classic The Hitchhiker's Guide the Galaxy – a hilarious, absurdist adventure to find the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.
Greed, for lack of a better word, is apparently no longer good.
A deadpan new PSA for the FBI replays an iconic, oft-quoted '80s movie scene before trotting out none other than Michael Douglas himself to rail against it. "In the movie 'Wall Street,' I play Gordon Gekko, a greedy corporate executive who cheated to profit while innocent investors lost their savings," he says. "The movie was fiction, but the problem is real."

Douglas goes on to explain that "Our economy is increasingly dependent on the success and the integrity of the financial markets," and, "If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is," before directing the viewer to contact the FBI for information on securities fraud.
Speaking in BusinessWeek this week, FBI Special Agent David Chaves revealed that the spot grew out of the FBI's desire to call attention to their Martha Stewart-sounding "Perfect Hedge" initiative, and to make clear that they still wear the pants, enforcement-wise. "At one point it was reported that the SEC was arresting people," Chaves said. "That's when I took the position that we need to be clear on what's going on." And who could the FBI recruit to hammer home the message? "I thought there was only one person to do it," said Chaves: the guy who played ultimate insider douchebag himself.
It's a noble effort -- and a well-timed attempt at public relations -- in a recessionary year, one in which the words "Wall Street" have become synonymous with "occupy." It's a chance for the U.S. government to look like the good guys, as opposed to just those corporate butt-kissers. But it's also amusing to see an actor explain that one of his old movies is in fact fiction. I'd like to see Al Pacino working for the Drug Enforcement Authority, explaining that he isn't a Cuban coke lord. Or Harrison Ford saying that he isn't really a replicant – OR IS HE?
Douglas, for his part, says the subtleties of the original film seem to have been lost on the cineastes of the financial world. The Times reports that "Mr. Douglas would receive high-fives and handshakes from real-life traders and bankers when he walked the streets of Manhattan." And now Douglas would like to remind them that just like their hero, they can go to jail.
British Columbia is close to the front of the pack when it comes to private medical clinics charging extra user fees to patients, according to a survey conducted by advocates for public health care.
The Ontario Health Coalition study alleges there may be improper billing at 30 of 34 private clinics in B.C. and at a total of 88 clinics across the country.
According to the coalition, only Quebec — at 31 clinics — had a higher number of facilities with suspect billing.
These clinics appear to be charging patients for services that are already covered through the public health-care system, the authors say.
"[These fees] interfere with the whole premise of Canadian public health care, which is of course that when we need care we should be able to get it, no matter how much we can afford to pay or not," said Adam Lynes-Ford of the B.C. Health Coalition, which sponsored the study.
"In this case, patients are paying sometimes huge amounts of money — up to five times more than the cost of those services in the public system."
For example, private B.C. clinics billed patients between $650 and $995 for MRI scans and more than $8,000 for knee surgery to repair a torn ACL, according to the study. In a handful of cases, those clinics also asked people for their health cards, raising the possibility that both MSP — and individual patients — are being billed for the same services.
The Canada Health Act specifically forbids patient payments for "medically necessary" services, and the coalition is calling for the user fees to be investigated as violations of the act.

The issue of billing for private health-care services is currently the subject of a long-running legal battle between the B.C. government and Dr. Brian Day, the owner of Vancouver's Cambie Surgery Centre
A 2012 provincial audit of Cambie Surgery turned up a half-million dollar worth of illegal billing.
Both the provincial and federal governments have the responsibility to protect patients from improper billing, according to Lynes-Ford.
But he also believes the provincial government can also address the issue by improving the service British Columbians get within the public system.
"We know that in B.C. we faced, in some cases, some of the longest waits for procedures in the country. Some patients feel trapped and so they're going to private clinics to get the care they need in a timely way, so they're really getting taken advantage of that," he said.
In an email, a spokesperson for Health Canada says these types of violations should be reported to the provincial government, because the federal government has no authority to investigate allegations of extra billing.
"When Canadians pay for their health-care services through their tax dollars, they should not be asked to pay again, by way of user fees, when they access those services," the statement said.
The Canadian Health Coalition is a public advocacy organization founded in 1979 to promote the preservation and improvement of the universal public health-care system in Canada.
HBO's Bill Maher clashed with his “Real Time” panel Friday in a heated debate over Islam's role in this week's London terror attack.
A man rammed a truck into people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer outside the house of Parliament. The Wednesday attack killed four, including one American. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria called the attacker a “a soldier of the Islamic State.”
"This is another example where we take one group of people and we demonize them," said Louise Mensch, a Heat Street columnist and former Conservative member of the U.K. Parliament.

"The guy was British-born. His name was Adrian before his converted. And partisans of Russia were out in the streets saying it was an illegal immigrant who did it, trying to turn the London people against our Muslim friends and neighbors. And you're not going to do that."
Maher, who often clashes with guests on his program regarding radical Islamic terrorism, disagreed with Mensch's take.
"Let's not pretend this has nothing to do with Islam, the religion," he said.
"It doesn't," Mensch responded. "It has nothing to do with Islam the same way Timothy McVeigh had nothing to do with Roman Catholicism."
McVeigh carried out the 1995 bombing of a government building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.
"Every time some bomb goes off, before it goes off, somebody yells ‘Allahu Akbar!'” said Maher. "I never hear anybody go ‘Merry Christmas! This one's for the flying nun!' ”
"When Christians do anything like this, do we ever say, 'Christian terrorism'?” asked Yale professor and author Timothy Snyder.
"No. But is Christian terrorism as big a problem?" asked Maher in response.
"If you lived in Oklahoma City in the 90s," injected MSNBC host Chris Hayes. "We're talking about London here."
"That's a false equivalency," Maher shot back. "Are there Christian terrorist armies like ISIS?"
"The IRA that blew up London for 15 years!" Hayes exclaimed.
"Yes. But that's the past! We're living in the now. There was also the Inquisition," retorted Maher.
"Are there Christian terrorist armies now ... like ISIS, al Qaeda, al-Shaabab, Boko Haram? Are there armies like that in the world that aren't Muslim?" he asked. "Let's not f--k around anymore! Can we get real?"
"I literally don't agree with you," Mensch said. "Russia is sending Chechen militants into ISIS trying to leverage this against a billion people."
"Real Time" is enjoying its highest-rated season since 2003, with viewership up almost 40 percent compared to last season.
When including repeat telecasts and streaming views, the program registers an average of almost 5.5 million viewers each week.
Transit police are rolling out the second phase of their campaign to stop sexual assaults against women on Metro Vancouver's transit system.
Transit police have launched a poster warning would-be assailants that “unwanted touching is a crime.”
“It's time to speak directly to the offenders or would-be offenders and to let them know it's not OK to assault women or harass them in any way,” Transit Police Chief Doug Lepard said.
READ MORE: Sexual attacks, security gates hot topics at TransLink AGM
Sexual violence on transit systems is rarely reported, but transit police said the first phase of the campaign — an active texting feature — has led to an increase in calls.
Transit police said they solve about two-thirds of all reported sex offences on SkyTrain. High-quality video surveillance on every car and platform has made it easier to track offenders.
Women's groups have lauded the poster campaign but said more enforcement is needed. Transit police said that is coming, with eight additional officers expected to join their ranks in the months to come.

During the late 1930s, the world was reeling under the ripples of the upcoming war, and fictional rescue rangers, superheroes in particular, provided the public an escape into a fantasy world where all the ills of the world were righted by these larger-than-life heroes.
The names of the caped crusaders who emerged in this era — Superman (debuted in 1938), Batman (debuted in 1939), and Wonder Woman (debuted in 1941) — have become legends and are still with us today.
It was at this time in India that a woman burst onto the screen, first as a princess, then as a masked vigilante, juggling whips, swords, guns, and even pummelling villains with her bare hands.
The year was 1935 and the woman was India's original stunt queen, Fearless Nadia.
Fearless Nadia
A blonde, blue-eyed beauty, Nadia was a hit with the audience from her first film and reigned Bollywood throughout the 1940s. Largely ignored by cinema historians as she performed mainly in the stunt genre, the story of this swashbuckling heroine is something few Indians know.
Born on January 8, 1908, as Mary Ann Evans to a Scottish father and a Greek mother in Perth in Australia, Nadia came to India as a little girl. Her father, Herbert Evans was a volunteer with the British Army and little Mary grew up in India's North-West Frontier Province.
From a young age, she wanted to be a singer and dancer and learned Scottish dances from her father and Greek songs from her mother. She went on to sing in church choirs in school but even as a young girl, she was different. While her classmates played with fluffy soft toys, she spent most of her time with a pony that became her best friend. She also spent time learning fishing, hunting, horse riding and everything normally considered audacious for girls of her age at the time.
When her father passed away during World War I, Mary moved back with her mother to Bombay. Here, she joined a ballet dance school run by Madame Astrova, a Russian dancer, who recognised the young girl's innate talent, and selected her to be part of her travelling troupe.
During her days with the troupe, Mary met an Armenian fortune teller who suggested that she change her name to one beginning with the letter N. She chose Nadia because she is like the “exotic sound” of it!
Nadia was originally born Mary Ann Evans
Other than dancing with the travelling troupe, Nadia also tried her hand at several other jobs. From working in a secretarial position, travelling as a theatre artist to performing as a trapeze artist at a circus, she did it all. She also worked hard to train herself as a gymnast and her graceful cartwheels, daredevil stunts and charming presence soon won her a lot of fans.
Eventually, Nadia left her job at the Zarco Circus and returned to full-time dancing, this time performing to Bollywood songs. Eruch Kanga, a cinema owner from Lahore, spotted her in a performance and suggested her name to J. B. H. Wadia and Homi Wadia, the brothers who owned a major production house called Wadia Movietone.
A meeting was set, and impressed by her striking looks and fearless attitude, the Wadias decided to put Nadia to test. She was asked to learn Hindi and given a small role in two of their upcoming movies, Desh Deepak and Noor-e-Yaman. Her cameos as a slave girl in the former and as a princess in the latter were well-liked by the audience.
Then came the most important moment in Nadia's career. In 1935, the Wadias decided to launch Nadia as a lead heroine in Hunterwali.
A cracker of a film, this movie was the first one to showcase Nadia's fearlessness, her athletic prowess, and her affinity for the stunt genre. The audience loved her – perhaps the fact that as a European, she was fighting on the right side was doubly appealing at a time when India's freedom struggle was foremost in the minds of most Indians.
Over the next decade, Nadia went on to star in over 50 films, performing her own stunts in every single one of them. From swinging from the chandelier and jumping off cliffs to fighting atop a speeding train and befriending lions, she did it all with an ease even men found difficult to achieve. Her fierce yell at wild animals, bandits, and bad boys in general, as she cycled down the road on her way to new adventures, became her signature.
She also risked her life in the line of duty a number of times. Once, while shooting for a fight scene, she fell flat on her face from a great height and another time, she almost got swept away in powerful currents of Bhandardara Falls in Maharashtra.
A champion of truth and justice in almost all her roles, most of Nadia's films were runaway hits, with the Indian audience revelling in her daring stunts and exotic costumes.
She went on to achieve great stardom and became one of the highest paid actresses in the Indian film industry during this period. Such was the adulation she received from public that her moniker ‘Hunterwali' was affixed by many brands of belts, bags, shoes and clothes in the country.
At a time when Indian women were slowly warming up to the idea of acting as a profession, Nadia also emerged a feminist icon, challenging male dominance with rousing lines such as: “Don't be under the assumption that you can lord over today's women. If the nation is to be free, women have to be freed first.”
In 1961, Nadia married Homi Wadia (he gave her the name Fearless Nadia after she sportingly jumped off the roof of a studio set during a shoot) but Indian cinema hadn't seen the last of her.
In 1968, at the age of 60, the fiery actress made a final comeback as a sassy secret agent in Homi Wadia's movie, Khiladi. As time passed, her legacy was gradually forgotten, only to be rediscovered in the 1993 documentary Fearless: The Hunterwali Story.
Made by JBH Wadia's grandson and Roy Wadia's brother, Riyad, the documentary was screened at various international film festivals, bringing her to the attention of India and the world, including Australia, the country where she was born.
In a review by Radio Adelaide just after the release of the documentary, Australian journalist Michelle Smith said that Nadia's films bear “a 1930s-esque innocence, juxtaposed with incredible stunts and spiels about women's rights.”
Today, while her legacy is little-remembered by the Indian film industry, Nadia's works are being studied by cinema experts in many countries, including at UK's School of Oriental and African Studies.

2016 Republican Presidential Polls Show Donald Trump, John Kasich Neck and Neck in Pennsylvania; Hillary Clinton Commanding Lead Over Bernie Sanders
Republican front-runner Donald Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich are locked in a tight, back and forth tug of war for control of the upcoming GOP primary in Pennsylvania.
A new Franklin and Marshall College poll shows Trump narrowly leading Kasich 33 percent to 30 percent, well within the poll's margin of error, with roughly a month before Republican voters there go to the polls.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz lags behind by more than double-digits at just 20 percent.
Kasich's Strong Showing Comes After Early Turmoil
Kasich's strong showing in the Pennsylvania comes after he was forced to endure a challenge to his eligibility to even be on the ballot. He submitted just over the minimum number of signatures required to be on the state's ballot and a challenge from a Marco Rubio supporter had sought to discount enough of the signatures to have him booted off the official rostrum of candidates.
Watch video
The challenge was only withdrawn after Rubio dropped out of the race after suffering what many characterized as a humiliating loss to Trump in his home state of Florida.
Kasich's rising status in Pennsylvania will undoubtedly come as a worrisome development for Cruz supporters, who, up until now, have tirelessly sought to have him exit the race so that their candidate could face off against Trump in a one on one scenario.
Clinton out to Comfortable Lead
On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders 53 percent to 28 percent.
Pollsters noted only eight percent of those polled were in the 18-34 demographic Sanders has dominated throughout election season, while 4-in-10 of them were from the 65 or older crowd Clinton has equally dominated.
Thus far, Trump has won 18 states to a combined 12 for all his other GOP rivals. He also has amassed nearly 800 of the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the Republican nomination outright.
Musical artist and known patriot Kid Rock announced yesterday over Facebook and Twitter that he's planning a run for the U.S. senate in his home state of Michigan, when he exclaimed that the media is once again “wrong” and also took a shot at Senator Debbie Stabenow.
On Wednesday, Kid Rock launched a new website at www.kidrockforsenate.com, so you know that he wasn't playing around, but the media insisted that it was nothing more than a publicity stunt for the sales of merchandising through a link to clothing apparel run by Warner Brothers. This prompted Kid Rock to correct the media over Facebook and Twitter, respectively. Let's be real for a minute, as we always are, since how many times have the media been wrong in the past 18 months, especially when it comes to known Republicans? They've been wrong and entirely false a great deal of times, so it comes as no surprise that Kid Rock also stated that he's “sick and tired of politicians ‘bullshit'”.
Kid Rock wrote, “Once again the press is wrong. First of all, I've got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC! Second, I'm not signed to Warner Brothers!!! – which simple fact checking would have revealed”.
Rock corrected the false and presumptuous news reports by the media, stating,”I have recently worked out a unique deal with BMG, Broken Bow, CAA and Live Nation to release music ON MY TERMS. Like politicians write books during their campaigns, I'm planning on putting out music during mine and IT ALL STARTS TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,”
Kid Rock then added, “It's not a hoax, it's a strategy and marketing 101. No plans for an album or anything else that has been the usual norm in the music business OR politics…..and…..”
The 46-year-old rocker/rapper/artist & patriot, without a shadow of a doubt is running for senate, since in these times of major “BS” in the media and in politics for a very long time already, perhaps Kid Rock is just the candidate to help clean up the state of Michigan, as let's not forget all the dirty water that Flint had to endure under Barack Obama's tenure, just to mention only one flaw from his supposed presidential legacy (major eye roll).
Kid Rock then fired some social media shots at his state opponent Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), yes a Democrat, saying that while she plays in politics, he will be “a voice for the tax paying, hardworking AMERICANS”.
Now let's break down exactly what Kid Rock wrote, “Senator Stabenow and I do share a love of music, although probably not the same kind. I concede she is better at playing politics than I am so I'll keep doing what I do best, which is being a voice for tax paying, hardworking AMERICANS and letting politicians like her know that We the People are sick and tired of their bullsh*t!”
Kid Rock (Robert James Ritchie) was suggested as a possible senate candidate for the Republican Party back in February during the Republican Convention in Michigan, and he was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump in 2016, not something which many celebrities dared to do, but Kid Rock dares to be real in these times of liberal lefties that are still truly whining about Hillary Clinton's epic presidential loss. Whilst, the economy sky rockets, consumer confidence grows, ISIS is being wiped out and employment is up, but you can't make delusional cry-babies happy, so keep on crying ya' muppets!
So, a big hat's off to you Kid Rock, and let's hope your candidacy is a success for the sake of Michigan and for Republicans nationwide. Visit Kid Rock's website/blog for the full announcement here.
Brainstain, over and out!

Facebook said Monday it won't allow the social network to be used to promote terrorism or hate speech as it unveiled a wide-ranging update of its “community standards.”
The new guidelines give more clarity on acceptable posts relating to violence, hate speech, nudity and other contentious topics.
The new document said Facebook will not allow a presence from groups advocating “terrorist activity, organized criminal activity or promoting hate.”
{snip}
The new guidelines say Facebook will take down “graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence.”
On terrorist or criminal organizations, Facebook also said it would not tolerate “supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or condoning their violent activities.”
Facebook said meanwhile that nudity would be banned in many cases but allowed for images of breastfeeding, art or discussions of medical conditions.
“These standards are designed to create an environment where people feel motivated and empowered to treat each other with empathy and respect,” said a blog post from Facebook global policy chief Monika Bickert and deputy general counsel Chris Sonderby.
{snip}
“It's a challenge to maintain one set of standards that meets the needs of a diverse global community,” the blog post said.
“This is particularly challenging for issues such as hate speech. Hate speech has always been banned on Facebook, and in our new community standards, we explain our efforts to keep our community free from this kind of abusive language.”

My grandfather's grandfather, Willard, sold things to people in his community – apples, lumber and other goods.
I'm not sure if he had a store at his farm or whatnot, I just know he kept records of what he sold and who he sold it to because I have a couple of the small ledgers he used for jotting down details.
Like most of the family history stuff I keep, they're all locked up in fireproof containers.
These 1800s ledgers may be historic or rare, heck they could be worth money.
But I'd never sell them or any other items that have been passed down in my family. They have a value that's hard to describe.
Like some of the grainy, black-and-white photos that survived more than a century, these ledgers, photographs and some really old horseshoes are items that my great-great-grandfather touched with his own hands.
So to me, they've still got some of “him” attached to them.
Willard's energy, as far as I'm concerned, still resonates in things he held in his hands and looked at.
They stand as testaments to the continuity of family to me, as proof of my heritage and background. The same goes for items I've been keeping since my wife's Mom Bobbie passed away not too long ago.
Some of her things now decorate the walls in rooms of our home. Her plants – at least the ones I've been able to keep alive – now hang around the windows in the kitchen.
Much of her furniture has either been incorporated into our home's “décor,” for lack of a better word, or still sits safely in space we've made in the garage.
Not everyone finds value in the items left behind when a loved one passes away. And for people like me, it's really difficult to get rid of anything at all. It's all important to me.
WHAT TO DO WITH ITEMS LEFT BEHIND BY A LOVED ONE WHO PASSED AWAY
Some folks detail who gets what in a Last Will & Testament. Others, through family discussion, have already told family members what they want them to have.
When it's unspoken and unwritten, donating items to needy people is a nice gesture.
In New York State, there are a variety outlet able to do just that, depending on what the items are. And you can select one based on other considerations: such as donating to an organization dedicated to helping veterans or to those that are rooted in religious values.
Below you'll find a list of organizations and some details on how to go about getting what your loved one left behind into responsible hands.
PETS
In the event your loved one hasn't made provisions for their house pet like a cat, dog or canary, you can consider adopting that animal or finding a relative who would be willing to care for it.
When that fails, you can give the pet to a shelter and hope they find someone to take care of it.
Sometimes, however, these animals are “put to sleep.”
You can find an animal shelter that can get the pet adopted on the No Kill Network website – just click on your home state and you'll see a whole list of shelters that don't kill pets. CLICK HERE to visit the website.
FOOD
If you're cleaning out a pantry, goods can often be donated to organizations that help hungry people.

Real Madrid are ready to make an initial move for David De Gea next week as they prepare to test Manchester United's determination to keep the Spain goalkeeper.
United have yet to receive any approach from Real for De Gea but the Spanish club are expected to formalise their interest once Saturday's Champions League final against Juventus is out of the way.
Real have been keen to avoid any unnecessary distractions in the lead up to the final in Cardiff as they bid to become the first club in the Champions League era to retain the European Cup.
They tried and failed to sign De Gea two years ago when a deal that would have seen Real's Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas move to Old Trafford as part of a £29 million package collapsed amid much acrimony on transfer deadline day in September 2015.
But Real believe they can land De Gea at the second time of asking as they seek a long-term upgrade on Navas, even though they face a fight to prise the £60 million rated goalkeeper from United.
Guy Vidra, the CEO of The New Republic, is stepping down and will leave the company entirely at the end of the month, marking the second major exit from the publication since publisher Win McCormack purchased the magazine from Chris Hughes in Februrary.
“I want to let you know that I have decided to transition to an advisory role at TNR,” Vidra said in an internal staff memo, which was reviewed by POLITICO. “I will continue in this capacity through the end of the month and will then make myself available to help as the magazine moves forward to a promising future under Hamilton Fish and Win McCormack.”
Vidra's departure comes just a week after POLITICO broke the news that TNR editor-in-chief Gabriel Snyder would leave the publication. Snyder's resignation was described by sources as a forced decision that made room for McCormack's chosen leadership.
Vidra, the former head of Yahoo News, was hired in October 2014 by former TNR owner Chris Hughes to steer the company toward Hughes's vision. But Vidra's Silicon Valley pedigree and tendency to speak “in passages pulled directly from venture capitalist Ben Horowitz's book,” according to Vanity Fair's Sarah Ellison , clashed with The New Republic's culture. His appointment led to a massive fallout at the magazine, including a mass resignation of two-thirds of New Republic staff.
Hughes announced early this year that he would put the magazine up for sale, effectively throwing in the towel on a four-year attempt to turn the publication around. Less than two months later, Hughes struck a deal with McCormack, a New York and Portland-based publisher. McCormack brought on Hamilton Fish as publisher and editorial director.
Vidra's entire note to staff is below:
After thorough consideration and reviewing the feedback of players all over the world, we've made a few changes to the balance of the game. We previously tested these changes in the Balance Test Map and are now ready to move forward with them. You can expect to see the following adjustments applied to Legacy of the Void multiplayer today.
Balance Changes
Zerg
Queen Anti-air weapon range increased from 7 to 8
Spore Crawler Root time decreased from 6 to 4
If you're interested in the StarCraft II Balance Team's reasoning behind each change, you can check out David Kim's recent forum post on the changes.
We continue to appreciate all the feedback we've received from the community as it helps shape each of our updates, and we hope you'll continue to participate in future balance testing. Until next time, we hope you enjoy these changes!
On average, up to three College Football Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. I wrote as much a year ago, and it's been worth repeating, mantra-style, almost every day since then.
To maintain faith in the Playoff selection committee, you might occasionally need to remind yourself that its job is relatively easy. Because every time we learn more about the process, the more we learn about the flaws of the process.
Fox Sports' Stewart Mandel told us in September that the committee would not be using any sort of strength-of-schedule variable. ("We could build a fancy algorithm, but kind of how the Supreme Court said you know pornography when you see it, you just know a hard schedule when you see it.")
And today, via CBS' Jerry Palm, who took part in last week's media mock selection process, we learned more about that and margin of victory, once eliminated from BCS formulas because of the unsporting nature of huge wins, not being part of the Playoff discussion.
Of course, you can see the schedule itself. The opponent, the opponent's record and the result of each game are listed. They also separate out wins against teams with records above .500 and losses to those below .500. Other than that, all you get is the old BCS version of each team's collective opponents' record, and opponents' opponents' record. There are no other ratings. [C]ommittee members get a litany of stats about each team that not only fail to help determine strength of schedule, they don't even help determine a team's ability to win games, and that's important too. Instead, team sheets have data from 26 statistical categories, about 2/3 of which are yardage based. The others are points based, and there are a couple that combine points and yards but one can't use any of that to determine strength of schedule. [...] [A]n even more meaningful stat isn't even allowed in the room. Margin of victory. Nothing correlates as well to winning percentage as MOV, but that isn't politically correct. When we were discussing various data points in our mock meeting last week, a couple members brought up stats from other sources, and real committee chair Jeff Long stopped us from using them. He said since the formulas for stats that were brought up were unknown, they would not be allowed to use them as discussion points in the room.
A few quick points here:
1. "They also separate out wins against teams with records above .500 and losses to those below .500." Your eye is going to naturally gravitate toward whatever information you are given when attempting to differentiate between Team A and Team B. Because it is available, the committee will look at the "above .500" and "below .500" records.
And they'll be using a number that values a win over a 7-5 team (by one point or by 50) the same as a win over a 12-1 team (by one or by 50). If you lose to a team that went 5-7 (by one or by 50), that's bad. If you lose to a team that went 7-5 (by one or by 50), that might be OK.
This might be even worse than simply providing a team's record.
2. "Instead, team sheets have data from 26 statistical categories, about 2/3 of which are yardage based." Palm confirmed to me on Twitter that some of these measures are at least per-play measures. That's good, as yards-per-play is the most descriptive of any primary statistic.
But the fact that any raw per-game stats are going to be used is depressing. It's 2014. We are in the era of pace. Baylor games produce completely different yardage and point expectations than Florida State or Stanford games. Per-game stats have become irrelevant.
I heard from another mock committee member that the tools given to them are useful and impressive when trying to compare one team to another. That's good. But that only matters so much, if you're looking at the wrong data.
3. "Nothing correlates as well to winning percentage as MOV, but that isn't politically correct." Football is a man's man's game. It's about grit and fortitude, leadership and sacrifice. It's a battle. It's a war. No sensitive souls need to apply.
But my goodness, if you don't call off the dogs in the fourth quarter, somebody might get their feelings hurt! And we can't take that chance!
4. "He said since the formulas for stats that were brought up were unknown, they would not be allowed to use them as discussion points in the room." Palm is a well-known figure in the stats world, in part because of his creation of the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI), which was basically the at-a-glance measure of choice for college basketball for nearly two decades. It is as transparent gets, comparing your win percentage to your opponent's win percentage to your opponent's opponents' win percentage.
As one would expect, Palm is pretty big on transparency. But his measure is only an at-a-glance résumé measure, one that isn't intended to be evaluative of actual play or predictive of future play. And those types of formulas don't work very well with 12-game seasons. You might have to dial into the per-play or per-possession data, like Ken Pomeroy does for college basketball. And when you do that, things get messy -- particularly the opponent-adjustment part -- and sharing formulas loses its purpose.
That's the bad news. The good news: no matter what goes into a given measure, you can judge a formula based on its performance. Jeff Sagarin's numbers go back to 1998. Ours at Football Outsiders go back to 2005. Along with sharing the components I use, I personally try to list the components that go into my ratings, and I share weekly/yearly results at Football Study Hall so you can see how they're measuring up against the actual schedule. (They're pretty good for gauging win probability and creating a hierarchy. They're not great if you're looking to break Vegas.) There are countless other formulas out there with varying complexity and all sorts of variables. Pick some out. Give them a test drive. Grill the creator of the measure for more information. Find the one that suits your needs.
Any number of them will be more useful than saying in December that Florida State is 7-0 against teams above .500.
Never mind given measures, though. With fancy tools and all sorts of gravitas in the room, the committee is being asked to actively avoid information that would be helpful to the cause of picking four playoff teams. In 2014, with infinite information available at fingertips, that is depressing.
On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious. On average, up to three Playoff teams will be painfully obvious ...
THE GUN RIGHTS lobby has spent considerable time and energy in pursuit of one goal: crippling the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). It has largely succeeded — and with dire consequences.
Concerned to the point of paranoia about the erosion of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the National Rifle Association and far too many lawmakers have fought against virtually every proposal to empower the bureau to better track and crack down on illegal firearms. They have won reductions in the ATF's already meager budget. They have restricted the bureau's ability to share information with other law enforcement agencies. They have kept the bureau rudderless for the past six years by blocking confirmation of new directors. And they continue to fight new rules that would allow the bureau to track bulk sales of long guns that have played a major role in the drug-fueled violence in Mexico.
Now, the very critics who have tied the bureau's hands are expressing outrage over a novel, and we would agree questionable, ATF operation intended to curb gun smuggling into Mexico.
Operation Fast and Furious was launched in 2009 and was centered in the ATF's Phoenix office, where agents surveilled straw purchases of AK-47 knockoffs and other high-powered weapons known to be favorites of the drug cartels. The agents did not try to seize the weapons but instead watched as straw buyers made repeated visits and passed firearms to third parties. In January, the Justice Department indicted some 30 relatively low-level individuals on charges of gun running and making straw purchases.
The ATF had hoped to move against higher-ups in the chain of command, but the operation went awry when the bureau lost track of 2,500 weapons, some of which have now been traced to criminal activity south of the border. Two such weapons were found in December at the scene of the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent.
The Justice Department's Office of Inspector General and Congress are investigating, understandably. The probes could help to explain what went wrong and what could or should have been done differently. But Capitol Hill's intense interest in the ATF should not stop there.
Lawmakers should give the ATF the tools it needs to fight illegal gun trafficking. They should enact stronger penalties for straw purchases and craft a federal gun-smuggling statute; close the gun-show loophole, which allows buyers under certain circumstances to purchase weapons without a background check; resuscitate the ban on assault weapons; and give the ATF the authority to collect data on multiple sales of long guns in border states. The Senate should move quickly to confirm a director for the long-leaderless bureau.
We may never know whether the bureau would have launched the Fast and Furious operation had it had other, more effective tools at its disposal. Those who would clobber the bureau for possible mistakes should look in the mirror and accept some responsibility for its failings.
Azen is one of the strongest mental players in SSBM history, and if tonight is any indication he is ready to retake his place as a dominant force in tournament play.​
For those eagerly awaiting the return of Azen, he is back - and did not disappoint.

He was a subject of the well-received documentary The Smash Brothers and had been a contender at every tournament he attended until his retirement in 2009. Since then, Azen attended Pound V in 2011 before receding from the community once again. Azen was scheduled to attend Bar Wars 2 earlier this year but was unable to attend. Tonight was Azen's first tournament in approximately three years.Project M is about to start, so if you want to see Azen work his magic in that game as well, tune in to VGBootcamp right now !

The new ownership group -- which, according to SI.com, includes venture capitalist Henry Nguyen, Mandalay Entertainment Chairman and CEO Peter Guber, former NBA executive and current ESPN analyst Tom Penn, and current Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan -- will be officially introduced on Thursday. That announcement will also shed light on the group's plans to build a soccer stadium in the Los Angeles area.
"As part of our new strategy for Southern California -- a major hotbed of soccer participation and fan support -- we believe that engaging with a new ownership group which has the resources and local community ties, and a plan for a dedicated soccer-specific stadium, provides us with the best chance for success," MLS commissioner Don Garber said in a statement.
ESPNFC.com reported last month that MLS would shut down the club. Sources with knowledge of the situation said that players and staff were informed on Monday morning of the league's plans and that MLS said it would assist the club's employees in finding new jobs.
As for the players, the league announced that it will hold a dispersal draft "at a later date," while sources said MLS intends to hold the draft around Dec. 1. It is not clear at present whether expansion teams New York City FC and Orlando City will be included, as the source said there are still some details to be ironed out with the MLS players' union.
Striker Erick 'Cubo' Torres will remain in MLS, but it is unclear where he will play next season.
Sources also said that Mexico international striker Erick "Cubo" Torres -- who led Chivas USA in scoring this year with 15 goals -- is unlikely to be included in the draft. The league is in the process of exercising the option on Torres' contract, and sources have said Torres likely will be made a designated player. How Torres would then be allocated hasn't been determined.
The move to disband Chivas USA means the league will operate with 20 teams next year and will be composed of two 10-team conferences. With Orlando and New York City FC entering the league next year, Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo will move to the Western Conference.

When Chivas USA joined MLS in 2005, the hope was that the club would capture the large Latino fan base present in the area. However, the team has struggled, both on and off the field.
While the club did enjoy a brief spell of success from 2006 to 2009 when it made the playoffs four consecutive years, Chivas USA always seemed to operate in the shadow of the L.A. Galaxy, with whom it shared StubHub Center in Carson as a home venue.
Garber said in an interview with ESPNFC.com that targeting the Latino market was likely doomed from the start, but that times have changed for the league since those days.
"I think it was a more bad idea than bad execution," Garber said of the marketing strategy. "Hindsight is 20/20. I'd do it all again the same way. What I hope everybody can remember is at that time; MLS was in a very different place than it is today. Things were really difficult. [Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake] were our 11th and 12th teams. Next year we'll have 20.
"It's a difficult business that we're all in, whether you're in soccer or any other professional sport. Everything needs to be perfectly aligned. Unfortunately it didn't happen with Chivas USA and we've learned from some of the decisions we made then and now have put a new strategy in place that addresses all of those decisions."
Chivas USA's image took a even bigger hit in 2013. After Jorge Vergara bought out co-owners Antonio and Lorenzo Cue in 2012, he held a meeting with team staff at which it was alleged that he said, "If you don't speak Spanish, you can go work for the Galaxy, unless you speak Chinese, which is not even a language," according to a lawsuit filed against the club.
That sparked a series of discrimination lawsuits, one of which included youth coaches Ted Chronopoulos and Dan Calichman. That suit, as well as one filed by the onetime head of human resources, Cynthia Craig, was settled out of court.
Combined with the club's inability to find a stadium of its own, attendance suffered. The average attendance for the club's home games this year was just 7,063 fans, less than half that of the team just above Chivas USA in the attendance rankings, the San Jose Earthquakes.
But San Jose played most of its home games in a home venue that held just 10,525 fans while constructing a new 18,000-capacity stadium that will open next season.
One executive said that there were Chivas USA home games this year with fewer than 1,000 customers in the building.
Thomas 'TJ' Hickey's family seeks apology on 10th anniversary of teenager's death in Redfern riot
Updated
A decade after the death of Thomas "TJ" Hickey, passions remain strong in the Sydney suburb of Redfern.
The Hickey family and supporters will today mark the anniversary with a rally to demand an apology from the New South Wales Parliament over the 17-year-old's death.
They are also seeking permission to mount a controversial memorial plaque at the fence where the teenager was impaled in 2004.
TJ's death sparked a nine-hour riot in which Redfern railway station was set on fire and police were pelted with rocks, bricks and bottles, leaving more than 40 officers injured.
Following an inquest, a coroner found no evidence the teenager, who was riding his bicycle, was being pursued by police when he died, even though a police car had followed him down a pathway.
Coroner John Abernethy found the death was due to a "freak accident" and police were not responsible.
The Hickey family disagrees with the findings.
They maintain TJ was chased to his death by police and have spent years campaigning for a fresh inquest.
Ray Jackson from the Indigenous Social Justice Association, which is organising today's march, says he has written to two government ministers seeking action.
He says he has asked Police Minister Mike Gallacher to intervene in the long-running dispute over the wording of a memorial plaque.
TJ Hickey's mother will lead the march to Parliament
Mr Jackson says the Hickey family has created a plaque stating TJ died as a result of a police pursuit, but Redfern police will not agree to it being placed at a memorial site.
"Why change history? Why change the facts of how her son died? TJ died as a result of a police pursuit. TJ's bike was rammed by a car driven by a Redfern police officer. She's not going to change that just to mollify the sensibilities of Redfern police," he said.
Gail Hickey will carry the memorial plaque as she leads the march to State Parliament.
Mr Jackson says he has asked the Mr Gallacher and Attorney-General Greg Smith to greet the protestors when they arrive at Macquarie Street but expects his request to be ignored.
He insists that will not stop the campaign for justice to be served.
"If we don't get an apology, if we don't get permission to put the plaque up, if we don't get a new investigation and a new inquest, we will continue the struggle for 11 years, 12 years, 15, 20, 25, 30 years," he said.
"However long the Hickey family wishes to march, we will march with them."
Mr Jackson says he is seeking a parliamentary apology to the Hickey family, similar to the one given last year by the West Australian Parliament to the family of John Pat.
The teenager died in police custody at Roebourne in north-west WA in 1983.
Four police officers and a police aide were charged with the 16-year-old's manslaughter but were all acquitted at trial.
Mr Jackson says the Hickey family needs similar recognition that a wrong has been done and hopefully will not have to wait 30 years for it like the Pat family.
"If you read the apology from the Western Australian Government it does not admit to any blame on behalf of the police. What it says is we recognise your sorrow and we're sorry for it," Mr Jackson said.

When we last saw college basketball, nearly six months ago, the on-court product was in excellent shape. Kris Jenkins gave us the greatest ending ever to a national championship game; Villanova, North Carolina and Buddy Hield, among others, collaborated on a well-above-average NCAA tournament; and the implementation of a 30-second shot clock reversed a decline in scoring and pace. In a few weeks on SI.com, we'll begin previewing the 2016–17 season on a player-and-team level, unveiling our projection system's forecasts for individual stats and conference races, and its 1–351 national rankings. Before that, I wanted to take a big-picture, analytic look at the state of the sport itself—how it's changed (or remained the same) during the past five seasons, the impact of the new shot clock and where college hoops stands in relation to the NBA.
• College hoops is the real home of three-point volume.
As the Warriors dominated all basketball discussion last season and were hailed as revolutionaries, they took 36.2% of their shots from long-range—the second-highest three-point rate in the NBA, behind the Rockets—and the league as a whole had an alltime high three-point rate of 28.5%. Meanwhile, in college, the national three-point rate hit an alltime high of 35.4%, and three of the four Final Four teams (Villanova, Oklahoma and Syracuse) took more than 40% of their shots on the season from deep. College, with its smaller arc, zone defenses and wider distribution of talent, is naturally a more three-point-conducive environment—and one that may experience a few more seasons of three-point-rate increases before it plateaus and gives the NBA a chance to catch up.
• College pick-and-roll volume is increasing at the same rate as it is in the NBA—but it's still well below the NBA. College teams iso slightly more than the NBA does, though.
Five seasons ago, college teams finished an average of 14.8% of their halfcourt possessions in the pick-and-roll (or with passes out of the P&R), according to my analysis of Synergy Sports Technology's team-by-team logs. While that rate has increased every season since, hitting 21.3% in ‘15–16, it's significantly lower than the NBA's most recent rate of 32.4%. College hoops are unlikely to close that gap; it still has plenty of motion-offense proponents, and 20% of a college team's possessions (on average) occur against zone defenses, making it almost impossible to run pick-and-rolls at the volume NBA teams do against 99-plus-percent man-to-man.
The surprise in this data is that isolation volume is higher in college than in the NBA. I think if you polled college basketball fans, 90% would speculate that the opposite was true. But the pick-and-roll boom in the NBA—as well as the realization that iso possessions tend to be inefficient—has led to a decline in iso popularity. When Duke relied on heavy doses of what some announcers called “NBA-style” isos for Brandon Ingram last season, the Blue Devils were actually iso-ing more than most NBA teams.
• The 30-second shot clock improved college hoops, and there is no going back.
Last summer, I was among the skeptics who worried that shortening the shot clock from 35 seconds to 30 would have the unintended consequence of empowering defenses. That didn't happen. The new shot clock hit a trifecta of increasing scoring, pace and offensive efficiency from ‘14–15—all positive outcomes for the game.
(Stats harvested from kenpom.com and sports-reference.com.)
That said, just because offensive efficiency went up in Year 1 of the new shot-clock era doesn't mean it'll stay that way. Coaches can be slow to adapt, and D-I wide, there weren't significant changes in the ways teams played defense from ‘14–15 to ‘15–16. It could take a few years for effective theories on shot-clock leveraging to spread. I still think there's merit to shaving seconds off with non-turnover-focused backcourt pressure, then falling into a time-eating halfcourt defense, in hopes of forcing more possessions into inefficient, end-of-shot-clock territory. But oddly enough, there was a slight decrease in full-court pressure from ‘14–15 to ‘15–16; it dropped from 7.6% of defensive possessions, on average, to 6.8%, according to Synergy.
• The new shot clock didn't create a zone boom.
A zone boom did happen in college hoops, but it was in ‘13–14, the first season the NCAA implemented its new freedom-of-movement guidelines for referees. Perhaps in response to the rising number of whistles, halfcourt zone defense usage jumped from 15.4% in ‘12–13 to 21.1% in ‘13–14, according to my analysis of Synergy team logs. There was widespread speculation from coaches that more zone would play under the 30-second shot clock, but . . . the national zone-D rate in ‘15–16 was 20.0%.
There were some anecdotal, high-profile cases that resulted in zone being talked about more—Xavier going from an infrequent zone team to one that did it 32.4% of the time; Duke going from all-man two years ago, to 23.5% of the time last year; Villanova throwing some 2-3 zone curveballs during its run to the national title—but the aggregate zone rate stayed pretty much the same.
• The college foul rate has declined from its initial freedom-of-movement-driven spike in ‘13–14.
The NCAA's definition of what constitutes a foul has evolved in the past three seasons. Referees have been instructed to place greater emphasis on enforcing freedom-of-movement infractions (such as hand-checking or cutter-bumping), and the rules committee made alterations to both the block/charge rule and the block/charge circle under the hoop. The rocky—but necessary for the long-term health of the game—initial adjustment season of ‘13–14 resulted in a ton of whistles. There were 19.1 fouls per game, 0.29 fouls per possession, and 0.41 free-throw attempts per field-goal attempt.
The NCAA shortened the shot clock and told referees to place additional emphasis on offensive freedom in ‘15–16, and while tempo gains pushed fouls per game up to 19.3, there were fewer fouls per possession (0.28) and fewer free throws per field-goal attempt (0.37) than in either of the previous two seasons. It's unclear whether those decreases were because there was less time to foul on each possession, or defenses were acclimating to the new rules or referees were simply calling fewer fouls. Regardless, a situation where pace and offensive efficiency increased while fouls-per-possession decreased is a positive development.
I have no interest in the college game looking exactly like the NBA, but the comparison of the leagues' data in the above graphic shows that the pro fans still enjoy fewer fouls per possession and fewer free throws per field-goal attempt. The NBA's shorter possessions are part of that, as are its different bonus rules, more entrenched definition of fouls, and more consistent refereeing. But I do think college should aspire to that level of flow, and keep doing whatever is necessary to reach the equilibrium where defenses are regulated enough to allow for offensive freedom, but whistles aren't bogging down the game.
In the early days of Ubuntu, it was always a challenge to promote an OS that was so new and little known to the market; we were often asked ‘Ubun what…?”! Over the years, Canonical has grown rapidly, has innovated even faster and the community has spread the word all across the globe. Today, with over 25 million users, Ubuntu is now a safe and perfect choice for customer, offering a stylish and intuitive interface that is fast, secure.
The growth of Ubuntu has also been driven through our strong partnership with major hardware OEM brands such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer. Not only is Ubuntu generally available pre-loaded from these leading OEMs, but in many regions we've entered into full retail partnership with dedicated stores.
Today, Dell and HP sell Ubuntu pre-installed at stores across India and China. Consumers can visit a designated store in major cities across these regions and find information, videos and experienced Ubuntu-savvy sales staff to thoughtfully guide customers through the buying experience. Dell offers computers for sale pre-loaded with Ubuntu in over a 1,000 stores across China, and HP is in the process of rapidly introducing 1,500 stores into the same region.
In Mexico, HP has been running in-store initiatives with Bodega Aurrera stores – a subsidiary of Wal Mart – where consumers could buy HP laptops with Ubuntu pre-loaded off the shelf. The computers are available in several hundred of the stores, and the initial units sold out at three times faster than anticipated. Proof that where Ubuntu device are available in stores, then customers will see strong value and purchase.
In USA-centric campaign with Asus, we ran a web-based sales campaign on Amazon.com. Asus netbooks pre-installed with Ubuntu were promoted on our website, guiding customers to the Amazon site. Asus PC's pre-loaded pre-loaded with Ubuntu made it to Amazon.com's top 100 sales for that month.
Dell's ‘Ubuntu Test Zones' are now open in Ukrainian shopping malls giving consumers the chance to experience Ubuntu via a life-sized 3D hologram promoter. The hologram promoter addresses shoppers so they can learn more about Dell computers with Ubuntu. In the campaign's first two weeks, Dell reached over 280,000 consumers in the shopping malls.
These are just some of the examples of the sales and marketing initiatives that we're working on with our partners today. These partnerships are continuing to grow both in terms of volumes and regionally because of increasing demand from consumers and businesses for a viable alternative.
The word cutlet is a bit of a culinary mystery – everyone has their own interpretation of what it means. Throughout most of Europe, a cutlet is a thinly-sliced cut of meat (usually pork or veal) that is beaten, covered in breadcrumbs, and fried (think schnitzel). This is the same in the US, but they are mostly made with chicken breasts. The Japanese like to use pork (tonkatsu). Australia uses either chicken or lamb. Great Britain is a little different in that cutlets are usually not breaded.
And then there's Russia. Somehow, as they trotted down the path of history, the Russians decided that котлет was a pretty good word for what we in the US would call a hamburger steak. Russian cutlets are a very common household dish, probably due to how easy they are to prepare. What's funny is that they often eat cutlets between two slices of bread as a snack – which sounds a lot like a hamburger to me, although they are still called cutlets.
So at the end of the day, you could have three people walking down the street,
a) eating a Chick-Fil-A sandwich
b) eating a schnitzel sandwich (they exist!)
c) eating what basically looks like a hamburger
…and they'd all tell you they are eating cutlets.
So, after working on my Russian cutlets for a while, I decided to make a dish that is unique in that it would be fit to serve at a restaurant (which is ironic, because cutlets are rarely served in restaurants in Russia).
for the cutlets –
2 lbs ground beef
1/2 med onion, blended
3 cloves garlic, blended
1/2 tsp each salt, white pepper, ground mustard
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp butter or ghee
for the sauce –
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 8oz can of tomato sauce or tomato purée
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 heaping tbsp sour cream
Blend your onion and garlic together into a paste, then get your other ingredients ready.
In a saucepan, melt the butter/ghee on medium heat, then add the onion/garlic paste. Simmer on medium heat for about two minutes, to sweat the liquid out of the onions and to lessen the oniony taste.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Combine the other ingredients for the cutlets and gently mix together with your hands. Be careful not to over-mix the meat.
Form the ground beef into six oval-shaped patties and place them on a baking sheet. I like to give them a little bit of a lip at the end of the cutlets, so that the sauce has a little reservoir to sit in. Place the cutlets in the middle rack of the oven and bake at 350 for 20 minutes, then broil them for another two minutes.
Meanwhile, let's get your sauce ready. Combine the tomato sauce, chicken stock, and black pepper, and simmer on low for 20 minutes while the cutlets are cooking.
When the cutlets are done, move them to a plate, and add a couple spoonfuls of the gunk/fat/liquid that's left on your baking sheet to your tomato sauce. It might look a little gross as you're adding it, but this is a very Russian way of preparing the dish – why waste all of that flavor?
At this point stir in the fresh parsley, and raise the heat to medium.
Once the sauce is simmering (it should only take a minute), remove the pan from heat, let it sit for about 30 seconds, then stir in the sour cream.
Spoon some sauce over the cutlets and enjoy. This dish is often served with pan-fried or mashed potatoes in Mother Russia.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel listens as angry residents speak at the third and final budget hearing. [DNAinfo/Heather Cherone]
DUNNING — Mayor Rahm Emanuel got an earful Thursday on the Far Northwest Side from residents angry about a host of issues ranging from a looming massive property tax increase, cuts to special education programs, school overcrowding and jet noise caused by planes using new runways O'Hare Airport.
But unlike Wednesday, when Emanuel's security detail rushed him off the stage at the South Shore Cultural Center to avoid angry protesters, the meeting held in the gymnasium at Wright City College ran smoothly, with approximately 70 people using their one minute at the microphone to urge Emanuel to act on a host of issues.
Several called on the mayor to rethink his plan to hike property taxes by between $450 million and $550 million, implement a garbage collection tax designed to generate $100 million and raise a host of other fees that officials said are necessary to deal with the city's structural budget deficit more than a decade in the making.
Any tax increase will be both "progressive and fair" said City of Chicago Chief Financial Officer Carole Brown in a brief presentation at the beginning of the third and final budget hearing.
If the Chicago City Council approves the massive tax increase, the owner of a home worth $250,000 would see their bill jump by about $470, an 11 percent increase, officials said.
Despite the relatively calm audience, Emanuel addressed the capacity crowd only briefly to respond to specific questions, including one about trade classes at Dunbar High School and another about Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's deep cuts to child care subsidies, which the mayor has condemned.
Despite the official schedule calling for Emanuel to speak at the end of the hearing, the mayor left the stage immediately after the last resident spoke. Emanuel staffers escorted several speakers who pleaded for help during the meeting into a private conversation with the mayor, out of the sight of news media.
Arnold Julien, a resident of South Shore, told the mayor he was amazed at what he saw Thursday afternoon near Wright City College, 4300 N. Narragansett Ave., as he waited for the hearing to begin.
"I didn't see any boarded up houses," Julien said. "In my neighborhood, there are boarded up houses on every block. Why is that, Mr. Mayor?"
Others urged Emanuel to solve the city's budget crisis by cutting spending rather than raising taxes, with some warning such a large tax hike would spark an "exodus" of residents.
"The city doesn't have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem," said Edgebrook resident Roberta Vesperman, garnering loud applause.
If approved by the City Council, the tax hike would hit owners of commercial properties even harder than homeowners, since those properties are taxed by the city at a higher rate.
The garbage fee Emanuel is considering proposing would cost homeowners $11 or $12 a month, according to reports.
Emanuel may also propose a $1-per-ride surcharge on ride-hailing services like Uber and a tax on e-cigarettes.
Both proposals were criticized at the budget hearing as being short-sighted.
The tax increases are needed to avert what city officials have called a "major crisis" created by the state Legislature's requirement that city to make a $550 million pension payment to police and fire pension systems by 2016, officials have said.
The first two hearings held on the West and South sides earlier this week were disrupted by protesters demanding that city officials reopen Dyett High School in Bronzeville.
Several members of the Chicago Teachers Union — wearing their trademark red shirts — and their supporters interrupted the meeting with a coordinated chant in support of the Dyett protests, but it failed to catch on, perhaps in part because of the terrible acoustics in the Wright gymnasium, and the meeting continued.
Twelve residents are in the third week of a hunger strike designed to force Emanuel to consider their plan to reopen the high school.
Hours before the budget hearing, Chicago Public Schools officials announced Dyett would reopen as open-enrollment, neighborhood arts school in September 2016.
But those participating in the hunger strike said the proposal was unacceptable and their protest would continue.

But the meeting was not without drama.
Sarah Chambers, a special education teacher and Chicago Teachers Union leader, presented the mayor with a "warrant for his arrest" for slashing spending on special education services and teachers as students holding posters calling the mayor a racist flanked her.
Through the meeting, Emanuel perched on a chair, taking notes, laughing occasionally and grinning through the harshest criticisms leveled at his treatment of Chicago's poorest residents.
Several parents pleaded with Emanuel to restore cuts made to Beard Elementary School in Norwood Park and Vaughn High School in Portage Park, saying special needs students should be protected from the impact of the Chicago Public Schools' $1 billion budget deficit.
Other Northwest Side residents told Emanuel their quality of life had been diminished because of the hundreds of flights soaring over their home in areas that heard little to no jet noise before an east-west runway opened in October 2013.
Norwood Park resident Merry Marwig asks the mayor to do more to reduce jet noise. [DNAinfo/Heather Cherone]
Norwood Park resident Merry Marwig said the noise — and Emanuel's lack of response to tens of thousands of complaints — was making her question whether to stay in the city.
"I can't sleep, I can't enjoy my yard," Marwig said. "I question why I would stay."
Members of the Dunning Neighborhood Organization asked Emanuel to move forward with plans to build a new high school near Irving Park Road and Oak Park Avenue to relieve severe overcrowding at Taft High School.
"Parents of Chicago school children have a tough decision to make," said Dunning resident Ed Bannon. "Help us stay in the city by building a new high school."
Emanuel is scheduled to present his proposed spending plan to the City Council on Sept. 22.

It's November in Seattle, which means it's the Mariners' Season of the Tease. But they absolutely have to find a big bat for the middle of the lineup.
Josh Hamilton is exactly what the Mariners need. A power-hitting outfielder, a run-producing machine, a proven star, a shot of adrenaline in the middle of the order.
And Josh Hamilton is exactly what the Mariners don't need. An outfielder whose birth certificate says he's almost 32, but his body says he's more like 38. A player with a history of serious drug addiction, whose asking price is way above his worth.
Hamilton could send a buzz through Seattle's baseball community. He could sell season tickets. He could be the guaranteed bat in the middle of the lineup that this team hasn't had since whom? Adrian Beltre? A-Rod? Junior?
Or Hamilton could send shivers through Mariner fans if he arrived late for a game, or went AWOL for a day, or limped off the field after diving for a line drive in the gap.
As late as last June, Hamilton was considered the best player in the American League. But by October, he looked like a fading star. He was the scapegoat for the Texas Rangers' spectacular September crash. Hamilton hit .259 in the second half of the season and his OPS dropped nearly 200 points.
He didn't produce in the final days of the division fight with the Athletics, dropping a fly ball for a two-run error in the deciding game at Oakland. And after the Rangers' wild card loss to Baltimore, he was booed by the same home fans that had hero-worshipped him for the past five years.
The Rangers told USA Today on Friday that they would only offer Hamilton a three-year contract, which was the same as saying they weren't going to re-sign him.
And now, it appears that Mariners are one of the teams interested in Hamilton.
But then again, it's November in Seattle, which means it's the Mariners' Season of the Tease. Dating to the days of Bill Bavasi, it seems that every year at this time, the Mariners express interest in a high-priced free agent, or an all-star on the trading bloc, only to finish second or worse in the chase.
They tease fans with thoughts of players like Prince Fielder, but in the end, Seattle gets Jack Cust, Milton Bradley, Russell Branyan, Carl Everett, Carlos Silva or Chone Figgins.
This season, the reachable star is Hamilton. Apparently he will ask for a seven-year, $175 million deal, but he's not going to get it. The Mariners might be willing to play a waiting game, offer him a four-or-five-year deal, but even that would be gambled.
Hamilton has more baggage than Lady Gaga on tour, but more talent and better credentials than any other free agent on the market.
The Mariners have to consider him. They absolutely have to find a big bat for the middle of the lineup, either through free agency or a trade.
The Mariners' No-Moneyball doesn't work. Never has. They can't spend another season waiting for a half dozen prospects to suddenly become all stars.
The M's need a veteran who can produce. They need a leader with credentials. And they need to spend to get him.
This year isn't rich with possibilities, but there are hitters who can help Nick Swisher, B.J. Upton, Alex Gordon, Torii Hunter, Shane Victorino, Billy Butler, Cody Ross. All of them are more productive than anybody in the Mariners' lineup last season.
Why not get serious about competing for the division and sign both Hamilton and Swisher? Shock the sport.
The Mariners have the money. They've smartly let their long-term contracts run out. They can't poor-mouth us anymore.
But is Hamilton the answer?
Hamilton and his contract could suffocate the franchise, or he could resuscitate the team. He could hamstring the Mariners, or he could liberate them.
He is the most intriguing, scary, thrilling free agent in many years. At the right price, not $175 million, he could be the answer to the Mariners' prayers.
They have to consider him, while also having a fallback position if he doesn't sign. They have to do their homework and make a determination on whether Hamilton's second half slide was a glitch or a pattern.
This is the most important winter since Pat Gillick left town. General manager Jack Zduriencik's job is on the line and he has to deliver.
It's November in Seattle and the fans deserve a bat, not another tease.

Peter Gabriel will be contributing songs to "2 Unite All," a benefit compilation album which will financially assist humanitarian organizations helping Palestinians in Gaza.
According to i24News Gabriel will join other musicians including System Of A Down singer Serj Tankian, Police drummer Stewart Copeland and Def Leppard's Rick Allen.
Gabriel's contribution is the opening track entitled "Across The River," an updated version of a song he originally recorded in 1982.
"Although I am sure both the Palestinian and Israeli people would benefit enormously from a just and fair two-state agreement based around the '67 borders, we have watched the Palestinians subjected to more and more suffering for far too long, especially in Gaza," Gabriel said in a statement on the album's official site. "Meanwhile their long held land is repeatedly stolen by force for illegal settlements. I am not and have never been anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic; I am anti-Israeli government policy, anti-injustice, anti-oppression and anti-occupation.
"There is clearly a growing movement around the world willing to speak out, including my own country's Parliament," Gabriel continued. "I am happy to be one of these voices now asking the Israeli government, 'Where is that two state solution you have so long said you wanted?' and more simply, saying, 'Enough.'"
Serj Tankian added that “helping to rebuild the lives of Palestinians in Gaza is a necessary and noble worldwide humanitarian prerogative that we must not shy away from. It's the least we can do for a people that have suffered under an occupation, embargo, and invasion."
The 26-track album was produced by Project Peace On Earth. All proceeds will go "towards urgent surgical & psychological care for Palestinians in Gaza and Mid East peace awareness." An Oct. 31 tweet from Unite 2 All added 40 per cent of all proceeds would go to The Palestine Children's Relief Fund.
Gabriel begins a European leg of his Back To Front tour in Brussels on Wednesday, Nov. 12.
The ascent of Yogi Adityanath to the top job in India's politically most important state is ripe with significance for markets precisely because it underlines a trend of addressing the bottom of the pyramid that has gained ground over the past year.
Make no mistake: the choice of Adityanath is not about building a temple at Ayodhya, or at least, not just about that. You need only to look back to the early days of Narendra Modi to get a sense of what could be coming. The similarities between Modi 1.0 and Yogi are striking: Hardline Hindutva (and accusations of abetting communal violence), the RSS influence, the energy born of meditation and yoga, and last but not least, the ‘single' status seen as precluding the need to amass wealth.
This is what gave birth to the Gujarat Model – zero tolerance for inefficiency and corruption, efficient administration and a focused development agenda.
Of course, Uttar Pradesh is no Gujarat. It's an integral part of the uncomfortable BIMARU grouping whereas Gujarat has always been a rich state. And it's early days to conclude that the monk from Gorakhpur will achieve anything like the outcomes Modi got in his state. But the election result means that the economic agenda of Modi at the Centre will get implemented by his lieutenants, and Yogi is now formally one of them.
Expect the following agenda to gain ground in the next couple of years leading into the Lok Sabha polls of 2019. The first is derived from the election slogan 'sabka saath sabka vikas' – Modi is a friend of the poor, contrary to his earlier image of a friend of the traders. Second is the crusade on black money and corruption and finally an end to crony capitalism: Political connections will no longer pave the road to success. The recent move of demonetisation dovetails well with these agendas.
In the run up to 2019, the theme that will have significant investment implication is the improvement in the economic condition of people who are really at the bottom of the pyramid, and there are plenty in UP. This is unlikely to be achieved through runaway increase in subsidy; directed subsidy will get further expanded into more areas and a possible introduction of Universal Basic Income that subsumes myriad grants from the state may be on the anvil.
The sectors that should get a fillip are basic consumption (staples), low- to mid- income housing, agriculture, and to some extent rural consumption. Our research throws up several interesting ideas on these themes and we urge investors to opportunistically build up positions amid market gyrations.
Housing for all by 2022 is definitely a pet project of the government that should continue to get disproportionate attention. Building materials and electrical companies focusing on entry level products should find favour.
Rural housing forms 40 percent of overall cement sales in India, which is largely supported by agricultural income and rural wages.
The other set of companies that should benefit from the focus on housing are mid- to-low ticket size housing finance companies focused in rural and semi-urban areas. Gruh Finance, Repco Home, GIC Housing and LIC Housing are some of the players in this category.
Alongside housing, more money either as grants or earnings should spell good news for staples as well as entry- level discretionary consumption companies. While valuation comfort in this space is limited at this point, any earnings surprise could contribute to alpha returns.
Agriculture which supports earnings of nearly 70 percent in rural India will be at the heart of any proactive government's policies in our country and should see improved prospects unless the monsoon plays spoilsport. Agrochem, fertiliser, farm equipment companies should benefit from this trend.
Reduction in leakages and a move to DBT (direct benefit transfer) for a significant proportion of subsidies would also give more cash in the hands of farmers to modernise. On the agrochem side, growth rates for agrochem players would be supported by rising adoption of high-value molecules, rising adoption of herbicides and fungicides.
While markets aren't really cheap, investors should gradually build up position in these promising areas that are likely to benefit from the Modi-Adityanath kind of political dispensation.
Amazon shed some light onto what goes on with its networking strategy inside its many data centers on Wednesday at AWS re:Invent 2014 in Las Vegas. James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer for Amazon Web Services, laid out the networking details during his conference session that also touched on data centers and databases.
Just like telcos and other like-minded infrastructure-heavy businesses believe, the cost of networking gear is way too high for most organizations to deal with, so [company]Amazon[/company] decided to take things into its own hands; it buys routing equipment from original design manufacturers (Hamilton didn't name any names) that it hooks up to a custom network-protocol software that's supposedly more efficient than commodity gear, Hamilton said.

And to make sure that networking gear can handle a lot of traffic, Amazon does a lot of testing, Hamilton explained. He claimed that Amazon uses about 8,000 servers in its networking-testing environment and because the testing happens in the cloud, the company can decommission those servers when the testing is over so the total cost equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars instead of millions.
Amazon hooks up its eleven worldwide regions—with each region containing several data centers—using private fiber interconnects, which helps the company bypass worldwide networking problems that may arise because of peering issues or some sort of malfunction.
“We've got 25 terabits per second of inter-availability zone traffic,” Hamilton said.
Each availability zone in a region contains two or more data centers that are “completely independent buildings,” Hamilton said, and each data center has around 50,000 to 80,000 servers; he said that the size of Amazon's data centers isn't as big as other organizations, but there's a limit to how much better performing a data center can be in regards to the amount of racks used. Also, if something catastrophic occurs, Amazon doesn't want a ton of machines to go down with it.
Amazon also invested in single-root I/O virtualization, a type of software-defined-networking technique that Hamilton described was used to virtualize network cards so that “each guest gets their own network card.” While the technique is difficult to do and means Amazon has to pay extra attention to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection and network capacity limits, the company has benefited with lower latency.
“The costs are gone,” said Hamilton, regarding how virtualization and custom gear lowered Amazon's networking, storage and server costs. ”It's not magic, they just aren't there anymore.”

Google's Pixel event is happening just two days from now, but it sounds like we'll have to wait at least two more weeks after that before the first devices start shipping. VentureBeat is reporting that the Pixel 2 will be released on October 19th, two weeks later. And Pixel 2 XL buyers may have to wait even longer, until November 15th.
Related Exclusive first look at the Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL
The October 19th date makes plenty of sense. Last year, the Pixel was announced on October 5th and shipped on October 20th; this year, the Pixel 2 is being announced on October 4th, so the 19th would be consistent.
Will the 2 XL beat the iPhone X to market?
The XL's release date wasn't staggered last year, but perhaps Google is pushing it out this time to ensure that it has plenty of units to ship. It seems like the XL will be the real flagship device this time, and last year, Google had some serious trouble keeping its phone in stock.
That said, pushing the 2 XL's release date out to November 15th could come at disadvantage. The iPhone X comes out November 3rd, and Google has a chance to have its nearly full-screen phone on sale first. A couple weeks in either direction may not matter much in the long run, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have a highly competitive phone ready to buy ahead of your competitor.
In addition to the phones' release dates, VentureBeat also published two new images of the Pixels. One is a cleaner mockup of the 2 XL (accompanying this earlier leak), and another is the group shot of the Pixel 2 that you see above. It's one of the best shots yet of the phone's three different colors, and I think it makes the “kinda blue” color start to look a bit better than in earlier leaks. What I still want to know: what color is the bezel on the other side of it?
We'll find out everything on Wednesday.

Narrow M1 data for April is the weakest since modern records began. Real M1 deposits – a leading indicator of economic growth six months or so ahead – have contracted since November.
They are shrinking faster that at any time during the 2008-2009 crisis, and faster than in Spain right now, according to Simon Ward at Henderson Global Investors.
If China were a normal country, it would be hurtling into a brick wall. A "hard-landing" later this year would already be baked into the pie.
Whether this hybrid system of market Leninism – with banks run by Party bosses – conforms to Western monetary theory is a hotly contested point. The issue will be settled one way or the other soon.
What seems clear is that China's economy did not bottom out as expected in the first quarter. It is flirting with real trouble. Yao Wei from Société Générale says a blizzard of awful data "screams out for easing".
China's electricity output – watched religiously by bears – slumped in April. It is up just 0.7pc over the last year. State investment in railways has fallen 44pc, with an accelerating downward lurch over recent months. Highway construction has dropped 2.7pc. "The data shows extreme weakness in the Chinese economy," said Alistair Thornton from IHS Global Insight in Beijing.
The Yangtze shipyards tell the tale. Caixin magazine said eight of the 10 largest builders in the country have not received a single new order this year. "A wave of closures in the shipbuilding industry has yet to begin. A hurricane is approaching," said one official.
Housing sales slumped 25pc in the first quarter, testimony to the zeal of regulators. This has since fed into a drastic fall in new building. Mr Thornton said floor place under construction fell 28.3pc in April.
This is hardly a sideshow. The sector employs 10pc of the Chinese work-force, and a further 20pc indirectly. Land sales provide 70pc of tax revenue to local authorities and 30pc to the central government. It is the "fair weather" financing illusion, as
we saw in Ireland. China's scope for fiscal stimulus may be constrained if property goes into a long slump.
The property correction is deemed benign because it is planned. Premier Wen Jiabao wishes to forces down prices as a social welfare policy. Yet did the Fed not slam on the brakes in 1928 to choke an asset boom? Did the Bank of Japan not do likewise in 1990, only to find that boom-bust deflation has its own fiendish momentum? Once you let credit rise by 100pc of GDP in five years – as China has, more than in those US or Japanese episodes – you are at the mercy of powerful forces.
Something odd is now happening. The People's Bank said new loans fell from $160bn (£99.5bn) in March to $108bn in April. Non-conventional lending seized up altogether. Trust lending fell by 96pc, bankers' acceptance bills by 90pc. This is astonishing data.
It may not be as easy for Beijing to turn the tap back on again. Loan demand has been falling for months. Banks are offering credit. Companies are refusing to take it. This is the old Japanese story of pushing on a string, or the European story today.
"China is in deflation," says Charles Dumas from Lombard Street Research. Yes, consumer price inflation is 3.4pc – though falling – but consumption is a third of GDP. Fixed investment is 46pc, and here prices have dropped 3.5pc in six months. Export prices have dropped 6.6pc.
The authorities have belatedly responded, cutting the reserve ratio by 50 points to 20pc over the weekend. It is thin gruel. Are we to conclude that the People's Bank is bent on breaking excess capacity in a cathartic Schumpeterian purge, or that leadership battles have paralysed the Party? Hard to tell.
All the BRICs need watching. India's industrial output fell 3.5pc in March. The country seems caught in a 1970s stagflation vice. Brazil has softened too, with car sales down 15pc and industrial production contracting in March. The bad loans of the banks have reached 10.3pc, higher than post-Lehman.
The bubble has probably popped already, but hoteliers in Rio are hanging on. The European Parliament has pulled out of the UN's Rio forum on sustainable development in June because the rooms are exorbitant. "We are short the vastly over-vaunted and over-owned BRICs," says hedge fund contrarian Hugh Hendry.
My fear has always been that the credit cycle in the Rising World would blow itself out before the Old World has safely recovered, or reached "escape velocity" to use the term in vogue.
Europe will slide further into 1930s self-destruction until it equips itself with a lender of last resort and takes all risk of EMU sovereign default off the table, though that may come too late. The US has functioning institutions at least but growth is barely above stall speed. Ben Bernanke's "massive fiscal cliff" looms this autumn. The Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) has not yet withdrawn its US recession call.
The BRICS helped save us in 2008-2009. If we now face a global crisis on all fronts – and such an outcome can still be avoided – it will test the mettle of world leaders. Interest rates in the G10 are mostly zero already, and budgets are frighteningly stretched.
Sensing what is coming, Citigroup's chief economist Willem Buiter says global central banks have not yet exhausted their arsenal. They can "and should" crank up quantitative easing (QE), buy everything under the sun, and do "helicopter money drops".
I would go even further. sovereign central banks have the means to defeat any depression thrown at them by launching mass purchases of assets outside the banking system, working through the classic Hawtrey-Cassel quantity of money mechanism until nominal GDP is restored to its trend line.
The problem is not scientific. A world slump is preventable if leaders act with enough panache. The hindrance is that the Euro Tower still haunted by Hayekians, and most G10 citizens – and Telegraph readers from my painful experience – view such notions as Weimar debauchery, or plain Devil worship. Economists cannot command a democratic consent for monetary stimulus any more easily today than in 1932.
One can only pray that helicopter drops do not become necessary in the chilly winter of 2012-2013.
Robots that provide assistance in homes, hospitals, and workplaces will need to be able to fall without damaging themselves.
At a major robotics competition held in June, several multi-million-dollar robots struggled to perform even simple tasks like climbing a flight of stairs; some even toppled over with what seemed like impeccable comic timing. But a few of these amusing pratfalls resulted in devastating damage to the robots' instruments, motors, and other components.
An Atlas robot operated by a team from the Institute for Human & Machine Cognition topples over at the DARPA Robotics Challenge.
Fortunately for such robot klutzes, researchers are exploring ways to enable robots to fall more gracefully and safely. The work will become important as robots are used in more complex environments, and as engineers experiment with machines that move around on legs rather than wheels.
Researchers at Georgia Tech took inspiration from the way people break a fall by sticking out an arm or a leg on the way down. “When you fall down, you try to dissipate energy,” says Karen Liu, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech who carried out the work with her then graduate student Sehoon Ha, who now works at Disney Research Pittsburgh. “And every time you make contact with the ground, some of that energy is dissipated.”
Liu and Ha devised an algorithm that lets an unbalanced robot figure out how to contort its body so that it hits the ground with less force. The algorithm calculates how to create a number of contact points with the ground in order to disperse the momentum of the fall.
At a conference in Germany last month, the Georgia Tech pair described testing the algorithm with a small humanoid robot called BioloidGP, and in simulations of a large humanoid called Atlas. The latter was developed by a company called Boston Dynamics, which specializes in making advanced legged machines and is now owned by Google. Several teams involved in the June event used Atlas robots. At the event, called the DARPA Robotics Challenge, tele-operated robots raced to perform a series of tasks including driving a golf cart, opening a series of doors, and operating a power drill.
The DARPA event was primarily meant to simulate the problems a robot would encounter when assisting at a stricken nuclear plant, but it also highlighted the remaining challenges for robots aiming to work in just about any normal human environment (see “Why Robots—and Humans—Struggled with DARPA's Challenge”).
Matt DeDonato, who led a team from Worchester Polytechnic Institute at the DARPA event, says that most participants were more focused on staying upright than working out better ways to fall, especially because each fall incurred a hefty time penalty. To minimize damage, the Atlas robot operated by his team, in collaboration with researchers from CMU, would power down its actuators and go limp when it detected a fall. But DeDonato, whose team managed to keep the robot upright throughout the DARPA event, says the area needs to be explored as more robots become commercialized. “You are guaranteed to fall over sometimes,” he says.
Marc Raibert, founder of Boston Dynamics, now part of Google, and a pioneer in legged robotics, says his team started thinking about how to protect a falling robot while developing a four-legged machine called BigDog. The first idea was to have the limbs seize up when a fall was detected. “That caused the limbs to act as long levers that apply large forces to the joints when the limbs strike the ground,” he says. “We actually broke some legs clean off the robot, so we reprogrammed BigDog to relax its joints during a fall. All the robots we build now do something like that when they detect that they have lost their balance.”
Lui says her group is also interested in devising ways for robots to avoid hurting people if they fall over. This might involve balancing in such a way that made falling toward a person more unlikely, she says.
The approach developed so far is limited, however, by the sensing capabilities and the computational power of most robots. For their experiments, the Georgia Tech team used an accelerometer in the head of the physical robot as well as external motion-capture cameras. Liu notes that the complexity of calculating how best to fall explains why so many animals, including humans, have a nervous system, which reacts automatically.
“That's why we have reflexes,” Liu says. “We are thinking of building something like a nervous system for robots.”
CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Dutch fashion retailers are paying “starvation wages” at factories in a major hub for the global garment industry in southern India, forcing many workers into crippling debt, a report on Tuesday showed.
Workers surveyed at 10 garment factories in and around Bengaluru in the southern Indian state of Karnataka took home on average 90 euros ($100) a month, and 70 percent were in debt, the report by four non-profit organizations said.
The factories were supplying Dutch brands that have “acknowledged the importance of living wages”.
They included Coolcat, G-Star, The Sting, MEXX Europe, McGregor Fashions, Scotch & Soda, Suitsupply, WE Fashion and C&A. The C&A Foundation partners with the Thomson Reuters Foundation on trafficking and slavery coverage.
“Workers cannot properly support their families with this wage,” said the report, “Doing Dutch”, co-authored by Clean Clothes Campaign, the India Committee of the Netherlands, Asia Floor Wage Alliance and Cividep India.
“Food and housing, usually a one-room apartment without a water tap and with a shared toilet outdoors, are the biggest expenses. Almost everyone would like to buy healthier and more varied food, but is unable to do that because of low wages.”
Responding to the report, companies have said they were putting procedures in place to overcome the challenges with regard to wages, overtime payment, working hours, creche and hostel facilities for workers.
The $40 billion Indian textile and garment industry, much of which operates in the informal sector and is poorly regulated, employs an estimated 45 million workers.
The report said there are around 300,000 workers in and around Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, and that 80 percent of the workers in the city's 1,200-odd factories are women.
A woman worker interviewed in 2015 said she walked an hour to work and an hour back to save on bus fare.
“These women are working very hard for a pittance,” said Tara Scally, spokeswoman of the Clean Clothes Campaign.
The International Labor Organization defines a living wage as a “basic human right”. Last year, the Asia Floor Wage campaign pegged a decent living wage in India at 18,727 rupees ($282) per month.
“We expect garment companies to make a concrete plan for a living wage for all workers and to make sure that their procurement price enables the suppliers to pay a living wage,” Gerard Oonk, director of the India Committee of the Netherlands, said in a statement.

Today marks the 50 year anniversary of when Malcolm X was assassinated in the Audubon Ballroom in New York City. His death elicited shocked reactions from many Civil Rights leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr., who sent Malcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, a telegram highlighted by Vox.
As you can see below, King wrote:
While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had the great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem.
Even though history often makes note of the difference between these two men's approaches — King was known for his dedication to non-violent resistance, while Malcolm X's philosophy was that people of color should obtain equal rights by “any means necessary” — the two reportedly had great respect for each other.
In a 1988 interview with Eyes on The Prize, King's wife, Coretta Scott King, shared her thoughts on their relationship.
I think they respected each other. Martin had the greatest respect for Malcolm and he agreed with him in, and, in terms of the feeling of racial pride and the fact that Black people should believe in themselves and see themselves as, as lovable and beautiful. The fact that Martin had had a strong feeling of connectedness to Africa and so did Malcolm. Ah, I think if he had lived, and if the two had lived, I am sure that at some point they would have come closer together and would have been a very strong force in the total struggle for liberation and self determination of Black people in our society.

22 More Hair Quirks Every Naturalista Can Relate To
I didn't think it was possible. But somewhere between last year and this moment, I was able to conjure up 20 more natural hair quirks. Keep in mind, this list is for pure entertainment. You may or may not be able to relate to any of these things, but hopefully you'll get a good chuckle out of the list regardless. Enjoy!
1. Candles lit, music is playing and you're totally vibing…you bend down to pick up an item off the floor…your hair is now on FIRE. Don't get too close to the flame folks. Your hair is larger than you think. (this actually happened to me once)
2. Your hair just isn't doing the right thing this week, so you decide to wear all black everything until you can wash and style it to your liking again. It doesn't deserve fancy attire.
3. You put your hair up into a chic protective style using Kanekalon braiding hair…now you have one lone bobby pin digging into your scalp. You carefully try to move your hair about to locate the demon pin, but end up destroying it in the process. Hey at least there's nothing stabbing you in the head now.
4. People ask you how you got all of your hair into that cute and sleek top knot. They don't know that it took 12 hair ties, 7 connected ponytails, 53.5 bobby pins, a gallon of Eco Styler gel and prayer to get it into that effortless looking little knot.
5. When a new natural tries to give you natural hair advice while you're wearing your protective style you think “You have no idea what I'm capable of”.
6. You have a sixth sense…the ability to randomly wake up in the middle of the night every single time your scarf or bonnet slides off of your head.
7. You stay away from winter coats that have detachable Velcro hoods. Been there, done that, dag on near lost ya nape because of it.
8. Planning your wash day around major events is so necessary. People need to see you at your larger than life 3 day wash n go/twist out/braid out/bantu knot out/roller set. First day hair will never do.
9. It's 11 p.m. and your hair still isn't dry even though you've been under the dryer for an hour. You're drunk with sleepiness, but you refuse to get up because if you do, it will be soggy hair central tomorrow. Better get comfortable. You can thank your butters and oils for this one.
10. You side eye every flying creature and pray that it doesn't decide to get tangled in your fro…because if it do you'll be bald. No one is going to pick out a giant wasp from their hair. Not today.
11. Wash day was put off for so long that when you finally do wash your hair, you're afraid that you won't have any hair left after you finish detangling that sucker.
12. You sit down and have a serious talk with your significant other when you discover that they've been using your hair care products.
13. Even though you've been natural for quite a while, you keep having that nightmare where you accidentally got a relaxer.
14. You have emergency shampoo, conditioner, and styling products just in case you slip up and forget to re‐up your good stuff.
15. You wake up some mornings, look at your hair and think “how am I going to pull this one off today”. But somehow you manage to turn that tragic bed head into a beautiful triumph.
16. Because your biceps and triceps are on point, people ask what kind of workouts you do. Meanwhile, your arms are only poppin' because washing , detangling, twisting, braiding, and setting natural hair take some serious strength.
17. Your hair is a blind spot when trying to look to the side and behind you while driving.
18. Ferociously stomping on a ball of hair from your detangling session because you thought it was a gigantic spider. Oops.
19. You're inspired by all the natural kids on social media and have dreams of styling your little one's hair into a plethora of natural styles. In real life, your child hollers and screams as you try to shingle, twist and diffuse their hair. You think “No one has time for all this. You're getting ponytails/a haircut”.
20. You walk past another natural on the street and give a secret smile. No need for conversation, y'all know what's up.
21. At first you were one of the only ones in your family and social circle to return to natural. Everyone thought you were “going through” something when you big chopped. Now eons later, you have everybody and their mom asking you for natural hair advice. Listen, if you couldn't accept me at my TWA, you don't deserve me at my BAA.
22. It's another year and you're still yet holding on to your natural hair journey. Cheers to being natural and fabulous!

In a new study, some of the nation's leading academic researchers on the impacts of minimum wage increases took a close look at how restaurant prices and jobs were affected after San Jose raised its citywide minimum wage by 25% in January 2013.
After analyzing a huge database of menu prices from 884 different restaurants from before and after the increase took effect, their statistical model found that for every 10% increase in minimum wage, restaurant prices increased by a grand total of.... 0.58%. And their research found no negative effects on employment levels at all.
This model suggests that over the course of Seattle's several-year phased-in increase from $9.47/hour to $15/hour, we should expect a total restaurant price increase of.... about 3%. With no negative impacts on employment.
In other words: the sky remains aloft.
-----
UPDATE (1/6/2016): New York's Shake Shack recently announced that after a 20% increase in the minimum wage in the city, prices are increasing... 1% to 2%. Which is right in line with the estimate here of 0.58% restaurant price increase for every 10% minimum wage increase. HOW WILL THE ECONOMY SURVIVE WHEN FRIES ARE 5 CENTS MORE EXPENSIVE?
Police: Taser use is “not one of the unanswered questions” surrounding the case
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Tuesday, July 29, 2008
You couldn't make it up if you tried. Police in Ozark, Missouri repeatedly tased a critically injured sixteen year old boy after he “refused to comply with the officers”.
The cops were called to investigate reports of a boy walking along a busy overpass, but when they got there they found young Mace Hutchinson had fallen 30 ft to the ground below, breaking his back and and foot in the process.
When he did not co-operate with the cops they pulled out their stun guns and fired them into his body, shocking him up to nineteen times with 50,000 volts.
According to the boy's father, the actions of the police caused an elevated white blood cell count leading Mace to develop a fever that delayed vital surgery by two days.
Ozark Police Capt. Thomas Rousset tried to condone the use of the taser in comments to the media:
“He refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their Tasers in order to subdue him. He is making incoherent statements; he's also making statements such as, ‘Shoot cops, kill cops,' things like that. So there was cause for concern to the officers.”
Watch a local report from KY3 News:
The idea that a boy with a broken back would need to be “subdued” by a team of cops is not patently ludicrous but also smacks of a desperate attempt to cover up the true events in this case.
This is a perfect example of how it has become the norm for cops to react with extreme physical force towards anyone who acts out of the ordinary in any way whatsoever.
We have previously carried reports of police tasing an already restrained disabled man, a 6-year-old boy who was wielding a piece of glass and a woman having diabetic seizure to name but a few, but this case trumps them all.
This behaviour is not limited to cops in the U.S. either, last November a man who slipped into a diabetic coma on the top deck of a bus in Leeds, England described how he was used for electric stun gun “target practice” after he “failed to respond to instructions” and police “mistook him for a suicide bomber”.
Tasers are supposed to be the last response before lethal action, yet police now use the taser as if it is a pair of handcuffs or pepper spray. The latest figures show that over 300 people died in one year in admitted cases in the US alone from being tased.
Prominent heart doctors have declared that there is no doubt that Tasers can cause heart problems and even induce sudden and lethal cardiac arrest.
The UN's Committee Against Torture issued a statement on the TaserX26, in November of last year which read: “The use of TaserX26 weapons, provoking extreme pain, constituted a form of torture, and that in certain cases it could also cause death, as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use.”
Despite these facts, we see stories every week of old women, children and disabled people being shot with tasers. The weapons are even being used in schools.
The police are now trained that “pain compliance,” a euphemism for torture, is acceptable in apprehending anyone even if that person poses no physical danger.
The heart of the issue is that this was another act of wanton police brutality and torture by means of tasing.

Chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have become the latest senior British politicians to publish details of their tax returns.
Mr Osborne paid £72,210 in tax in 2014-15 on £198,738 in earnings, comprising his official salary, rental income and share dividends from his family firm.
The Labour leader paid £18,912 in tax on his MP's salary and declared £1,850 of other taxable income.
It came as David Cameron defended the right to "make money lawfully".
Facing MPs for the first time since the row over his family's tax affairs, the prime minister said "artificially reducing tax" should not be confused with legitimate enterprise and wealth creation schemes.
The series of personal disclosures - which also included an updated tax statement from Mayor of London Boris Johnson - came after Downing Street said "potential prime ministers" and chancellors should be expected to publish their tax returns in future.
Speaking in the Commons, Mr Corbyn suggested the government was "incapable of taking global action against tax dodging", claiming there was "was one rule for the rich and one for the rest".

But Mr Cameron questioned how long it had taken for the leader of the opposition to publish his own tax return.
The Labour leader had to ask Revenue and Customs for a copy amid reports he did not keep one of his own.
In his statement, Mr Cameron - who published a summary of his tax returns on Sunday - addressed what he said were "deeply hurtful and profoundly untrue" allegations about his late father's offshore investment fund.
He said the fund, in which the PM owned shares which he sold for a £19,000 profit in 2010 after paying tax, was perfectly legitimate.
He said a number of public sector organisations, including trade unions and the BBC, had similar investment arrangements, describing them as a "standard practice and not designed to avoid tax".
"It is right to tighten the law and change the culture around investment to further outlaw tax evasion and to discourage aggressive tax avoidance," he said.
"But as we do so, we should differentiate between schemes designed to artificially reduce tax and those that are encouraging investment. This is a government - and this should be a country - that believes in aspiration and wealth creation."
He told MPs that he had decided to sell the shares in 2010, before he became PM, to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest.
'National scandal'
Mr Cameron told MPs that he had released an "unprecedented" amount of information about his own tax affairs and believed the leader of the opposition, chancellor and shadow chancellor should also follow suit as they either ran or aspired to run the nation's finances.
But he said that he did not believe MPs should be compelled to routinely publish similar information as the principle of confidentiality in tax information should be maintained.

Confirming he would continue to publish his tax return on an annual basis. Mr Osborne said: "This is an unprecedented degree of transparency from a government that has done more than any other to tackle tax evasion."
Responding for Labour in the House of Commons, Mr Corbyn said the prime minister had failed to give a "full account of his involvement in tax havens until this week or take essential action to clean up the system".
"The UK is at the heart of the global tax avoidance industry," he said. "It is a national scandal and it has to stop".
Mr Cameron defended the UK's record on fighting tax evasion saying the government had agreed with all Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories - except Guernsey and Anguilla - on giving the UK authorities access to their national registers setting out the beneficial ownership of companies listed there.
He also announced plans for a new law making firms criminally liable if their employees fail to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion.

This would lower the threshold of responsibility for companies whose employees may have advised clients to take actions which would evade - as opposed to avoid - paying tax.
Mr Cameron was backed by Conservative MPs but amid heated exchanges in the Commons, veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner was suspended from the Chamber for the day after referring to the prime minister as "dodgy Dave" and refusing to withdraw the remark.
Public mood
The prime minister released a summary of earnings and tax going back six years after being accused by Labour of misleading the public over money he had invested in his father Ian Cameron's company, Blairmore Holdings.
Labour is continuing to press him to publish his full tax returns dating back to before he became prime minister and are questioning why the original investment was not disclosed in the register of MPs' interests.
Labour has announced a 10-point plan to "clean out" tax havens - including forcing MPs to disclose any offshore holdings.

Boris Johnson released figures showing he has paid more than £1m in tax in the past four years on his earnings from publishing and journalism, as well as his mayoral salary.
Mr Johnson paid £276,505 alone in 2014-15 on a taxable income of £612,583.
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said he expects all MPs to be publishing their tax returns within two years, reflecting changes in the "public mood" over tax transparency and the need, as he put it, for "Caesar's wife to be above suspicion".
But Conservative MP Charles Walker told the BBC's Daily Politics there was "a new culture of bullying" in the UK and warned of a situation where public figures could end up having to release a stream of personal information, such as medical records.
And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he wouldn't be divulging any details since most people regarded tax as a private matter.
"Neighbours would hate the thought that the people at Number 32 knew what their income was," he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.
"I'm worried where we are going with this. If we want to have party leaders publish their tax returns then presumably all MPs must do so, presumably then all councillors must do so, bishops of course must do so, generals must do so, newspapers… BBC presenters must do so."

Endurance International Group Holdings Inc., a website hosting and e-mail marketing company whose financial reporting is under federal investigation, said its chief executive is stepping down.
The Burlington company said on Monday that CEO Hari Ravichandran will continue in the job until the board hires a successor. In a statement, Endurance cited efforts to generate more cash and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation for the decision to accelerate plans for Ravichandran to give up his post.
“My number one priority has always been to do what is best for Endurance, our employees and our shareholders, and I am pleased that the board and I are aligned on the qualities our next CEO needs,” Ravichandran, who founded the company 20 years ago, said in the statement.

In early 2016, it completed the $1.1 billion acquisition of Constant Contact, a Waltham company that sells e-mail marketing services. Constant Contact shed more than 200 jobs shortly after the acquisition was finished.
In late 2015, shortly after it announced plans to acquire Constant Contact, the two companies disclosed that the SEC ordered them to produce documents relating to their financial reports and their sales and marketing practices.
In its most recent annual report, Endurance said it was cooperating with the SEC investigation, which was launched by the SEC's Boston office. Endurance said it couldn't predict how the probe might affect its business.
Endurance has increased its revenue and narrowed its losses in recent years, but remains unprofitable. The company reported a net loss of about $139 million on $292 million in sales in 2012, and a loss of about $81 million on revenue of $1.1 billion last year.

The company said that its board believes “finding a CEO with a breadth of experience growing complex organizations will enable Endurance to reach its next set of milestones.”
Endurance shares were up more than 4 percent to $7.15 in after-hours trading Monday on news of the CEO search and confirmation of the company's financial guidance for 2017, including a 4 to 5 percent increase in revenue.
The company's stock reached a high of $22.80 per share in April 2015, but its price has declined steadily since then.

Joe Freeman of The Oregonian reports that Portland Trail Blazers forward/center Joel Freeland could miss the rest of the 2013-14 regular season with a knee injury.
The Trail Blazers' backup big man on Tuesday said he could miss another five weeks - or the rest of the regular season. "I look at it like I've got a month to get ready for the playoffs," Freeland said.
The full story -- with additional details about Freeland's progress -- is right here.
Freeland suffered a sprained MCL in his right knee back on February 10 and the team placed his initial recovery timeline was placed at 4-to-8 weeks. So far, Freeland has been sidelined for roughly four weeks, and this latest update pushes the high end of his total recovery timeline slightly.
Freeland, 27, is in his second season with the Blazers after playing professionally in Spain for a number of years. He is averaging 3.3 points and 3.9 rebounds in 13.8 minutes per game this season.
The final game of Portland's regular season is Wednesday, April 16, against the Los Angeles Clippers at the Moda Center.

People believe more in the afterlife than ever as a 'rise in the something-for-nothing mentality', an academic has argued.
Despite belief in God falling to lower levels than at any time in history in US society, there is an increasing belief in the afterlife among US citizens, a survey found.
Increasing feelings of 'entitlement' may be fuelling a rise in believing in life after death, despite not accepting religion or God, academics suggested.
A study of 58,893 Americans between 1972 and 2014 found that five times as many Americans admitted to never praying in 2014 compared to those who answered the same question in the 1980s. Twice as many said they did not believe in God over the same period
A study of 58,893 Americans between 1972 and 2014 found that five times as many Americans admitted to never praying in 2014 compared to those who answered the same question in the 1980s.
Twice as many said they did not believe in God over the same period.
Dr Jean Twenge of San Diego State University said Americans are becoming more secular.
The one exception to the decline in religious beliefs was a slight increase in belief in the afterlife.
She said: 'It was interesting that fewer people participated in religion or prayed but more believed in an afterlife.
The biggest declines in belief in God have been found among 18 to 29-year-olds. The findings also contradict widely-held opinions that while people may believe less in formal, organised religion there has been an increase in private spirituality. Despite the drop in religion, more people than ever believe in an afterlife
BELIEF IN DIVINE INTERVENTION Dwelling on what could have gone wrong in the past could strengthen your belief in a higher power. Psychologists have found that those looking back on 'what might have been' when reflecting on a major life event that could have turned out poorly reinforces the notion of divine intervention. In particular, hindsight following a change of fortunes that turned out for the better bolsters a person's belief in God and believers use it to rationalise their faith in the face of doubt and scientific evidence.
'It might be part of a growing entitlement mentality - thinking you can get something for nothing.'
The biggest declines in belief in God have been found among 18 to 29-year-olds, according to Dr Twenge in research published in the journal Sage Open.
The findings also contradict widely-held opinions that while people may believe less in formal, organised religion there has been an increase in private spirituality.
Dr Twenge said: 'Most previous studies concluded that fewer Americans were publicly affiliating with a religion, but that Americans were just as religious in private ways. That's no longer the case, especially in the last few years.'
She added: 'The large declines in religious practice among young adults are also further evidence that Millennials [people born between 1980 and 2000] are the least religious generation in memory, and possibly in American history.'
Similar findings have been found in the UK.
A 2012 survey by the Institute of Education found that 49 per cent of Britons born in 1970 believed there is 'definitely' or 'probably' life after death.
Only 31 per cent have said that they believe in God, either without doubts (13 per cent) or with some doubts (18 per cent).
Manama: A restaurant owner in Saudi Arabia is offering free food for one year to a soldier who helped a cat drink water.
A picture of the soldier in uniform joining his palms together in order to hold water and allow a cat to lap it up went viral on the Internet, sparking praise and tribute. The setting suggests the soldier was in an ablution room of a mosque getting ready for prayers.
On seeing the picture, Abdullah Al Harithi, the restaurant owner in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, said he would offer a free lunch to the soldier for one year, starting this week.
“If he is not from Jeddah and cannot come to the restaurant, I am willing to donate to him the cost of the lunches for one year,” Al Harithi said, quoted by Saudi daily Okaz on Sunday.
Comments on the social media praised mainly the soldier for his compassion.
“These are the true values upheld by our dear servicemen - very high morals and an outstanding commitment to helping all,” Abu Nawwas posted.
Abu Zubaidi said that Saudi soldiers deserved the highest respect.
“I cannot believe that there are people targeting our soldiers and security people on phony accusations,” he said, referring to calls by terror groups to assault people in uniform. “May God bless him and protect him and his colleagues from all harm,” he said.
For Eastern Province Man, another blogger, the soldier incarnated the values that “a genuine Muslim” had to uphold.
“A truthful Muslim must be helpful with all people and animals,” he said. “He must not allow negative ideas or destructive ideologies affect him in any way.”
Other comments welcomed the restaurant owner's decision as “a great act of compassion and fraternity” that deserved to be lauded.
On PBS's “NewsHour” on Friday night, New York Times columnist David Brooks warned that Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and similar legislators' rise to prominence threatens the traditional Republican Party.
Brooks insists the motives of Cruz are less about legislation and policy and more about the politics of undermining the Republican establishment.
“What's going on in the House, and a bit in the Senate, too, is what you might call the rise of Ted Cruz-ism,” Brooks said. “And Ted Cruz, the senator from Canada through Texas, is basically not a legislator in the normal sense, doesn't have an idea that he's going to Congress to create coalitions, make alliances, and he is going to pass a lot of legislation. He's going in more as a media-protest person. And a lot of the House Republicans are in the same mode. They're not normal members of Congress. They're not legislators. They want to stop things. And so they're just being — they just want to obstruct.”
“And the second thing they're doing, which is alarming a lot of Republicans, is they're running against their own party,” he continued. “Ted Cruz is running against Republicans in the Senate. The House Republican Tea Party types are running against the Republican establishment. That's how they're raising money. That's where they're spending their money on ads. And so they're having a very obstructive role which is going on this week, and I think it's going to make John Boehner's life even more difficult.”
Watch:
Brooks hypothesized the reason the leadership in the House and Senate is unable to control the so-called Ted Cruz-ism movement is that members of it have become uninterested in any of the perks that the leadership has to offer.
“Two things that are interesting that are happening, especially being talked about this week,” Brooks said. “One, leadership in both bodies, the leadership's inability to force any discipline. That's partly because a lot of these people just are not interested in the committee assignments, the normal leverage the leadership has, in part because the earmarks are gone, some of the spending favors.”
Brooks continued that the policy goals of Cruz and others weren't actual policy goals, but a means to take over the Republican Party.
“[S]o the leadership can't impose any discipline on a Ted Cruz,” Brooks said. “There's nothing they can punish him with. And, remember, what these people, Ted Cruz and some of the tea party people, their object is not to win Obamacare. Their object is to take over the Republican Party. So, they really are running against the Republicans. And for Ted Cruz, it's potentially to get the nomination. And taking this down, if it can mobilize enough Republicans so he can take over the party and become — really transform the party, then that becomes the object. And one little straw in the wind, the Heritage Foundation, a very prominent conservative think tank, is running against Republicans. And that's part of the change that is going on here.”

Bourekas are parcels of flaky filled dough that are either fried in hot oil or melted butter or baked in the oven. In Israel, bourekas with all sorts of fillings are a bakery mainstay, and the supermarkets sell frozen ones as a convenience item. Kosher supermarkets in the U.S. and elsewhere often carry them, too, but they can be hard to find otherwise. Fortunately, they're not at all hard to make at home.
This easy recipe for Israeli potato bourekas is made with purchased puff pastry for convenience and baked for a simpler preparation. Unlike the equally popular cheese boureka, these are pareve, so they can be eaten with a meat or dairy meal.
Traditional recipes often call for margarine or butter, but if you'd like to skip both, feel free to use olive oil instead. For a vegan version, skip the eggs. You won't miss them in the filling. To help the sesame seeds adhere to the pastry, lightly brush with water or soy milk before sprinkling on the seeds.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran may abandon the nuclear deal it reached with six major powers if the United States decides to withdraw from it, Iranian foreign minister told Qatar's al Jazeera TV in New York.
A staff member removes the Iranian flag from the stage after a group picture with foreign ministers and representatives of the U.S., Iran, China, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and the European Union during the Iran nuclear talks at the Vienna International Center in Vienna, Austria July 14, 2015.

U.S. President Donald Trump has called the 2015 deal an “embarrassment”. The deal is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with Iran and its collapse could trigger a regional arms race and worsen tensions in the Middle East.
“If Washington decides to pull out of the deal, Iran has the option of withdrawal and other options,” al Jazeera TV wrote on its Twitter feed, quoting Mohammad Javad Zarif.
“Washington will be in a better position if it remains committed to the deal,” the network quoted Zarif as saying.
Al Jazeera deleted an earlier tweet citing Zarif as saying that if Washington withdrew from the deal Iran would do so too, rather than just having the option to do so, after an Iranian official said Zarif had been misquoted.
Trump is considering whether the accord serves U.S. security interests. He faces a mid-October deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with the pact.
A State Department official said Washington would not comment on every statement by an Iranian official.
“We are fully committed to addressing the totality of Iranian threats and malign activities,” the official said.

Iranian authorities had repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the agreement, under which Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions that had crippled its economy.
The prospect that Washington could renege on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it. French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that there was no alternative to the nuclear accord.
If Trump, who has called the accord “the worst deal ever negotiated”, does not recertify it by Oct. 16, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions suspended under the accord.
Edmonton police are investigating after homes, vehicles and at least 30 bus shelters were found damaged in the west end Friday morning.
Police believe the vandalism happened overnight. Officers said it appears the suspect(s) used rocks to shatter windows of bus shelters, vehicles and homes.
“We get mischiefs pretty much on a daily basis but not on a scale like this where it spans all across a whole area of the city,” Const. Brad Marshman with the Edmonton Police Service said.
Marshman said the damage spans from 149 Street to 178 Street, and from Callingwood Road to Stony Plain Road.
Ginger Poetz lives in the Laurier Heights neighbourhood. Her husband looked out their front window this morning and noticed the back window of her Jeep was completely smashed.
“It's hurtful. I don't know why anybody would want to go and damage someone's personal property. For what good reason? There really isn't one,” Poetz said.
“It's reasonably a good neighbourhood. It was pretty shocking to see.”
Poetz said she found a large rock in her SUV, which she believes was used to do the damage. Shattered glass was spewed throughout the vehicle, all the way onto the front dash.
“It's a pretty big mess.”
Each pane of glass is worth $500. Taxpayers will be on the hook to foot the bill, as it is City of Edmonton property that was damaged.
Counc. Andrew Knack calls the vandalism concerning and disappointing.
“It's rather confusing. I can't even begin to comprehend why somebody would do something like that,” he said. “I think they need to be held accountable for their actions.
“It costs money every time these shelters are smashed,” he continued. “That's money that could go to enhancing bus service for people that need it… because of the selfish actions of, I'm guessing a few individuals, now it's something we don't get to do.”
Police are receiving help from the Edmonton Transit System in the investigation. Anyone who noticed anything suspicious or may have surveillance footage is asked to contact the EPS at 780-423-4567.
Crews were out working to clean up the mess and repair the damage Friday.

Meet Kelli Space. She went to Northeastern University to get a degree in sociology. And she graduated in $200,000 of student loan debt. In the economy's newest trillion-dollar crisis, she is the 1 percent.
Kelli is not the face of America's student debt problem. Among the 37 million people in this country with student loans to pay off, the median balance is $12,800. A whole 72 percent of borrowers have less than $25,000 left in debt, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Thumbnail image for Fed_Graph_Data.png More
No, students like Kelli are the rarities, the white rhinos. Only about 5 percent of borrowers owe more than $75,000. The question is: How do they get there?
In some cases, the answer may be that the students simply didn't understand the decision they were making, at least according to a new study of high-debt borrowers by youth advocacy group Young Invincibles. The group surveyed about 6,500 former undergraduate and graduate students, who owed an average of $76,000 in loans (those who only had a bachelor's degree averaged $54,000). A full 65 percent responded that they either misunderstood or were surprised by some aspect their loans.
A whole 20 percent were taken off-guard by the size of their monthly payments. Another 20 percent were surprised by their repayment terms. About 15 percent hadn't fully anticipated the interest rate they would be paying. Although more than 3,500 graduates took out both federal loans and private bank loans, almost two-thirds said they didn't now the difference between the two (hint: private loans tend to be a lot more expensive to pay off).
"I did not fully understand the extent of what I was getting myself into," one former student, who took out $150,000 in loans, told the researchers. "All I knew was in order to pay tuition, I would need to take out private and federal loans. I was also repeatedly told by several people that I would easily be able to pay off the amount, even though it seemed pretty steep. When I graduated and fully did the math, I knew I was in trouble."
Whose responsibility is it to make sure these students understand their actions when they sign a loan term sheet? The study suggests colleges and universities themselves might need to take a firmer hand in educating young people before they commit. According to the survey, 80 percent of borrowers either learned about their loan options from a college counselor or website. These schools are already providing information. They may just need to provide better information.
More From The Atlantic
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia has moved troops closer to the border with Ukraine and continues to support rebels in the country's east, NATO's chief said on Tuesday, after an election held by the pro-Russian separatists and condemned by Kiev and Western leaders.
Ukraine's president said Sunday's vote flouted terms of a plan to end a war that has killed more than 4,000 people, and that newly formed army units would be sent to defend a string of eastern cities against a possible new rebel offensive.
“Recently we are seeing Russian troops moving closer to the border with Ukraine,” Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO, told a news conference with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.
“Russia continues to support separatists by training them, by providing equipment and support them by also having Russian special forces inside eastern parts of Ukraine.”
Russia has denied military involvement in eastern Ukraine despite what Western officials have cited as overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
“We call on Russia to make genuine efforts towards a peaceful solution,” Stoltenberg said, “and to use all their influence on the separatists to make them respect the Minsk agreements and to respect the ceasefire which is a precondition for a political solution to the difficult situation in Ukraine.”
Stoltenberg said Russia was also trying to show strength by increasing military flights close to NATO airspace in Europe.
“We (NATO) are intercepting the Russian planes whether it is in the Atlantic Sea or in the Baltic Sea or in the Black Sea. The numbers of intercepts have so far this year been over 100, which is about three times as much as the total number of intercepts the whole of last year,” he said.
The pro-Russian separatists staged swearing in ceremonies for their leaders in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.
Moscow says the election of Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky as leaders of the Donetsk and Luhansk “people's republics”, which jointly call themselves “new Russia”, means that Kiev should now negotiate with them directly.
EU TO MULL CHANGES TO SANCTIONS
Kiev has rejected this, describing the rebels as Russian-backed “terrorists” or “bandits”, with no legitimacy.
Mogherini said the EU would assess whether to strengthen or ease sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in Ukraine depending on the situation on the ground.
“This is a process that is going to go on in the coming weeks,” she said, when asked if Russia's response to Sunday's rebel ballot could trigger stiffer sanctions against Moscow.
The situation in Ukraine will be addressed at the next EU foreign ministers' meeting on Nov. 17, she said.
“...I would say the main topic of discussion today should be ... how do we make sure that we find a solution to the conflict?” the former Italian foreign minister said.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said on Monday that the newly elected leaders in eastern Ukrainian separatist regions have a “mandate” to negotiate with Kiev, Interfax news agency reported.
Mogherini said the “so-called elections” in eastern Ukraine were illegal and illegitimate and would not be recognised by the EU. There was a risk they could end chances for rebel dialogue with Kiev and dialogue between Kiev and Moscow, she said.
The EU has gradually tightened sanctions against Russia in response to its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March, after the overthrow of Kiev's pro-Russian president by protesters, and its support for the rebel cause.
Ian Apperley and Mike Riversdale who, along with Ben Wilde, are responsible for organising Hack Miramar.
It sounds like a shadowy group of cyber crims, but Hack Miramar is actually a community engagement project that aims to connect ideas with experts, data and technology.
It is the second civic hackathon event, run by eastern suburbs residents Mike Riversdale, Ian Apperley, and Ben Wilde, all with IT backgrounds.
Over two days, participants will be divided into teams to brainstorm and develop ways to use technology to improve community consultation with council and government.
They will then pitch to a Dragon's Den-style panel that organisers hope will include Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown or Deputy Mayor Justin Lester.
The first hackathon last year focused on improving Wellington's transport and ideas emerged for taxi-pooling and tracking cyclist numbers.
"The idea is simple," Apperley said.
"We get a willing troupe of people together for a weekend and we give them a challenge. In this case, the challenge is, 'How do we improve community engagement in Wellington?'
"Transport saw the creation of smartphone applications and some electronic devices as well as ideas generation.
"We think that community engagement in Wellington can be much improved. It's about how we talk to each other as neighbours and suburbs. It's about how we get the community to engage on important issues."
The event will look at expanding community engagement initiatives such as Neighbourly.co.nz, regional or suburban Twitter accounts and localised Facebook groups.
Organisers recognised that not everyone in the community was tech-savvy, but said they were open to all ideas.
Wellington City councillor Paul Eagle - chairman of the community, sport and recreation committee - supported the initiative.
"I think it's great a group have got together, recognising people are disengaged with civic issues," he said.
"I want them to challenge the council's decision-making processes."
Jason Paul, adviser on community resilience with the Wellington Region Emergency Management Office, has consulted coastal communities on the placement of tsunami warning lines.
"I'd like to see a community that is empowered to make the decisions that affect them, especially as we are starting to think about pre-planning how our communities might rebuild if we have a disaster here," Paul said.
Ben Woodward, voice behind trending Twitter account Why Wellington, says the account has unlocked the pride and passion Wellingtonians have for their city.
"A hashtag could just as easily be used as a central point for community consultation, collaboration and conversation from council level to street level."
After Hack Miramar, organisers will aim to network with groups who can help develop their ideas further.
The free event runs from 9am to 5pm on March 7 and 8 at 127 Park Rd, Miramar. Registration is through the website.
We'll Be Among the First to Play Borderlands 2 This Week! What Should We Ask Gearbox?
Joel Taveras March 21, 2012 11:49:40 AM EST
You read that correctly. Sometime this week, in an undisclosed location, we'll be among the first members of the gaming media selected to receive some hands-on time with Borderlands 2. It's kind of a big deal for us on staff considering that we were already fans of the first title and have been oozing in anticipation for the second one (it's actually the only reason I still own a 360).
Although we have plenty of questions of our own, we feel that the reason the original game was such a huge sleeper hit was mainly because of its community support and word of mouth. Now we want you — the community — to send us along your questions for Gearbox. I can't promise that we get around to all of them, so make sure you write the best damn (coherent) question that you can, if you want it answered.
I know that growing up your teacher would tell you that there “are no stupid questions,” but she lied, and there are. Please keep your questions on topic, and be reasonable. In return I'll do my very best to have them answered. Once the dead is done, I'll update this post to let you know when to expect all of this juicy Borderlands 2 coverage. Now If you'll excuse me, I have some skags to kill.
The Vision of the Cross by assistants of Detail fromby assistants of Raphael , depicting the vision of the cross and the Greek writing "Ἐν τούτῳ νίκα" in the sky, before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.
In hoc signo vinces" on a 1721 " on a 1721 Portuguese coin from the reign of King João V
"In hoc signo vinces" ( Classical Latin: [ɪn hoːk ˈsɪŋnoː ˈwɪŋkeːs]; Ecclesiastical Latin: [in ɔk ˈsiɲɲo ˈvintʃes]) is a Latin phrase conventionally translated into English as "In this sign thou shalt conquer".
The Latin phrase itself renders, rather loosely, the Greek phrase "ἐν τούτῳ νίκα", transliterated as "en toútōi níka" ( Ancient Greek: [en tóːtɔ͜ːi níːkaː], Greek pronunciation: [en ˈtuto ˈnika]), literally meaning "in this, conquer".[citation needed]
History [ edit ]
Lucius Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius was an early Christian author (c. 240 – c. 320) who became an advisor to the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine I (and tutor to his son), guiding the Emperor's religious policy as it developed during his reign.[1] His work De Mortibus Persecutorum has an apologetic character, but has been treated as a work of history by Christian writers. Here Lactantius preserves the story of Constantine's vision of the Chi Rho before his conversion to Christianity.[2] The full text is found in only one manuscript, which bears the title, Lucii Caecilii liber ad Donatum Confessorem de Mortibus Persecutorum.
The historian bishop Eusebius of Caesaria states that Constantine was marching with his army (Eusebius does not specify the actual location of the event, but it is clearly not in the camp at Rome), when he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words "(ἐν) τούτῳ νίκα" ("In this, conquer"),[3] a phrase often rendered into Latin as in hoc signo vinces ("in this sign, you will conquer").[4]
At first, Constantine did not know the meaning of the apparition, but on the following night, he had a dream in which Christ explained to him that he should use the sign of the cross against his enemies. Eusebius then continues to describe the Labarum,[5] the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against Licinius, showing the Chi-Rho sign. The accounts by Lactantius and Eusebius, though not entirely consistent, have been connected to the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312 AD), having merged into a popular notion of Constantine seeing the Chi-Rho sign on the evening before the battle.[citation needed]
The phrase appears prominently placed as a motto on a ribbon unfurled with a passion cross to its left, beneath a window over the Scala Regia, adjacent to the equestrian statue of Emperor Constantine, in the Vatican. Emperors and other monarchs, having paid respects to the Pope, descended the Scala Regia, and would observe the light shining down through the window, with the motto, reminiscent of Constantine's vision, and be reminded to follow the Cross. They would thence turn right into the atrium of St. Peter's Basilica, ostensibly so inspired.[citation needed]
The Kingdom of Portugal has used this motto since 1143, according to the legend in Lusíadas.

Notes [ edit ]
(CNN) Scientists in southern China have discovered human teeth dating back at least 80,000 years -- 20,000 years earlier than modern humans were previously believed to have left Africa to migrate around the world.
The 47 teeth were found in a cave in Daoxian, in China's Hunan province, and are the strongest proof yet that modern humans first migrated from Africa to Asia 80,000 to 120,000 years ago, according to a study published in the journal, Nature.
"This is stunning, it's major league," Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist from the University of Oxford in the UK, who was not involved in the study, told Nature . "It's one of the most important finds coming out of Asia in the last decade."
Out of Africa
The widely accepted theory of modern human migration, known as "Out of Africa," is based on available scientific evidence that indicates modern humans originated in Africa and made their first successful migration to the rest of the world in a single wave between 50,000 and 70,000 years ago.
These teeth challenge that theory, both in terms of the timing of the first migration from Africa and whether a different group of modern humans evolved separately in Asia.
One of the lead researchers, Liu Wu, on an excavation trip to the Daoxian cave in 2014.
"The fossils reveal that 80,000 years ago, the first modern humans appeared somewhere in southern China," said one of the study's lead researchers, Liu Wu, from China's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP). "We believe that southern China probably was a central area for modern evolution."
Liu told CNN that although the research hasn't yet explored where the Daoxian people were from -- and whether they originated from Africa or China -- he was inclined to believe they evolved from local ancient humans, suggesting that human evolution "didn't happen all at once."
Maria Martinón-Torres, a researcher at University College London and one of the co-leads of the study, said the new finds open up a raft of questions to be answered.
"What does this mean? What is the origin of this population (of people in China)? And what is their fate?" she asked. "Some people really now have to reconsider models. Maybe there's not only one (migration) out of Africa, (maybe) there are several out of Africa."
"And also we have to understand what happened in Asia," she added. "These populations, did they really evolve also for a while outside Africa?"
The research also raises questions about how and why modern humans reached Asia earlier than Europe, where the earliest modern human remains found so far are around 45,000 years old.
Liu said the research group plans to extract DNA from the teeth samples to shed more light on the origins of the Daoxian people.
Human remains left by predators
The teeth were found in a cave system along with the remains of mammals, including a extinct giant panda, and other animal species. No stone tools were uncovered, leading researchers to believe that humans had never lived in the cave and that the teeth had been left there by predators.
The research team now hope to DNA test the teeth to determine the origin of the Daoxian population.
"The teeth are basically the same as yours and mine," Liu said.
The teeth were so old they could not be tested using carbon dating, so scientists had to date the surrounding calcite deposits and human remains in the cave to estimate their age.
"They really look modern, but they are very old," Martinón-Torres said of the teeth. "And they are very old also particularly when we take into account that they were found in China."
Asia's archaeological frontier
Martinón-Torres believes it just the tip of the iceberg.
"I think that Asia is an unknown land," she said. "The samples are amazing, they are wild, they are variable and I think in the next few years we are going to have surprises because they have a lot to say not only about Asian study but about the main stories that we have been talking about (regarding) human evolution."
This euthanasia device was invented by Dr Philip Nitschke . Four terminally-ill Australians used it to end their lives with a lethal dose of drugs after they answered "yes" to a series of questions on the lap-top screen. This procedure was legal in Australia's Northern Territory between 1995 and 1997.
The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT)[1] was a controversial law legalising euthanasia in the Northern Territory, which was passed by the Parliament of the Northern Territory of Australia in 1995. The Act was passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 25 May 1995 by a vote of 15 to 10, received the Administrator's assent on 16 June 1995, and entered into force on 1 July 1996. A year later, a repeal bill was brought before the Northern Territory Parliament in August 1996, but was defeated by 14 votes to 11.[2]
The effect of the law was nullified in 1997 by the federal Parliament of Australia which passed the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997.[3] The Act continues on the Territory's statute books. Dr Philip Nitschke founded Exit International in response to the overturning of the Act.
While voluntary euthanasia had previously been condoned officially in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon, the act was the first time that a legislative assembly passed a law explicitly legalising euthanasia.[4]
Provisions of Act [ edit ]
The Act allowed a terminally ill patient to end their lives with medical assistance, either by the direct involvement of a physician or by procurement of drugs.
The Act set out a somewhat lengthy application process, designed to ensure that a patient was both mentally competent to make the decision and in fact terminally ill. Under the Act:
a patient had to be over 18 and be mentally and physically competent to request their own death,
the request had to be supported by three doctors, including a specialist who confirmed that the patient was terminally ill and a psychiatrist who certified that the patient was not suffering from treatable depression,
once the paperwork was complete, a nine-day "cooling-off period" was required before the death could proceed.[5]
Those who assist in the ending of a person's life under the Act were immune from prosecution or other legal consequences if acting in good faith. (Sections 16 and 20).[1]
Reaction to Act [ edit ]
The passage of the Bill—one of the first of its kind in the world—provoked a furor in Australia, and indeed in much of the rest of the world. The Act received both widespread support from "death with dignity" and right to die groups who saw it as a model to be followed elsewhere, and widespread condemnation from euthanasia opponents, such as right to life groups, who sought to overturn it.
Opponents also included the Australian Medical Association,[4] and the Bishop of Darwin, Edmund John Patrick Collins.[6]
Use of Act [ edit ]
While the law was in effect, four people died by suicide through its provisions.
The first was carpenter Bob Dent, 66, who died on 22 September 1996. Dent was a prostate cancer sufferer who became Australia's first person to lawfully end his life by means of physician assisted suicide. Dent, who had been suffering from prostate cancer for five years in what he called "a rollercoaster of pain", left an open letter when he died that stated: "If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition I am in, I would be prosecuted. If you disagree with voluntary euthanasia, then don't use it, but don't deny the right to me to use it."[5] He died with the help of Dr Philip Nitschke.[7]
The law applied to non-residents of the Northern Territory as well, and one non-resident did take advantage of the law. A resident of South Australia, Janet Mills, 52, came to Darwin in December 1996. She had suffered for some 10 years from a rare disease known as mycosis fungoides. She used Nitschke's device to take her life on 2 January 1997.[5]
In addition, an anonymous 69-year-old male cancer patient used the law and Nitschke's device to die on 22 January 1997. A further two people had received approval to use the law when the law was nullified; a proposed amendment to the Voluntary Euthanasia Laws Bill allowing them to proceed did not pass.
Overturning of the Act [ edit ]
While some people in the Northern Territory were unhappy with the Act and campaigned for its repeal, the Northern Territory legislature was unwavering in its support. Views in the rest of Australia were much less supportive, however, and opponents began demanding that the federal parliament overturn the law, which it had the power to do since the Northern Territory does not have the same standing in Australian jurisprudence as the states. The federal parliament could not have overturned an identical state law, since the states are sovereign entities possessing legislative power in their own right. However, self-governing territories like the Northern Territory derive their power by way of a grant from the federal parliament. Consequently, the federal parliament retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the right to territory laws. In practice, it very rarely exercised that right.
On 25 March 1997, the federal parliament passed the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997,[8] which, although not technically repealing the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, for all practical purposes rendered it of no legal effect. Rather than repeal the Act directly, the law instead amended the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978, the act under which the Commonwealth Parliament has delegated legislative power to the Northern Territory Parliament—effectively the territory's "constitution" or "charter"—removing the Territory's constitutional power to pass any law permitting euthanasia. The Act technically remains in force in the Territory, but to the extent that it permits euthanasia it is now invalid and of no legal effect.
Although passed as a reaction to the situation in the Northern Territory, the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 made similar amendments with respect to Australia's two other self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island, also preventing them from passing a law permitting euthanasia. The Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 has no effect on the power of an Australian state to pass any law permitting euthanasia, and it expressly leaves open the possibility of a territory passing laws regarding the withholding of life support.

The all-electric Formula E championship is off to a surprisingly good start since its launch in 2014 considering the level of difficulty associated with establishing a new racing championship.
It is still facing some technological problems, but most of them should be solved in the next generation of the race cars. We are now seeing the first pictures of the new concept.
Spark Racing Technologies, an engineering firm owned by former Renault F1 team principal Frederic Vasseur, is the supplier of the current Formula E chassis and it was selected to design the next-gen chassis, which will debut during the 2018 season.
The new chassis has a sleek new look that is closer to a supercar than the previous generation.
Spark recently released a few renders showcasing the design and while it's not the final car, the concept is a good indication of what we will see next season:
While they seem to have the aesthetics locked-in, the performance also needs improvements and Formula E promised to deliver next year.
Currently, due to battery limitations, each driver has two cars and switches between them mid-race in lieu of a traditional pit stop, but by season five the goal is for each team to have a single car which is capable of performing at race speed the whole race without recharging the battery.
McLaren is in charge of making that happen since they won the contract to supply batteries to Formula E for the next season. They will be taking over from Williams Advanced Engineering, the current battery supplier for the Championship, and they plan to double the energy capacity of the cars – from ~28 kWh to ~56 kWh.
Spark's new chassis will also contribute to the increased range with better aero and lower weight. The company wrote:
This is a new challenge for Spark as the new car must go twice the distance of the current cars, which will be accomplished by more efficient aero design, lower weight and better efficiency in the drivetrain. Safety and innovation are the main drivers of this project. We will design a new chassis including a new battery tech that will be heavier. In order to gain 10% weight, we are working on new innovating solutions using new materials so the cars can be more efficient and we also have to focus on new developments to keep the drivers safe.
We will report back when we have the final design and specs of the new all-electric race car.
“If Trump loses any combination of the states that vote on Tuesday, March 15, his path becomes improbable — and should he lose Florida, Ohio and Illinois, it will be nearly impossible for Trump to emerge as the Republican nominee for President,” reads a memo from Our Principles PAC, a group working to stop Donald Trump from becoming the Republican nominee. | AP Photo Super PAC memo outlines delegate math for stopping Trump
Donald Trump is unlikely to amass the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination, the leading anti-Trump super PAC argued in a memo Wednesday.
Our Principles PAC, a super PAC run by former Mitt Romney aide Katie Packer that has spent millions of dollars' worth of TV ads savaging Trump, said the Republican front-runner severely underperformed last weekend when he won Kentucky and Louisiana but lost Kansas and Maine to Ted Cruz.
“If Trump loses any combination of the states that vote on Tuesday, March 15, his path becomes improbable — and should he lose Florida, Ohio and Illinois, it will be nearly impossible for Trump to emerge as the Republican nominee for President,” the memo reads.
The missive lays out various scenarios that could play out on Tuesday and beyond. Trump could win a series of states, Our Principles allows, but still fall short of the 1,237-delegate mark if he loses Florida and Ohio.
Even if Trump wins Florida — where he has a big lead in the polls — and a number of upcoming states, he would still be below the delegate threshold, according to the memo.
Should Trump manage to win Florida and Ohio, as well as a number of additional states the memo outlines, he would again be short of the necessary delegates.
“Further complicating Trump's chances is the fact that there are a number of closed primaries coming up, where only Republicans are allowed to vote — such as Florida's primary,” the memo says. “To date there have only been three such contests: Oklahoma and Idaho (both of which Trump lost); and Louisiana (which he carried by a narrow 41% - 38% margin). After March 15, there will be twelve more ‘closed' primaries … representing 636 delegates or 44% of the delegates yet to be chosen.”
“Given the current dynamics of the race,” the memo concludes, “it will be difficult for Donald Trump to win the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination.”
The Washington Post first reported the memo.
MainStage, with its all-in-one instrument and effect rig powers, is now a la carte, and both Logic and MainStage are cheaper. A lot cheaper. Image courtesy Apple.
As expected, Apple moved its Logic Pro music production tool to the App Store. And the results are mostly what you'd expect. The biggest change is the price: Logic gets slashed to US$199.99, while MainStage gets a so-low-you-might-as-well-try-it $29.99 sticker price.
Wave editor Soundtrack Pro, removed from Final Cut Studio, is gone here, too. Lesser-known mastering tool WaveBurner gets the axe.
Logic Pro 9 is still Logic Pro 9. Today is a minor update that you can now download via the App Store if you choose. Logic Studio remains for sale through Apple in its boxed edition, but at two hundred bucks, the App Store version is the winner.
No Logic Pro X
If you were expecting Logic Pro X, my guess is, it's just not done yet. I still expect the number ten to follow the number nine. (Amazing how that works.) I don't expect Logic Pro X to produce the kind of disruption that Final Cut Pro X did, however. Logic already has a 64-bit infrastructure. Final Cut had an aging code base, deeply rooted in deprecated versions of QuickTime, that prompted Apple to do a ground-up rewrite. The initial results made people unusually unhappy, and perhaps justifiably so, but ground-up rewrites of software this complex tends to be ugly at first. There's no reason to believe Logic will face a similar overhaul. Whatever Apple is doing, I'm in no rush; Logic is a deep program, and I'd rather wait for upgrades from everyone (note to all developers everywhere) than have serious production software rushed out before its time.
Logic Express is also, not surprisingly, eliminated. At $200, there just isn't a spot for Express any more. And I've never been in love with this kind of product tiers; you're constantly explaining to people whether they should get Express or Pro, as they desperately try to work out how “serious” they are in light of the products.
What is notable is MainStage: there are some welcome tweaks, and absurdly-cheap, standalone pricing that should get some attention.
Most importantly, $30 now gets you all of the instruments and effects from Logic in MainStage, including instruments like Sculpture.
MainStage
The real changes software-wise come in MainStage. For starters, if you don't love Logic but want to try Apple's live performance / instrument and effect rig, you can now do that. MainStage works standalone, and you even get all the Apple Loop sound content and sample-based instruments previously available in Logic Pro – Jam Packs and all, what once could have cost you hundreds of dollars is now thirty bucks. One thing I wondered about with the App Store was how Apple would handle distribution of all that content. They've thoughtfully allowed you to check off only the content you want to install, saving bandwidth and hard disk space if you don't want everything.
All those instruments and effects: You also get, bundled into the package, an extensive collection of everything from guitar amps and stompboxes to the Ultrabeat drum machine to virtual instruments from analog to the unique physical-modeling Sculpture. Because MainStage supports ReWire, that means if you, say, love Ableton Live or Cubase more than Logic, but longed for some of those Apple instruments, you can now play with them in your DAW for thirty bucks without having to buy the whole Logic package. You'd just route audio straight into your DAW.
Check out the extensive list of instruments and effects on the MainStage product page. (They're called “plug-ins,” but they can only be used in Logic and MainStage, not in other tools.)
For onstage or live studio use, MainStage also includes a looper, backing track player, and other useful tools.
MainStage 2.2 also delivers some new features for your $30. From the release notes, I spot a few highlights:
Now takes “full advantage” of Macs with four or more processor cores
New template picker, Assignments and Mappings view for streamlined screen and hardware control
Bigger interface elements
More MIDI control, SMF support for sending SysEx and other data when you make a patch change, block unwanted controller messages
Support for: Akai MPK25, Akai MPK49, Alesis Q25, Korg nanoKey2, Korg nanoKontrol2, Korg nanoPad2, updated M-Audio Axiom and Oxygen models, Novation Nocturn 25
There are also some bug fixes and improved ReWire support.
None of this is really earth-shaking in itself – though it's nice to see those patch change additions for people with hardware rigs. But the big news here is that, with MainStage unbundled from Logic, it's in a whole new product category. It could be a viable option for Mac owners wanting to control plug-ins and hardware from a streamlined setup, even if they're not Logic fans. And that could open MainStage to new audiences using other DAWs. Years ago, I reviewed a similar app, Rax, now marketed by Audiofile Engineering. (At the time, it was developed by Plasq, now better known for Skitch, which they just sold successfully to Evernote.) I was disappointed that no one really picked up on the app.
The idea is great: make a simple, straightforward app that gets you actually playing instruments on your computer with minimum fuss. It still seems like a great idea, and perhaps now the time is right. Rax/MainStage shootout, anyone?
Bottom Line
Sometimes, it's news that something isn't news. For all the rumors that the App Store transition was going to be a big deal, I think for Logic users, it's probably not. It could be a more convenient way to distribute Apple's software. And it sure makes those days of giant Logic boxes and blue Emagic copy protection dongles seem distant, huh? But I don't think the question is whether competitors will go to the App Store, specifically. I think the question will be more generally, when will we cease to see boxes of nothing but software in stores? It seems stores may continue to carry hardware bundles, but that software will get delivered, you know, on the Internet.
OAKLAND — Two people were shot Monday night in West Oakland while leaving a local store, authorities said.
Both were recovering Tuesday at a hospital.
The shooting happened about 10:51 p.m. Monday in the 900 block of 32nd Street.
Authorities said the 30-year-old woman and 41-year-old man had just left a neighborhood market and were walking when more than one person approached and began shooting at them.
The woman was hit in the back and the man in the abdomen. They were able to get their own transportation to a hospital.

A house in the area was also hit by the gunfire but no one else was hurt.
Authorities were not sure what the pair's relationship was.
No motive for the shooting has been released yet by police and no arrests have been made.
Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering up to $10,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of the suspects in the shooting. Anyone with information may call police at 510-238-3426 or Crime Stoppers at 510-777-8572.

Provinces, SANA – Army and Armed Forces units clashed with ISIS terrorists on the southern and western axes of Deir Ezzor city and the surroundings of the Military Airport, where many of the terrorists were either killed or injured and their weapons destroyed.
SANA's reporter said that the Syrian Air Force carried out intensive airstrikes on the hideouts and movements of ISIS terrorists in the areas of al-Huseinia, al-Bogheilia, the Panorama, Hattla, Marat, and Mazloum, inflicting heavy losses upon the terrorists in personnel and weaponry.
In the meantime, several mortar shells fired by the terrorists landed in the neighborhoods of al-Joura, al-Qosour, and Harabesh, causing huge material damage, but no casualties were reported.
Moreover, local sources confirmed that a number of ISIS leaders fled Deir Ezzor, including the deputy “Emir of Hisba” in al-Ashara area Hamed al-Nouri aka “Abu Hamza al-Qaraani,” in addition to the terrorists Bashar al-Maddah, Ibrahim al-Bandar, Mohammad al-Qassouba, Abdulhadi al-Halloum, and two Kazakh terrorists.
The sources said that a group of locals attacked the so-called “al-Hisba Headquarters” in al-Hajin town in the eastern countryside, killing a terrorist and injuring two.
Meanwhile, the army's air force carried out a series of raids on the positions of ISIS terrorists in Um Tweinah to the east of Jub al-Jarah in Homs eastern countryside.
SANA reporter said that the raids ended up with the killing of more than 20 terrorists, destroying a cache, a vehicle bomb and a tank.
While bamboo floors, textiles, and laminates have gained increasing popularity among homeowners, it's also carving a niche for itself in the biking community. Denmark-based E-Wheels just rolled out the world's first bamboo-framed electric mountain bike, appropriately called “the Beast.”
Very light, extremely strong, and able to grow up to a meter a day, bamboo could end up being the all-natural material of the future. While the idea of using bamboo on vehicles is something explored by niche design groups and major automakers alike and even road bicycles, the E-Wheels Beast is the first application of bamboo on an electric mountain bike.
The Beast utilizes a Zambia-built ZamBikes bamboo mountain bike frame, and attaches a Falco eMotors 250W electric motor to big, thick 26-inch tires and a RockShox suspension. The Beast is assembled in Denmark by E-Wheels, and if bamboo is tough enough for the Scandinavians, it is tough enough for you. Not only is this bike gorgeous, lightweight, and strong, but the electric motor can help power up some serious hills and obstacles.
The Beast is as much a work of art as it is a mountain bike though, and the gorgeously-polished bamboo frame is held together with natural fibers and glue. Alas, this bike is only for sale in Europe right now; completed bikes cost 3999 euros, while DIY kits that can be shipped anywhere in Europe start at 3499 euros, or about $4,500.
Do. Want. Bring it to America!

Today, as Jeff Sessions was formally sworn in as attorney general for Donald Trump's administration, the president signed and released a trio of executive actions detailing his commitment to fight crime, most particularly drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and violent crimes against law enforcement officers.
To be clear, though these are all executive orders, they do not actually attempt to change any existing rules or policies immediately. This isn't like Trump's order on travel visas—the president does not have anywhere near as much latitude in changing laws and regulations here. As we saw under President Barack Obama, though, he can set the stage for how the Department of Justice actually implements or enforces laws.
What we see from these executive orders is Trump calling for exactly what he has promised while campaigning. He argues that we are in a surge of threatening violent crimes, actual data be damned, and wants to reverse it.
One executive action calls for increased efforts in fighting "transnational criminal organizations," particularly drug cartels and human traffickers. It calls for more of what federal law enforcement is already doing (see Elizabeth Nolan Brown's reporting on trafficking this morning) and calls for a new "working group."
The second executive action calls for a "task force" to "reduce crime and restore public safety to communities across the Nation." If this sounds a little redundant when matched up to the previous executive order, that's somewhat the case. Of concern, it calls for federal law enforcement to "take the lead" in supporting local public safety issues, whatever that could possibly mean. A very important bullet point about this task force's goals that should be a concern for those who would see a ramping down on actions like the drug war:
[I]dentify deficiencies in existing laws that have made them less effective in reducing crime and propose new legislation that could be enacted to improve public safety and reduce crime
This sounds like a call for tougher laws or sentences. That does not sound like an administration that is interested in the Department of Justice taking it easy on the people it arrests.
The third executive order contains what is probably the most ominous proposal. It's an order calling for strategies to protect law enforcement officers across the country and at all levels from violence. It contains this possible goal:
[P]ursue appropriate legislation, consistent with the Constitution's regime of limited and enumerated Federal powers, that will define new Federal crimes, and increase penalties for existing Federal crimes, in order to prevent violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers.
Who is ready for a federal Blue Lives Matter sentence enhancement law! It also suggests further down the possibility of increasing mandatory minimum sentences for crimes that involve violence against police.
Two important things: First, despite the constant rhetoric and some high-profile incidents, police have been largely seeing a lengthy drop in violence targeting them over years. There was an uptick in 2016, but it was an anomaly (and not a huge one) in the current downward trends. In total, 63 police officers were killed by gunfire in 2016. Another 12 were killed by vehicular assault. These are the numbers over which we're considering new federal laws and penalties. I noted in October that there's also been an increase in the number of assaults on law enforcement officers, but it's too soon to say there's a trend there, and it's again after years of decreasing numbers. The data does not support the "war on police" narrative.
Second, we've seen what has happened in Louisiana as a result of efforts to create "new" laws to protect police, and it's not pretty. Louisiana passed a law adding police and emergency responders to its hate crime statute. Meaning, if a person specifically targets a police officer for a crime, he or she faces an enhanced sentence as though they had targeted somebody on the basis of their race or religion.
Well, that's what the law is supposed to mean. In reality, what has happened so far is that police have attempted (unsuccessfully) to charge people with hate crimes on the basis of them saying things the police didn't like while the police were interacting with them. That's allegedly not what the hate crime law is supposed to do, yet the very people covered by the law are the ones who are deciding whether to charge somebody with it. As C.J. Ciaramella noted, one police chief in the state attempted to argue that simply resisting arrest in Louisiana could be classified as a hate crime.
The last thing we want or need to happen is for such a terrible law to pass nationally and subject people to federal prosecution for such subjective reasons. We have enough of that already.

When President Barack Obama signed an update to U.S. law protecting religious freedom late last week, one provision drew special attention: U.S. law now recognizes non-believers as, in essence, a religious group.
Obama's signing of amendments to the International Religious Freedom Act on Friday wasn't widely noticed — except among the community of atheists, agnostics and others who categorize themselves as "humanists."
For the first time, the law — which was originally passed in 1998 — specifies that "the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess or practice any religion."
Among other things, the main amendments to the law promoting religious liberty around the world:
Allow the United States to target "entities of particular concern" (that is, groups that aren't sovereign countries, like ISIS and Boko Haram).
Set up a way to track religious prisoners overseas.
Require that all foreign service officers undergo training in religious liberty.

The addition of protections for non-theistic or even non-existent beliefs wasn't even mentioned in many news reports. But for Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the nonprofit American Humanist Association, the change is a historic cause for celebration.
"That non-theists are now recognized as a protected class is a significant step toward full acceptance and inclusion for non-religious individuals, who are still far too often stigmatized and persecuted around the world," Speckhardt said.
"Legislators are finally recognizing the human dignity of humanists and granting the non-theistic community the same protections and respect that have been given to religious communities," he said.
In its 2016 annual report (PDF), the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal panel that was created under the original 1998 law, highlights numerous instances of persecution of atheists and other non-believers.
The report plays no favorites, singling out important U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia, where the poet Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death last year for "apostasy" — specifically, for spreading atheism. The sentence was reduced in February 2016 to eight years in prison and 800 lashes.
Regulations enacted in 2014 by the Saudi Interior Ministry, in fact, classify "calling for atheist thought in any form" as terrorism.
The report also harshly criticizes Egypt, which convicted Mustafa Abdel-Nabi, an online activist, to prison in absentia in February for "blasphemy" after he published posts about atheism on his Facebook page. A year earlier, another Facebook user, Sherif Gaber, was sentenced to prison for discussing his atheist views online.
"Religious freedom for all people, theists and non-theists, is an American value we must protect," said Matthew Bulger, legislative director of the American Humanist Association.
But it's not just humanist groups that are applauding the revision.
"Protecting non-theistic beliefs and requiring increased religious freedom training for our foreign service officers emphasizes our shared value of religious liberty for all people across the globe," said J. Brent Walker, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Freedom, a coalition of more than a dozen Baptist denominations.
"We are pleased that religious liberty still finds broad bipartisan support," Walker, an ordained minister, said in a statement to The Baptist Standard, a publication devoted to the Baptist faith.
From the iconic prism of The Dark Side of the Moon to Animals' inflatable pig, the intentions behind Pink Floyd's striking album covers still generate feverish debate among fans.
Now a teenage Egyptian artist has been chosen to continue that lineage by creating a memorable image to accompany the rock legends' surprise return with their first new album in 20 years.
Ahmed Emad Eldin, an 18-year-old, hitherto unknown Egyptian digital artist, has provided the imagery of a man punting on a “river” of clouds towards the glow of the sun, which will adorn The Endless River, a largely instrumental album, released in November.

The album is described as a “tribute” to Rick Wright, Pink Floyd's keyboardist who died in 2008, and features his contributions from 1993 sessions for The Division Bell album, which have been enhanced by David Gilmour and Nick Mason.
Storm Thorgerson, the graphic designer whose surreal covers for Floyd's classic albums, including Dark Side... immeasurably enhanced the group's mystique, died last year prompting an international search for an artistic successor.

Aubrey Powell, Thorgerson's partner in the Hipgnosis design studio, discovered Eldin. Powell said: “When we saw Ahmed's image it had an instant Floydian resonance. It's enigmatic and open to interpretation, and is the cover that works so well for The Endless River.”
Born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Eldin began experimenting as a digital artist when he was 13 and is now based in Cairo.
Eldin told The Independent: “A creative agency working for Pink Floyd contacted me after checking my artworks through the internet as my work has appeared on online galleries on behance.net.”
Responding via email, Eldin described the inspiration behind his design: “Thinking about life and nature and what is beyond the world of charming factors we have never seen is enough to create millions of different amazing feelings.”
“First, I draw a sketch for what is in my mind, then I start to simulate the sketch and the idea with real images, and that's called photo manipulation.”
His Endless River artwork was displayed for the first time on an 8m illuminated cube installation on the South Bank. Images of the sleeve art were also displayed in prime spots in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Berlin and Milan.
Although many will only see Eldin's cover as a thumbprint-sized image in their digital music collection, it will also grace a double-album vinyl version of the album, designed to be listened to as a four-sided LP suite, with a classic gatefold sleeve.
The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) is regarded by some as the greatest album sleeve of all time. Thorgerson, who came across the image of the prism in a photo book, explained that the light reflected the band's psychedelic live shows and triangle was a symbol of ambition, which was in the band's lyrics. He went on to create the “burning man” cover for Wish You Were Here (1975) and Animals, (1977) which featured an inflatable pig floating over Battersea power station.
The Endless River is largely instrumental, with one song, Louder Than Words, featuring new lyrics by Polly Samson, Gilmour's novelist wife.
Gilmour said: “The Endless River has as its starting point the music that came from the 1993 Division Bell sessions. We listened to over 20 hours of the three of us playing together and selected the music we wanted to work on for the new album.
“Over the last year we've added new parts, rerecorded others and generally harnessed studio technology to make a 21st century Pink Floyd album. With Rick gone, and with him the chance of ever doing it again, it feels right that these revisited and reworked tracks should be made available as part of our repertoire.”
Washington, D.C., March 2, 2016 – Marking the 85th birthday of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the National Security Archive at George Washington University (www.nsarchive.org) today posted a series of previously classified British and American documents containing Western assessments of Gorbachev starting before he took office in March 1985, and continuing through the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The documents show that conservative British politicians were ahead of the curve predicting great things for rising Soviet star Gorbachev in 1984 and 1985, but the CIA soon caught on, describing the new Soviet leader only three months into his tenure as “the new broom,” while Ronald Reagan greeted Gorbachev's ascension with an immediate invitation for a summit. The documents posted today include positive early assessments by Margaret Thatcher and MP John Browne, CIA intelligence reports that bookend Gorbachev's tenure from 1985 to 1991, the first letters exchanged by Reagan and Gorbachev, the American versions of key conversations with Gorbachev at the Geneva, Reykjavik and Malta summits, German chancellor Helmut Kohl's credit to Gorbachev in 1989 for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, and the U.S. transcript of the G-7 summit in 1990 that turned down Gorbachev's request for financial aid.
The Archive gathered the Gorbachev documentation for two books, the Link-Kuehl-Award-winning “Masterpieces of History”: The Peaceful End of the Cold War in Europe 1989 (Central European University Press, 2010), and the forthcoming Last Superpower Summits: Gorbachev, Reagan and Bush (CEU Press, 2016). The sources include the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library, and Freedom of Information and Mandatory Declassification Review requests to the CIA and the State Department.
Leading today's Gorbachev briefing book is British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's “discovery” of Gorbachev in December 1984 during his trip to Britain as head of a Soviet parliamentary delegation. In contrast to his elderly and infirm predecessors who slowly read dry notes prepared for them, Gorbachev launched into animated free discussion and left an indelible impression on Lady Thatcher. The Prime Minister, charmed by the Soviet leader, quickly shared her impressions with her closest ally and friend, Ronald Reagan. She commented famously, “I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together.”
Soon after Gorbachev became the Soviet General Secretary, a Conservative member of the British parliament, John Browne, who observed Gorbachev during his visit to Britain and then followed information on Gorbachev's every early step, compared him to “Kennedy in the Kremlin” in terms of his charisma. By June 1985, the CIA told senior U.S. officials in a classified assessment that Gorbachev was “the new broom” that was attempting to clean up the years of debris that accumulated in the Soviet Union during the era of stagnation.
But Reagan had to see for himself. For four years before Gorbachev, as the American president complained in his diary, he had been trying to meet with a Soviet leader face to face, but “they keep dying on me.” In his first letter to Gorbachev, which Vice President George H.W. Bush carried to Moscow for the funeral of Gorbachev's predecessor, Reagan invited Gorbachev to meet. Gorbachev and Reagan became pen-pals who wrote long letters – sometimes personally dictated, even handwritten – explaining their positions on arms control, strategic defenses, and the need for nuclear abolition.
Their first meeting took place in Geneva in November 1985, where in an informal atmosphere of “fireside chats” they began realizing that the other was not a warmonger but a human being with a very similar dream—to rid the world of nuclear weapons. That dream came very close to a breakthrough during Gorbachev and Reagan's summit in Reykjavik; but Reagan's stubborn insistence on SDI and Gorbachev's stubborn unwillingness to take Reagan at his word on technology sharing prevented them from reaching their common goal.
Through a series of unprecedented superpower summits, Gorbachev made Reagan and Bush understand that the Soviet leader was serious about transforming his country not to threaten others, but to help its own citizens live fuller and happier lives, and to be fully integrated into the “family of nations.” Gorbachev also learned from his foreign counterparts, establishing a kind of peer group with France's Mitterrand, Germany's Kohl, Britain's Thatcher, and Spain's Gonzalez, which developed his reformist positions further and further. By the time George H.W. Bush as president finally met Gorbachev in Malta, the Soviet Union was having free elections, freedom of speech was blossoming, velvet revolutions had brought reformers to power in Eastern Europe, and the Berlin Wall had fallen to cheers of citizens but severe anxieties in other world capitals.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote in his letter to Bush at the end of November 1989: “Regarding the reform process in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the CSSR [Czechoslovakia], and not least the GDR [East Germany], we have General Secretary Gorbachev's policies to thank. His perestroika has let loose, made easier, or accelerated these reforms. He pushed governments unwilling to make reforms toward openness and toward acceptance of the people's wishes; and he accepted developments that in some instances far surpassed the Soviet Union's own standards.”
In 1989, the dream of what Gorbachev called “the common European home” was in the air and Gorbachev was the most popular politician in the world. When he was faced with discontent and opposition in his country, he refused to use force, like his Chinese neighbors did at Tiananmen Square. And yet, the West consistently applied harsher standards to Gorbachev's Soviet Union than to China, resulting in feet dragging on financial aid, credits, and trade. As Francois Mitterrand pointed out during the G-7 summit in Houston in 1990: “the argument put forth for helping China is just the reverse when we are dealing with the USSR. We are too timid […] regarding aid to the USSR. […].”
What Gorbachev started in March 1985 made his country and the world better. In cooperation with Reagan and Bush, he ended the Cold War, pulled Soviet troops out of Afghanistan, helped resolve local conflicts around the globe, and gave Russia the hope and the opportunity to develop as a normal democratic country. As with many great reformers, he did not achieve everything he was striving for – he certainly never intended for the Soviet Union to collapse – but his glasnost, his non-violence, and his “new thinking” for an interdependent world created a legacy that few statesmen or women can match. Happy birthday, Mikhail Sergeyevich!

Mohammed, a 12-year old Syrian boy from Aleppo with an amputated leg, holds a Syrian opposition flag and a defaced poster of Russia's President Vladimir Putin that reads "Killer Putin!" as he takes part in an anti-Russian protest in Istanbul, Turkey, November 27, 2015. Murad Sezer/Reuters Analysts largely agree that Russia's entry into the Syrian civil war on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has not yet turned the tide of the war in Assad's favor.
But in the nearly four months since Russia launched its air campaign there to bolster pro-Assad forces, Russia has slowly but surely "changed the slope of certain battlefields in favor of the regime."
That's according to Jeff White, a defense fellow at The Washington Institute specializing in the military and security affairs of the Levant and Iran.
"Not dramatically, but perceptively," White told Business Insider of the effect of Russian involvement.
"These include northern Latakia, Aleppo, perhaps eastern Homs and maybe Daraa, although Daraa is shakier," White said. "The Russians have also allowed the regime to go on the offensive and to increase pressure on rebels generally, likely increasing attrition of rebel forces, commanders and equipment and making rebel logistics activity more difficult."
Aleppo, Syria's largest city and its main urban center in the north, is arguably the most strategically important frontline of the war. The city is currently enveloped in a four-way battle among regime forces, rebel groups, the Islamic State and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) — an alliance of Kurdish, Arab, Assyrian and Turkmen militias supported by the US.
Russia's intervention in late September was followed by a regime offensive to recapture Aleppo from opposition forces, who control roughly half of the city's eastern flank. The offensive did not result in any significant gains for the regime.
"The city is surrounded by Jabhat al-Nusra in the west and IS in the east," Fabrice Balanche, an associate professor and research director at the University of Lyon 2, and visiting fellow at The Washington Institute, told Al-Monitor at the time. He was referring, respectively, to the Syrian Al-Qaeda affiliate and an alternate acronym for ISIS.
"The city is also located only 50 kilometers [31 miles] from Turkey, from which rebels receive substantial logistical support," Balanche added. "One can hardly imagine that the Syrian army can retake Aleppo completely without control of the Turkish-Syrian border."
In this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, shows Syrian government troops walk inside the Kweiras air base, east of Aleppo, Syria, Wednesday, Nov. 11, 2015. SANA via AP Three months later, however, the regime is closer to controlling that area, owing to an intense Russian bombing campaign along the Turkish-Syrian border that began in late November after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane.
"Russian aircraft are multiplying their raids on the corridor and weakening the rebel defenses, especially near the border crossing of Bab al-Salam, and losing this road would leave rebel units in the eastern districts almost completely surrounded by regime forces," Balanche wrote for the Washington Institute last week.
Indeed, the airstrikes have shifted the epicenter of the war toward a corridor north of Aleppo, through which Turkey smuggles aid and supplies to the rebel groups it supports. That aid, flowing through Azaz to the northern capital, has been all but cut off.
That development, combined with the steady tempo of Russian airstrikes in Aleppo province more broadly, have allowed regime forces to approach the city from the southeast and put substantial pressure on the rebel forces stationed there.
Institute for the Study of War Indeed, in an analysis of the Azaz corridor's strategic importance last month, Balanche wrote that Russia's airstrikes in the area could allow the regime to "lock other Turkish crossing points between Bab al-Hawa and Jisr al-Shughour, effectively putting the entire province of Idlib in a net."
White said, however, that it was too soon to say whether Russia's intervention had definitively turned the tide of the war in Assad's favor.
"The problem with tides is that they run both ways," White said. "That has been the pattern of the Syrian war."
Assad regime efforts to recapture Aleppo have ebbed and flowed over the past four years, depending on how much manpower the government could devote to retaking the northern capital.

It ebbed when the regime wanted to focus more of its efforts on regaining territory in the south, for example, around October. But Russia seems to be pulling its weight there, too: Russian airstrikes around the Syrian capital of Damascus killed one of the southern front's most important rebel leaders, Zahran Alloush, on Christmas day.
A recent Financial Times article, moreover, highlighted how Russia's growing role in the south may be shifting the balance against the rebels operating there. It's part of a larger strategy employed by Moscow and the regime, some experts say, to turn military victories into diplomatic leverage ahead of negotiations over Syria's future.
The rebels, for the most part, have remained resolute in their demands. Opposition leaders told the UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura last week that they will only participate in talks if the regime stops bombing civilians, releases some detainees, and lifts blockades on rebel-held areas.

"Can the international community achieve the implementation of this pre-negotiation stage in the few remaining days? If it can, there is no problem," Riyad Naasan Agha, a member of the opposition council, told Reuters on Saturday. "But I doubt they can."
Russia and the regime, meanwhile, are likely reveling in the notion that some opposition groups will refuse to come to the table. Russia retains the ability to strike rebels that sit out of the talks — on the grounds that they are impeding the peace process. "The regime is not going to compromise on talks," Syria analyst Joshua Landis, head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told the Financial Times last week. "They now think they're going to win on the battlefield, and that Russia is taking them to the finish line."
There is absolutely no doubting that Game of Thrones has had a massive impact on television since its debut in 2011. The show's actors have gone from C-list to A-list, it shows that big budget television can make a huge profit and it has transcended high fantasy from the realm of the nerd to the mass market. Since Game of Thrones there has been endless chatter about several other fantasy book series being adapted (Game of Thrones is based on The Song of Ice and Fire books by everybody's favourite gnome-looking writer George RR Martin). I think that this is truly the way forward for fantasy adaptations; greedy corporations always want to make franchises out of adaptations of books and TV would be a much more versatile medium than film.
Science fiction and fantasy are often seen grouped together on the shelves of the ever decreasing libraries and bookshops and it's true, the genres do appeal to the same sort of reader (me) but when it comes to adapting them from the screen they couldn't be more different. Science fiction is a genre that is perfect for film because it's all about an idea. Whether it be about aliens, androids or inter-dimensional travel, a two hour movie is enough time to explore a science-fiction idea. Fantasy on the other hand is about so much more than an idea; it's about a world. Game of Thrones wouldn't have worked as a film because the world is so rich and complex to be explored in a mere couple of hours. There are of course examples of some great sci-fi shows (Star Trek) and fantasy films (The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit) but Star Trek on television was run into the ground after a lack of ideas and the Middle Earth films barely scratched the surface of the reams of lore produced by Tolkien.
So let's delve into the multitude of reasons why fantasy is suited for television. As I've previously discussed TV, whether it be the Game of Thrones thing of 10 episodes, the more usual 13 episode seasons or a huge 24 episodes, allows for more time for world building as well as introducing a wide array of characters (imagine how many characters would have to be cut from Game of Thrones if it was a movie). The time spent in the world allows for deeper characterisation and the metaphors and allegories that are rife in fantasy fiction can be explored in a suitable way, not rushed by running time concerns. It's not just the world that is expansive in fantasy but the story too. Most fantasy books are behemoths of fiction and a show is needed to actually tell the story from the page with the correct pacing.
Almost all of the recently released fantasy films aim for a PG-13/12A certificate so that they are available for a wide audience but are any of them successful? Other than the Hobbit movies the answer is no. Many recent fantasy films, such as Seventh Son, have been commercial and critical failures due to movie studios attempting to appeal to everyone and nobody enjoying the results. TV networks spend less on a show than a film so they don't have to make their products attractive to everyone at the risk of tone and story. Once again Game of Thrones is a great example of this; it's become one of the most popular shows on the planet by picking a dark tone with high levels of adult content and sticking with it.
For my money some of the best actors today are working in television, not film. The decline of the 30 million dollar movie and indie scene and the rise of big budget relatively dumb blockbuster has led to a mass exodus of actors from film to television. I'm talking about actors and actresses like Jon Hamm, Bryan Cranston, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Elizabeth Moss and Vera Farmiga. Those are the types of people who would be great for fantasy adaptations, not huge movie stars looking only for their next ridiculously massive pay check.
The Dark Tower is Stephen King's foray into fantasy with the book series taking on a western Lord of the Rings kind of vibe. I've recently read the first book, The Gunslinger, and really enjoyed it and was happy to find out a film is in development. The first book is relatively small and its story could fit into the confounds of a 2 and a bit hour movie. JJ Abrams was once connected to direct but with him now out of the picture with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Nikolaj Arcel (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) is the planned director. The problem is that the books keep getting bigger as the series progresses. Back when JJ was attached to the project, The Dark Tower was going to be a film trilogy but with two seasons of an HBO produced TV show to fill in the gaps. This is a smart way of doing things by pleasing book fans with the material not in the films being in the show but also streamlining the story so people who only see the films don't feel they've missed out on anything. There should be more symbiotic film/TV relationships because it really could work for the storytelling. Sadly HBO pulled out to pursue, yep I'm mentioning it once more, Game of Thrones and the current plan is to adapt all the books as films.

WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, suggesting an acceleration in job growth in September.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended Sept.20, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 300,000 last week.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,250 to 293,500.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the state level data.
Claims are hovering near their pre-recession levels, an indication that labor market conditions are tightening despite August's sharp slowdown in job growth.
The jobless claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid edged up 7,000 to 2.44 million in the week ended Sept. 13.
The data for the so-called continuing claims covered the household survey week from which the unemployment rate for September will be calculated.
Continuing claims fell 89,000 between the August and September survey weeks, suggesting some improvement in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate was at 6.1 percent in August.
Call for policy of believing alleged victims to be scrapped as inquiry finds 43 failings in child sexual abuse investigation
Senior detectives fell for “false allegations” from a man who claimed VIPs had sexually abused and killed children, and then misled a judge to get warrants to search the homes of innocent members of the establishment, distressing them and their loved ones, a report has found.
The report into Operation Midland by Sir Richard Henriques, a retired judge, said one of the reasons detectives blundered was because they had to believe the victim under a policy originally aimed at stopping officers hiding the scale of sexual violence.
The main complainant, known as Nick, is now under investigation by Northumbria police for allegedly perverting the course of justice. Details of his alleged conduct are outlined in sections of Henriques's report that the Metropolitan police are keeping secret, the Guardian understands.
Detectives helped Nick fill out a claim for criminal injury compensation, and at one point described his claims as “credible and true”. But Henriques identified 43 failings by detectives who spent 16 months and more than £2m pursuing the allegations.
Nick's claims led to the Met investigating public figures including the former military chief Lord Bramall, the former home secretary Leon Brittan and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.
Henriques said police should have spotted that Nick was not credible earlier, and ceased their investigation sooner.
Operation Midland: how the Met lost its way Read more
The report concluded: “Those accused remained isolated and uninformed of the progress of these several investigations until finally being informed that there was an insufficiency of evidence against them. In short, these men are all victims of false allegations and yet they remain treated as men against whom there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. The presumption of innocence appears to have been set aside.”
Bramall's late wife witnessed the search of their home, Lady Brittan was distressed by the raid on their property, and Proctor has said police actions ruined his livelihood.
Henriques called for an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry into the false grounds used to obtain search warrants. “The gravity of a judge being misled in such circumstances cannot be overstated.”
He said the searches were carried out “when there were no reasonable grounds to believe an indictable offence had been committed”.
Police stated in the application for a warrant that the victim had contacted police in late 2014, “when in fact Nick first contacted MPS [Metropolitan police service] in 2012 before being referred to Wiltshire police where he was interviewed at length in December 2012”.
One police chief and four detectives are to face investigation for potential disciplinary offences.
The deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who was in day-to-day charge of Operation Midland as well as a separate inquiry into claims Brittan had raped a woman in the 1960s, denied any wrongdoing. “I do not believe that I, or indeed any officer within Operation Midland, have committed any misconduct,” he said.
The Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioned the report in February, a month before Operation Midland was shut down having been unable to establish any grounds for arrest. It was dismissed by critics as a baseless witch-hunt, and Henriques's report damned the Met.
He said the presumption of innocence had been sacrificed for the policy that victims should be believed. He said the protocol “perverts our system of justice” and should be scrapped.
While Hogan-Howe backed the report's findings, the rest of British policing and victims' groups appeared to oppose it, saying it could damage the fight to bring sexual abusers to justice.
David Tucker, crime lead at the College of Policing, said: “To start an investigation from a position of doubt is unlikely to encourage victims to come forward.”
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the report's recommendation to scrap the policy could not be allowed to result in “a return to the dark days when we looked the other way and failed to confront the horrors of abuse and bring those responsible to justice”.
Hogan-Howe said he had been unaware of the scale of the blunders until he read the report. He accepted responsibility for the serious failings and said it was a matter of “professional and personal dismay” that the VIPs had been pursued by the police for so long.
However, the commissioner, who retires in February, said he could not know about every investigation across London, even the high-profile ones.
He said he had apologised to Bramall, Lady Brittan and Proctor. “They have all suffered as a result of the investigation and our description of the allegations as ‘credible and true'. We should not have said this.”
But Hogan-Howe said that when Midland started in late 2014, police were accused of being part of an establishment coverup of sexual abuse: “These investigations … started at a time when there was significant concern that numerous sexual attacks on children and others had been ignored, including by the Metropolitan police in decades gone by.
“Even worse were the allegations that abuse had been covered up by the establishment, including the government.”
The Met faces more than 40 claims of bungling child sexual abuse inquiries and is expected to face criticism from the government-backed inquiry into the handling of sexual abuse claims over the past several decades.
Henriques said Brittan should have been informed before his death that the rape claim against him had been dropped, and he backed calls for suspects to have anonymity unless there was a reason to name them.
The Crown Prosecution Service said perverting the course of justice occurred when “a person deliberately makes a false allegation of a crime in the knowledge that there is a risk that the police will conduct an investigation”.
Whether one views Microsoft's Surface line of 2-in-1 tablet devices as energizing or cannibalizing the sales of other PC manufacturers, one thing's for certain: they've made quite a splash in the market. In a time where innovation and inspiration are of utmost criticality, Microsoft's engineers have stepped up to the plate to elaborate on an undeniably novel and in many ways downright amazing concept which has encouraged a paradigm shift in the world of personal computing. Need a tablet? Need a laptop? Why not have both in one device?
For all their merits, it's probably fairly unanimous that the Surface line has yet to approximate the full benefits of a top-grade Ultrabook. But its feature set and strengths lie elsewhere: it doesn't seek to just be a top-grade Ultrabook, but also a more-than-competent tablet. Like many other modern detachables, the Surface faces the daunting task of uniting two traditionally separate computing universes under the same umbrella while minimizing pesky compromises. And it does so while focusing most heavily on adopting tablet-specific benefits, such as a large, bright touchscreen, quiet (or silent) operation, extremely low weight and small form factor, and even an optional digitizer pen—all while still maintaining a solid foundation as a functional PC.
As chipsets become ever-more efficient, the unification of these previously disparate markets is becoming increasingly practical. As the Surface series of machines progressed beyond the first generation (just three years ago!), the focus shifted away from increased processing power and instead toward enhanced portability and lower power consumption. This was first evident in the Surface Pro 3, which saw a significant reduction in the size and weight of the device versus the previous generation. However, for all its engineering brilliance, the machine still fell short in a few key areas: namely, constrained performance (and high heat) under load, a less-than-stellar keyboard, suboptimal lap usage, and absolutely zero possibilities for maintenance and repair.
Although the Surface Pro 4 features a nearly identical form factor and weight (only slightly reduced), it continues the drift toward greater efficiency and portability. But it also widens the array of options available to consumers: still available are the top-end Core i5 and i7 CPUs, now buoyed by an enhanced Skylake chipset refresh. But perhaps even more intriguing is what's developed on the lower-end of the spectrum: a model featuring an Intel Core m3-6Y30 CPU (with a TDP of just 4.5 W) which is passively-cooled. This essentially positions the lowest-end Surface Pro 4 configuration directly against modern passively-cooled tablets, which is yet another encroachment upon their slice of the market.
Speaking of which, our review unit is the lowest-end $899 MSRP model (up from $799 MSRP for the cheapest SP3), featuring the aforementioned Intel Core m3-6Y30 CPU, 4 GB dual-channel LPDDR3 RAM, and 128 GB NVMe SSD. We also will be taking a detailed look at the revised Type Cover and Surface Pen. Could this finally be the tablet that replaces your laptop?
The Delhi High Court today set aside the disciplinary action taken by JNU against 15 of its students, including ex-JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar, in connection with a controversial event on February 9 last year in the varsity.
Justice V K Rao remanded the issue back to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to be decided afresh after allowing the students to inspect the records and hearing them.
The court told JNU's appellate authority to pass a reasoned order within six weeks of hearing the students, who also included Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, that the varsity did not give them due opportunity to defend themselves against the charge of indiscipline.
The students in their pleas had also challenged their punishment, which ranges from rustication for a few semesters to withdrawal of hostel facilities.
The appellate authority of the university had rusticated Umar from JNU till December this year, while Bhattacharya was asked to be out of the varsity for five years.
Kanhaiya, Khalid and Bhattacharya were earlier arrested in a sedition case in connection with the February 9 event on the campus against hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru during which anti-national slogans were allegedly raised.
They were later granted bail in the case in which charge sheet has not yet been filed.

Friday night dinner = time to pull something out of the freezer! Luckily, I have a couple pre-made meals just sitting there for the Friday-night-laziness-factor. This tandoori chicken recipe serves 4-6, which is perfect because my husband and I can eat it for Friday dinner and also a weekend meal. Warning — a little pre-planning is usually involved when pulling something out of the freezer to account for defrosting time.
And here's how I made it (a couple of weeks ago!) Put the following ingredients into a bag:
Chicken (about 6 breasts, sliced lengthwise a couple times)
1 ½ cups yogurt
1/4 tsp Cumin
1/4 tsp Turmeric
1/4 tsp Cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp Paprika
1 tbsp Oil
1 Tbsp garlic
1 Tbsp ginger
½ tsp Salt
Then kneed the bag. Put it into the freezer. Defrost in fridge overnight. Put onto a baking sheet and bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.
To accompany this, I cooked brown rice and asparagus (fried with ginger, garlic, lemon juice, and fish sauce.)

Energy Secretary Rick Perry took sweeping steps on Friday to buttress a pair of financially-strapped nuclear plants under construction and redefine how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for the electricity they provide — a move that, if agreed to by independent federal energy regulators, could tilt some of the nation's complex power markets away from renewables and natural gas.
Perry announced the Energy Department would provide $3.7 billion in loan guarantees to three Georgia utilities struggling to complete a pair of nuclear reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating plant. These loan guarantees come on top of $8.3 billion in loans the department has already given to the project, but they still might fall short of what will be required to complete the costly reactors.
The nuclear project has been running far over-budget and behind schedule, and the utilities have been scrambling to come up with financing after the main engineering company, Westinghouse, declared bankruptcy earlier this year.
The nuclear industry has urged the federal government to help, saying the AP1000 reactors are part of a new generation of nuclear plants. “I believe the future of nuclear energy in the United States is bright and look forward to expanding American leadership in innovative nuclear technologies,” Perry said. He noted the project had created approximately 6,000 construction jobs and, if completed, would create about 800 permanent jobs.
The aid for Vogtle partners would be issued by the Energy Department's loan guarantee program, which President Trump's 2018 budget proposal would abolish.
“They certainly have courage to contradict their convictions,” said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation Policy Education Center and a longtime critic of federal energy loan guarantees.
Many Republicans have criticized the Energy Department's loan guarantees, often citing a loan given to Solyndra, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer that went bankrupt. Defenders of the program say the loan guarantee program's failure rate is well below the level Congress anticipated when it created the program.
“First it's losing solar programs. Now it's losing nuclear programs. When are we going to stop subsidizing losers?” Sokolski said.
The new loan guarantees would provide $1.67 billion to Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Co.; $1.6 billion to Oglethorpe Power Corp.; and $415 million to three subsidiaries of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia.
Critics of the loan guarantees say the construction of the Vogtle reactors is risky and there is a strong possibility the loans will not be repaid. The Georgia Public Service Commission must review the utilities' financial plans and construction progress regularly because the utilities have already been passing along costs to consumers.
“Department of Energy officials should be exercising more caution now, with billions of taxpayer dollars already on the line for the ill-fated nuclear reactor project. Instead, they've doubled down on a bad decision,” said Ryan Alexander, the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, in a statement.
Perry also moved Friday to help nuclear and coal plants competing in regional electricity markets. Citing his department's recent, contested study about the workings of the electric grid, Perry asked the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, to adopt new regulations that would ensure coal and nuclear plants that add to the grid's reliability can “[recover] fully allocated costs and thereby continue to provide the energy security on which our nation relies.”
[Here's the bottom line on the Energy Department's grid study]
Perry's letter to FERC, and the proposed regulation, argue these so-called “baseload” plants provide critical stability and reliability to the electric grid and should be compensated accordingly. They cite not only the department's recent grid study, but also the recent hurricane disasters afflicting the United States and power outages during the 2014 Polar Vortex event.
“What's most significant about this is that we've been working on these issues for the better part of the last 3-plus years, even longer — and what the Secretary has done is said, enough talk, we need to actually act,” said Matt Crozat, the senior director for policy development at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which hailed both of Perry's moves Friday. “And so what this is going to do is drive to some conclusion what a policy action is going to be.”
FERC has 60 days to decide what action to take, and there is no guarantee the independent agency will go along with Perry's request. Trump has recently appointed people to key posts at the agency — and the commission's new chairman, Neil Chatterjee, has already signaled he could be receptive to the move.
“I believe baseload power should be recognized as an essential part of the fuel mix,” Chatterjee said in an August FERC podcast. “I believe that generation, including our existing coal and nuclear fleet, need to be properly compensated to recognize the value they provide to the system.”
“For years, FERC has been relatively fuel-neutral, instead focusing on broader and successful approaches to reliability,” said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford, and former chief of staff and an assistant secretary in the Department of Energy. “The question is whether that era has ended and we'll now see different commissioners representing different fuel camps.”
If FERC agrees with Perry, and if it decides coal and nuclear are more reliable, the result could potentially mean reducing the use of solar, wind and natural gas by key grid operators in favor of coal and nuclear — which would be compensated in a way that would help prevent more plant closures. Half a dozen reactors have shut down since 2007 and half a dozen more are scheduled to close in the next nine years, according to the Energy Information Administration. The number of operating reactors has dropped from 104 to 99.
Some environmental groups and defenders of renewable energy quickly attacked the proposed regulation as a way of imposing government mandates on the working of energy markets and reducing competition.
“I think this is the most significant electricity policy action in 20 years,” said Rob Gramlich, who works for renewable energy clients through his consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC, and previously served as an adviser to FERC commissioner Pat Wood.
Gramlich argued if FERC goes in this direction, then grid operators are “going to pay for resources they don't necessarily need. So they're going to charge homes and businesses more than they otherwise would. And they're going to use relatively more coal and nuclear relative to gas, wind and solar.”
Mark Kresowik, a deputy regional director for the northeast with the Sierra Club, said he thought that if FERC actually adopted the proposed policy, it would lead to lawsuits or even states dropping out of certain regional electricity markets that would be affected, which primarily lie in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.
“Instead of coal and nuclear plants having to compete against cheaper, cleaner sources, customers would be forced to pay for unnecessary plants,” Kresowik said. “Frankly, I think that states that currently compete and use the markets would leave. I certainly would expect states to walk away from organized markets. It would be the end of competitive markets in the United States of America. That's not even an exaggeration.”
However, Richard Powell, who runs the conservative ClearPath Foundation and praised Perry's request, said “if you do allow a lot of these generators to go down, rates are also going to go up, because we're going to take a lot of capacity offline, which is going to mean power supply is scarcer.” ClearPath is backed by wealthy North Carolina businessman Jay Faison.
Other groups, such as those representing the nuclear and coal industries, also hailed the move Friday.
“We commend Secretary Perry for initiating a rulemaking by FERC that will finally value the on-site fuel security provided by the coal fleet,” said Paul Bailey, the president and chief executive of the American Council for Clean Coal Electricity, whose members include the nation's largest coal mining companies, coal-intensive utilities and coal-carrying railroads. “The coal fleet has large stockpiles of coal that help to ensure grid resilience and reliability. We look forward to working with FERC and grid operators to quickly adopt long overdue market reforms that value the coal fleet.”

On Thursday, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) let the cat out of the bag when it comes to Democratic motivation for opposing a tax cut that puts money back in the pockets of well over 80% of the American people: jealousy. Pure jealousy.
Here's his tweet:
GOP underestimates how people feel when they know others got a better deal. If Sally gets a tax cut of $380 but others get $200,000, she will be upset. And wait until Joe finds out he is getting a tax increase for residing in CA. That's why tax bill is so unpopular: human nature. https://t.co/uPr9aWBAsn — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) December 20, 2017
Now, it's true that people at the bottom end of the earnings brackets get less back from the government than high-income earners. That's because they pay far less in taxes. If you slash tax rates, those who pay more in taxes will see a bigger benefit.
But that's the entire problem from Lieu's perspective: if the poor man gets to keep a small amount of money because he's poor, that's unfair. Instead, he's being robbed, since he has some sort of right to the rich man's money.
This is immoral. It violates at least three of the Ten Commandments: the commandment not to steal, the commandment not to covet, and the commandment not to worship idols. On a moral level, just because you want someone else's property doesn't mean the government can provide it for you or that you have a right to vote for politicians who will take it.
But at least we now know what's behind Democrats' insane response to Americans keeping their cash: it might make other people who don't have as much money feel bad.

Remember last week when a good guy with a gun stopped Alton Nolen from continuing his Islamic Jihad beading spree by shooting him? What about Dr. Lee Silverman stopping a shooting rampage in a hospital last July? The Huffington Post is hoping you don't remember as they push their anti-gun agenda by asserting that good guys with guns do not stop bad guys.
Mike Weisser, the self-described HufPo gun guy, wrote this today: New FBI Report Casts Doubt on NRA's ‘Good Guy Stops Bad Guy' Nonsense
It's as illogical as the headline would indicate:
After years of listening to Wayne LaPierre croon away about how “only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” we finally have some real data to test whether this rationale for arming civilians (and selling more guns) is really true.
Before we get to this Earth-shattering data that Weisser claims as proof that armed good guys don't stop bad guys, we need to understand where it's coming from. Last week I reported how the media was erroneously reporting that an FBI study about active shooters showed that mass shootings are on the rise. This confused HufPo writer is using that same report to “prove” the ineffectiveness of armed civilians to repel criminals.
Weisser looked at all of the active shooters that the FBI cataloged and broke it down like this:
Here's how these incidents ended. More than half (56 percent) were terminated by the shooter who either took his or her own life, simply stopped shooting or fled the scene. Another 26 percent ended in the traditional Hollywood-like fashion with the shooter and law enforcement personnel exchanging gunfire and in nearly all of those situations the shooter ended up either wounded or dead. In 13 percent of the shooting situations, the shooter was successfully disarmed and restrained by unarmed civilians, and in 3 percent of the incidents the shooter was confronted by armed civilians, of whom four were on-duty security guards and one person was just your average “good guy” who happened to be carrying a gun.
And comes to this conclusion:
The fact that 21 of these shooting situations were terminated by unarmed civilians as opposed to a single incident that ended because a good guy had a gun might come as a big surprise to the NRA, but for those of us who try to engage in the gun debate by issuing statements based on facts…
Here are some alternate facts: When active shooters are confronted by armed resistance, that's usually when they kill themselves or give up. Adam Lanza took his life when he heard the police sirens in the Sandy Hook parking lot. The 56% of these incidences that ended in suicide or surrender are due in most part to good guys with guns.
The 26% of active shooters killed by police shooting them were ended by good guys with guns. The 3% stopped by armed citizens were terminated by good guys with guns.
So 85% of the active shooter incidents that the FBI studied came to a conclusion because of good guys with guns, yet Weisser says the study, “debunks the ‘good guy stops the bad guy' nonsense.”
It is astounding that Weisser can look at these FBI stats and think that only one active shooter was stopped by a good guy with a gun or that not having a firearm makes people safer against killers.
Even if we can dismiss the results of this study, there is this thing that gun grabbers love called commonsense. What is a better tool for stopping a madman on a killing rampage: a firearm or a sense of self-righteousness?
This is the most pathetic attempt yet to justify civilian disarmament. This author is saying that guns will not help you defend against a deadly situation so you might as well give up your 2nd Amendment rights and turn in your guns.

The elite mostly lead a reactionary existence of talking one way and living another.
One of the strangest things about the modern progression in liberal thought is its increasing comfort with elitism and high style. Over the last 30 years, the enjoyment of refined tastes, both material and psychological, has become a hallmark of liberalism — hand in glove with the art of professional altruism, so necessary to the guilt-free enjoyment of the good life. Take most any contemporary issue, and the theme of elite progressivism predominates.

Higher education? A visitor from Mars would note that the current system of universities and colleges is designed to promote the interests of an elite at the expense of the middle and lower-middle classes. UCLA, Yale, and even CSU Stanislaus run on premises far more reactionary and class-based than does Wal-Mart. The teaching loads and course responsibilities of tenured full professors have declined over the last half-century, while the percentage of units taught by graduate students and part-time faculty, with few benefits and low pay, has soared.
The number of administrators has likewise climbed — even as student indebtedness has skyrocketed, along with the unemployment rate among recent college graduates. A typical scenario embodying these bizarre trends would run something like the following: The UC assistant provost for diversity affairs, or the full professor of Italian literature, focusing on gender and the self, depend on lots of graduate and undergraduate students in the social sciences and humanities piling up debt without any guarantee of jobs, while part-time faculty subsidize the formers' lifestyles by teaching, without grading assistants, the large introductory undergraduate courses, getting paid a third to half what those with tenure receive.

The conference and the academic book, with little if any readership, promote the career interest and income of the trendy administrator and the full professor, and are subsidized by either the taxpayers or the students or both. All of the above assumes that a nine-month teaching schedule, with tenure, grants, sabbaticals, and release time, are above reproach and justify yearly tuition hikes exceeding the rate of inflation. The beneficiaries of the system win exemption from criticism through loud support of the current progressive agenda, as if they were officers with swagger sticks in the culture wars who must have their own perks if they are to properly lead the less-well-informed troops out of the trenches.
Take illegal immigration. On the facts, it is elitist to the core. Big business, flush with cash, nevertheless wants continued access to cheap labor, and so favors amnesties for millions who arrived without English, education, or legality. On the other end of the scale, Jorge Hernandez, making $9 an hour mowing lawns, is not enthusiastic about an open border, which undercuts his meager bargaining power with his employer.

The state, not the employer, picks up the cost of subsidies to ensure that impoverished illegal-immigrant workers from Oaxaca have some semblance of parity with American citizens in health care, education, legal representation, and housing. The employers' own privilege exempts them from worrying whether they would ever need to enroll their kids in the Arvin school system, or whether an illegal-alien driver will hit their daughter's car on a rural road and leave the scene of the accident. In other words, no one in Atherton is in a trailer house cooking meth; the plastic harnesses of missing copper wire from streetlights are not strewn over the sidewalks in Palo Alto; and the Menlo schools do not have a Bulldog-gang problem.
Meanwhile, ethnic elites privately understand that the melting pot ensures eventual parity with the majority and thereby destroys the benefits of hyphenation. So it becomes essential that there remain always hundreds of thousands of poor, uneducated, and less-privileged immigrants entering the U.S. from Latin America. Only that way is the third-generation Latino professor, journalist, or politician seen as a leader of group rather than as an individual. Take away illegal immigration, and the Latino caucus and Chicano graduation ceremony disappear, and the beneficiaries become just ordinary politicians and academics, distinguished or ignored on the basis of their own individual performance.

Mexico? Beneath the thin veneer of Mexican elites suing Americans in U.S. courts is one of the most repressive political systems in the world. Mexican elites make the following cynical assumptions: Indigenous peoples are better off leaving Mexico and then scrimping to send billions of dollars home in remittances; that way, they do not agitate for missing social services back home; and once across the border, they act as an expatriate community to leverage concessions from the United States.

Nannies, gardeners, cooks, and personal attendants are increasingly recent arrivals from Latin America — even as the unemployment rates of Latino, African-American, and working-class white citizens remain high, with compensation relatively low. No wonder that loud protestations about “xenophobes, racists, and nativists” oil the entire machinery of elite privilege. Does the liberal congressman or the Washington public advocate mow his own lawn, clean his toilet, or help feed his 90-year-old mother? At what cost would he cease to pay others to do these things — $20, $25 an hour? And whom would he hire if there were no illegal immigrants? The unemployed African-American teenager in D.C.? The unemployed Appalachian in nearby West Virginia? I think not.

#page#Or take the green industry. At about the same time that statisticians readjusted the first-quarter GDP growth markedly downward — to a 1.8 percent annual rate, from the previously reported 2.4 percent — President Obama announced sweeping new regulations to curtail carbon emissions that will hamper the coal industry, further slow the economy — and delight his elite green base. Al Gore thought the speech historic. And why would he not? Gore has made hundreds of millions of dollars in the Marcus Licinius Crassus style of hyping a disaster and then profiting from its remedy. Gore hates carbon emissions. So much so that he dismisses those who live by them, such as coal-company executives, coal miners, and the rubes who mindlessly use coal-based electricity. But Gore also likes money and what money can do for him — SUVs, private jet travel, multiple residences. That's why he just sold his interest in a failed cable-television network to a broadcasting network backed by a Middle Eastern authoritarian sheikhdom, known for both its anti-Semitism and its huge cash profits from the sale of fossil fuels. Take away the talk of polar bears and melting ice caps, and Gore becomes just another huckster, cashing in on oil profits from the Middle East, a region that is ensured continuance of its riches in part because of environmental restrictions that hamper fracking, horizontal drilling, and coal production on public lands in the United States.
Here in central California there are predictable themes to the new environmentalism: Land that could produce food and provide jobs will be idled to protect a bait fish in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. Rivers that are critical to irrigation and are anchors of the economy will be diverted to their 19th-century course in order to fulfill the dream of salmon runs through a desert-like San Joaquin Valley, and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of gas and oil that could be fracked and provide jobs for communities suffering 10-plus percent unemployment will be ignored. On one side, there are academics, lawyers, high government officials, those with inherited wealth, and those with enough capital to easily afford the higher taxes and higher costs of fuel, power, and food that are the inevitable wages of their own boutique ideology. On the other side, there are the apparent losers and clingers who are out of work, who pay over $4 a gallon for gas for their silly used Dodge Ram trucks, and who stupidly splurge by turning their air conditioners on for an hour or two a day in 108-degree Fresno.

In the real world, the tiny delta smelt is a good psychological totem for a well-paid Google exec in Mountain View, who doesn't mind paying a little more for his arugula or paying higher sales taxes. But the worship of a bait fish is not shared by Manuel Lopez, a tractor driver in Bakersfield who has no more fields to disc this summer. Those in breezy, cool Malibu hate coal, and apparently believe those who mine it would be better off on food stamps and unemployment insurance, which the generous seaside denizens would so selflessly be willing to pay for.
Take gun control. What caused the latest round of furor over the Second Amendment was not gun-related deaths per se. In fact, they have been declining overall in the United States for some time. Nor is it the death toll in Chicago, where last year over 500 mostly African-American and Latino youths gunned each other down, almost exclusively with illegally obtained handguns in a city that has enacted among the tightest gun laws in the nation. Instead, the horrible tragedies of Columbine and Sandy Hook and Aurora suggest that the atypical shooter with a semi-automatic long gun will on rare occasions slaughter anywhere, from an upscale school to a cinema in a good neighborhood. Worse still, the most effective remedies for stopping these typically young, white, unhinged suburbanite shooters — detain the mentally ill far more frequently, curb the promiscuous use of psychotropic drugs, treat violent video games for our youth as we do pornography, jawbone Hollywood to show some restraint in its graphic and titillating portrays of gun carnage — rub up against liberal elite views on mental health, civil liberties, free expression, and the arts.
The result is that the elite find resonance in demonizing the largely white lower-middle-class gun crowd, who are not responsible for the vast majority of yearly gun deaths, but whose culture as the proverbial clingers is ripe for caricature and the fuel of elite outrage. No gun law that Barack Obama has supported would have stopped any of the recent suburban violence — given the millions of weapons that exist throughout the United States. To stop Sandy Hook — where the deranged Adam Lanza stole from his own mother firearms that she had legally purchased — the president would have had to confiscate privately owned semi-automatic rifles and larger clips, or made the possession of existing rifle ammunition illegal. No matter: Obama knew well that the liberal elites were outraged that savage violence had hit the suburbs; he knew too that there was nothing he could do to stop it that was acceptable to those elites, while there were lots of cultural targets that would at least allow the elites to vent. Thus followed the hysterical calls to ban all sorts of evil-looking black “assault weapons” and the demonization of the redneck beer-bellies who for some reason like to shoot them at their inane target ranges.

Modern liberalism, among other things, is a psychological state, in which very-well-off Americans find ways through their income and privilege to be exempt from the ramifications of their own ideologies, while adopting causes and pets that exempt them from guilt over their own status and limitless opportunities. Judging by their concrete actions, they are indifferent to the poor whom they romanticize at a safe distance. In short, voting for larger government and subsidies is seen as a necessary cost of being a reactionary, liberal elite.

Mr Obama would need to cover his head to enter the temple and there are reported concerns opponents would use this to show he is a closet Muslim.
The Golden Temple, or Harmandar Sahib, is Sikhism's holiest site.
Sikhs have been urged to use social network sites to press Mr Obama to go ahead with the visit.
'Support and guidance'
A US official told the BBC there had never been a final decision to go to the temple but conceded that it had been planned as a possible place for Mr Obama to visit.
The official said it was not definite that Mr Obama would not visit, but that it was unlikely.
Correspondents say that it had earlier been strongly hinted that Mr Obama would visit, and it appears the White House has not done its homework on the Golden Temple and the requirements and sensitivities associated with entering it.

Officials at the temple said that although heads needed to be covered, a simple cap for Mr Obama would suffice.
Hansdeep Singh, a senior staff attorney for the United Sikhs lobby group, said: "If these rumours are true, this is a tremendously disappointing moment for the entire Sikh community and religious minorities in general."
One Indian foreign ministry official told Agence France-Presse news agency an advance team of US diplomats had prepared the temple visit.
"We provided them with all the support and guidance they needed but now it is for US officials to decide whether Obama should go to the temple or not," the official said.
Mr Obama is a Christian, but a Pew Research survey of 3,003 Americans in August showed that 18% believed the president was a Muslim.
The poll found beliefs about the president's faith were closely linked to political judgements about him. It found that people who believed Mr Obama was a Muslim "overwhelmingly disapproved" of his job performance.
The United Sikhs group said that if Mr Obama did not visit it would be "a missed opportunity".
It said: "We implore the Sikh community and all others concerned with raising the visibility of religious minorities [to write and express], in a respectful manner, how important it is for President Obama to visit Harmandar Sahib through the White House's Twitter and Facebook sites."
Join Take Two each weekday at 9 AM where we'll translate the day's headlines for Southern California, making sense of the news and cultural events that people are talking about. Find us on 89.3 KPCC, hosted by A Martinez.
Freemasons, the fraternal organization based on medieval fraternities of tradesmen, once operated in secrecy for centuries, so it was bizarre when three self-proclaimed members were arrested and charged for impersonating police officers.
The three people, including a low-level aide to state Attorney General Kamala Harris, had gone around to various police departments introducing themselves as officers of the Masonic Fraternal Police Department. It set off questions by authorities who have launched an investigation.
Several Masonic lodges in Southern California say they were baffled by the news, too.
But some members suspect bogus Masonic lodges are to blame. Christopher Hodapp, a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason and the author of "Freemasons for Dummies," says stars like Beyoncé and Jay-Z led to their rise.
"They use a lot of Masonic symbols in their music videos and on their albums," he says.
Did Beyoncé flash a sign of the Illuminati at her 2013 Super Bowl performance? That's what got the Internet talking when it happened.
Even though their connections are treated as an online joke that spawned sites like Is Beyonce the Illuminati?, Hodapp believes that celebrities are driving up genuine interest in Freemasonry, especially among millennials and African-Americans.
However, he says these groups are unsanctioned and capitalizing on the attention: "They're bogus money-making schemes."
Hodapp adds that official Freemason lodges are more subtle and community-focused.
"You vote on candidates, you investigate candidates, you generally have some Masonic education, and then you adjourn and go and have dinner," he says, describing a typical meeting.
Hodapp says lodge members range in ages from 18 and up and reflect the local community; for example, most lodge members in South L.A. are African-American, according to the LA Weekly.
Also, Masons are only secretive because they had more than enough members for decades, says Hodapp. He estimates there were 5 million Masons worldwide in the 1940s and 1950s.
Many of those members are now dying off. Freemasons have a policy not to recruit – only solicit new members.
But many lodges are trying to attract people by opening themselves up. Hodapp says the Internet has been an important tool because lodges can post their contact information publicly so people can reach out to them.
"We're starting to grow again, very slowly," he says.
Smart-watches are becoming the next big thing, but with increased miniaturization it is becoming impossible to build these sorts of devices yourself. This project aims to provide a "smart-watch" which can be built from readily available components (eg. from element14, digikey, etc.), and able to be soldered by hand. Of course, processing power must be sacrificed, but who needs a camera and 60FPS graphics on a watch???
I have been working on this watch since early 2013, and it has come a long way! It is still very much a work-in-progress though, and I am working on another hardware revision which will fix all the hardware bugs. (you can read more about those from my previous posts on the project)
You can find more info and progress on my hackaday.io project page: http://hackaday.io/project/2263-OSHWatch
Features
The watch features a PIC24F microcontroller and a 128x128 RGB OLED display, along with an accelerometer and magnetometer. The goal is to have both USB-HID (driverless) and Bluetooth 4.0 LE connectivity, so I can sync the calendar quickly and easily.
Working features
Real-Time Clock - It can tell the time!
University Timetable - I can tell when and where my next class is
USB-HID comms and bootloader
Buttons
Basic accelerometer logging
Battery charging & monitoring
Anti-aliased font drawing (Just grayscale at the moment, no "clear-type")
Future features
Accelerometer 'tap-to-wake'
Magnetometer compass
Bluetooth 4.0 LE
Alarm clock with peizo buzzer
Desktop GUI for updating the calendar
Hardware
The hardware is a 2-layer design utilizing SMD components, and is fully open-source in case you'd like to build your own. Schematics and PCB layout were done using Altium, which unfortunately is quite expensive, but they recently announced they would be releasing a free version sometime in the future!
Known Issues (Rev 1)
Microcontroller doesn't fit the PCB! (see: http://jared.geek.nz/2013/may/oled-watch)
VCC isn't regulated
Known Issues (Rev 2)
Watch sometimes resets when waking up (possibly supply decoupling issues)
USB comms task sometimes doesn't go to sleep (drains the battery)
OLED display has some weird ghosting artifacts
In the schematic I got the connector around the wrong way, so the OLED is on the opposite side of the PCB than I wanted.
I didn't assign the OLED data lines to the PIC24's TFT driver, so I can't make use of it and drawing performance is less than what it could be.
Bluetooth 4.0 is untested
There are a few minor "bodges" on the PCB required to make it function correctly
Future (Rev 3)
I am working on a revision 3, which will fix all of the above issues and make the PCB much more compact! Stay tuned... (Subscribe to the RSS feed to keep up-to-date)

With each Fan Friday, we feature creations from some of the clever members of the Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ community. This time around we're shining the spotlight on some of the incredible artwork done by our fans.
Be sure to check out this month's Fan Site Spotlight where we talk to Chimaera, a great French site dedicated to bringing you the latest from The Old Republic.
Also, we compiled a number of images from the “Return” cinematic trailer for you to download and use as your desktop wallpaper.
Community Creations
Writers and artists from all corners of the world have drawn inspiration from Star Wars over the past three decades. Our community has contributed many of their own works and with each Fan Friday we highlight some of the impressive creations from members of our passionate community!
In the aptly named “Twilek” thread, community member JenFX created this stunning render of a young Twi'lek woman lost on the forest moon of Endor.
Longtime member of our French community, norzeele, created this powerful piece of Republic propaganda entitled “Join Us!”
Inspired by our Tatooine Developer Walkthrough, forum member Alliant painted this stunning environmental view of Tatooine's barren desert as well as other paintings inspired by the iconic world for his “Tatooine Sunday!” thread.
Alliant also created a series of awesome iPhone and iPad wallpapers to allow everyone from the noblest Jedi to the most insidious Sith to represent their faction on their mobile devices!
Fan Site Spotlight
This month, we're proud to feature our first French Fan Site Spotlight: Chimaera. Originally created by two passionate fans of Star Wars, this little project evolved and today it is an active community fan site with great coverage of the game. If you have a chance, take some time to look at their site and their upcoming projects, including podcasts, in-game streaming after the game's release and more!
How was the Chimaera Guild formed?
Our community was formed after a meeting of two people. We (Kaes and Vorlox) had known each other in the past, but were both managing two different communities at the time. When The Old Republic™ was announced, we wanted to be with the game when it was released and, as luck would have it, we met around a forum. We talked about it and realized we had the same objectives and aims. We then started Chimaera in June 2009 essentially with a phpbb forum and no more than five members.
How has the Chimaera Guild evolved since it was launched?
The guild has changed a lot since it was first created two years ago now. We began recruiting people fairly slowly. Over the months, and as BioWare released more information, our core membership started to grow until we reached the number we have today, which is mainly made up of people who have been with us from the start or for at least a year.
We then also decided to develop our portal as well as our content. So we redesigned our website and used it to develop the editorial and community aspect. We went from "basic" guild status to a community. This means we can share lots of stuff with some members of the French community who visit our site or follow us on Twitter.
Then we also had our "wall of crazy" with a bunch of projects like a podcast, in-game streaming via our Dailymotion network, written or video guides and a whole load of other things. Now all we need is the game and some people to develop these projects!
What is the structure of the guild and what are the objectives regarding Star Wars™: The Old Republic™?
Currently we want our structure to stay fairly simple and with very few members at the moment. The guild is managed by two people (Kaes/Vorlox) and we have recently brought in a member as a manager responsible for recruitment to make it easier to hire people, as we're spending a lot of time looking at the applications, and we have quite a few of them!
In the long-term we should evolve to have more officers and to set up master classes, but we want to wait until we can put the right people in the right places.
What is the aspect of The Old Republic community that you like best?
What we like most about The Old Republic community is seeing the level of commitment. So many members give their time and get involved, whether it's translating a message from Georg Zoeller or Stephen Reid for example, or an article in an American, German or French magazine, or the various people who run fan sites.
Lots of people follow game news very closely, and want all the latest info. We were made particularly aware of this when we organized a live chat during E3 last June. We had a day when there were over 100 French people chatting and looking at the available lives late into the night. OK, it gets a tad chaotic when there's such a big crowd of you, but it was great to follow the show in such a terrific atmosphere.
What is the most important thing you need to know about managing a fan site?
We haven't been doing it for that long, but with the little experience we have, one thing we can say is: running a fan site takes time. A massive amount. It's quite usual for one of us to stay up until one or two o'clock in the morning to finish an article or translation, especially during the games shows like E3 or GamesCom. You really have to be passionate about what you're doing.
We have seen lots of people create a fan site, only to see them abandon it a few weeks later for various reasons, which is a real pity. That's partly why it's good for a group of you to start this kind of project.
So if you have things you want to share and the time to do it, go for it!
You have recently been able to interact more with the BioWare community team. How do you see the future exchanges between the French fan sites and BioWare?
We are really pleased that Antonio Moreno is now our French Community Lead. The French community has been looking for someone to talk to direct for a while now. And it's cool that Antonio is on Twitter, like Stephen Reid, and makes himself very available. When we post a message on Twitter to one of these people, we know we'll get an answer, which is something you can't say that often.
Where future exchanges between French fans and BioWare are concerned, we're not about to dis another "Fan Site Summit" or, in any case, more accessible events. Something which is also very dear to the hearts of fans on French sites is somewhere a visible where we can share our articles. For many people the "community creations" section is a place where they can share pictures and stories; lots of people are unaware that fan sites also share their articles and maybe they miss out on something that could interest them.
What are you really looking forward to most in The Old Republic?
Above all we are expecting high-quality content. We already know that the rise in levels is great, but we're looking at the long-term, so it's the high standard of content that will keep us playing the game for at least a few weeks or months. So we can't wait to experience the first Operation, the Eternity Vault, as well as the high level Flashpoints and PvP with or without instances.
But for the moment we just want to play, that's all!
8. Do you want to say something to the Star Wars: The Old Republic community?
While we're here, we'd like to say hello to everyone in The Old Republic community, to all the fan sites that generally do a terrific job, and to our readers and members who we can't thank enough. We've been around for two years now, and hope to keep going for a long time to come!
For those who don't know us already, feel free to come and have a look at our work or drop by our site and say hello. You can also find @GuildeChimaera on the micro blogging site "à tête de piaf".
And finally, thanks in advance to BioWare for this upcoming MMORPG and for agreeing to let us talk to you here.
Wallpapers
We have a number of new wallpapers based on the “Return” Intro Cinematic that first debuted at E3!
The first of these wallpapers depicts the young Sith apprentice known simply as Malgus, minutes before he would usurp his master and obtain the title of Sith Lord.
Jedi Master Kao Cen Darach fights off the Sith Lord Vindican and his apprentice, Malgus, buying valuable time to allow his allies to escape.
Smashing through a piece of debris, Malgus leaps into the final duel.

It's off Baffin Island but technology has reported no strange sound.
Mysterious sound detected in Canada's Arctic
Find Your Forecast Search for a location
Daniel Martins
Digital Reporter
Thursday, November 3, 2016, 5:27 PM - People in Canada's Arctic are straining for an explanation for a mysterious sound detected off Baffin Island.
CBC News reports says local hunters, from the nearby community of Igloolik, describe the sound as a "ping" or "hum," apparently coming from the sea floor in the Fury and Hecla Strait, a narrow waterway that separates northern Baffin Island from mainland Nunavut.
Several people claim to have heard it this past summer, including passengers aboard a yacht in the area and several callers into a community radio show running a segment on the subject, according to CBC News (which says its staff have not heard the sound or spoken to anyone who claims to).
The noise is seen as a serious problem for area hunters, who say it's scaring away fish and wildlife, according to Nunavut lawmakers.
RELATED: Four weird and unexplained sounds from around the world
"That passage is a migratory route for bowhead whales, and also bearded seals and ringed seals. There would be so many in that particular area. This summer there was none," George Qulaut, an MLA who is a former hunter, told CBC News.
At Nunavut's request, the Canadian Forces dispatched a CP-140 Aurora aircraft to survey the site, but though the crew did sight six walruses and two pods of whales, they found no trace of the sound.
"According to Department of National Defence spokesman Dan Le Bouthillier, the Aurora's crew "[The crew] performed various multi-sensor searches in the area, including an acoustic search for 1.5 hours, without detecting any acoustic anomalies," Dan Le Bouthillier, a spokesman with the Department of National Defense, told the National Post. "The crew did not detect any surface or subsurface contacts."
CBC says there have been a few theories floated around as the the source of the noise, including sonar surveys by a nearby mining company (the company in question, Baffinland, says it hasn't conducted any this summer). Another theory: A deliberate attempt by Greenpeace or other environmental groups to drive away wildlife to save them from the hunters, which Greenpeace has denied.
"Not only would we not do anything to harm marine life, but we very much respect the right of Inuit to hunt and would definitely not want to impact that in any way," spokeswoman Farrah Khan told the CBC.
Canada is no stranger to unexplained sounds, with the most famous being the Windsor Hum, though evidence suggests it may be just one manifestation of a more general "world hum."

Flashback: Harry Redknapp predicted 18-year-old Frank Lampard will go right to the very top
Amid all the speculation that Frank Lampard's days are now numbered at Chelsea, a new video has hit YouTube reminding people how Lampard has received negative comments throughout his career only to come through the other side with flying colours.
The video in question dates back to 1996, when a fresh-faced Frank was an 18-year-old just breaking into Harry Redknapp's first team at West Ham.
Filmed at a West Ham event in which Redknapp and his nephew Lampard were sitting on a panel, the footage captures an incredible moment in which an Irons' fan calls out the then teenager.
The question from the audience was harsh, as an unnamed fan wondered whether the publicity Lampard was then getting was warranted “because personally I don't think he's quite good enough yet.”
Redknapp's reply was superb.
He's good enough and he definitely will be good enough… I get paid to make judgement on players… I'd tell you now, without any shadow of a doubt they'll be no comparison between what Frank Lampard will achieve in football and what Scotty Cannon achieves in football…. There is no favouritism… I'm telling you now he'll go right to the very top!

Who is Anwar al-Awlaki?
“Terrorist No. 1 in terms of threat against us,” in the words of Rep. Jane Harman, an intelligence expert. The sermons of the charismatic, Internet-savvy imam have been found in the possession of nearly every Islamist radical who has attacked Western targets in recent years, including the London subway bombers and Zachary Chesser, an American who recently confessed to helping Somali terrorists. Al-Awlaki may even have been involved in the 9/11 attacks (see below). The Obama administration has targeted him for assassination, to the dismay of civil-liberties advocates, who note that he is an American citizen who has never been charged with terrorism crimes. Al-Awlaki's father and the American Civil Liberties Union have sued the government, arguing it can't impose a death sentence on a U.S. citizen without trying him first.
Where is he now?
He's believed to be in southern Yemen, under the protection of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the network's Yemeni branch. There, intelligence officials say, al-Awlaki not only preaches that Muslims have a duty to wage war against the West, he actively plots terrorist attacks. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to bring down an airliner with a bomb hidden in his underpants last Christmas Day, told interrogators that al-Awlaki was one of the al Qaida operatives who trained him. Faisal Shahzad, the would-be Times Square bomber, said that al-Awlaki's recorded sermons had inspired him. And al-Awlaki exchanged e-mails with Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 military personnel at Fort Hood, and publicly praised the massacre.
How did al-Awlaki become a U.S. citizen?
He was born here. His father, Nasser al-Awlaki, moved his family to the U.S. in 1971 to study at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, where Anwar was born. The family returned to Yemen in 1978, when Anwar was 7. While in Yemen, he was exposed to Wahhabism, the puritanical strain of Islam practiced by Osama bin Laden, and dreamed of fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. But instead of waging holy war, he returned to the U.S. in 1990 to attend Colorado State University in Fort Collins. In 1994, he took a part-time job as an imam at the Denver Islamic Society.
Is that when he became a radical?
When that change occurred is unclear. In Denver he preached a brand of Islam friendly to the West, and he later did the same in San Diego, where he moved in 1996. (While in San Diego, he was also placed on probation after two arrests for soliciting prostitutes.) In 2000, al-Awlaki moved to suburban Washington, D.C., where he continued to preach a benign form of Islam at a large mosque in northern Virginia. After the 9/11 attacks, he publicly condemned the hijackers, and even lunched at the Pentagon as part of the Defense Department's outreach to moderate Muslims.
Was his moderation a ruse?
Perhaps. Even before he arrived in Virginia, al-Awlaki had begun associating with radical Muslims, drawing the scrutiny of law-enforcement officials. In 1999, the FBI first investigated him for possible connections to radical Islam, including links to a Palestinian associate of bin Laden and to Omar Abdel Rahman, the “blind sheikh” who organized the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Then in 2002, al-Awlaki left the U.S., moving first to London and later, in 2004, to Yemen.
Is that when the U.S. targeted him?
No. The Obama administration authorized the military and the Central Intelligence Agency to kill him only after the Fort Hood massacre and the attempted Christmas Day bombing. In a recording posted on a website last March, al-Awlaki said, “Jihad against America is binding upon myself, just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.” Now, says a U.S. intelligence official, “he's in everybody's sights.”
Is it legal to assassinate a U.S. citizen?
That is a matter of dispute. The Obama administration says it's legal in this case, because al-Awlaki's role in terrorist attacks makes him a “belligerent”—in effect, an enemy soldier. Consequently, the U.S. can target him in its own self-defense. Intelligence officials say that al-Awlaki was added to the government's “kill list” only after a special review determined that he poses an imminent threat to American lives. The administration, though, refuses to release its evidence, calling it a state secret.
Does that violate his rights?
Civil libertarians think so. “The United States cannot simply execute people, including its own citizens, anywhere in the world based on its own say-so,” says Vincent Warren of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is a party to the suit against the government. But U.S. officials insist they have targeted al-Awlaki as a last resort, taking into account that Yemen's weak central government is unwilling or unable to arrest him and turn him over to the U.S. Under those circumstances, they say, assassination is both legal and necessary. He is “first and foremost a terrorist,” says CIA Director Leon Panetta, “and we're going to treat him like a terrorist.”
9/11's ‘loose end'
While it's not certain that Anwar al-Awlaki participated in the planning of the 9/11 attacks, investigators have tied him directly to three of the hijackers. Two of them, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaq Alhazmi, attended al-Awlaki's San Diego mosque and held long, closed-door meetings with him in 2000. Alhazmi and another hijacker, Hani Hanjour, later turned up at the mosque in Falls Church, Va., where al-Awlaki preached. FBI investigators say al-Awlaki's function may have been to keep the hijackers “spiritually on track.” After 9/11, investigators searching the Hamburg, Germany, apartment of Ramzi Binalshibh, one of the attack's planners, found the phone number of the Falls Church mosque. The links don't add up to an open-and-shut case against him, says Philip Zelikow, executive director of the government commission that investigated the attacks, but they certainly make al-Awlaki “a 9/11 loose end.”
Whatever their disagreements, Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will do a lot of damage together very fast.
There is a sort of unstated belief in critical assessments of both presidential candidates that their more ambitious plans will be stymied by the same kind of congressional gridlock that has so regularly frustrated Barack Obama. With respect to Donald Trump, the big fear has been that he will simply ignore constitutional restraints on the presidency and govern like the kind of despot he so obviously admires.
If Trump is elected, Republicans are likely to maintain control of the Senate and will definitely control the House. You do not have to resort to banana-republic analogies to find a scenario in which large and damaging things happen very quickly, and through the old-school process of legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. So long as Republicans have 50 senators, an awful lot of the very large common ground shared by Trump and the GOP can be enacted via the filibuster-proof budget-reconciliation process, and even more can be enacted if (as is likely) Republicans more or less abolish the filibuster itself to reduce Democrats to an impotent backbench, like they are in the House.
A lot of very smart people don't quite seem to grasp this. The current issue of The New Yorker features a long and otherwise well-researched piece by Evan Osnos covering the early phases of a hypothetical Trump presidency from all sorts of angles. Here's what Osnos says about legislation:
Some of Trump's promises would be impossible to fulfill without the consent of Congress or the courts; namely, repealing Obamacare, cutting taxes, and opening up “our libel laws” that protect reporters, so that “we can sue them and win lots of money.” (In reality, there are no federal libel laws.) Even if Republicans retain control of Congress, they are unlikely to have the sixty votes in the Senate required to overcome a Democratic filibuster.
Actually, cutting taxes and at least disabling Obamacare — along with other funding-related matters like block-granting Medicaid and SNAP, eliminating other forms of “welfare,” boosting defense spending, shifting subsidies to favored fossil-fuel energy sources, and killing federal support for Planned Parenthood or other “anti-family” entities — can easily be accomplished by packaging it all in a budget-reconciliation bill, which can be enacted by the Senate under filibuster-free procedures. (The modern use of budget reconciliation began in 1981 when Ronald Reagan achieved much of his domestic-policy agenda in two bills.) Party discipline on such a measure would be viciously enforced. And while it is true a funding nexus is necessary before an item can be included in a reconciliation bill, it is not that hard to find indirect ways to “defund” enforcement of laws and regulations Congress does not like, and in close cases the Senate parliamentarian — who works for the majority party — can make friendly rulings.
In fact, the odds are very good that a Republican Senate dealing with a Republican House and a Republican president will kill the filibuster entirely in the pursuit of a legislative blitz designed (along with the executive actions Osnos writes about) to eliminate the Obama administration's legacy almost entirely. As my colleague Jonathan Chait has explained, the filibuster (already abolished by the last Democratic-controlled Senate for executive-branch and sub–Supreme Court judicial appointments) has survived the last few years only to the extent it was made moot by other roadblocks like divided control of Congress and a presidential veto. With both Houses of Congress and the White House pulling in the same direction, the filibuster will inevitably be eliminated to grease the skids, beginning with an instant measure to confirm a right-wing Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia — the very foundation of the Trump alliance with movement conservatives — and then the filibuster reform will be extended to regular legislation. If traditionalists complain, Republicans will shrug and point at Harry Reid as the fiend who violated the sacred mores and folkways of the Senate with his limited version of filibuster reform, making its consummation a matter of course.
It is true that if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency and Democrats win both Houses of Congress, they, too, will “ram through” legislation via budget reconciliation and radical filibuster reform. With the presidential race tightening, however, the odds of a Democratic trifecta have dropped significantly. It is far more likely that Clinton is the one who could face the kind of legislative gridlock we know so well from the post-2010 Obama presidency. Sure, congressional Republicans could “rein in” Trump to some extent on the topics where they don't see eye to eye: I doubt Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are going to go for any big infrastructure spending initiative or a major attack on corporate subsidies. And they might try to interfere with his desire to revoke most of America's trade deals and other diplomatic arrangements.
But make no mistake, “plague on both your houses” pundits and voters: The Trump-Ryan-McConnell common ground is broad and radically reactionary, and it is a lot closer to realization than Hillary Clinton's agenda. Within just a few months we could see the final confirmation of a prophecy made by Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell back before he was sent to the hoosegow for his role in Watergate: “This country is going so far to the right you won't recognize it.”
This is a storm deck. For those of you who don't know what that means, Storm is a card mechanic, where it lets you copy the spell with storm as many times as the amount of spells you have cast this turn. The idea is to play stuff like Goblin Electromancer to play instants/sorcery cards cheaper. Then use cards like Desperate Ritual to get mana, while drawing cards with draw cards. Finally, hit them with Grapeshot for a ton to win, or you can use Empty the Warrens in your sideboard to swing for a ton. Cards like Past in Flames lets you flash back cards to add to the storm count or even to hit them again with grapeshot/empty the warrens. This is a more budget deck at the moment, and I will remake it less budget when I acquire the cards to do so.
Matthew Hancock criticised for chartering a plane from Aberdeen to London after talks with Mexico president on environment protection
Climate campaigners have rounded on the energy minister, Matthew Hancock, for hiring a private jet to fly himself back to London after signing a deal with the Mexican president in Aberdeen to help combat climate change.
The Guardian has established that Hancock, the Tory MP for West Suffolk, chartered an aircraft after meeting Enrique Peña Nieto in Aberdeen on 5 March during the president's official visit to the UK.
The memorandum of understanding they signed focused heavily on the UK's commitment with Mexico to press for an “ambitious, equitable, comprehensive and legally binding global agreement” at the climate talks in Paris in December.
Whitehall sources said that Hancock persuaded two Foreign Office diplomats to share the 100-minute flight back to London to help cover the costs, even though there were 16 scheduled services from Aberdeen to four London airports that day.
Ollie Hayes, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “A minister in any government department should know better than to use taxpayers' money to charter a private jet when a scheduled flight is available.
“But in this case, the minister is from the climate change department and has used a private jet to fly back from doing an oil deal. You couldn't make it up.”
Alison Johnstone, a Scottish Green party MSP, said it was perverse for an energy minister to hire their own jet after signing such a deal.
“It shows flagrant disregard for the public purse,” she said. “It's also deeply ironic that a minister from the department with responsibilities for climate change uses one of the most polluting forms of transport to attend a meeting aimed at encouraging the extraction of fossil fuels.”
Hancock was in Aberdeen with the Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael, on the final day of President Peña Nieto's official visit to the UK, to sign a memorandum of understanding between the UK and Mexico which placed heavy stress on tackling climate change and promoting safe energy cooperation.
The agreement updated a 2011 deal between the two countries “to work together on sustainable and low carbon development. It reaffirms the progressive stance of both countries and our shared aim to reach an ambitious, equitable, comprehensive and legally binding global agreement at the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris in December”.
The memo also spoke of ensuring “environmental protection in both countries” in an ambitious deal to increase cooperation and collaboration on oil extraction. That included a $1bn (£674m) line of credit for British oil firms operating in or exporting to Mexico.
Hancock, who holds a dual ministerial role at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and is fighting to retain his seat at the election, was one of 100 Tory MPs who signed an open letter opposing continuing subsides for onshore wind farms in England.
A vocal critic of windfarms in his constituency and a supporter of fracking, Hancock also welcomed a Tory election pledge last year to end state support for the sector.
UK's new energy and environment ministers opposed green energy Read more
The Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Foreign Office confirmed that only three people from the UK delegation took the private flight. Carmichael is thought to have had other appointments in the area and stayed in Aberdeen.
They insisted it was in line with UK government policy and the ministerial code, but refused to disclose how much the flight cost, what type of aircraft was hired and why the flight was authorised.
A DECC spokesman said Hancock was too busy to take any of the scheduled flights. Aberdeen airport confirmed the commercial services that day went to Heathrow, Gatwick, London City airport and London Luton.
“The minister was in Aberdeen helping to secure an agreement worth millions of pounds to the economy. He got a chartered flight together with senior diplomatic officials for the return journey, to fit around diary commitments,” the DECC spokesman said.
There is currently a great deal of alarmist concern, triggered by a recent RAND report, about Russia's supposed ability to conquer the Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, three former Soviet republics that are now part of NATO — and thus drive a wedge into NATO without the West being able to do anything to stop it.
But before we start to panic, it's important to consider not just whether Moscow might ever actually want to do this, but also all the many ways in which the West could retaliate other than with military force. There are, after all, more ways to win wars than just with tanks and fighters.
The reality is that not only does Russia likely have zero ambitions to capture the Baltic states in the first place, but even if it did, the US and NATO could do a whole lot to punish it for doing so.
That's because for all the talk of Russia's brilliant use of "asymmetric" or "hybrid" warfare — that is, fighting not so much on the regular battlefield but by using all kinds of sneaky and unconventional approaches, from information and cyber warfare to political manipulation — the truth is that if anyone has an "asymmetric" or "hybrid" edge, it is actually the West.
The RAND report: Russia takes the Baltic states while NATO is caught napping
The present debate was sparked by a RAND report, released earlier this year, that was based on a series of war games whose goal was to evaluate "the shape and probable outcome of a near-term Russian invasion of the Baltic states." The report concluded that "as presently postured, NATO cannot successfully defend the territory of its most exposed members," essentially the Baltic states, which, it claimed, Russia could conquer in at most 60 hours.
There are serious questions over the RAND study's numbers and assumptions, not least that the Russians would get pretty much everything right and NATO would be caught by surprise. Just because the Russians could take Crimea (against no opposition) and bomb rebels in Syria (who have no serious air defenses), that doesn't make them 10 feet tall — and any invasion would be impossible to hide from the West, even under the guise of a "military exercise." That might have worked two and a half years ago, but since Crimea we are on the lookout for such scams.
The study also fails to consider the most crucial question: intent. In other words, would Russia even want to take the Baltic states in the first place?
The Baltic states would just be a major headache for Putin
The answer, in short, is probably no. Vladimir Putin is, of course, currently engaged in an aggressive campaign to raise Russia's international standing and undermine the West's will to punish him for his actions in Crimea and Ukraine. However, he is neither a lunatic nor some kind of imperialist desperate to rebuild the old Soviet Union.
Conquering the Baltic states may be possible, but it would win him the overt enmity of the West, the worry of his other neighbors, and three territories full of disgruntled locals with a history of guerrilla warfare against Muscovite conquerors.
And for what? There are no resources of the sort Russia could readily use (their real assets are their people, who would hardly be enthusiastic about their new overlords). Rather than dividing NATO, it would probably unite and galvanize it and make Moscow look dangerously erratic. Even China would be alarmed to find its neighbor and quasi-ally suddenly flirting with global war.
The West has many ways to make Russia pay if it did take the Baltic states
Even if Russia did take the Baltic states, though, the West would have plenty of ways to punish Russia short of launching a full military counterattack.
The first is with financial means. If Russia relies on tanks for its attack, the West could turn to banks for its response.
An invasion of the Baltic states would be grounds for invoking NATO's Article V, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all members, thus making all NATO members at war with Russia. Member states could not only seize any Russian state assets within their jurisdictions but could — and should — extend this to Russian companies and the personal property of those Russians deemed to be significant players within the state.
Oligarchs and officials alike have gleefully taken advantage of Western financial openness and rule of law to stash their usually ill-gotten gains away from the Kremlin's hands. That could be turned into a vulnerability, a chance to encourage dissent and division within an elite more interested in its own kleptocratic opportunism than in Putin's historical vision.
Not only could the West close its markets to Russia — and likewise ban all exports there — but it could also use its political and economic muscle to try to isolate Russia from its other trading partners. Russia imports almost 40 percent of its food, and while countries such as Iran are unlikely to be willing to curtail exports to Russia, others without land borders with the country could be prevented from supplying the country's needs.
The West could also in effect force Russia out of SWIFT, the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. This would severely limit Russian banks' capacity to move money and engage in economic activity, and although it's not the "nuclear option" some make it out to be — in part because there are some ways around it — it would still be a severe blow to the Russian economy.
Another way the West can hurt Russia is through cyberattacks. While Russian cyberattacks have been most evident, this is more because Moscow has been more willing to encourage its hackers to cause mischief in the West than because it has that much greater capacity. The West could strike back in kind once it was willing to take off the virtual gloves.
Putin may be willing to see ordinary Russians make sacrifices in the name of geopolitics, but with the ruble already having devalued by some 50 percent, and more than half of household budgets in Russia currently being spent on food, how long would they be willing and able to put up with that?
The old stereotypes of the fatalistic Russian peasant willing to endure any hardship for the motherland are long since out of date. Putin's popularity at home depends on giving the appearance of easy wins, whether in Crimea or Syria.
What happens to that narrative when, for example, cyberattacks crash the cellphone networks on which Russians have come to rely? How does the country function when the software behind the railways and airports becomes compromised? How do Russians buy, sell, and work when banking systems are hit and ATMs closed down?
There are also "non-kinetic" military options that play to Western strengths and would have a disproportionate impact on Russia. NATO is worried about the threat of "A2/AD" — anti-access/area denial — as Russian missiles and submarines prevent NATO planes from flying in Central Europe and NATO ships from operating in the Baltic Sea.
But, conversely, NATO can close the Dardanelles to any Russian military or civilian shipping, locking it out of the Mediterranean, just as it can also deny Russia the Baltic, and maybe also the Barents and Okhotsk seas to the north and east. Beyond that, the West controls the global sea lanes and could impound Moscow's ships and cargoes, or prevent third-country trade with Russia.
Of course, there are limits to such indirect ways of waging war. China can hardly be leaned on — although it is unlikely to be comfortable with a Kremlin that is willing to start such a pyrrhic and dangerous war — and none of this will be easy or cheap.
But this is war, and if the West wants to save the lives of its soldiers, it has to spend money instead.
To really deter Russia, the West needs to stop playing nice
The West can do it, though — and Moscow knows this. While we have been worrying about Moscow's ability to wage so-called "hybrid warfare," the truth is that this kind of warfare is actually a Western strength. Moscow is just hoping we don't notice.
Russia has in the past often managed to punch above its weight because it has been able to assume that West will be moderate and well-mannered. It has kidnapped an Estonian security officer across the border, shielded the people who shot down a civilian airliner, buzzed US warships, and invaded a neighbor.
The day the West decides to be as ruthless as Russia will be a very black one for the Kremlin. However, it is vital not only that the West grow to realize this — because if we feel powerless, we become vulnerable to Putin's mind games and power plays — but also that we practice and posture such that the Kremlin appreciates that this is a real threat.
Just as Moscow puts on an exercise simulating an attack on a Western country or talks about nuclear attacks when it wants to push our buttons, we can do the same. Wargaming closing the Mediterranean or openly discussing how economic warfare could cripple an unnamed but obvious enemy will spark furious denunciations from Moscow. But the very scale of the response will indicate just how seriously the Kremlin takes such a risk.
The fact is that Russian security discussions are dominated by an awareness of the country's vulnerabilities to a stronger, richer, larger, more advanced West. Up to now, though, we have not let ourselves acknowledge our strengths.
The greatest risk for the West is, after all, not its weakness of means but a perception of its weakness of will, both at home and in Moscow. After all, deterrence only works when it is displayed, when the other side knows the misery and ruin it risks.

Male privilege is the phrase “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned” and everything it implies, such as no woman has any reason to be mad at a man unless they were rejected because that's the only bad thing men do because they are so perfect and their only fault is that they just can't love all the women who want them, and these rejected women are soo unreasonable and instead of being sad for a moment and moving on like a man would, they act crazier and angrier than hell. But don't worry, even though they are so acting like murderous lunatics, they still aren't dangerous because they're just itty bitty women (and if they aren't itty bitty then they deserved to be rejected). But don't worry, these woman aren't only mad at men, they are mad at the fact that they have the illest of the sexes.
Ok that was a bit rant-ish, but I'm not done.
Male privilege is the fact that “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned” is used so often, and that a lot of the time it is used the person doesn't even finish the sentence, they just say “hell hath no fury…” because obviously they are talking about a woman so it's just a waste of breath.
Male privilege is the fact that there is no male equivalent except for men in the FriendZone, but everyone sympathizes with them because they were just being “friendly” even though they are literally men who are angry and the ONLY reason they are angry is because they were rejected.
THE former chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic, Paul Kiely, is "extremely ill" and is not in a position to give evidence before the Dail Public Accounts Committee.
THE former chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic, Paul Kiely, is "extremely ill" and is not in a position to give evidence before the Dail Public Accounts Committee.
PAC clerk Ted McEnery told the committee that he has been in touch with Mr Kiely's legal representative who has confirmed that the former head of the charity will not be in a position to attend a PAC meeting next Thursday to answer questions over his €742,025 retirement package from the Clontarf clinic.
Referring to Mr Kiely's ill-health, Mr McEnery said: "I think we should accept that and I wish him well."
A report into the clinic by administrator John Cregan published last week said that the CRC set up its charitable arm for the sole purpose of ensuring that it maximised the funding it received from the HSE but the fund was used to pay salary top-ups for senior executives.
Senator Shane Ross said there were a lot of questions for the old board still to answer and that the report into the CRC mentioned missing files "which we ought to ask them about".
Mr McEnery has been in touch with the former board members through a consultant retained on their behalf. However, he admitted to the committee they have not confirmed whether they will be attending.
Mr McEnery has also been in touch with former chairman Jim Nugent as well as former executives David Martin and Brian Conlan asking them to attend.
Mr Ross expressed concern that there might be some doubt about the former CRC board coming in asking: "What's the problem then?"
PAC Chairman John McGuinness, said the only doubt was that the former board members had not replied and said Mr McEnery would check again to determine what witnesses will be before the committee next week.
He said a suggestion had been made that Mr Cregan would represent himself and deal with the report on his own but said he didn't believe that should be the case.
"I believe he should be here with the new chairman and with the other CRC members and HSE and we can deal with this fully and openly and complete our business," he said.
PAC has also written to former chairman Hamilton Goulding asking him to attend and seeking documentation.
Officials from the HSE will also be in attendance.
Meanwhile, the Rehab Group has commenced a process to recruit new board members "as part of a programme of transformation and change".
Applications
The body, which has been rocked by money scandals, is seeking applications from volunteers who would like to serve as company directors.
It has been engulfed in controversy for months, much of which centred around former chief executives Angela Kerins and Frank Flannery.
Group chairman Sean Egan said yesterday: "The Rehab Group is seeking to renew its board membership to ensure that it has in place an effective and robust governance structure that can serve the organisation well into the future. I am confident that there will be many people who are interested in contributing to the important work of Rehab through serving as board members."

A brief recap of the Voyager series? I'll try, but no promises!
Keep in mind, though, that the books are a lot more interesting than the story may come across here – what's missing from this the vast amount of character development that has occurred throughout the books so far.
The Spirit Walk duology, written by Christie Golden in 2004, left many of the Voyager characters scattered:
Admiral Janeway was at Starfleet Headquarters;
Chakotay, Tom Paris and Harry Kim were on Voyager;
Seven and the Doctor were working at an Earth-based think tank;
Tuvok was teaching at Starfleet Academy;
B'Elanna had gone to Boreth to solve a mystery surrounding her mother's death – and in the process, discovered that there were Klingons in the Alpha Quadrant who thought her infant daughter Miral was the Kuvah'magh – the Klingon messiah.
Then – outside of the Voyager novels – a number of our characters had significant developments:
In Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangel's first Titan novel, Taking Wing, Tuvok left the Academy and accepted an undercover mission with Starfleet Intelligence. He was captured working undercover on Romulus, rescued by the Titan, and joined the crew.
Admiral Janeway was killed in Peter David's Before Dishonor, while investigating what was supposed to be a dead Borg cube that turned out to be only mostly dead.
Voyager was called to the front lines during David Mack's Destiny trilogy, and was all but destroyed at the Azure Nebula.
When Beyer came on board to take over the Voyager novel series, she had to connect the events of several other series' stories into the narrative.
Full Circle – my first post-series Voyager novel – begins just after Spirit Walk, and continues for almost three years – taking the crew through and beyond the events of Destiny. Under the command of Captain Chakotay, Voyager is dispatched to the planet Kerovi to interrogate a Changeling they battled in Spirit Walk – and Admiral Janeway joins them.
But before they get underway, they learn that B'Elanna and Miral are missing from Boreth. Seven, the Doctor and Tuvok all lend their expertise as the crew is reunited in a search for Miral that ends on a remote planet where a Klingon cult has kidnapped their savior – Miral – to protect her from others dedicated for centuries to killing the Kuvah'magh.
A new counselor, Lieutenant Hugh Cambridge, joins the crew, and initially, he and Chakotay really don't get along.
Miral is rescued, but the Warriors of Gre'thor flee, still determined to kill her. Admiral Ken Montgomery, who has been overseeing Project Full Circle – a thorough analysis of the ship's seven years in the Delta Quadrant – is frustrated by the fact that Chakotay sacrificed his mission to Kerovi to save Miral.
Captain Afsarah Eden and her ex-husband Admiral Willem Batiste are also introduced. Their work on project Full Circle has left Batiste convinced that Starfleet should continue investigating the Delta Quadrant. Eden isn't so sure until she realizes what a huge potential threat the Borg represents to the Alpha Quadrant.
Admiral Janeway is adamantly opposed to the mission. Tom and B'Elanna concoct a plan to save Miral from the Warriors of Gre'thor by faking their deaths. Admiral Janeway and Chakotay finally give into their mutual affection for one another now that duty no longer makes that relationship impossible. Seven joins the staff at Starfleet Academy where Icheb is one of her students.
The Doctor leaves the think tank and joins his creator, Lewis Zimmerman and Reg Barclay at Jupiter station designing advanced holographic technology. Then – catching up to the story in Before Dishonor and Destiny – the Borg show up in the Alpha Quadrant.
Admiral Janeway is one of the first casualties, but by the end of the assault, the body count numbers sixty-three billion. Chakotay is particularly hard-hit by Janeway's death. His grief combined with the carnage at the Azure Nebula leaves him devastated. Seven grieves as well, but has a more pressing problem. Ever since the Caeliar transformation of the Borg in the finale of the Destiny trilogy, she has struggled with a voice in her head that tells her she is “Annika.”
In Keith R.A. DeCandido's A Singular Destiny, B'Elanna and Miral successfully fake their deaths, as Tom lays the groundwork to join them. Admiral Batiste finally convinces Admiral Montgomery that further investigation of the Delta Quadrant is essential, and given what the Borg has just wrought, Starfleet Command agrees. They assemble a fleet of nine ships to return to the DQ – all equipped with slipstream drives – to investigate former Borg space and make sure the Collective and the Caeliar are really gone.
Tom Paris, Harry Kim, and Counselor Cambridge will stay with Voyager, and the Doctor joins the fleet aboard an experimental medical vessel he has helped create – the Galen. Counselor Cambridge is assigned to evaluate Chakotay for his fitness to command Voyager as part of the new Full Circle fleet. Chakotay gains new respect for Cambridge as the counselor helps him deal with his grief.
Chakotay finally regains his equilibrium when he learns that Janeway died trying to prevent Starfleet from sending that fleet out, but it is too late. His command is taken from him and given to Captain Eden. Batiste becomes the Fleet Commander. Determined to help Seven, Chakotay resigns his commission in order to remain with her on Earth.
* * *
Unworthy is the beginning of the story of the fleet's return to the Delta Quadrant.
When Chakotay and Seven realize that to figure out why the voice is tormenting her, they decide that the need to find the Caeliar – so they come aboard Voyager as observers. Counselor Cambridge and the Doctor begin to help Seven control the voice and search for its source.
B'Elanna and Miral enjoy a brief stay at New Talax with Neelix before reuniting with Tom and Voyager. Harry takes Tom's betrayal personally, and there is considerable tension between the two former friends.
Voyager discovers a new species, the Indign, who is a contrary to reason, actually revere the Borg and have developed a cooperative society of six species hoping to prove themselves worthy of assimilation. But a number of inexplicable malfunctions plague Voyager's efforts to establish meaningful communication with the Indign.
In the interest of self-preservation, the Indign send their most deadly weapon to Voyager, a canister containing the consciousness of one of eight individuals imprisoned thousands of years earlier for horrific crimes against its own people. That consciousness is freed and possesses an incredibly advanced new hologram, Meegan McDonnell, one of the Doctor's assistants aboard the Galen.
It is revealed that Admiral Batiste only pushed for the Full Circle fleet's mission to enable him to return to the Delta Quadrant and create a rift to fluidic space. He was a member of Species 8472 sent to spy on the Federation and now just wants to go home. Eden is devastated by Batiste's betrayal, but Chakotay facilitates Batiste's return, pleading for his salvation with Valerie Archer. Meegan escapes and her whereabouts remain unknown.
Seven's work with the Indign allows her to begin to reconcile her human, Borg and Caeliar natures and the voice finally loses its power over her. Finally, Eden, who now commands the entire fleet, tells Chakotay that his resignation was not accepted by Starfleet and he is reinstated as Voyager's captain.
* * *
Children of the Storm tells the story of what three other fleet vessels were doing while Voyager was busy making a rough first contact with the Indign.
The Children were introduced in the second Destiny book – Mere Mortals – as a strange, intensely xenophobic species. These non-corporeal aliens had somehow managed to clear their territory of the Borg, and Starfleet decides that simply must know how they succeeded (where so many others had failed).
The Quirinal, under command of Captain Regina Farkas, the Planck, led by Hosc T'Mar, and the Demeter, led by Commander Liam O'Donnell, set out to collect intelligence on the Children and within days, the Children attack the fleet vessels, destroying Planck and capturing Demeter. Quirinal barely escapes and crash-lands on a planet twenty thousand light years away.
When the trio of ships does not report in as ordered, Captain Eden plans a rescue mission. Chakotay's priority is the immediate rescue of Demeter, but Eden is unwilling to pick a fight she does not believe she can win. Meanwhile, Demeter has its own problems. Commander O'Donnell quickly realizes that the ship was captured because of the vast store of living organisms it holds.
Demeter is a special mission ship there to study any new botanical life forms the fleet encounters and to provide fresh food for the fleet as needed. While O'Donnell's young XO, Commander Atlee Fife, is determined to free their ship by force from the Children, O'Donnell works patiently to understand these aliens and if possible, to help them. Voyager succeeds in locating Quirinal and another special mission ship, the Achilles, is tasked with making her space-worthy again. B'Elanna Torres, who is now the fleet's chief engineer, leads this effort.
Eden presses her crew to unravel the origins of the Children of the Storm and they succeed, locating the Children's “mother,” a space-born life form whose thoughts become the Children. Armed with this knowledge they are able to rescue Demeter, and enter into a new and mutually beneficial relationship with them. We learned in Full Circle that Captain Eden doesn't know much about her past. She was raised by two men she calls her uncles, who she believes found her on a distant planet before sending her to Earth for her formal education.
Several episodes of intuitive insight when viewing relics from the Delta Quadrant, however, have led her to believe that her true home might be somewhere in the Delta Quadrant. By the end of Children of the Storm, Eden has confided this truth to both Counselor Cambridge and Captain Chakotay.

The Eternal Tide reveals Asfarah Eden's true origin.
She was created by the ultimate destructive force of the multiverse – the Omega Continuum – to balance an unintentional breach of that continuum that if left untended, will result in the end of the multiverse trillions of years ahead of schedule.
The only individual in the multiverse who has a sense that something is amiss is Q – that's “Junior“, the son of John de Lancie's Q, played by Keegan de Lancie in “Q2”. He has suddenly lost the ability to move into the future, and learned at the same time that when Admiral Janeway died aboard that Borg cube back in Before Dishonor, she also dies in every other existing timeline.
He posits that his problems and hers are connected, and believes that this situation only exists because Voyager successfully sealed the Omega Continuum in the original timeline where it took them twenty-three years to get home; the timeline that was erased by the actions of Janeway and her future self in “Endgame”.
Janeway – who had been rescued (in a disembodied state) by the Q at the moment of her ‘death' – agrees to return to ‘life'. The nature of the threat is revealed and ultimately, Captain Eden and Q (“Junior”) must sacrifice themselves to restore the balance necessary to save the multiverse.

Add Mesopotamian inspired cuisines, and a rooftop deck, to the menu in Jackson Ward.
Meso, a restaurant that will offer a blend of Greek, Indian and Lebanese dishes, plans to open in the two-story, 2,200-square-foot building at 522 N. Second St. in Jackson Ward after the July Fourth holiday, said Ahmed Razak, owner/operator and chef of the new venture.
“I like what's happening in the neighborhood,” Razak said of his decision to open in Jackson Ward. “Give it two to three years, and I feel like that area is going to be the next Carytown.”
Razak said he has invested between $50,000 and $100,000 to upgrade the space since purchasing it six months ago. He said his contracting company – Richmond-based All Star Painters – is completing renovations to the space.
Meso will be staffed with three people. However, Razak said that number may increase to seven to handle increased customer traffic once university students return.
“Much of the money has been used to upgrade the building and on equipment,” Razak said. “We still have a few things to complete, but once we get it done, it's going to look great.”
In addition to Indian, Greek and Lebanese dishes, Razak said Meso will offer well-known items such as kebobs, gyros and pizza. It also will offer breakfast options that pair coffee and tea with ethnic dishes.
“It will be quality food at fair prices,” Razak said.
When night falls, Meso's second floor will open into a hookah lounge, where on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Razak said lounge music would fill the space. He added the roof also would be a hangout – an entertainment trend catching on across downtown Richmond, with at least two other rooftop bars opening in recent months.
“We're waiting on our ABC license, because we do plan on serving drinks that people can take on the roof with their friends,” Razak said. “We're going to have Italian/Swedish-style lounge furniture that will make it really nice for people.”
Meso also will offer catering services from its Jackson Ward location, Razak said. The restaurant currently operates a catering firm in Woodbridge.
With Meso preparing to open in the coming days, Razak said he's not done expanding his business empire – in the next year or two, he plans on opening another restaurant, preferably in Carytown or the Church Hill areas.
In the meantime, Razak is pleased with the growth and momentum occurring in Jackson Ward.
“This is an up-and-coming area,” Razak said. “There is a lot going on in the area that I feel is going to be good for business.”
Meso will be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday; from 8 a.m. Saturday to 2 a.m. Sunday; and from noon to 6 p.m. Sunday.
Media Bias: Not surprisingly, the media take seriously and support Jill Stein's and Hillary Clinton's excellent vote-recount adventure, despite there being no indication a recount is needed. Heck, even President Obama agrees — Donald Trump won, period. But when Trump dares to suggest in a Sunday tweet that illegal aliens voted in the election, the media respond with massive denial.
"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," Trump tweeted to the barely concealed contempt of many in the media.
Typical was the utterly dismissive headline in The Nation, the flagship publication of the progressive movement: "The President-Elect Is An Internet Troll."
The Washington Post's "The Fix" blog site did a little better: "Donald Trump's new explanation for losing the popular vote? A Twitter-born conspiracy theory."
There are many more, too many to put here. Most follow the same theme: Trump foolishly followed the faulty analysis of Gregg Phillips of True The Vote, an online anti-voter-fraud site and app. Phillips estimates that illegals cast three million votes in the 2016 election. He's wrong, say the media. Heck, even the liberal fact-checking site FactCheck.org says so.
But, in fact, it's almost certain that illegals did vote — and in significant numbers. Whether it was three million or not is another question.
While states control the voter registration process, some states are so notoriously slipshod in their controls (California, Virginia and New York — all of which have political movements to legalize voting by noncitizens — come to mind) that it would be shocking if many illegals didn't vote. Remember, a low-ball estimate says there are at least 11 million to 12 million illegals in the U.S., but that's based on faulty Census data. More likely estimates put the number at 20 million to 30 million.
What's disappointing is that instead of at least seriously considering Trump's charge, many media reports merely parrot leftist talking points and anti-Trump rhetoric by pushing the idea that Republicans and others not of the progressive left who seek to limit voting to citizens only are racist, xenophobic nuts.
But there is evidence to back Trump's claims. A 2014 study in the online Electoral Studies Journal shows that in the 2008 and 2010 elections, illegal immigrant votes were in fact quite high.
"We find that some noncitizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and congressional elections," wrote Jesse T. Richman, Gulshan A. Chattha, both of Old Dominion University, and David C. Earnest of George Mason University.
More specifically, they write, "Noncitizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress."
Specifically, the authors say that illegals may have cast as many as 2.8 million votes in 2008 and 2010. That's a lot of votes. And when you consider the population of illegal inhabitants has only grown since then, it's not unreasonable to suppose that their vote has, too.
Critics note that a Harvard team in 2015 had responded to the study, calling it "biased." But that report included this gem: "Further, the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U.S. elections is 0."
Really? That's simply preposterous, frankly, as anyone who has lived in California can attest. Leftist get-out-the-vote groups openly urge noncitizens to vote during election time, and the registration process is notoriously loose. To suggest there is no illegal voting at all is absurd.
What's appalling, as we said, is not the media's skepticism, but its denial. But why? Illegal votes shouldn't be allowed to sway U.S. elections. So why tolerate them?
When the far left began insinuating that the Russians had hacked the election, the media treated the nonsupported claims with the utmost of respect. They still do. But not Trump's suggestion that illegals voted, and in large numbers, mainly for Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton.
And, yes, Trump is right: Illegal votes may in part explain why Hillary now has a nearly two-million-vote lead in the popular vote, even though she lost convincingly in the Electoral College. A Rasmussen Reports poll earlier this year found that 53% of the Democratic Party supports letting illegals vote, even though it's against the law. It's pretty clear why.
Yes, there is room for skepticism of any claim that's made. But every vote cast by someone who isn't by law permitted to vote disenfranchises American citizens. The charge should at least be taken seriously.
Meanwhile, we will expect the media to continue to give its fawning attention to the spurious challenges of nonexistent vote tampering leveled by Hillary Clinton and Jill Stein, on behalf of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.
While the media savage Trump and his motives, please recall what Hillary said in the debates: that the idea a defeated candidate wouldn't recognize the results of the election was "horrifying." And she has also agreed there is no "actionable evidence" of either hacking or outside interference, despite joining with Stein to seek recounts.
So what about Clinton's motives?
As for Stein, who barely registered a blip on the 2016 electoral screen, the $5 million or so she has raised to pay for recounts really seems more like a ploy to bail out her failed campaign than a serious attempt at a recount. But the media continue to treat her like a serious political operator — not the far-left kook she is.

PENTICTON — Hope is on the way to Penticton, but hope — the feeling, not the town — is really what's happening this week for the Vancouver Canucks and their prospects at the Young Stars Classic.
The Canucks have brought 30 players to the rookie tournament here and they'll be challenged in four games against rookies from the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Winnipeg Jets and San Jose Sharks.
Canucks management hopes that 2013 first-round picks Bo Horvat and Hunter Shinkaruk are the real deal, that previous first-rounders Brendan Gaunce and Niklas Jensen have grown as players, that Frank Corrado continues to show maturity beyond his years and that goaltender Joacim Eriksson is the winner he was in Sweden last season.
Lots of questions, lots of hope.
“This tournament is an exceptional forum for us,” noted Canucks assistant general manager Laurence Gilman. “It gives us a chance to see our prospects play and perform against their peers and it also gives us the opportunity to see them play with each other, particularly in the case of guys who are junior age and will be going back.
“Additionally, it gives players who are coming here for the first time, in some cases from Europe, an opportunity to get their feet wet and get some familiarity with their teammates before the season starts.”
This is the third version of the Young Stars tournament. It began in 2010 but was cancelled last season because of the NHL lockout.
“It was a success from the start and everyone who was in the first one, except for Anaheim, decided to stay in,” Gilman said. “From what we've been told, everyone is looking to keep this going for years to come.”
The Canuck prospects will get down to work Wednesday with a practice, to be run by Utica Comets head coach Travis Green and his assistants Nolan Baumgartner and Paul Jerrard. Their first game is Thursday night against the Sharks, followed by a Friday nighter against the Flames, and then matinees Sunday against Oilers (2 p.m.) and Monday against the Jets (noon).
There will be all kinds of players trying to make an impression, from first-round picks to mid- and late-round picks, to tryout candidates. Here are some prospects, both on the Canucks and the other teams, worth watching:
1. Bo Horvat, 18, drafted ninth overall by Vancouver in 2013. Horvat is the only return from the Cory Schneider trade and you can bet all Canuck eyes will be on the London Knights centre. By the way, have you seen his top-10 goals video? Some beauties in there.
2. Hunter Shinkaruk, 18, drafted 24th overall by Vancouver in 2013. After filling the net the last two seasons for the Medicine Hat Tigers, Shinkaruk will be looking to prove he can score at any level, not just major junior.
3. Cole Cassels, 18, drafted 85th overall by Vancouver in 2013. His dad Andrew, a one-time Canuck, made a living dishing to his wingers with his soft hands. Is Cole an Andrew clone?

Doing at least half an hour of exercise three times a week may boost men's sperm count, say scientists.
Men who took up running and stuck with it had more "healthy swimmers", according to the research in the journal Reproduction.
The boost was only temporary, and began to wane within a month if the men stopped their treadmill training.
Experts say it is important to strike the right balance because too much exercise can harm sperm production.
Studies have shown that participation in competitive sports, like cycling, can lower sperm quality.
Sperm boosters
Keep your testicles cool - avoid tight underwear and hot baths
Avoid sexually transmitted infections
Stop smoking
Cut down on alcohol
Stay slim
Get some exercise, but not too much!
All of the 261 men enrolled in the recent trial were healthy and did not have any fertility problems as far as they could tell. They had normal sperm counts and healthy-looking sperm and led fairly sedentary lives.
The men were allocated to one of four programmes:
no exercise
three sessions a week of high intensity interval training (10 one-minute bursts of very fast running with a short recovery period between each bout)
three sessions a week of moderate exercise (30 minutes on a treadmill)
three sessions a week of intense exercise (about an hour on a treadmill)
Exercise training appeared to boost sperm quantity and quality, with moderate exercise coming top.
Men in all three exercise groups lost weight and saw improvements in their sperm test results compared with the men who did no exercise over the 24-week trial period.

The researchers say at least part of the benefit may come from shedding excess weight - all three exercise groups lost some body fat.
Experts already know obesity can lower a man's fertility. A third of the men in each study group were overweight.
Fertility aid?
What is not clear is whether the boost from exercise translates to better fertility. That is something the researchers plan to explore in the lab by checking if training-induced changes affect the fertilising potential of sperm.
Lead researcher Behzad Hajizadeh Maleki said: "Our results show that doing exercise can be a simple, cheap and effective strategy for improving sperm quality in sedentary men.
"However, it's important to acknowledge that the reason some men can't have children isn't just based on their sperm count. Male infertility problems can be complex and changing lifestyles might not solve these cases easily."
Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield and spokesman for the British Fertility Society, said: "We have a very poor understanding of how physical exercise affects male fertility and sperm quality, but it is a question commonly asked by men wishing to improve their chances of having a child."
He said there probably was a level of exercise that is optimum for male fertility, but recommended that men check with their GP before embarking on anything too strenuous.
UK guidelines recommend that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, such as running, every week.
23-year-old Bulgarian went missing after his visa interview in the US Embassy in Sofia. File photo
The father of a Bulgarian 23-year-old who went missing on May 12, begs US President Barack Obama for help.
Vladimir Dimitrov, father of Petar Dimitrov, wrote a letter to the US president to ask for assistance for finding his son.
Petar went to the US Embassy in Sofia for his visa interview. He was planning to go on a Work and Travel program in the USA, but his request for visa was rejected. The young man was supposed to meet friends in front of the Embassy, but he did not show up. His phone has been switched off since then.
The security cameras show Petar entering the Embassy, but there is no record of him going out of it.
“US Embassy officials said the boy has left the building, but there is not a single proof for that,” said Nikolay Kolev-Bosiya who is helping the father solve the mystery.
After pointlessly watching the security tapes, Vladimir Dimitrov wrote a letter to Barack Obama through the White House website, with the help of the Bulgarian Embassy in Washington.
“I do not blame anyone, but in order to require help from the Bulgarian institutions, I need to have proof that my son has left the building,” the father wrote, asking the US president for information on his son's psychological condition.
Dimitrov finds the possibility of his son's illegal immigration to the USA impossible because he did not have enough money.
“Petar was not a conflict person and would not do anything irrational because of a visa rejection,” he added.
Petar Dimitrov is more than 180 cm tall, with strong physics. He is a sophomore in the Police Academy in Sofia, majoring in “National Fire Safety and Protection of Population”.

The California housing market has had its worst year on record. 2008 will go down as one of the most difficult and volatile economic years in history. With that said, there is still a lingering notion or profound desire for bargain hunting. Many articles now try to call a bottom in the stock markets by looking at market fundamentals. Similarly many are now trying to call a bottom in housing in particular the California housing market.
It is hard not to be tempted to call a bottom. It is tempting to call a bottom since the median price of a California home has gone from a peak in May of 2007 of $484,000 to the current price of $258,000. That is a stunning drop of 46 percent in slightly over a year.
This is going to be a comprehensive housing report for the state of California. The challenging thing in today's market isn't so much that the data isn't available, but trying to put the data together into some meaningful analysis. The data used in this report comes from the American Community Survey which was released only a few weeks ago and has data reflecting changes all the way up until the end of 2007. I've also combined this data with the home price data from DataQuick which has covered the California housing market for many years and is used by many analyst and reporters.
The data in this analysis will cover 32 of the most populace counties in the state and covers 33,888,596 people and 11,561,712 households. This should be a very comprehensive report. The main question many people are thinking about is whether the state of California is or near a housing bottom. Simply stating we have a bottom because prices have fallen 46 percent from their peak is not an economic argument or holds much water under analysis. We had a prolonged bubble that had its roots planted way back in 1979. It took many years to build and hit the peak only last year. We may be looking at a multiple year correction here.
Analysis #1 – Income to Price Ratios
*Click for sharper image
One excellent measure of determining whether a home is affordable is looking at the income of households living in the immediate area. This is a very important data point. For example, a median price of $1 million may seem a lot on the surface but if the median household income of the area is $300,000 per year, then the price is right. In this same line of thought, a home priced at $50,000 is expensive if the median income of an area is $5,000.
The above chart tells us a lot. First, we see that the three most expensive counties are:
San Francisco: 9.89
San Luis Obispo: 7.82
Marin County: 7.46
What the above information tells us for example is that the current median home price for San Francisco is 9.89 the median household income of the area. That is still extremely overpriced. In fact, 12 of the 32 counties on the list have income to price ratio of 5 or higher. This is high. Across the nation we will find income to price ratios of 3 or 4 which are more within historical standards.
The three least expensive counties in California are:
Stanislaus County: 3.18
Solano County: 3.09
Merced County: 2.83
What this tells us is that using a blanket statement like “California has hit a housing bottom” is missing the point. Certain counties may have already hit a bottom. Yet you will also need to look at the employment situation in some of these areas. I have provided 10 reasons why this recession will feel like a minor depression so now we have to also factor in whether other factors like employment growth will hold up. Looking at places like Detroit we find low ratios but the employment base is quickly shrinking.
And population size of a county does not indicate affordability. The largest populated county Los Angeles with 9.6 million people has a price to income ratio of 6.46. That is extremely high. Yet a county like San Bernardino with 1.9 million people now has a price to income ratio of 3.42. The dynamics of the California housing market are wide and varied.
Analysis #2 – Median Household Income
To say that a high median household income is enough to qualify for high home prices is wrong. I think this chart tells a lot more of the California housing bubble story. When prices reached nearly a $500,000 median price across the state, it was clearly a bubble because statewide the median household income is approximately $50,000. That at the peak put the ratio at 10 which is a difficult ratio to justify.
Even now after the historic bust, we are still very much overpriced. Let us look really quickly at the top 3 median household income areas and see what their price to income ratios are:
Marin County: Median Income: $83,732 – Price-to-income ratio: 7.46
Santa Clara County: Median Income: $83,074 – Price-to-income ratio: 5.37
San Mateo County: Median Income: $81,573 – Price-to-income ratio: 7.12
This is very useful data. What we learn is median income in these 3 counties is very similar. Yet Santa Clara county has a better price ratio of homes to the current income of those in the area. Let us look at the bottom 3 income areas:
Madera County: Median Income: $44,534 – Price-to-income ratio: 3.6
Merced County: Median Income: $44,141 – Price-to-income ratio: 2.83
Tulare County: Median Income: $41,837 – Price-to-income ratio: 4.18
More useful information. The incomes again are rather similar for the bottom 3 yet if we look at the ratios, Merced County would be the most “affordable” place to buy.
Analysis #3 – Median Home Price
Just looking at the median home price does not tell the entire story. If you look at the above chart, we have 2 counties with prices over $600,000, 3 with over $500,000, and 5 with median prices over $400,000. We would have to go to $300,000 to find 16 counties with higher prices, or half of the 32 counties on the list.
But what is the population of these 16 counties?
Top 16 median priced counties: 22,701,908
Bottom 16 median priced counties: 11,186,688
Keep in mind that we are looking at the largest 32 counties in the state so we are not capturing 100 percent of the picture simply because all the data isn't available but this data captures 90 percent of the California population. So on the surface, this may lead you to believe that most people can afford to live in high priced areas. Or is it that most of these high priced areas are in a bubble and that is why people are now struggling with holding onto their homes? Let us run a quick average of the price-to-income ratio of both subsets:
Top 16 counties average price to income ratio: 6.11
Bottom 16 counties average price to income ratio: 3.61
This is a very important data set here because of the bifurcation of the state. What we can derive is the lower priced counties are starting to find a bottom yet the top 16 are still overpriced. This is important because someone looking to buy in Merced would arrive at a different conclusion than someone looking to buy in San Francisco. We are looking at income relative to each county so we are painting with a very narrow brush here.
Take a look at the population breakdown:
The above chart breaks down the 32 counties in our data set by population.
It is the case that the California housing market is diverse and has enormous variability. I have argued before that California will not see a bottom until 3 years in the future and have provided an additional 3 reasons. Yet with that argument, I was looking at the state on an aggregate basis and not on individual levels. What this analysis shows is that certain counties are arriving at bottoms much quicker and higher price areas are much more stubborn yet are coming down in price. This happens in most housing bubbles. The marginal areas get hit first and progressively move up the spectrum to higher priced areas.
If you are planning on buying in the near future, make sure you know where you live and take all the data into consideration. Simply saying we are at a bottom is too broad a statement for the California housing market.

An “empty out the fridge” kind of soup — use your favorite veggies, add some quinoa + chicken, and finish it with a delicious spice blend. Healthy and hearty with all the ease of being slow cooked (dump it and forget about it meal). You know those vegetables that are left over from the last soup or dinner you made? The ones that tend to sit in the bottom drawer of your fridge just *waiting* to be made into something delicious?
Because you always have good intentions for the leftover vegetables right? I always have those good intentions and then somehow I seem to find a few completely wilted celery stalks and some less than firm avocados (okay fine. squishy and brown beyond any desire to eat) in the bottom of the fridge. And honestly I hate wasting food. I mean who doesn't, right? And that is why this soup has become a favorite as of late. It's totally customizable to keep any of your vegetables going to waste. It's one of those recipes that makes you feel good in the “I just used the last bits of random veggies in the fridge” kind-of-way.
And THEN, you taste the soup, and it's a whole new level of excitement. Because this soup is not only keeping you from wasting any small amounts of veggies, but it's also tasty, filling, and very healthy.
We've made this soup a few times now always using different vegetables. You can pretty much chop up and add just about whatever you have on hand or whatever you like.
My favorite combos always start with celery, carrots, and onion (chopped super fine and the husband can't even tell there are in there (he's not an onion fan)). If you add in the carrots slice them thin and small to get them tender in time with the other ingredients. And basically any other vegetable you add — make sure it's chopped or sliced into pretty small bits so it can get cooked through in the time the chicken and quinoa is cooked in.
We've also tried both chicken breasts and thighs. The thighs result in a more tender (and a bit more flavorful) meat, but both will work. If you use chicken breasts, slice them into large chunks (about 3 chunks per breast) to help the chicken cook evenly with everything else.
Since quinoa absorbs liquid like crazy, I've found it's best to only use the high setting when cooking this soup. Cook this soup on low and it turns into more of a stew (also good, just depends on what you like.) For a very brothy soup, you can always add in more broth and make sure to cook it just until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through.
And (when will I ever stop making excuses for my videos? ?) just because the video is missing a few ingredients (the tomato paste and minced garlic) don't leave those out ingredients out! Sometimes (okay pretty much every single video) I think I hit record and then find out later I never did. Either that or my memory card suddenly filled up and it stopped recording. OR my battery died. Or, I just don't even know. Sometimes recording myself adding things to the crockpot is harder than it sounds. ?
5 from 6 votes Print Crockpot Chicken Veggie Quinoa Soup Prep Time 10 mins Cook Time 5 hrs Total Time 5 hrs 10 mins Servings : 6 -8 Authors : Chelsea Ingredients 1 pound (~2 large) boneless skinless chicken breasts or 4-6 thighs
1 can pinto beans
1 can corn
1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots
1/2 cup sliced celery 2 stalks
1/3 cup diced yellow onion
3/4 cup quinoa I use garlic infused packet
1/2 cup orange juice or extra broth
1 can dice tomatoes with green chiles
1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
2 teaspoons minced garlic
5 cups chicken broth or stock
Seasoned salt and pepper Seasonings 1-2 leaves bay
1 teaspoon chicken seasoning blend or 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons cajun seasoning*
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper
Toppings: low-fat sour cream, fresh cilantro, fresh lime wedges or lime juice Instructions Trim the fat off the chicken breasts or thighs. If using breasts, cut each breast into 3 large even pieces. Place the chicken breasts or thighs in the bottom of a large crockpot. I use a 6 quart crockpot. Add in the drained and rinsed pinto beans, drained corn, thinly sliced carrots, sliced celery, diced onion, quinoa (rinse if not pre-rinsed to remove the bitter saponin coating), orange juice (or extra broth), undrained can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as Ro-Tel), tomato paste, minced garlic, and chicken broth or stock. Add about 1 teaspoon seasoned salt (or to taste) and 1 teaspoon pepper (or to taste), bay leaves, chicken seasoning blend, cajun seasoning, oregano, ground cumin, and paprika. Stir and then cover and cook on high for 3-5 hours or until the chicken easily shreds and the quinoa has "popped." My crockpot takes about 3 hours. The longer it cooks, the more liquid the quinoa absorbs which is why I don't recommend cooking on low unless you are fine with a stew 🙂 Remove the chicken and shred. Return to the crockpot. Remove the bay leaves and then enjoy the soup topped with optional toppings such as fresh cilantro, fresh lime, sour cream (we use low fat), and additional cajun seasoning, salt, pepper. Recipe Notes For a "brothier" soup just add a few extra cups of chicken broth to desired preference! *I use McCormick cajun seasoning which tends to be a bit mmilderthan others. Scale up or down to personal preference.

A new arm of the LCBO will sell recreational marijuana in Ontario, the province announced Friday morning, with the goal being to keep people from buying it.
“We've heard people across Ontario are anxious about the federal legalization of cannabis,” Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said, setting the tone. “The province is moving forward with a safe and sensible approach to legalization that will ensure we can keep our communities and roads safe, promote public health and harm reduction, and protect Ontario's young people.”
Naqvi, Finance Minister Charles Sousa and Health Minister Eric Hoskins delivered the plans Friday morning, partly reading a joint statement on behalf of the government and partly taking questions individually — Naqvi about the law, Sousa about the logistics of retail sales and Hoskins about the health implications.
The federal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised its own legislation to legalize marijuana by next summer, keeping a 2015 campaign promise from Trudeau's Liberals. Working out the details of how it'll be sold is up to the provinces.
Neither the federal nor the Ontario government seems very eager to do any of this, though. Prohibiting pot has been an obvious failure for decades, costing fortunes in law enforcement and ruining lives with criminal charges without keeping the smell of sweet smoke from wafting through every downtown neighbourhood on mild evenings, all to try to stop people from choosing to use a drug that's less damaging than alcohol.
Instead of welcoming a chance to stop failing expensively, the ministers all looked as though they'd just been threatened in a back room and then dragged out by their heels to the microphone.
“Cannabis will remain a carefully controlled substance in Ontario,” Sousa promised. It'll be covered by the restrictions that apply to tobacco, plus the restrictions that apply to alcohol. “We are confident that we have taken the best approach. The LCBO model works. It's proven and we feel strongly that it's the way to go.”

“Legalization is taking place at the federal level. It's not a matter of supporting or opposing. Our approach is to be as thoughtful and as competent about it (as possible),” Naqvi, the MPP for Ottawa Centre, said in a separate interview. “That's why we've spent a lot of time and, being the lead on it, we've spent a fair bit of time on understanding the marketplace, understanding the behaviour, and understanding where the preferences will lie for Ontarians.”
Following general models we already use to restrict legal drugs will be convenient, he said. “To the extent that we can align the regulatory mechanism with alcohol and tobacco, it will be easy to educate Ontarians, it will be easy to familiarize them with the reality of legalization of cannabis,” he said.
But unlike a nice Niagara Riesling, pot is still a dirty drug. So the experience of buying it legally will be like the one the provincial liquor store offered decades ago, when you'd buy wine and spirits by filling out a slip saying what you wanted and a worker would go and get it for you from a back room.
“We will not permit products to be visible,” Sousa promised.
Customers will have to show identification and get their pot from salespeople behind counters in up to 150 standalone marijuana stores by 2020, with the actual marijuana concealed in plain cases the way corner stores now keep their tobacco. Sousa's ministry will consult with municipalities on just where to put the stores, mindful that some people won't want them near schools, for instance.
They'll open in waves — 40 next summer when federal legalization kicks in, 80 by the end of 2018, the full complement two years after that.
There will be no self-service, no browsing. Sales will be restricted to people 19 and older (youths will be banned from possessing marijuana under provincial law, though it won't be a criminal offence) and recreational marijuana use will only be allowed in private residences.
So don't expect marijuana vaping lounges or even to smoke a joint in places you can smoke a cigarette. At home only, though in a back yard or on a balcony will be OK. Naqvi did say that licensing premises for marijuana consumption, like pot bars, is something Ontario will explore at some point. We'll figure out what to do about edible marijuana products if and when the federal government legalizes those, and we'll have to figure out provincial rules on driving while high.
They're still working on how the government retailer will buy its marijuana wholesale and how it'll be priced. The provinces are expecting meetings on that later this fall, seeking some common ground so there aren't huge differences from one jurisdiction to another.
How cross-border pot shopping will work is another interprovincial issue yet to be resolved, Naqvi said.
Sousa said he expects marijuana to be a moneymaker for the government, though hiring and training staff and setting up stores and a distribution network will mean up-front costs. Hoskins said he expects some of the proceeds to be plowed into public-health campaigns that discourage pot-smoking.
Ontario has 660 government-run liquor stores now and a further 212 “agency stores,” where private grocery and convenience-store owners in more rural areas have licences to sell alcohol. So there'll be a comparative lack of government pot shops.
Sousa said online sales will begin in 2018, on the same terms as it's legal to buy alcohol online — with ID checks and signatures required upon delivery. That's how people without a nearby marijuana store will be able to get the stuff.
The province and cities will crack down on the proliferation of private storefront marijuana shops, which are illegal and will stay that way. Dozens have opened across the province since the Liberal government announced its legalization plans, with owners hoping to get momentum. Expect more aggressive police enforcement.
Having the LCBO run the retail marijuana business means it's likely the jobs in the government stores will be filled by employees represented by the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, historically one of the provincial government's most obstreperous. OPSEU has lobbied for the LCBO to handle pot sales for years.
“An important side benefit to today's announcement is that it means good union jobs that will promote the culture of safety and integrity that people appreciate in the LCBO,” said OPSEU president Smokey Thomas. “There is no downside to today's announcement. It's a model that we encourage other provinces to emulate.”

Piers Sellers sleeps on on Shuttle mission STS-112 in 2002. He's floating in the lower right corner and wearing a sleep mask. May cause drowsiness, decreased mental alertness, and problems with coordination. Don't drive or operate machinery. Don't engage in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination.
These are among the standard warnings for lots of sleeping pills. And that's fine if you don't have to go out on the highway or operate a backhoe.
But what if your workplace 24 hours per day is a big, heavy, hazardous machine in outer space, like the shuttle of the International Space Station?
The question is getting renewed attention in the most extensive study to date of the sleeping habits of astronauts as recorded in flight. They've got a problem sleeping, it said, and lots of them, up to three-fourths, take medication to help them doze off.
The study, by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School and the University of Colorado, is published in the Lancet Neurology and summarized in a release from Brigham and Women's.
It looked at the data from more than 4,200 nights spent in space by 64 astronauts on 80 shuttle missions and 21 astronauts aboard International Space Station (ISS) missions.
“Crew members attempted and obtained significantly less sleep per night” than would otherwise be the case, the study found. Though NASA recommends eight hours of sleep for astronauts, the study said as a group they averaged just less than six hours on shuttle missions and just more than six hours on the space station. They also got less sleep just before flights as well, it said.
To help themselves sleep, the researchers found “widespread use of sleeping medications such as zolpidem and zaleplon during space flight,” said the summary. “Three-quarters of ISS crew members reported taking sleep medication at some point during their time on the space station, and more than three-quarters (78 percent) of shuttle-mission crew members used medication on more than half (52 percent) of nights in space.”
“Sleep deficiency is pervasive among crew members,” Laura K. Barger of BWH's Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, stated in the BWH press release. “It's clear that more effective measures are needed to promote adequate sleep in crew members, both during training and space flight, as sleep deficiency has been associated with performance decrements in numerous laboratory and field-based studies.”
“The ability for a crew member to optimally perform if awakened from sleep by an emergency alarm may be jeopardized by the use of sleep-promoting pharmaceuticals,” said Barger. “Routine use of such medications by crew members operating spacecraft are of particular concern, given the U. S. Federal Drug Administration warning that patients using sleeping pills should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, including potential impairment of performance of such activities that may occur the day following ingestion of sedative/hypnotics. This consideration is especially important because all crew members on a given mission may be under the influence of a sleep promoting medication at the same time.”
This problem is not news to NASA, though the extent of sleeplessness and of medication use is greater than earlier studies reported. In 2001, an agency press release, “Wide Awake in Outer Space,” highlighted the issue:
Astronauts sleep poorly in space and it's no wonder. Just consider: the excitement of blasting off on a powerful rocket, the strange sensations of floating in free-fall, the novelty of mornings that return every 90 minutes. Who could sleep through all that?
The study was supported by NASA and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute.
Although not many details about Dragon Ball Super have been revealed yet, Goku's Japanese voice actress is excited about the series.
Last weekend on May 9th was officially recognized as “Goku Day”. Toei Japan caught up with Goku's voice actress, Masako Nozawa, to discuss Dragon Ball Super and her opinion on the future of the franchise.
Surprisingly, Nozawa does not know many details about Dragon Ball Super herself even though the series is set to debut this July in Japan. She said she doesn't know about the story yet, but she knows the series will be “super fun”.
She is also predicting that Dragon Ball Super will also have amazing battles. Apart from the new series, she's also hoping a new animated movie is made too. For now the only recent DBZ movies are Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. We still don't know if another movie will be made yet.
Nozawa also hopes that Dragon Ball Super just doesn't focus on Goku, Gohan and Goten. She hopes the Dragon Ball family gets bigger in the future. I guess she means the series introduces a few new characters that we haven't seen yet.
It may not be until next year that Western countries get to see Dragon Ball Super. However story and characters details are sure to be shared when the series airs in Japan this July.

(CNN) Exercising its veto power at the United Nations for the first time, the Trump administration torpedoed a Security Council resolution critical of the White House's unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley cast the veto, blocking the resolution, introduced by Egypt, despite the 14 other members of the Security Council voting in favor.
"Today for the simple act of deciding where to put our embassy, the United States was forced to defend its sovereignty. The record will reflect that we did so proudly," Haley said after the vote.
"Today for acknowledging a basic truth about the capital city of Israel, we are accused of harming peace. The record will reflect that we reject that outrageous claim. For these reasons and with the best interest of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people firmly in mind, the United States votes no on this resolution."
Palestinian leaders slammed the US decision, citing it as further proof the White House could no longer play an impartial role in any Israeli-Palestinian peace process. A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the US veto "contravenes the resolutions of international community and Security Council resolutions and represents a complete bias with the [Israeli] occupation and aggression," according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh said the veto would further isolate the United States, calling it a "provocation of the international community."

Image copyright PA Image caption The hospital said "unacceptable behaviour" had been recorded "within the hospital"
Staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital have received death threats over the treatment of baby Charlie Gard.
The hospital said police had been called after families were "harassed" and "unacceptable behaviour" was recorded in the hospital.
It is involved in a legal battle to remove life support from the 11-month-old, who has a rare genetic disorder.
His parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard said they did not condone abuse and had also faced "nasty and hurtful remarks".
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter although Charlie's case was "sad and complex", this behaviour was "totally unacceptable".
Charlie, who was born on 4 August 2016, has a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and irreversible brain damage, and his parents want to take him to the US for pioneering treatment.
Image copyright PA Image caption Connie Yates and Chris Gard want Charlie to receive an experimental therapy called nucleoside
They have lost a succession of court cases to overturn the hospital's decision that it would be in the best interest of the child to be allowed to die with dignity.
The latest court battle involves new testimony from a US neurologist who has visited Charlie in hospital to decide whether he should travel to America for therapy.
Charlie's parents want to take him to New York for experimental treatment, which the US doctor said might give him a 10% chance of improving his health.
Mary MacLeod, chairman of Great Ormond Street Hospital, said in a statement that Charlie's case was "a heartbreaking one", adding the hospital understood the "natural sympathy people feel with his situation".
However, in recent weeks the hospital community had been subjected to a "shocking and disgraceful tide of hostility and disturbance," she said.
Image copyright PA Image caption Charlie has a rare genetic condition and is on life support
She added: "Staff have received abuse both in the street and online.
"Thousands of abusive messages have been sent to doctors and nurses whose life's work is to care for sick children.
"Many of these messages are menacing, including death threats.
"Families have been harassed and discomforted while visiting their children, and we have received complaints of unacceptable behaviour even within the hospital itself."
Ms MacLeod, who also chairs the hospital's clinical ethics committee, said "there can be no excuse" for patients, families and staff "to have their privacy and peace disturbed".
'Totally unacceptable'
In a statement issued through a spokeswoman, Charlie's parents said: "We don't condone abusive or threatening behaviour to GOSH staff or anybody in connection with our son.
"We too get abuse and have to endure nasty and hurtful remarks on a daily basis.
"People have different opinions and we accept that but there is a line that shouldn't be crossed as it makes a stressful situation worse and is very upsetting for all involved."
The case is due back before a High Court judge on Monday.

Hey everyone!
We would first like to apologise for the delay since the last blog post. We have hit a snag with one of our dependencies in the game's code which has meant that we will need to replace it with a custom solution. For the sake of long-term development it made the most sense to write our own version of that dependency and integrate it with the engine. We have also hit some technical issues on the video front, and the interview with Ben should be released next weekend!
For our next instalment of Developer Delvings, we have some cool new developments. These range from game design, to programming developments, all the way to the development of a web application for powering service related to SoA, and Regrowth Studios as a whole!
In short, we are continuing the quest to make Seed of Andromeda more accessible, unique, and smoooooooth. Giving you as interesting and as fun an experience as possible. Now for the details...
Flora generation now allows for single and multi-block forms, such as the death cacti and tall grass. This will make the worlds you can explore that bit more interesting, and give that bit more power to the procedural generation engine behind the majority of environments you'll encounter.
In that same vein, we have also worked on large tree generation with sub-flora as fruit, and space colonization for branches.Space Colonization is a method to generate realistic branches that avoid each other and seek out light. However, this method is much slower than the cellular automata branch generation. For those Computer Science gurus out there, Space Colonization is O(n * n * m) in complexity, whereas cellular automata is between O(n) and O(n * n) depending on the parameters. For this reason, we are using both methods in our tree generation. For smaller trees, typically cellular automata generation is just fine, and overlapping branches aren't too much of a problem. But for giant trees like the one below, space colonization can generate the main branches then cellular automata can generate the sub-branches. All of this happens quite fast as long as you keep the number of data points for the colonization low, and make sure to use a good step size. When we make our tree editor, we will make sure that it flags performance warnings, so that modders can be sure that their trees won't take forever to generate!
We've also optimized generation of flora a bit more with some really clever usage of bitfields. Trees are generated on a separate thread without any information about the grid, and then are pasted on to the grid later as a performance boost. Because of this, we send a list of "nodes" to the main thread for placement. Before, if two branches overlapped, the nodes for those branches would both be sent to the main thread to be placed, which is a waste of time and memory. Now, overlapping nodes do not cause redundant voxel edits, because most overlaps are discarded! This yielded a pretty significant boost to performance with trees that have lots of overlapping branches, like bargonite crystals! ( yes, crystals use the tree generator :P )
Now let's talk about voxels a bit. The voxel acquire/release API allows for mods to “Acquire” and “Release” certain chunks, guaranteeing that the chunks will be in memory for as long as they are acquired by at least one thread. It is essentially a refcounting system for voxel data. This doesn't provide much of a performance benefit over the old method with regards to basic gameplay, but it gives modders and code a much easier thread-safe API for getting access to the voxel grid. And it greatly simplifies the code, which is good for us, and in extension you!
The writers have been hard at work determining the overall structure of the game story. This is at a high level and is lending itself to making it easier to specify detailed things about the different factions in the story. They have been discussing the alien race that shoots down the colonists in some significant detail, as well as the humans and some other factions that are yet to be revealed!
There has also been work done on a web application that will serve user, modding, forum, blog and other functionalities related to SoA, and ultimately other Regrowth Studios projects. The application is being designed to be very powerful, allowing it to be integrated with more than just a single website - instead multiple websites and clients. The modding service that will be a part of it will be critical to making the modding experience as easy for both creators and users as possible. There will be more info to come on this, so keep your eyes peeled!
Finally, we have been investigating the best server infrastructure for this web application, and have begun setting it up for implementing the application. It will be far more powerful than the server infrastructure we currently use, allowing many more concurrent users of the web application. The server being courtesy of our own Jeremy, who has put in a lot of work towards this side of the work.
That's it for now! Back to work for us. Be sure to let us know what you think of this progress in the comments or on the forums!
Microsoft is preparing to "end sales" of its Lumia smartphones by the end of the year, according to an anonymous internal source.
And in a decision that will surprise almost nobody, Microsoft is believed to be planning to replace its underperforming Lumia range with a new Surface Phone.
The anonymous tipster's predictions have seemingly been borne out recently, both by the fact that just four Lumia models are left on the market, with no more forthcoming, and by reports that many retailers have been offering discounts and removing the phones from in-store prominence. Microsoft has even removed the link to buy Lumias from its US website, and dialled back their presence in other regions.
According to WinBeta, which first broke the news, the source says that the Lumia brand will be totally removed from sale by the end of the year, rather than just having production ceased. The speculation is that this will make space for the rumoured Surface Phone, a notion corroborated by a pair of now-deleted tweets sent one of Microsoft's engineering directors, Laura Butler, who wrote "Surface iPhone. ;-)" on September 6, and "Surface Phone not NOT confirmed. :-)" on September 7, in reply to questions.
The firm is thought to be holding an event in October to announce a Surface all-in-one, which is when the phone could be revealed as well, or it might be held back for an event in 2017.
While Microsoft seems to be closing the book on its experiment with Nokia and laying off thousands of employees it acquired during its ill-starred takeover of the Finnish phone company, it would still come as something of a surprise if it stepped out of the smartphone game for good, especially as it does still seem to be enthusiastic with its other Surface products.
(CNN) — A rare Roman tombstone discovered facedown weeks ago in England proved to be even more spectacular on Wednesday, when archaeologists turned it over.
The inscription on the front of the tombstone, discovered at a dig in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, reads: "To the spirits of the departed/Bodicacia/faithful wife/died aged 27," according to a preliminary translation by Cotswold Archaeology
Most likely dating back to the 2nd century AD, the tombstone may be for a person named Bodicacia or Bodica, according to Ed McSloy, Cotswold Archaeology's senior finds and archives officer. The name variations would be Latinized versions of Celtic names, though Cacia could be fully Roman, he said.
"It is also just possible that ... the inscription contains two names and refers to a male Bodus and includes the female name Cacia -- possibly the name of the wife," wrote McSloy, via email.
The title "Coniunx" (faithful wife) in the inscription is sometimes used in association with freed slaves, McSloy added, so the person may have started life as a slave.
Finding an inscribed Roman tombstone in England is rare. Fewer than 300 have been found in Britain, and only 10 in Cirencester, McSloy said.
And locating it in a cemetery -- where it was intended to be located -- is also rare. "Most tombstones that are known have been reused later in the Roman period as building stone, often built into town defenses," McSloy explained.
"This tombstone was found in a grave, directly above an adult skeleton. It remains to be confirmed whether the skeleton is that of the named individual, or whether the tombstone was later reused as a cover for the grave of another person."
Analysis of the bones will likely determine the person's gender, age at death, diet and whether the person was local to the area, McSloy said.
The headstone still shows mason's chisel marks and a design probably showing Oceanus, the god of the sea, with a long mustache, long hair and crab-like pincers above his head, McSloy said.
- Attorney for Little Caesars said on Friday that a lawsuit that claimed a Detroit-area Muslim man had been served pepperoni pizza instead of halal pepperoni was being dropped. However, the man's attorneys are disputing that assertion.
Little Caesars says after they were made aware of Mohamad Bazzi's lawsuit, they looked into the matter -- as the consumption of pork is strictly forbidden under Muslim law.
They say they found the allegations to be false and presented those results to Bazzi's attorney before heading into court.
"We shared the results of what we learned with Mr. Bazzi's attorney, which caused him to tell us he would dismiss the lawsuit," said Mike Huget from local Detroit law firm Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn.
Attorneys for Bazzi released a statement to FOX 2 saying that claims of the lawsuit being dropped were not accurate. Attorneys claim that they said the planned to dismiss the lawsuit in order to add additional plaintiffs. Read the statement below:
"The allegations that Little Ceasar's Pizza made in its news release needs to be clarified. Yesterday, I met with the attorneys for Little Caesars. I was shown a video of the event of that day. There is nothing in the video that changes the merits of the case. That is my client was served "Pork" pepperoni on two separate occasions...Plaintiff had planned on dismissing the lawsuit to add additional plaintiffs. It appears that Little Caeser's Pizza first lied to its Muslim customers by serving "Pork" pepperoni and now they are lying to the media by mistaking the truth. The truth is my client isn't dismissing the case because it lacks merits, he was hoping to dismiss to have the case filed with additional plaintiffs...which was sent to the attorney for Little Caesar's. "
Bazzi's lawsuit claimed he ordered a halal pizza from the location on Schafer near Warren in Dearborn on March 20.
When he and his wife began to eat, they realized that they were eating pork pepperoni, they had said.
Bazzi went to the Dearborn police to complain. On May 24, he ordered another halal pepperoni pizza -- even checking to ensure the receipt and box's label said "halal," he said.
He said again, he found pork pepperoni.
Bazzi returned to the store and the manager told him that he asked for regular pepperoni and that he "told the employee to put the [halal] sticker" on the box.
According to the lawsuit, Bazzi states Little Caesars does not "provide proper training to employees on the magnitude and emotional distress that is caused by feeding 'pork' to Muslims, under the guise that it is 'halal.'"
The class action lawsuit had been filed for $100 million in economic and punitive damages.

The Globe's source also said a surveillance camera at Lord & Taylor, located directly across the street, had provided clear video of the area, though it was unclear whether the image of the suspect was taken from that camera.
“The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,” confirmed Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino. “All I know is that they are making progress.”

Judge George O'Toole has denied in large part the defense's request to obtain more material from the prosecution. However, he offers a hint how the defense might overcome this obstacle: the requests must be more specific.The Lord & Taylor surveillance video certainly fulfills all required preconditionsfor an "in camera" review:- what evidence does the defendant hope to find?why does he think the material contains this evidence?- why would this evidence be favorable for him?Associated Press defended their story of a suspect in custody for a while even after the high level denial, just like King. This Twitter message (WCVB TV) is from 15:00:This is what John King said at 14:45, when the arrest had been disclaimed by high level officials. His sources were still telling him about a significant breakthrough based on enhanced surveillance video, but they suffered from a "significant blowback at the leaks".-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The criminal complaint against Dzokhar Tsarnaev, issued on April 21th, exclusively refers to surveillance footage from a camera above the doorway of the Forum restaurant which allegedly shows him dropping his bag at a metal barrier near the curb. According to this court document , the surveillance video is the prosecution's main evidence that Tsarnaev planted the Forum bomb. It was provided to the defense on May 10th - and it was apparently the only video, because it is formulated in singular.There is however another live video of the explosion at the Forum, taken from the roof of Lord & Taylor, a department store across the street. The video has fallen into oblivion, but its existence is confirmed prominently by the then Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and entrenched itself firmly into the realm of mainstream media:MeninoThese reports are from April 17th and emphasize the crucial role of the Lord & Taylor video as the most outstanding single piece of evidence. But four days later the complaint refers solely to the video taken by the Forum camera. Interestingly, the Washington Post had accomplished a nice graphic of the Lord & Taylor camera and its relative position to the crime scene by then, but, based on official sources, played down the significance of its footage in behalf of the Forum video.We've never heard of the Lord & Taylor video since. Given the permanent stonewalling of the prosecution, it is highly doubtable that Tsarnaev's defense team has obtained it. This is most unfortunate because it probably contains exculpatory evidence. The defense should request it in all circumstances. Here's why - for one hour at midday of April 17th, CNN's John King put his head far over the parapet and leaked some details of what the video shows:Let's summarize. King emphasizes that the breakthrough came from the Lord & Taylor footage and that the video shows a dark-skinned male - identified by a clear facial image - dropping a black bag at the Forum. Then he reports that an arrest has been made based on this surveillance video. This information is independently confirmed by Boston law enforcement sources as well as federal sources.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's skin color doesn't differ from a white, "Caucasian" American; his bag was light-colored, not black; and he was not being arrested at this time. In other words:Not all of the details reported by King - f.i. the "dark-skinned male" - are confirmed by other sources; but the importance of the Lord & Taylor video, the clear identification of the suspect and the black bag are ( Boston Globe ).The alleged arrest, despite being disclaimed shortly later, was widely reported, amongst others by the Associated Press and the Boston Globe:So it is difficult to dismiss this message as a pure rumor. In fact, a big crowd of journalists gathered in front of the Moakley courthouse, where they expected the suspect to be. Strangely, the courthouse was subsequently evacuated due to a bomb threat. The Wire has a good summary of the confusing news on that day.As matters stand, the Lord & Taylor video may be able to prove Tsarnaev's innocence at once by showing a dark-skinned male planting a black backpack on the patio of the Forum restaurant, 15 feet away from the place where Tsarnaev placed his bag. The defense must insist on obtaining it and may request to summon Thomas Menino and John King.
The Libertarian Party is trying to make a name this political season, which has disaffected some voters from the major political parties. Alex Merced believes a Libertarian option gives him an edge in a race against incumbent Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY).
Merced jumped in the race against Schumer in what he calls a “weird political year.” And he points to the ease of getting signatures to get on the ballot as a sign that this year will work to his advantage.
"We were able to get such a huge amount of signatures, over 32-thousand, which just goes to show you the demand for a third alternative, when basically the two major parties are asking you to choose between corruption and crazy,” said Merced.
Merced is facing Schumer, a Democrat running for his fourth term, who could also become Senate Majority leader in January, if Democrats win control of the Senate; and Wendy Long, a Manhattan Republican, who lost by a record margin two years ago, in a race against Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.
"You've got Chuck Schumer, who basically chooses his legislative action and proposals, based on what will get him in front of a camera, instead of what will benefit everybody, and then you've got Wendy Long, who's doubled down on anything Trump,” said Merced.
So Merced offers himself as what he calls “the candidate of reason.” The Libertarian Party in essence is the party of less government intervention. He says that means it can appeal to conservative Republicans who want to scale back the size of government, and liberal Democrats hoping to expand civil liberties. For example, he says his proposal for a 20 percent flat tax could appeal to both sides.
“To create sort of a huge simplification of the tax code, which will appeal to the right, but also some progressivity and social support that would appeal to the left that actually simplifies and reduces the size of government,” he said.
Merced says his positions on all the issues are explained in a series of YouTube videos on his website. He joins presidential candidate Gary Johnson as the two Libertarian candidates in statewide races. There are a smattering of other Libertarian candidates in some local races, mostly downstate. And while he won't admit that it would take a miracle to beat Schumer, he hopes his candidacy shows other Libertarians how to run a traditional political campaign.
“Regardless of what happens, this campaign will be a model to other Libertarian candidates going forward, of how we can be competitive, of how we can get the message out there, how we can be compelling and make our case.”

The man with whom he created that retail juggernaut, Costco co-founder and former CEO Jim Sinegal, said Tuesday that “over 35 years, he became not just a business partner but a confidante, a great friend. I'm not exaggerating for a second when I say I loved the guy.”
Mr. Brotman, 74, died in his sleep at his home in Medina, said his brother, Michel Brotman.
The cause of death wasn't immediately known. “We assume his heart just stopped working,” Michel Brotman said.
Mr. Brotman's death came as a “complete shock for everyone,” said Sinegal.
He said that on Monday night, Mr. Brotman had attended a dinner for about 2,000 Costco warehouse managers from around the world who are gathered this week at the Washington State Convention Center.
“You couldn't like Jeff. He would say things like: ‘I'm not going to let you get mad at me.' ” They had their disagreements, but Brotman's attitude was a key to their not staying angry at each other for longer than a day when they fought, Sinegal said.
The pair's complementary set of business skills also helped grow Costco into a global giant, with Sinegal overseeing operations and finances, and Mr. Brotman handling the real-estate moves.
“He became an expert” at choosing where new Costco warehouses should be located, Sinegal said — significant decisions as the company expanded to its current 736 warehouses across the U.S. and in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia.
They helped build Costco into one of the world's largest retailers, usually coming in No. 2 behind Wal-Mart. Last year, the Issaquah-based company generated revenue of nearly $119 billion.
The company did not say who would succeed Mr. Brotman as chairman of the board and did not respond to requests for comment. Sinegal said it was too early to say.
Jeff Brotman grew up in a retailing family in Tacoma. His father, Bernard Brotman, founded Bernie's Mens Wear in Tacoma, as well as Bottoms women's store and other retailers.
It was Bernard Brotman who came upon Price Club, a warehouse store serving small businesses that had opened in 1976 in San Diego, and told Mr. Brotman,“You should do this,” Michel Brotman recalled.
“Jeff understood immediately that there was an opening there,” he said. “The Price Club idea appealed even to people with money — the idea of being able to buy value at the right price. It wasn't about buying cheap. It was about buying good value.”
Mr. Brotman and Sinegal opened the first Costco warehouse in Seattle in 1983.
“On occasion, you will see a store run a loss-leader, where it reflects the same price as ours. But day after day, you can't find cheaper prices than here,” Mr. Brotman said in a 1983 Seattle Times story about the then-new warehouse store and its strategy.
Costco and Price Club merged in 1993, with the combined company generating $16 billion in annual sales at 206 locations, according to Costco.
“Jeff was not interested in just a store. He always thought much bigger than I did,” said Michel Brotman, who founded the Simply Seattle gift stores. “He wouldn't have been attracted to an idea that would've been limited to the Pacific Northwest. But I don't think he dreamed it would be this big.”
Mr. Brotman also supported other entrepreneurs. He was an early investor in Starbucks.
“I will miss Jeff immensely. He was a dear friend, mentor and a brother,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks' executive chairman, said in a statement. “He was one of the earliest believers and investors in Starbucks and in me.”
Schultz added that Mr. Brotman “has been a shining light in the community contributing so much to Seattle and the nation. We have lost a titan of our community.”
The philanthropic endeavors of Mr. Brotman and his wife, Susan, spanned the educational, medical and cultural sectors.
He was appointed as a regent to the University of Washington, where he earned his undergraduate and law degrees.
“With the passing of Jeff Brotman the University of Washington has lost one of its greatest volunteers and most accomplished and generous graduates,” UW President Ana Mari Cauce said in a statement. “His and Susan's principled and passionate leadership, coupled with their generosity — particularly in support of students and of advancements in medicine — have left a lasting impact on our University and all those we serve.
“Thousands of students were able to attend college and earn degrees thanks to the Costco Scholarship Fund, which he helped launch, and his dedicated support for UW Medicine, including his vital role in the development of the South Lake Union Campus, are just two examples of the many ways his heartfelt devotion will continue to change lives for years to come,” she said.
The Brotman and Sinegal families, along with Costco, have supported Seattle Children's hospital through the Friends of Costco Guild, according to HistoryLink.org.
Mr. Brotman and his wife have been major donors and served as trustees of the Seattle Art Museum and have been major donors to Pacific Northwest Ballet, where Susan serves as a trustee.
Mr. Brotman also gave nearly $1 million to Temple Beth El in Tacoma, where he grew up, to build a preschool and day care center, according to the The News Tribune in Tacoma.
The couple have been active in politics as major Democratic Party donors. Last year, they hosted a fundraiser at their Medina home for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. They also hosted President Barack Obama at a fundraiser in 2012.
“We are proud to have called him a Democrat,” U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, said in a statement. “He helped so many do great things in our state.”
In addition to his wife and brother, Mr. Brotman is survived by his son, Justin Brotman, of Seattle, daughter Amanda Brotman-Schetritt of New York City, and two grandchildren.
The family is determining when and where services will be held.
Royal Dutch Shell submitted a plan to the federal government on Thursday to try once again to explore for oil in the Alaskan Arctic, following years of legal and logistical setbacks as well as dogged opposition from environmentalists.
While the plan is just a first step in the process, it reflects the energy potential in the Arctic. Shell's proposed programs consist of two drilling rigs working simultaneously in the Chukchi Sea, which could produce more than 400,000 barrels of oil a day.
Shell emphasized that it had not made a final decision on whether to drill next summer. But it said that the filing with the Interior Department preserved its options.
The efforts, even in this preliminary stage, are likely to rankle environmentalists, who argue that drilling in the Arctic is overly risky because of ice floes, darkness in winter and the presence of several species of already threatened wildlife like polar bears. Several environmental groups were quick to say they would oppose Shell's latest plan, including with court challenges, if it receives government approval.

Over the last eight years, Shell's Alaskan Arctic efforts have been plagued by blunders and accidents involving ships and support equipment, reaching a climax with the grounding of one of its drilling vessels in late December 2012 in stormy seas. Environmental groups seized on the episodes as evidence to support their claims about the risks.
Shell, which has already spent about $6 billion on the effort, drilled two shallow wells in Alaska's Arctic during 2012. But the federal government did not allow Shell to reach the deeper, oil-bearing formations. The company did not have the equipment to contain spills after the testing failure of a containment dome designed to cap a runaway well and collect oil in case of an accident.
After Shell's problems, ConocoPhillips and the Norwegian oil giant Statoil suspended their Alaskan Arctic drilling plans.
Shell's plans for the Alaskan Arctic had looked doubtful since Ben van Beurden took over as the company's new chief executive nearly nine months ago. Mr. van Beurden pledged to increase discipline on rising costs and improve cash flow. Under his guidance, the company has begun to sell off underperforming natural gas and oil fields around the United States while stepping up production from its deep water Brazilian and Gulf of Mexico oil wells. Profit is improving, though Shell's investments in Russia could be at risk if Western sanctions tighten.
The company announced in January that it would not make an effort to drill in Alaska this summer, given the legal obstacles. A federal appeals court had ruled that the Interior Department's environmental impact review was flawed when it sold Shell over $2 billion in oil leases in the Chukchi Sea.
But in recent weeks, Shell has shown renewed interest in its Alaska efforts by signing an agreement with several Alaska Native corporations to share profits from offshore drilling. Wall Street analysts said Shell could not afford to watch other companies succeed elsewhere in the Russian and Canadian Arctic and not participate in the future drilling.
“These people are paid to play and not to watch,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “After all the hiccups and bad luck, the company has decided that the upside potential is greater than the downside risk and its worth another shot.”
The Alaskan Arctic is one of the great untapped frontiers for offshore drilling in the United States, with the potential to produce up to a million barrels a day, according to industry experts. But Alaska has suffered a long decline in its oil production because of the aging of its onshore fields and underinvestment.
Gov. Sean Parnell pushed a tax overhaul supported by the oil industry through the Alaska Legislature last year, and this month beat back a ballot referendum effort intended to return the state to its old tax regime. With new tax breaks and incentives, the industry has pledged to invest more in Alaska's oil fields.
Still, Shell faces many hurdles in its renewed efforts. The Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management must redo the original inadequate environmental impact assessment by the spring, when Arctic waters begin to open and Shell can start to move its drilling and support vessels into position.
A coalition of environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Earthjustice, is preparing to challenge a new assessment if reaches a similar conclusion to the previous one. A legal challenge, even if its ultimately unsuccessful, could mean more delays for drilling.
“Drilling in the Arctic makes no more sense in 2015 than it did when it was first proposed,” said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental activist group.
Shell will also need to have its exploration plan approved by the Interior Department. A Shell spokesman, Curtis Smith, said that the new plan had fortified safety features, including new tugboats, an extra helicopter, additional offshore supply vessels and better management of contractors.
“All to say we've taken a critical look at the experiences we've had in Alaska over the last several years and this exploration plan takes those learnings into account,” he added.
Environmentalists are similarly expected challenge any approval of those plans. Shell's separate spill response plan, submitted earlier, is also currently being contested in a federal appeals court based in San Francisco.
“Anyone who has been following this story knows Shell is not Arctic-ready,” said Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, which was highly critical of Shell's planning. “And more importantly, the Arctic will never be Shell-ready.”
Looks like we're scheduled to endure another round of hype about Iran's nuclear program. David Sanger writes in today's New York Times about an imminent IAEA report.
International nuclear inspectors will soon report that Iran has installed hundreds of new centrifuges in recent months and may also be speeding up production of nuclear fuel while negotiations with the United States and its allies have ground to a near halt, according to diplomats and experts briefed on the findings. Almost all of the new equipment is being installed in a deep underground site on a military base near Qum that is considered virtually invulnerable to military attack. It would suggest that a boast by senior Iranian leaders late last month — that the country had added upward of 1,000 new machines to its installation despite Western sabotage — may be true. The report will also indicate, according to the officials familiar with its contents, that Iran is increasingly focused on enriching uranium to a level of 20 percent — a purity that it says it needs for a specialty nuclear reactor that it insists is used only for medical purposes, but that outside experts say gets it most of the way to the level needed to produce a workable nuclear bomb. The report does not attempt to address the question of whether Iran has made a decision to build a nuclear weapon; American intelligence officials believe it has not, and Iran insists it wants to use nuclear power for peaceful ends.
I suppose there's some solace to be taken in the highlighted portion. After hearing about it from readers, the Times reports on Iran now stress that the consensus of the US intelligence community states that they have not determined whether or not to build a nuclear weapon, nor have they restarted their nuclear program. This so rarely gets highlighted as part of the discussion around Iran that it's a kind of success that it made its way into the bottom of paragraph number 3.
Sanger also indicates that it would take years to develop a weapon from a standing start like this. But this will not matter to the lords of saber-rattling, who we will hear from over the next couple months, against the backdrop of the US Presidential election. Chatter in Israel has already picked up about Iran's nuclear capabilities, which exist outside of whether they have an active nuclear weapons program. And this IAEA report will fuel that speculation.
Diplomatic talks between Iran and Western powers have basically ended. The sanctions are in place and they continue to constrict the Iranian economy. Neoconservatives who view every potential international crisis as an opportunity for more bomb-dropping will certainly put together the stalled talks and this report as a signal that Israel must strike and that the US must back them. We're closing in on some very dangerous territory.
One of the most tragic and harrowing chapters of the WWII was the siege of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, which lasted for almost 900 days. RT spoke to the survivors who unveiled the horrors of the deadliest siege in the history of warfare.
For 872 days, from September 8, 1941 till January 27, 1944 people in the Russian city of Leningrad were encircled by Nazi forces, cut off from the rest of the country with no food or vital supplies.
Though the total death toll is still unclear, estimates of the victims from the siege vary, with some numbering up to 1.5 million civilians.
Svetlana, one of the survivors of the Leningrad siege was only 7 years old when the war broke out. Speaking to RT's Madina Kochinova, she recalls her first encounter with death when she found her aunt frozen on the street.
“She was lying with her head looking that way,” Svetlana said to RT's Kochinova, showing the spot where she had found her relative. “Her feet, they looked so scary, so black because of the cold.”
The city was heavily bombed while people were dying of starvation and extreme cold. The winter of 1941-42 saw temperatures plunge to 40C below zero. With no heating the entire water supply network had frozen solid. The only solution was to collect water from holes in ice in the frozen Neva River.
“People wander around the city holding empty buckets search for water. There is no water, the pipes are frozen…” wrote Lubov Shaporina in a diary entry on January 6, 1942.
People endured severe food shortages: a strict rationing system was in effect in the city, with individual daily food consumption limited to around 125 grams of bread.
“The horror of the siege was how death became routine, in winter '41-'42 people just collapsed and died on the streets,” Oleg Bushuev, the siege survivor, said according to iremember.ru website dedicated to WWII.
Tatyana Korsakova, now 78, lived under the blockade for two years. In an interview with RT she recalls that death was in the air in the city.
“As spring came we went to the bridge over Fontanka river. And from there we saw corpses floating down the river. And for some reason the kids including me were neither scared of the corpses nor disgusted. It was just a fact of the reality we were living in.”

At one point the death toll peaked at 150,000 people a day, with those still alive forced to eat pets, rats or glue. Many people were driven to madness, while some resorted to cannibalism.
“Cases of cannibalism started to appear. You walk down the street and you see a corpse, you walk back and see there is piece missing,” wrote Klavdiya Naumovna in a diary entry on February 22, 1942.
Women and children were being attacked. People kidnapped children “to eat them,” Svetlana told RT. “It did take place. Everyone knew about it.”
As Hitler's army surrounded the area of around 5,000 square kilometers, cutting almost all road links to the city, the only way for supplies to reach the population was via a narrow and dangerous road on the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga - it became known as the "Road of Life."
"Vehicles drove along one and the same track, and the ice became very thin and worn out, so we had to watch the traffic and the ice condition. The ice was repaired manually: we drilled holes and carried water to pour on the ice road. All the while the Germans were bombing us,” Vera Rogova, who served as a traffic officer on the Road of Life, told RT.

Another witness of the siege, Svetlana Magaeva, said Nazi planes were constantly bombing the trucks on the lake, many of which were carrying children.
"They didn't care that those were the Red Cross trucks. In winter, the headlights of those drowned trucks were glowing and glowing until they finally went off. And in summer, we often saw children's caps in the water,” Magaeva recalled in her book of memoirs.
People looked for symbols to give them hope. Amid the suffering, people could hear the persistent beat of the so-called Leningrad metronome. It became a symbol of the people's resistance to the siege. Broadcast through 1,500 speakers, a slow beat meant retreat, while a fast beat warned of an air raid.
Another symbol of resistance and the will to victory was the legendary 7th Symphony composed by Dmitry Shostakovich who witnessed the horrific siege in the first year of the war.
"My 7th Symphony was based on the formidable events of 1941," the composer said on an archive tape. "I dedicated my composition to the struggle against fascism, our forthcoming victory and my native city of Leningrad."
The blockade of Leningrad is described as deliberate genocide by some historians. Over half a million people are buried in the Piskaryovskoe Memorial Cemetery, which is the main resting place for its victims.
“The blockade was sudden and unexpected, as much as the war itself was unexpected for the country. There were no reserves of fuel, no food...” the siege witness, Russian writer Daniil Granin said in his speech at the German parliament in 2014.

Max Burkholder as Max Braverman, Ray Romano as Hank Rizzoli in “Parenthood.” (Photo by: Jordin Althaus/NBC)
The six Braverman families at the heart of “Parenthood,” Jason Katims's family drama, which is now in its sixth and final season, initially looked like a kind of liberal ideal. In adorable craftsmen houses and in small apartments, the Bravermans raised interracial families and a boy with Asperger syndrome. The clan included stay-at-home dads, single moms and corporate-drones-turned-recording-studio heads. “Parenthood” may have been a sly endorsement of conservative visions of self-reliance and strong families, but it was also overwhelmingly, unrelentingly a reflection of its Berkeley, California setting.
And as “Parenthood,” a show I have loved, draws to a close, that ethos is driving me slowly nuts. “Parenthood” has become everything that conservatives love to parody about liberal culture: myopic and obsessed with self-actualization to the point of doing real damage to others.
Most of my problems center around Adam (Peter Krause) and Kristina (Monica Potter). For the first few seasons, they seemed like the most stable leg of the zany Braverman table. They raised their son (Max Burkholder) with patience and good cheer after he received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, and if meant that their daughter Haddie (Sarah Ramos) occasionally got short shrift, the atmosphere in their house was such that she grew up in a dignified, smart young woman nonetheless.
But my affection for Adam and Kristina began to curdle last season.
After recovering from breast cancer, Kristina decided to run for mayor of Berkeley against her old consulting client, Bob Little (Jonathan Tucker). “Parenthood” might have tried to build a compelling case for her candidacy based on her past work experience, but instead, the show and her campaign treated her new zeal for life and her experience parenting Max as if they were credentials enough to run a city of more than 100,000 people. And both Kristina and “Parenthood” seemed to decide that Bob was some sort of bad person because he had previously dated Kristina's niece Amber (Mae Whitman), who might have been younger than him, but was certainly of age. “Parenthood” treated the mayorality not like a serious job, but like an appropriate reward for Kristina's fortitude.
This year, Adam and Kristina went ahead and opened a charter school, once again with parenting Max as their main qualification. And as Max develops a crush on his fellow student Dylan (Ally Ioannides), “Parenthood” has shown Adam and Kristina make a series of terrible mistakes that makes it impossible to trust them as school administrators and much harder to watch them without cringing in utter agony at their lack of self-awareness.
Max, perhaps not surprisingly given his diagnosis, turns to pick-up artist techniques to figure out how to approach Dylan. I understand why Adam and Kristina want to encourage him to develop social skills and to follow up on his feelings. But as both parents and school executives, they end up demonstrating an appalling lack of respect for the rights of other students, and in this week's episode, they essentially got away with doing so.
When Max distributed flyers all over school, smearing another boy who Dylan had become involved with, Kristina gave him a talking-to, completely ignoring that she had two other students who had just been shamed by her son. In another bid for attention, Max declared his affection for Dylan in the lunchroom, a gesture that had the effect of making Dylan feel an enormous amount of pressure. Kristina's reaction was to congratulate him for his bravery in expressing his feelings, leaving Dylan alone in the cafeteria.
And this week, Kristina brushed off Dylan's frantic requests to partner with someone other than Max for a school project. Max took the opportunity to pressure Dylan about dating him yet again.” “Is it because I haven't demonstrated my physical affection and am now in the friend zone?” he demanded to know, trying to touch Dylan as she pushed him off, panicked, just as a group of visiting parents showed up.
Dylan's parents are right to be furious about Max's behavior and Adam and Kristina's obliviousness and insistence that the whole thing is just a misunderstanding or a “complication.”
“Which complication are you referring to?” Dylan's father demands to know. “Are you referring to when he distributed a bunch of malicious flyers all over the school about another student? Or the violence he threatened the boy with? Or maybe it was one of the tons of unwanted gifts he's been publicly bestowing on our daughter?” Watching Adam lash out at them, characterizing their reaction as “a couple of absentee parents trying to blame somebody else for their own oblivion because you haven't been home. You haven't been watching your daughter”, made me feel physically ill.
But “Parenthood” is so solidly Team Braverman that it cannot assign Adam, Kristina and Max any really serious consequences. Dylan, despite her awful experience, begs Kristina to make the case to her parents that she should not have to switch schools. Her parents end up apologizing to Adam and Kristina and accepting Adam's diagnosis of their parenting. Max is obviously upset by the prospect that he has been harassing Dylan: “Harassment is defined as aggressive or intimidating pressure. I was only trying to do nice things,” he explains to his parents. But even though Adam and Kristina bring over Max to apologize to Dylan, they also reassure him that he was not harassing her.
I understand the impulse to treat a character like Max with kindness–he is a child, and he was following a set of instructions, partially provided by his parents, that are dangerous precisely because they obscure nuance and consent.
But “Parenthood” could have made a sharper point that Max's actions, no matter his intentions, did constitute harassment and make Dylan physically uncomfortable, and there ought to be consequences beyond a conversation. At a moment when pick-up culture and the language of sexual entitlement is having serious real-world implications, watching the Bravermans prioritize their son's comfort over Dylan's safety reveals the limits of their goodness. If I was sure “Parenthood” meant that to be the takeaway, I might be impressed. But that would run counter to everything Katims has taught us about the Bravermans over the previous five seasons.
And it's genuinely disturbing to see Adam and Kristina get to go on as before despite the fact that they have effectively used a bunch of other students as objects in their ongoing project to help Max acclimate to the world. They never seemed qualifed to run a school, and now that they have demonstrated it, “Parenthood” might have considered letting them really fail, instead of just have yet another obstacle over which they emerge triumphant and flush with self-esteem.
Adam and Kristina may be the Bravermans who most make me wish to set my own hair on fire, but “Parenthood” is not doing other members of their extended family any favors, either.
Crosby Braverman (Dax Shepherd) is only now emerging from his extended adolescence. But the cause of his revelation is not exactly admirable. He recognizes that his hope that big bands will just spontaneously to record at his studio, the Luncheonette, is just a fantasy only when his wife Jasmine (Joy Bryant) has to take a square's gig as a file clerk to make ends meet, rather than pursuing an artistic dream job. In Braverman-land, it's a failure to self-actualize that is the biggest tragedy.
And Crosby and Adam's niece Amber is also in a quandary that “Parenthood” has handled in a weird cavalier way. Their failure to build their business means that Amber is facing the loss of her job as she prepares to become a single mother to her baby with her ex-fiancé.
“Parenthood” had a very effective episode that highlighted just how unprepared Amber was for motherhood. Left to babysit Max and his younger sister Nora (played alternately by Mia and Ellen Allen), everything melts down. Amber realizes she does not even have a car seat, much less room in her tiny studio, for a child. That might have been the beginning of a productive multi-episode plot where Amber reckons with her decision to continue the pregnancy and with the other choices that have left her economically precarious. But “Parenthood” cannot afford to pay all their actors to be in all their episodes, and it has a lot to wrap up over its final shortened season. Some Braxton Hicks contractions aside, “Parenthood” does not seem to have a lot of time for Amber's troubles.
The thing that would make the Bravermans annoying in real life–their blitheness and extreme comfort–also leeches the stakes out of a lot of their stories. Time and the vicissitudes of the heart still make for effective enemies, and it is no mistake that patriarch Zeek Braverman's (Craig T. Nelson) struggles to accept his failing health, and Joel and Julia Braverman-Graham's (Sam Jaeger and Erika Christensen) struggles to decide whether to end their marriage or repair it has been the high points of this season. But nothing else can touch the Bravermans. They will always be fine, no matter how they treat anyone else. That makes it hard to worry about them–and hard to root for them, too.
I was pleasantly surprised by ASUS' Eee Pad Transformer. In a sea of clones, ASUS managed to produce the first Honeycomb tablet that was truly different in more than just styling and software preload. As the first PC maker to build a Honeycomb tablet, ASUS brought some new perspective to the game - which had previously been dominated by players from the smartphone industry.
From a hardware standpoint, the Eee Pad Transformer was nothing new. Its mostly plastic construction helped keep costs down but ASUS managed to get the overall device to feel pretty decent, aside from some creaking. The form factor itself was quite pleasant, the Eee Pad felt good to hold. Internally driven by NVIDIA's Tegra 2 SoC, performance and battery life were similar to other Honeycomb tablets we'd reviewed. Not as good as the iPad 2, but still better than most notebooks/netbooks. ASUS also shopped at the right places for the display panel: its quality and characteristics rivaled those of the iPad 2. In fact our only real complaint about the Eee Pad was that its display was far too glossy. It's not a huge problem indoors but held up against rival Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 or the iPad 2 and it is distracting.
By avoiding an aluminum chassis, ASUS was able to build and sell the Eee Pad for $399 - making it the cheapest Honeycomb tablet on the market today. Price alone isn't what ASUS was leaning on however. The real selling point of the Eee Pad is its ability to transform into a 10.1-inch netbook via an optional keyboard+battery dock. With a street price of $150 and often available in more affordable bundles, the dock gave us a peak at one potential future of computing. As a standalone tablet the Eee Pad held its own against the competition, but when docked it became virtually indistinguishable from a high-end PC. Apps like Polaris Office give you access to read/write Word and Excel documents, while the full keyboard and mouse make typing long emails or even articles so much better. It's not the perfect PC replacement as a number of file types are still not supported (Polaris won't let you so much as view a .pptx file) but it's amazingly competent for an OS with its roots in smartphones. The extra battery life you get from the dock was also much appreciated. As a glorified typewriter, the combination would easily last you on a flight from California to Japan (or LA to Taiwan like I'm on today). The solution has potential, but it also has problems.
I ran into a number of hiccups with the setup in my review of it last month. Some of the issues were of course due to the early nature of Honeycomb, while others were just problems with ASUS' implementation. Just yesterday ASUS gave me a drop of the OTA (over the air) update that's coming to all Eee Pad users on Monday. This update will give the Eee Pad Android 3.1, the long-awaited point release to Honeycomb that is supposed to fix bugs, improve performance and even enable some new functionality. Xoom owners got access to the update earlier this month thanks to it being Google's launch device for Honeycomb, but ASUS isn't far behind.
I haven't had a lot of time with the update but I wanted to go over some of the enhancements and give you Eee Pad users a preview of what's to come on Monday.
Improved 3D Performance
Just as we have different CPU/GPU configurations for notebooks and desktops, in the future I'm expecting to see different SoCs targeted at smartphones and tablets. Today however, the two share a common architecture with most SoCs optimized for the larger portion of the market - smartphones. The current one-size-fits-all approach has consequences for tablets. NVIDIA's Tegra 2 for example is clearly built for smartphones with either a 800 x 480 or 960 x 540 display resolution, however it's used in tablets running at 1280 x 800. With nearly twice as many pixels to render it's not surprising that while the Tegra 2 performs exceptionally well on a smartphone, its 3D performance suffers on a high resolution tablet. It's no different than buying a PC video card - a GPU that performs well on a 1680 x 1050 display may not be able to drive a 2560 x 1440 display.
In our first Honeycomb review I complained that some UI animations and transitions lacked the smoothness that I expected from a fully GPU accelerated UI. Google argued that part of the reason was the display resolution, but it also conceded that there was still room for improvement in drivers. Android 3.1 gives us that improvement.
The performance impact is easily seen in our standard 3D benchmarks. Let's start with GLBenchmark 2.0:
The Egypt benchmark saw a 54% increase in performance. I don't doubt that some of this performance improvement was NVIDIA simply optimizing for the benchmark, but a lot of it translates into real world performance improvements as well.
GLBenchmark PRO doesn't show any increase in performance by comparison, perhaps indicating that we'll see a greater increase in OpenGL ES 2.0 workloads.
We've added two new tests to the suite from Rightware: Taiji and Hover from the BaseMark ES2.0 suite (basically the updated version of 3DMarkMobile):
3D performance improves in both tests by 24% and 10% respectively.
The impact on GPU performance isn't limited to just 3D games, the Honeycomb UI is now noticeably quicker. Everything is snappier, which implies more than just a GPU performance improvement but the other part of that is an improvement in UI frame rate. Swiping between home screens is pretty similar to 3.0.1, but the experience is far more consistent. While 3.0.1 was more likely to chop, 3.1 seems to be more resistant to slowdowns that impact UI speed. Renegade background apps can still ruin the experience - caching songs from Google Music in the background made the Eee Pad extremely slow.
Calling up the app launcher is still not smooth, but boy is it smoother/faster than before. Even details like the circle animation when you unlock the device are smoother on 3.1.
The iPad 2 still does a better overall job of giving the UI thread high priority and keeping the interface running at full frame rate, but Android 3.1 takes a step in the right direction. If you were unhappy with the UI experience on 3.0.1, the experience with 3.1 is a lot better but still not perfect. If you were happy with 3.0.1 however, prepare to be even happier.
Alcatraz is a term deeply ingrained in our cultural consciousness as a source of mystery and curiosity, so it seems fitting that J.J. Abrams and Elizabeth Sarnoff, two of the genius minds behind the equally enigmatic "Lost," would choose to tackle the iconic island for another high-concept TV series. "Alcatraz" (premiering Mon., Jan. 16, 8 p.m. EST on Fox) might be lacking smoke monsters and polar bears, but there are still plenty of questions to be answered, as HuffPost TV discovered when we visited the Vancouver-based set in October.
The show's story begins in March 1963, when history tells us the prison was closed due to unmanageable operating costs and the erosion of buildings from years of salt water exposure. But in the world of "Alcatraz," the true reason for the closure is far more compelling: 302 prisoners and guards mysteriously vanish without a trace, only to reappear in our time without having aged. An unlikely team -- Alcatraz historian and comic book writer Doctor Diego Soto (Jorge Garcia), police detective Rebecca Madsen (Sarah Jones) and government agent Emerson Hauser (Sam Neill) -- must work together to capture the returned inmates and discover the truth behind their disappearance.
The series was conceived by Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt, former "Kyle XY" writers, who sold the concept to Abrams' Bad Robot production company. But Sarnoff, who has now stepped down as showrunner, took another stab at the story before shopping around to the networks.
Another "Lost" alum, Jack Bender, serves as executive producer, and he was on hand to answer reporters' questions during the group set visit. On the surface, the two island-based shows share similar DNA -- and not just because of Abrams and Garcia. But Bender insisted that "Alcatraz" is designed to be more accessible than its predecessor.
"I think the networks are certainly afraid of the mythology of the show overpowering an audience's potential to come aboard the train if they've missed a few [episodes]," he said. "I think that our show is going to walk that fine line, hopefully, because each week there is going to be a story unfolding that begins and ends. And there's still this overreaching, 'What happened? How the hell did this happen? What's going on?' vibe to the show that will be, season by season, revealed in a slow fashion so that the mystery stays alive and well."
Mystery series are somewhat dependent on the cast and crew's ability to keep a secret, and Abrams has arguably created a whole sub-genre of television show that's designed to keep the audience guessing, from "Alias" and "Lost" to "Fringe" and "Person of Interest." "Alcatraz" will be no exception.
Garcia, who shot to fame as the lovable Hurley on "Lost," told The Huffington Post that he's become accustomed to not knowing anything about his character's backstory -- and that he knows better than to ask. "I've gotten used to working this way from having done a show with these people before," he said. "I enjoy having to fill in my own blanks at the beginning. If stuff gets revealed later, even if it seems contradictory, I always feel that contradiction is what makes us people. So when you behave in a way that's not how people would have expected, it's a very human way to behave. So I've always enjoyed those moments myself as an actor."
While Garcia admitted that his new character on "Alcatraz" has his humorous moments, fans shouldn't expect Hurley 2.0 from Doc Soto. "It's fun finding a new guy. I'm digging what they've been writing for me," he said. "I wear a lot more clothes than on 'Lost' -- I've been doing that and I did that for six years; now let's explore somebody new and go see where I would go with it a different way."
Though Garcia and Neill's characters are integral parts of the story, Detective Rebecca Madsen is our true entry point to the mystery. She's a Scully-esque skeptic whose family history is inexorably linked to the prison. Sarah Jones has appeared in numerous guest spots and recurring roles (most notably in "Big Love" and "Sons of Anarchy"), but "Alcatraz" marks her first experience as the lead.
Jones described the show as a "procedural hybrid" that balances the weekly mysteries with added character development and ongoing mythology. In terms of her character, Jones said: "It's about her journey into a very new phase, a new chapter in her life that connects her to her past that she didn't know about before. Her world is basically turned upside down in the pilot and [the show] follows her through trying to put the pieces together, while she's catching the worst of the worst coming back and wreaking havoc on the good people of America."
Though Sam Neill wasn't on set during The Huffington Post's visit, his co-star helped shed a little light on Neill's cryptic Emerson Hauser, a member of a shadowy government agency who seems to know far more about the secrets of Alcatraz than he's letting on.
"There's definitely secrets he's keeping from them," Garcia admitted. "He lets stuff out, but really lets it out in a very thin trickle. It's not like a big idea of you become president and then go, 'All right, let me show you what's in the secret closet where the aliens are.' It becomes very need-to-know with him, because he's old-school G-man."
Luckily Rebecca and Doc have each other when Hauser's being guarded. "It's us against Hauser sometimes, very much," Garcia said. "I think we have this kind of relationship where we look out for each other. She does the ass kicking stuff; I do the vagrant. But we also try to watch each other's back. We know that we have to deal with Hauser -- and Hauser's not going to always give us a lot of information, so there are sometimes moments where we just find ourselves having to be in cahoots with each other, I think."
Jones agreed, adding: "I really like what the writers have done with their relationship. ... I like that Rebecca is not quick to trust people. There's very few people in her life that she allows herself to get close to and trust and I like that the writers aren't so quick to make Rebecca and Doc best friends. There's a relationship that's built and sometimes they have a moment together and sometimes she pushes him away; but that's something I'm really grateful to the writers for, because it allows Doc and Rebecca to actually get to know each other and learn how to trust each other."
Unlike Garcia, Jones is new to working with Abrams' closely-guarded plot turns, so she's still trying to figure out the show's central mystery: Where did the inmates disappear to?
"A part of each episode is that you get a little bit closer to finding out why these guys are here: Where did they come from, who's running it, you know?" she said. "I don't even know yet -- I'm trying to figure it out. I've got my own theories about it with a bit of the clues that we get every episode, but I'm sure they're not right. I'm sure I'll be way off and have no idea what I was talking about!"
Bigwig: an important or influential person; someone of a high status
Origin:
The term bigwig originated in the 17th century, when the short lived fad of wig-wearing (1) was at its peak. It became fashionable for people to shave their heads (2) and replace their hair with wigs; in this way they could sport a style they might not be able to naturally grow. It was seen as a triumph of man's ingenuity over nature. However hair to make up these wigs was quite rare and expensive. Hair was sold by the strand and it was not uncommon for the lower classes to be seen wearing wigs consisting of only several strands of hair. The rich folk on the other hand were able to purchase large wigs made up of thousands of strands of hair and very soon the term ‘bigwig' became associated with the very wealthy. This fad faded away as quickly as it had come with the advent of the top hat, however it lives on in the large ceremonial wigs seen in the British courts.
Footnotes:
1 – “Wig” is actually a slang term, which originated as a sarcastic name for early proto-wigs which were made of straw, and looked very similar to wigs made of twigs.
2 – The term ‘buzz cut' for a shaved head has its origins here. People would have to shave their heads in order to wear wigs, and since this was the popular thing to do at the time it was called the ‘buzz' cut.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — President Barack Obama's health care overhaul has never been popular in Arkansas, a state where even most Democrats regard the law as politically toxic.
But with a quarter of the state's working-age population uninsured, a governor who once said he would have voted against the law now wants to use it to widen government-funded coverage to thousands of additional families. And he's relying on the move to help prevent a Republican takeover of the state Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction.
Gov. Mike Beebe, the first Southern governor to back the law's expansion of Medicaid, has become an unlikely advocate for a central part of the overhaul that would expand Medicaid, a position made easier by the fact that he's not seeking re-election.
"I think it's good for our people because it's helping folks that don't have insurance now that are working their tails off," said Beebe, who is barred by term limits from running again. "They're not sitting on a couch somewhere asking for something."
Two years ago, as the health care debate raged in Washington, Beebe said he wanted the president to focus more on the economy and even declared that he would not have voted for the bill if he were in Congress.
But it passed, and federal officials assured Beebe that the state could drop the expanded Medicaid coverage later if it wanted to. That's when the governor announced his support.
Beebe and other Arkansas Democrats are counting on voters to feel the same way. They say the benefits of a government program that helps so much of the state's population should outweigh any animosity toward the president.
If approved, the expansion would offer coverage to everyone making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. That works out to about $15,400 for an individual or $30,650 for a family of four. Most of those who would be added to the Medicaid rolls are low-income adults without children.
Debbie Willhite, a Little Rock Democratic consultant, said it's a "no-brainer" for legislative candidates to run on the expansion.
"We are a very poor state, and nobody needs to be told that. We have an incredible population that is underserved by health care," Willhite said. "Anything that expands that is going to help individuals and help the economy."
Under the law, the federal government agreed to pay the full tab for the Medicaid expansion when it begins in 2014. After three years, states must pay a gradually increasing share that tops out at 10 percent of the cost.
When it upheld the health care law back in June, the Supreme Court said the federal government could not take away states' existing federal Medicaid dollars if they refused to widen eligibility.
The expansion still faces a tough road in Arkansas. Approval will require a three-fourths vote in both the state House and Senate, a number that would be difficult to reach even with the current Democratic majorities.
Beebe has said he thinks lawmakers will support expanding eligibility when they see the broad benefits. The state Department of Human Services has estimated expanding the state's Medicaid rolls by 250,000 people will save the state $372 million over the next several years. Republicans have expressed skepticism about that figure, noting that it factors in savings from other parts of the federal health overhaul.
Republicans have questioned whether the state — which is expected to have a shortfall of up to $400 million in its Medicaid program next year — can afford the additional cost of expanded Medicaid coverage when the state begins to pay more.
"How can you put 250,000 people on a program and then turn around and kick them off?" said Rep. Bruce Westerman, the top Republican in the state House. "In reality, that doesn't happen with government programs."
The GOP is using Beebe's support of the expansion to link the popular governor to Obama. One release issued by the state party after the governor's announcement was headlined: "The Beebe Agenda: Implement Obamacare."
"It's clear Gov. Beebe's agenda is to implement Obamacare and stick the state with a bill we can't afford when he skips out of office in two years," Arkansas Republican Party spokeswoman Katherine Vasilos said in the statement.
It's a familiar criticism for a party that saw its ranks in the state Legislature thinned in a 2010 election that hinged primarily on the president's unpopularity. Now Democrats are trying desperately to maintain their majority, which the party has successfully defended since this former Confederate state emerged from the aftermath of the Civil War.
In late October, every year, without fail, a group of well-meaning people (men) in mainline denominations go into an official state of mourning because the anniversary of the Protestant Reformation is fast approaching. They bemoan (this particular) schism in the church. They talk a lot about Christian Unity (preferably with people who vote the same way they do).
This October is going to be especially difficult for them, because it marks the 500th Anniversary of the Reformation. Sad.
Meanwhile, the Rev. Mrs. Condon (wife of the Rev. Mr. Condon) will be somewhere all:
I first noticed this we-don't-feel-good-about-the-Reformation gang when I was in seminary. They would correctively tell me that the Reformation “wasn't something we should be celebrating” because the church should never have split. Oh, “progressive” dudes, arbitrators of what I am supposed to celebrate. Y'all are the most fun. And by most fun, I mean, PLEASE STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.
Here's the deal banana peel: I would not be ordained if it were not for the Protestant Reformation. Period. I wouldn't be married to my husband either.
When I gently remind the all-knowing Reformation Haters of this fact they've apparently forgotten (#somepriestshaveboobs), they jump to reassure me, “Oh of course! I love women's ordination!”
Wow. Thanks brother. You're an amazing feminist.
Oftentimes, we look back on history and wonder, what would have happened if x historical event had never taken place. Guess what? When it comes to women's ordination and married clergy, we know what would have happened. We still wouldn't be ordained! And my husband would either be single or in another job. It's like an Outlander episode where we know how everything works out.
'Cause, while I love me some Pope Francis, he is not eager to have me wear my collared dress and high heels behind one of those Catholic Church altars. Also, obvious from a local visit to your Catholic Church, priests would still be celibate. Whenever men tell me how sad they are about the Reformation, I begin to wonder about things that are not my business.
*clears throat*
Funny thing about all of that. Before the Reformation, clergy did have women that they lived with, made love to, and made babies with. And those women were called concubines when people were being nice and whores when they were not. Those women were often ostracized. They were regularly denied midwives when they gave birth. Call me crazy, but as someone who is married to a priest, I feel like our current situation is better?
Also, we have actual records of Martin Luther's wife, Katharina, interjecting herself into his theological Table Talks. Which means I stand in a long, proud line of clergy wives who do the important work of telling our husbands when to “reign in it.” This alone would be a real win for Christianity.
But let's just say that none of the above registers with your life.
Well then. There is this other thing that happened in the Reformation. And it is Good News too good to deny. People began to hear the message of God's Grace clearly. The Bible was translated into native tongues. The church began to teach children the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer. We learned that we had never been justified by our works. Believers were reminded afresh that we are only forgiven through the redeeming work of the Cross.
This sounds so obvious to us now. But 500 years ago, such Gospel truth was highly obscured if not forbidden.
Which brings me to the final aspect of my love for the Reformation:
God is Sovereign. And sometimes he asks us to burn it all down.
God tells Noah to get everybody on a boat because the flood is coming. He gifts Deborah with the military orders that save her people. God tells Jeremiah to warn Judah and Jerusalem of their impending doom.
God binds up and loosens as He pleases. Jesus heals on the Sabbath, breaks bread with notorious sinners, and strikes up watercooler conversations with the town floozy.
When we start feeling regretful about the Reformation, we miss out on what God has done. Besides, it is ill advised to look over our shoulders and wonder what might have been—unless you like being a pillar of salt. History tells us that when the Reformation took place the state of the church felt beyond repair. Christians were doing unspeakable things in the name of Jesus.
So, God burned it down His own self. Because make no mistake, Martin Luther had no intention of turning the church on its head when he nailed the 95 Theses to the door of a church on October 31, 1517. That was God's work in the world. We'd be wise not to badmouth it.
But what do I know? I'm just a sinner/saint/mother/wife/ladypriest who loves the Protestant Reformation.
Planned Obsolescence: A Lament for Quality Amid a World of Junk
Our family recently camped for a week in a nearby state forest where our most trusted item was a cast-iron frying pan. Its thickness distributes heat evenly. Nothing can harm it. The wrong kind of spatula won't scratch some special non-stick coating.With simple care, it will last for a thousand years. Which reminded me how rare that combination of high quality and durability is today.
Most everything else I own is junk and seems to be designed that way. Here are several anecdotal examples:
In the old days, most Americans rented phones from the phone company (“Ma Bell”). My parents still own one, now over 30 years old, that survived raising three boys. These phones lasted forever. Meanwhile, Ma Bell was broken up in the 1980s. One engineer who worked for the phone company before and after the breakup told me of how the engineers were gathered together and given new ground rules: “It was all well and good in the old days to make phones with gold-plated contacts. But now it's different. Here's how to make the newer phones…” I think back on this comment as I watch one phone after another die, often after a few months.
I once helped my uncle select a new laser printer for his small business. The printer was a Laserjet 5 made by Hewlett-Packard. That was 15 years ago; the printer still works beautifully. It is made of metal and feels robust. In contrast, current printers, whether from HP or anyone else, feel like plastic junk. Whenever I open a compartment on my current printer, I worry that I will snap off a piece of the case and break it beyond repair.
Many iPhone models cannot have their battery replaced.
My less anecdotal example is textbooks. A standard introductory college physics textbook is Young and Freedman's University Physics. Why is it in its 12th edition? In the 55 years since it was first published, has introductory college physics changed so significantly and so frequently? Hardly. Almost every idea taught in introductory physics has remained unchanged since the 1930s when quantum mechanics was developed. Indeed, the masterwork in this genre, Feynman's famous Lectures on Physics was published in 1964 and is still mostly in its original form (there are two newer editions incorporating corrections provided by readers worldwide).
The reason for the 12 editions of Young and Freedman's University Physics, as for most textbooks today, is planned obsolescence. Textbook publication contracts usually have a clause roughly along the following lines:
You agree to revise the book upon written request from us (the publisher). If you do not agree, we may select an author and pay them from your royalties. The payment will not exceed 25 percent of the royalties for the first revision, 50 percent for the second revision, and 75 for the third revision (and all the royalties for fourth and subsequent revisions).
The original author may be unwilling to do a revision, either because he or she has died or otherwise has no time. The publisher invites another author to make the revision, and voila, a new edition with a longer author list is created.
Best of all, the new edition is not available on the used-book market! Therein lies the publisher's reason for the new edition: to force students to buy a new book rather than to “recycle” by buying a used copy. Often the newer edition will be nearly identical to the previous edition, except for reordering and renumbering the end-of-chapter problems. Therefore, homework assignments with lists of problems based on one edition cannot be used for a different edition. Conscientious professors will provide multiple problem numbers based on edition. However, after a few editions even the most conscientious will give up tracking the changes and simply require students to buy the current edition.
This deliberate generation of waste might have amazed and shocked our scholarly colleagues from medieval times. In medieval England, a book cost about $10,000 (in 2011 dollars) [H. E. Bell, The Price of Books in Medieval England, Library s4-XVII (3):312-332 (1936)]. This cost makes sense: Copying a book by hand might take a skilled workman about half a year. That one day books would be so cheap and publishers' profit so important that people would design books to be thrown out—this would simply have been incomprehensible.

I'd like to address some concerns that people have raised about Steven “Jews Scream Louder in the Fake Shower” Crowder.
Many people were excited when Steven Crowder announced that he was Alt-Right, and would be assuming leadership of the movement. I personally felt like his extreme, genocidal rhetoric served as a good counterbalance to the faggotry that MILO has introduced into the movement.
However, a recent rant against NEETs and anime fans has some wondering if Crowder actually believes in the ideals of the Alt-Right, or if he is just using it as a vehicle to commit mass-murder.
I don't speak for the entire Alt-Right, but I know that NEETs and anime Nazis make-up a significant portion of my readership, and in fact are at the core of the Alt-Right. I think it's pretty out of line to call for them to be ovened with the kikes.
Perhaps even more disturbing than his anti-NEET rant, however, was a series of tweets which appeared to indicate gross mental instability. Several of the tweets seemed to allude to a plan to kill his ex-wife, Caroline.
All this having been said, the Alt-Right has been experiencing a serious leadership crisis, so many in the movement have shown a willingness to jump on board with Crowder's plan to “genocide billions of people.” Some have even gone so far as to comply with his demands to remove their anime avatars on Twitter.
As of late, there has been a good deal of cucking, due to the media coverage the Alt-Right has been receiving. Some have even argued that we need a “big tent” in the Alt-Right, and have begun pushing to include non-White “allies of color,” including Jews. When you have people going on about stuff like that, I suppose it's hard to reject Crowder simply because of a few personality quirks.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter if Crowder is in the movement because he believes in creating a future for Whites, or if he just wants to murder billions of people and creating a future for Whites is a good excuse for that.
At least he wants to gas kikes. As far as I'm concerned, his psychological state is none of my business.
Joey Votto seems to love trolling fans on the road. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz)
Of all the things baseball has going against it these days — and there are a lot of things — its glaring lack of a mustache-twirling heel is probably pretty far down the list in terms of importance. But Reds first baseman Joey Votto is doing what he can.
Here's Exhibit A, from Wednesday's game against the Giants in San Francisco.
Kid asks for Joey's batting gloves. Votto replies "You're sitting in the front row, you're elite. This isn't a 'Make A Wish' situation"…
Votto seems to delight in tormenting the swells when the Reds are on the road. Earlier this year in Philadelphia (obviously), he had some fun with the close-in fans, especially one Phillies supporter who was razzing him over his allegedly small feet (he wears a size 13, if that matters).
He was entirely pleased with himself, as any good heel is.
Votto continued to produce as the game wore on:
And then he trolled the fan he had just punked, mimicking his demand for the ball.
Some may say he's being a jerk here, but I won't. Baseball is supposed to be a fun game, and Votto is doing what he can to make baseball fun again (minus the hat).
“A high percentage of the guys and ladies and kids on the first-base side were smiling and laughing,” Votto said after the Phillies game. “Fair game. I happened to pop in during the game and on TV the theme was I didn't give a ball to a kid, which is definitely not the case. I made a point to not give a ball to an adult that was giving me a hard time. So be it.”
Asked for his response to fans who think he's over the line here, Votto was succinct: “Too bad.”
And then he finished with a flourish.
“I have no problems with any of the Philly fans, except for the Philly fan kids,” he said, smiling. “I can't stand kids here. Kids drive me crazy, Philly fans especially.”
WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 27: U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) answers questions at a press conference following the weekly House Republican caucus meeting January 27, 2015 in Washington, DC. Boehner discussed the invitation the House of Representatives extended to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address members of Congress during his remarks.

The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.
House Speaker John Boehner says there are “unanswered questions” about the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. He specifically asks “why didn't we attempt to rescue” Americans under siege and why were some U.S. personnel “told not to get involved” in rescue attempts?
But those questions have been answered at length in several investigative reports, including two by Republican-controlled House committees. Congressional committees and an independent board detail the rescue attempts that night, carried out despite U.S. military assets not being in position to defend the Benghazi facility. Those reports say there were no undue delays in responding to the attacks, and they pointedly rejected unfounded allegations that the U.S. response was deliberately thwarted by a “stand down” order.
“Quite the contrary: the safe evacuation of all U.S. government personnel from Benghazi twelve hours after the initial attack and subsequently to Ramstein Air Force Base was the result of exceptional U.S. government coordination and military response,” the independent Accountability Review Board concluded in its Dec. 18, 2012, report.
The “U.S. military performed well in responding to the attacks,” the House Armed Services Committee said in a February 2014 report. Separately, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said in its November 2014 report that the CIA — which was first on the scene of the attack — responded in a “timely and appropriate manner.”
Boehner appeared on “Fox News Sunday” and discussed the Select Committee on Benghazi, a special panel created by the Republican-controlled House last year. The U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi (referred to in official reports as a temporary mission facility, or TMF) was attacked by heavily armed extremists on Sept. 11, 2012. The terrorist attack left four U.S. citizens dead — including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.
Host Chris Wallace asked Boehner why he set up the committee “even though there have been about a half dozen investigations” and the GOP-controlled House intelligence committee “basically said there was no there there.” Wallace asked if the committee was created to hurt former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential ambitions.
Boehner, Feb. 15: No, Chris, it's — the idea here is to get the American people the facts about what happened. Why wasn't the security for our embassy in Libya, the extra security, given to the ambassador after repeated requests? The night of the event, why didn't we attempt to rescue the people that were there? Why were the people there told not to get involved? And then, as importantly, when did the president know this? And why, for some two weeks, did he describe it differently than what it really was? There are a lot of unanswered questions, and as Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the Benghazi committee, has been told by me, I don't need a big show here but we need our facts. The American people deserve the truth about what happened and that's all we're interested in.
All the questions posed by Boehner have been addressed by various House and Senate committees and by the Accountability Review Board convened by the State Department, but we focus in particular on the U.S. rescue attempts because the premise of those questions is misleading.
Let's review what the reports say about the rescue attempt and how U.S. security, intelligence and military personnel were deployed that night.
Extremists armed with small arms, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars attacked the diplomatic facility at about 9:42 p.m. Benghazi time on Sept. 11, 2012, according to a Defense timeline. In about 17 minutes after the attack, the Defense Department diverted an unmanned surveillance drone to Benghazi, the timeline says. At about the same time, the chief of a CIA annex near the Benghazi diplomatic facility was making preparations to send a team of seven to assist in a rescue operation.
At 10:04 p.m., the CIA team departed in two armored vehicles, arriving at the facility at 10:25 p.m. and immediately engaging in a 15-minute firefight with the extremists, according to a bipartisan report issued December 30, 2012, by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
The House intelligence committee report said that “some Annexes team members wanted urgently to depart the Annex for the TMF to save their State Department colleagues,” but the Annex chief “ordered the team to wait so that the seniors on the ground could ascertain the situation at the TMF and whether they could secure heavy weaponry support from local militias.”
This order to wait has been described by some as a “stand down” order, but it was not. The Republican-controlled House intelligence committee said that based on all the evidence, “the Annex leadership deliberated thoughtfully, reasonably, and quickly.”
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Nov. 21, 2014: The evidence from eyewitness testimony, ISR video footage, closed-circuit television recordings, and other sources provides no support for the allegation that there was any stand-down order. Rather, there were mere tactical disagreements about the speed with which the team should depart prior to securing additional security assets.
A bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report released on Jan. 15, 2014, reached the same conclusion.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Jan. 15: The Committee explored claims that there was a “stand down” order given to the security team at the Annex. Although some members of the security team expressed frustration that they were unable to respond more quickly to the Mission compound, the Committee found no evidence of intentional delay or obstruction by the Chief of Base or any other party.
At about midnight Benghazi time, a little more than two hours after the attack began, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gathered top military leaders at the Pentagon to discuss military options, according to the Defense timeline. (We will get back to Panetta's decisions later.)
While military leaders convened at the Pentagon, a six-man security team from the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, including two military personnel, departed for Benghazi at about 12:30 a.m. Rear Adm. Brian Losey, commander at the time of Special Operations Command Africa, did not send all the security forces stationed in Tripoli. He ordered Army Lt. Col. S.E. Gibson's team to remain in Tripoli to protect the U.S. embassy in the event of an attack there, according to the House Armed Services Committee report.
Gibson was initially “visibly upset” that his team was not dispatched to Benghazi along with the other team from Tripoli, the House report said. A colleague described Gibson as being “furious” at the time at having been ordered to “stand down.” But “Gibson made it clear to the committee that ‘in hindsight' he believes remaining in Tripoli was appropriate,” the House report said.
“I was not ordered to stand down. I was ordered to remain in place,” Gibson told the House Armed Services Committee. ” ‘Stand down' implies that we cease all operations, cease all activities. We continued to support the team that was in Tripoli.”
The Tripoli team arrived in Benghazi in about an hour, but it was delayed at the airport “for at least three hours,” according to the Senate homeland security committee report. The committee said the delay “merits further inquiry” to determine if it was merely part of the “chaotic environment” at the time or “was it part of a plot to keep American help from reaching the Americans under siege in Benghazi.” It turned out to be the result of the “chaotic environment,” not “part of a plot.”
The Senate intelligence committee later said in its report that the Tripoli team was trying to locate Stevens before leaving the airport. There had been reports that Stevens may have been at the Benghazi Medical Center, but Libyans were concerned about security at the hospital and feared the Americans could be lured into an ambush, the committee report said.
“After more than three hours of negotiations and communications with Libyan officials … the Libyan government arranged for the Libyan Shield Militia to provide transportation and an armed escort from the airport” to the CIA Annex, the Senate intelligence committee report said.
The Tripoli team arrived at the CIA Annex at 5:04 a.m., “about ten minutes before a new assault by the terrorists began, involving mortar rounds fired at the Annex,” according to the Senate homeland security report. That attack resulted in the deaths of Annex security team members Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, the report said. Libyan forces arrived at the Annex at 6 a.m. with 50 vehicles and transported the remaining Americans to the airport, where they would be evacuated by plane to Tripoli in two trips at 7:40 a.m. and 10 a.m. enroute ultimately to Germany.
Where was the U.S. military?
Panetta's midnight meeting (Benghazi time) at the Pentagon lasted until about 2 a.m. After the meeting, Panetta took several actions. He agreed to send one Marine Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team platoon stationed in Rota, Spain, to Benghazi and another to Tripoli. He also directed two special operations forces — one from Central Europe and another based in the United States — to depart for a staging base in Italy, according to the Defense timeline and the Senate homeland security report. None of those troops reached Benghazi in time.
“[T]here simply was not enough time given the speed of the attacks for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference,” as the independent Accountability Review Board said in its report. But other rescue efforts did make a difference.
The ARB report, which was released Dec. 18, 2012, said “every possible effort was made to protect, rescue and recover Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith.” Smith, a State Department information management officer, also died in the attack at the diplomatic mission.
Accountability Review Board: The interagency response was timely and appropriate, but there simply was not enough time given the speed of the attacks for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference. Senior-level interagency discussions were underway soon after Washington received initial word of the attacks and continued through the night. The Board found no evidence of any undue delays in decision making or denial of support from Washington or from the military combatant commanders. Quite the contrary: the safe evacuation of all U.S. government personnel from Benghazi twelve hours after the initial attack and subsequently to Ramstein Air Force Base was the result of exceptional U.S. government coordination and military response and helped save the lives of two severely wounded Americans.
In a press conference on the board's report, Mullen addressed the military's inability to mobilize its assets quickly enough to defend the Benghazi facility. He said that “it is not reasonable, nor feasible, to tether U.S. forces at the ready to respond to protect every high-risk post in the world.”
There was, however, an increase in military protection of U.S. diplomatic facilities after the Benghazi attacks. A Congressional Research Service report dated July 30, 2014, said that “the U.S. Marine Security Guard posted detachments to 152 U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world as of September 2012; 35 new Marine Guard detachments were requested by the department after the Benghazi attacks.”
There is no question that mistakes were made prior to Sept. 11, 2012, that left the U.S. facilities in Benghazi vulnerable to attack. Multiple investigative reports document those mistakes.
The Senate homeland security report said the State Department made a “grievous mistake” in keeping the Benghazi facility open given the “dangerous threat environment” in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attack. The ARB report said “systemic failures” and leadership “deficiencies” caused the State Department to ignore “repeated requests” for additional security staffing in Libya, leaving the Benghazi facility “grossly inadequate to deal with the attack.” (Which goes to another of Boehner's questions: “Why wasn't the security for our embassy in Libya, the extra security, given to the ambassador after repeated requests?”)
But as far as the night of the attack? The consensus is that the rescue attempts were carried out in a timely manner under difficult circumstances. For Boehner to ask “why didn't we attempt to rescue” Americans under attack and why were some U.S. personnel “told not to get involved” ignores the evidence.
Bluetooth-enabled HomeKit products from Elgato
Amazon's Alexa-enabled Echo
Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN.
Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. "The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month," she said.
Apple has been in the smart home market for over two years, having introduced its HomeKit framework in the fall of 2014 alongside iOS 8, but HomeKit has been slow to get off the ground because of the company's strict requirements.Amazon, meanwhile, entered the smart home market somewhat later with its Alexa-enabled Echo in-home speaker officially launching in the summer of 2015, but Amazon's Echo already supports a wider range of products.The difference between the two? Open and closed development, as explored by Reuters in a new article that details the different approaches that Amazon and Apple have taken when developing their smart home offerings.Apple maintains strict control over its HomeKit platform, with a heavy focus on security and simplicity. Manufacturers who want to create a HomeKit product are required to use special HomeKit chips priced up to $2, along with specific WiFi and Bluetooth chips.HomeKit devices have to be made in factories certified by Apple, and then have to be sent to Cupertino for rigorous testing, a process that can take three to five months and must be conducted in secret.Amazon's process for smart home products that work with Alexa is much simpler, taking a matter of days to complete. Smart home companies simply need to write code and send it for Amazon to review -- that's it. No special chips, no secure factories, and no specific oversight. Companies can send a product to a third-party lab for testing to earn a specific "Works with Alexa" label, a process that is completed "within 10 days."As Reuters points out, while HomeKit doesn't work with as many products, it supports Bluetooth, is much more secure, and has a quicker setup process. Security, which Amazon can't promise, is a key differentiator between the two companies and a factor that could ultimately entice more consumers in the long run. A non-hackable smart home product like a door lock or a camera provides more peace of mind than quick compatibility.Reuters spoke with several HomeKit manufacturers, and all were satisfied with Apple's approach. "It makes for a better user experience," said Incipio senior engineer Ahmed Abdallah, speaking about HomeKit's ability to work offline. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Nanoleaf CEO Gimmy Chu.Amazon's simpler certification process has led to over 250 smart home products being certified to work with Alexa, while Apple has certified approximately 100 devices. Alexa-enabled devices have also been selling rapidly, with an estimated 10 million sales over the holiday season, while Apple's HomeKit sales are less clear.Apple is rumored to be ramping up its smart home efforts through a smart home hub that's similar to the Amazon Echo, with built-in Siri capabilities, a speaker, and a microphone, allowing it to be used for controlling smart home accessories.For more detail on the lengths that Apple goes to in order to ensure that its HomeKit products are secure, make sure to read the full analysis over at Reuters
The Boston Bruins‘ David Pastrnak played his hundredth game on Monday night, netting his fourth goal of the season against the Winnipeg Jets. Since his debut with the Bruins in 2014, the 20-year-old Czech forward has proven to be an asset to the team that drafted him, and will likely remain a strong player for the franchise.
David Pastrnak Shines In First Hundred Games
Pastrnak led the Czech U18 League in both goals and points in the 2011-12 season. The loss of his father, Milan, to cancer in 2013 inspired him to train harder and follow his dreams to play in the NHL. As a prospect, he was know for his speed and goal scoring ability.
Under then general manager Peter Chiarelli, the Boston Bruins selected Pastrnak 25th overall in the first round of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a three-year entry level deal with Boston in July of 2014, and was assigned to the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League at the beginning of the season.
Pastrnak made his NHL debut in November 2014 in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. After another stint in Providence, he returned to the team to score his first two NHL goals in one game against Ray Emery of the Philadelphia Flyers. He ended the season as one of only two players from the 2014 draft (along with the Florida Panthers' Aaron Ekblad) to play more than 40 games that season. The ability to play alongside his Czech hockey idol David Krejci excited Pastrnak, and may have contributed to his success early on. Krejci, in addition to housing the young player in his sophomore season, acted as a role model and helped his linemate adjust to life in Boston.
An injury early in the 2015-16 season sidelined Pastrnak from November to January. After a short rehabilitation stint in Providence, he returned and would finish the year with 15 goals and 26 points in 51 games. Pastrnak was fifth (tied) on the team in goals and tenth in points, despite missing so much time.
What's In Store This Season
So far this season, Pastrnak leads the team in goals scored and is second in points to his current linemate Brad Marchand. Only three games in, he has already netted four goals, including the game winner against Winnipeg. If he is able to avoid injury, he could be amongst the team's leaders in points. He will get a further boost when teammate Patrice Bergeron returns from injury, which could be as early as the home opener Thursday versus the New Jersey Devils.

As baseball enters the last weekend before the trade deadline on Sunday, the trade rumor mill is buzzing louder than ever. This morning, so-so pitchers Andrew Cashner and Colin Rea were dealt from the Padres to the Marlins in exchange for some pretty big names, including top prospect Josh Naylor and the rehabbing-but-overpowering Carter Capps. Yahoo's Jeff Passan also said that the Phillies' Jeremy Hellickson might fetch three or four prospects—it's a seller's market, and the barely-contending Yankees should really jump into it.
That last point rings particularly true with a new rumor about closer Andrew Miller and the Nationals. The Yankees have been understandably reluctant to deal him, but everyone should be available for the right price. Now, it seems like they have finally received an offer worthy of the elite reliever. Per MLB Network's Jon Morosi, the Nationals are willing to part with Lucas Giolito in exchange for Miller. The back of their bullpen is a mess with Jonathan Papelbon struggling while they try to fend off their NL East opponents. They would love to solidify it with Miller, last year's AL Reliever of the Year.
Simply put, the Yankees are fools if they don't accept this potential deal. If it's real, then they would be adding the best pitching prospect in baseball to their farm system. That's not hyperbole. Lucas Giolito is, by many accounts, the game's most prestigious young arm. In MLB.com's midseason update, the 6'6” 22-year-old right-hander was ranked fourth overall and the best pitcher. Giolito was ineligible for the Baseball Prospectus midseason list since he was in the majors, but prior to 2016, he was ranked third overall and again, the top pitcher. Baseball America had the Cardinals' Alex Reyes just ahead of Giolito in their midseason update, but Giolito was the fourth-best prospect and behind only Reyes among pitchers.
Giolito is the real deal, and the Yankees don't receive many opportunities to add such an elite prospect. He's an even better return than Gleyber Torres and far superior to Luis Severino, even at his pitching prospect peak. Other than Severino, there are not many well-liked pitchers in the Yankees' system. James Kaprielian and Ian Clarkin are both nice but hurt, and Domingo Acevedo is all the way down in High-A Tampa (and older than Giolito).
Miller is a ton of fun to watch and a tremendous closer, but at the end of the day, he's only a closer under control through 2018. Mariano Rivera wouldn't have been as valuable without standout starters like Andy Pettitte and David Cone around to get the ball to him. Prospects are no guarantee, but Giolito is as highly touted as they come. The fact that he has excellent makeup doesn't hurt, either. Eventually, teams have to roll the dice, and this is one trade the Yankees really should make.
Per Jon Heyman, the Yankees have also been asked about Miller by the Cardinals, Indians, Giants, and Rangers. If they're not taking this supposed Giolito offer now, the only acceptable reason is that they're trying to get a little bit more in this seller's market, either from the Nats or one of those teams. The rationale absolutely cannot be their fringe hopes of contending in 2016. Their playoff odds are not great and they trail multiple teams in both the AL East and Wild Card standings.
Is that tiny percentage of postseason aspirations really worth refusing to invest in the future? I hope not. Please make this trade.
Update
for the record, yankees would not do this https://t.co/dPM9QZdJk2 — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) July 29, 2016
The Yankees are really annoying, you guys.
This is a guest post by Tyler Curtis. He is a sophomore at Skagit Valley College and the Executive Director of the Skagit Secular Student Alliance.
This past weekend I was lucky enough to attend the 2011 Secular Student Alliance Annual Conference. Among the speakers was American Atheist president David Silverman, and it was a speech I enjoyed. His talk focused on inspiring us secular youth; emphasizing how we are the future, and how the future looks good. I couldn't agree more, and found the talk pretty inspirational in this sense.
His talk came together focusing on the sleeping giant…the “30 under 30”. That is, that 30% of people under 30 years of age are nontheistic. He stressed that within 20 years, we all will be out of school, and be the leaders of our country. Needless to say, that got me super excited about the future. I mean, as a nation we're FAR behind when it comes to rationality and ridding ourselves of these ancient magical stories, but looking at trends like that provides hope.
During the speech, no sources were provided for the “30 under 30” statistic. Not the worst thing in the world, but being at a skepticism related conference, I personally expect all statistics cited. So, upon arriving back home and catching up on things, I looked into the source of the statistic. I was eager to read up on it more in depth.
And. I. Found. Nothing.
I still can't. No published study I've found comes close to supporting the “30 under 30” claim.
I emailed Silverman inquiring to his source, and while he was unable to immediately find the original source for his “30 under 30” point (he said he'll look more when he has time, in which I'll add to this post later if so), he did link me to the Pew Research Center with statistics saying that 25% of those 18-29 years old were religiously unaffiliated. Bumping that to 30 is quite the rounding, but we'll see if he finds his original source. I would have expected him to have an easier time finding a source for something he has been claiming for about a year though.
But I even found problems with this source he provided me with. This “unaffiliated” category he cited for his statement about young nontheists is…misleading. The definition of “unaffiliated” is something that needs to be established before we can even have any useful discussion about it. Four labels fall under this category according to the report; atheists, agnostics, the secular unaffiliated and the religious unaffiliated.
According to the above table from Pew, “the ‘religious unaffiliated' category includes those who describe their faith as ‘nothing in particular' but say that religion is somewhat or very important in their lives.” Should we really be counting those who are religious, but just unaffiliated with any specific religion, in our secular movement?
Of course fucking not. Go read that definition of the religious unaffiliated again. That is antithetical to most of what the secular movement is about.
Luckily for us, the Pew Research Center breaks down this 25% of 18-29 year olds statistic into the subcategories. The atheists, agnostics, and secular unaffiliated make up a total of 16 of the original 25% claim. We shouldn't be including the religiously unaffiliated in the secular movement, and when we don't it ends up being barely half of the original “30 under 30” Silverman claimed.
I hope he's right. I want him to be right. But his claim is currently unsubstantiated. His enthusiasm is unmatched, and that alone was inspiring for us students. The secular movement is indeed winning, but it doesn't seem to be at the pace he claims. The younger generations do believe in less of this archaic bullshit that plagues society, as can be seen in the above table. Belief is going down. The trend doesn't seem to be stopping. “…the Nones increased in numbers and proportion in every state, Census Division and Region of the country from 1990 to 2008,” according to another report, the American Religious Identification Survey.
To clarify this definition of “nones”, the nones in the ARIS included those who responded with their religion as “None, No religion, Humanistic, Ethical Culture, Agnostic, Atheist, Secular”. The ARIS does come a lot closer to Silverman's claim, with 22% of 18-29 year olds identified in the None category in the ARIS report. While over 22% of societies up and comers is something to be proud of, it's certainly not the 30% that was being claimed. “22 under 30” doesn't exactly flow as well admittedly, but it's actually a claim supported with evidence.
The evidence/logic is on our side and people are beginning to realize that. There is no need to skew our numbers and we must be careful of letting statistics that sound great cloud our skepticism. We demand sources in our discussions among those who disagree with us; we should do the same for those that do agree with us.
We should think critically about our demographics and figure out how we may best increase them. Saying they are one thing when they are not only give us an exaggerated rate of success. I'm confident that with honestly looking at the statistics regarding belief we can make Silverman's “30 under 30” claim a reality.
***Update*** (8/16/2011): I've been informed of the source from readers of this blog post, and I confirmed with Silverman that this was his original source. No survey is mentioned as to where the actual percentage comes from, but even ignoring that issue there are enough details stated in the article to dismiss it. His supporting statistic comes from this sentence:
“Between 25% and 30% of twentysomethings today say they have no religious affiliation — roughly four times higher than in any previous generation.”
I hope your red flags went up…there's that “no religious affiliation” thing again. While this article doesn't give us the specific breakdown of the sub-categories like the Pew source did, it does go on to clarify the statistic slightly in the next paragraph:
“Very few of these new “nones” actually call themselves atheists, and many have rather conventional beliefs about God and theology.”
So maybe not all the “nones” call themselves atheists, not a huge deal. But those with conventional beliefs about God and theology? Those are certainly not non-theists, and should not be used to inflate our numbers.
Select an atheist friend or relative and pray for them by name each day during the month of April, 2010 (and beyond!). It's easy and could make an eternal difference for someone you love.
According to American Atheists there are over 30 million Americans who claim to be atheists. April 1st has been referred to both National Atheists Day and April Fool's Day but Christians are not fooling around when it comes to praying for atheists.
Recently, Christians started a "Pray for an Atheist" Facebook initiative with the intent to encourage other Christians to pray for atheists and become better equipped to sharing their faith in a respectful manner with atheists.
The initiative has opened up dialogue between Christians and atheists and
become somewhat controversial as opposing religious sides are challenging each other.
Some social critics wonder if Facebook is the proper forum for converting people to Christianity? What would Jesus think of these new religious tactics for sharing your faith? What approach should oppose religious views use for effectively communicating both sides?
Jim Spiegel, author of The Making of an Atheist and professor of philosophy and religion at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana, claims that although atheists present arguments against belief in God, "Atheism is not at all a consequence of intellectual doubts. These are mere symptoms of the root cause—moral rebellion. For the atheist, the missing ingredient is not evidence but obedience," says Spiegel.
Holly Ordway, the author of Not God's Type, is a highly educated, former atheist and professor of English, who represents a demographic supposedly beyond the reach of the church in postmodern America. Ordway was once hostile toward Christianity but through a series of conversations with a wise and patient mentor, Ordway not only became convinced of God's existence, but embraced Christianity.
Members of the "Pray for an Atheist" initiative agree to do the following:
PRAY for an atheist by name for one month
UNDERSTAND how people become atheists through resources so you can pray more effectively
INTERCEDE through prayer for an atheist
ENCOURAGE participating Christians through email and prayer

An elderly Miami-Dade man is facing an attempted murder charge after he shot his son during a dispute over dirty dishes, police said.
Rangel Roman, 78, is charged with attempted second-degree murder in the Tuesday morning shooting of his son in the 3900 block of Southwest 92nd Avenue in Westchester, police said.
Roman was being held on $10,000 bond Wednesday and it was unknown whether he has an attorney.
It's the World's Largest...
According to police and an arrest affidavit, Roman and his son, who is in his 40s and lives with his dad, were in a verbal dispute "over food preparation and dirty dishes."
At one point, the son walked into a bedroom and Roman became "intimidated" and assumed his son had armed himself with a knife, the affidavit said.
Roman took a pistol out of his pocket and fired five shots at his son, hitting him in the abdomen once, the affidavit said. The son was taken to Kendall Regional Hospital in critical but stable condition.
Weird News Photos: Man Shoves Snake in Pants
According to Roman, he and his son have a long history of domestic disputes and his son often punches or throws things around the house to intimidate him, the affidavit said.
"The defendant stated that due to the intimidation the victim has subjected him to, he has been forced to carry a firearm while he is in his own house," the affidavit said.
Roman told officers he thought he had only fired two shots at his son, the affidavit said.

Gov. Scott Walker's gubernatorial campaign committee has only $160,000 cash on hand, according to The Associated Press.
Walker's financial filing today shows that he spent almost as much as he raised in the first six months of the year: He raised $1.1 million and spent $970,000.
Still, he's better off financially today than he was at the end of 2015, when just $20,000 was in his campaign account.
Walker has hinted he plans to run for a third term in 2018, and low cash reserves would encourage would-be challengers. Some political observers also believe that his support for presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump could make him vulnerable, depending on how the rest of the Republican campaign plays out.
The governor was an ardent foe of Trump last year while campaigning for the GOP presidential nomination. Despite burning through $90,000 a day, he was the first of the party's 17 hopefuls to exit the race.
Walker's campaign and the dark-money groups supporting him spent a total of $32.6 million on his flameout presidential bid, according to www.opensecrets.org.
Eighty-two percent of the donations made to Walker's presidential campaign came from outside the state.
Walker's presidential campaign committee still had a debt of $807,000 at the end of May. He's tried numerous tactics to retire that debt, including selling his donor list and offering T-shirts from his failed campaign in exchange for $45 donations.
Resigned to supporting Trump
When he dropped out of the race, Walker said he hoped to encourage other candidates to do so as well in order to allow voters to coalesce around presumptive nominee Donald Trump.
But the governor, who was the subject of Trump attacks, says he'll put them aside for the good of the country and will speak at the Republican National Convention, which takes place in Cleveland July 18–21.
Three weeks ago, Walker said that he believed GOP convention delegates should be free to vote their consciences instead of being bound to vote for Trump, who won the state's primary.
But Walker has since backed off the idea that Trump could be replaced as the nominee. He told WKOW-TV that a vote for anyone other than Trump is a “de facto vote” for Hillary Clinton.
Other prominent Wisconsin Republicans who had been distancing themselves from Trump are also acquiescing. House Speaker Paul Ryan has tepidly endorsed the TV reality star, even though he says Trump's style is offense and divisive.
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who faces a tough re-election bid against former Sen. Russ Feingold, now says he'll attend the GOP convention after earlier saying that he wouldn't.
Even right-wing radio star Mark Belling has come around to supporting Trump.
For those of you not familiar with me, I've been one of those guys that's kind of had the heebie-jeebies over Donald Trump. But I'm voting for Donald Trump,” he told his conservative listeners on July 14. “I'm comfortable with my decision, and, while I'm not going to try to pressure anyone to coming around to that point of view, I think it's the right thing to do.”
Anyone passing through Amsterdam today may come across some unusual traders - the world's first ecstasy shop. Political youth organisation Liberal Democrats (D66) want the drug decriminalised and afforded the same legal treatment as cannabis, which is available freely in the Netherlands and on sale in shops across the country. However, anyone looking to pick up some high quality gurners will be disappointed – the store will only be selling placebos.
In the ecstasy shop, the party want to demonstrate why decriminalisation is better than leaving distribution to dealers. Dirkjan Tijs, president of the Young Democrats claims: ‘We can prevent minors from buying, make sure there's no overdose in pills and educate people on ways to minimize the risks involved with ecstasy-usage." The shop will only be open today and is called MDMJA, combining MDMA, the active substance in ecstasy and "Ja", the Dutch word for "yes".
The Indiana DNR Law District 7 posted a photo to their Facebook page that highlights the dangers of using the wrong kind of gunpowder in your firearm.
The DNR post was captioned:
Corporal Eric Doane worked a firearm accident last night in Martin County that resulted in the shooter losing a couple fingers. This is what can happen when you shoot smokeless powder out of a muzzleloader designed for black powder.
The photo speaks for itself.
Every new gun sold comes with an instruction manual that features a warning to only use ammunition specifically designed for your firearm. Read the freaking manual.
This applies equally to blackpowder firearms as it does cartridge firearms, and replacing blackpowder with the more powerful, faster-burning modern propellants is just asking to turn your firearm into a grenade.
Looking at the shattered stock and barrel, the shooter is very lucky that all he lost was a few fingers, and not his life.
About the time my iTunes music library reached 5,000 tracks I knew it was time for a cleanup. While I was at it, I adjusted the volume on some tracks that I had converted from audio cassettes, made sure joined tracks play in sequence, set iTunes to fill my iPod automatically, and learned some handy playback-control keyboard shortcuts.
Now I'm spending more time listening to the tracks in my iTunes library and less time skipping, scrolling, and searching.
The semi-automatic way to remove duplicate media files
iTunes provides two options for identifying duplicate files: one based on the song name and artist, and another "exact" method based on the song name, artist, and album. To see a list of files with the same name and artist, choose the library in the left pane and click File > Display Duplicates. Press the Shift key in Windows or the Alt or Option key on a Mac and then click File > Display Exact Duplicates to view files with the same name, artist, and album.
To ensure you're deleting the lowest-quality duplicate, show the Bit Rate column in the file list: click View > View Options, check Bit Rate in the Show Columns list, click OK, and then drag the Bit Rate column to the left so it's visible next to the song name, artist, and album.

If you want to delete the eldest of the duplicates, sort by the Date Added column (if the column isn't visible, click View > View Options, check Date Added, and click OK). If you're an iCloud subscriber, click the iCloud Status column to list all the duplicate files together.
Select the duplicates you want to remove by Ctrl-clicking, Command-clicking, or Shift-clicking them, as the case may be. Then press Delete. You're then told the files will be removed from you media player on the next sync, and you're given the option to keep the files in your iTunes Media library or placing them in the Recycle Bin or Trash. (iCloud subscribers are given the option to delete the file from their iCloud library.)
Screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET
Depending on your media collection, you may have duplicates remaining after you delete the files iTunes identified as duplicates. It took another pass through my library to find the few dozen duplicates that iTunes failed to spot. Still, the semi-automatic dupe-deletion method shrank my library by more than 15 percent.
Link tracks to play in sequence
I'm a fan of shuffling the songs I listen to from my library, until the third movement of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony plays without being preceded by movements one and two and followed by movements four and five. (If I had followed the steps below to join CD tracks when I ripped the disc, I wouldn't need to connect the tracks after the fact.)
You can tie together separate tracks of a single piece of music or the cuts from one side of an LP (think Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon") if the track numbers are sequential, and the tracks have the same album name.
There are two ways to ensure separate album cuts play in sequence: right-click each track separately and choose Get Info > Options > Part of a gapless album > OK; or select all the tracks at once, right-click the selection, choose Get Info > Yes (at the warning about editing information about multiple files at once) > Options, choose Yes in the drop-down menu next to "Gapless album," and click OK.
Screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET
As the Apple support site indicates, gapless playback is on by default in many iPods and iPhones, unless their audio-crossfade feature is enabled (crossfade is off by default). Unless you're listening on shuffle, most contiguous tracks will play as intended without having to enable gaplessness.
Join CD tracks when you rip them
There's a simple way to avoid having to link tracks so they play in the appropriate sequence: tell iTunes to join the cuts before you rip them from the CD.
When you insert the CD, iTunes will ask whether you would like to import the tracks. Click No, and then select the connected tracks by Shift-clicking (note that iTunes can join tracks only if they are listed together). Once the tracks are highlighted, click Advanced > Join CD tracks. A small black line to the left of the tracks indicates that they are linked.
Screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET
After the tracks are joined, click Import CD. Once the import is completed, the connected tracks appear in your library as a single entry.
As the Apple support site indicates, the Join CD tracks option requires that the tracks are selected on an audio CD, that the tracks are contiguous, and that the CD is sorted by track number in ascending order.
Now playing: Watch this: Make iTunes sound better
Use the Sound Check/Equalizer to adjust the volume of single tracks
In July 2011 I explained how to use the free Audacity audio software to convert LPs and audiocassettes into MP3s and CDs. Hundreds of the songs in my iTunes library were transferred from a tape or vinyl record. Unfortunately, the volume of these tracks is often much lower than the volume of original MP3s and tracks ripped from audio CDs.
iTunes lets you adjust the volume of individual tracks via the song's Options dialog box. Select the track, right-click it, and choose Get Info > Options. Move the volume-adjustment slider to the left to lower the track's volume or to the right to increase its volume.
Screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET
You can also choose one of the equalizer presets from the drop-down menu below the volume adjuster. The presets include spoken word, bass booster, acoustic, jazz, vocal booster, and small speakers. Click Next to open the Options dialog for the next item in your library. To adjust a track's equalizer settings manually, click View > Show Equalizer (Windows) or Window > Equalizer (Mac).
Let iTunes fill your media player when you sync
If your iTunes media library fits on your iPod, iPhone, or iPad, you can let iTunes sync the items in the device automatically when you connect it to your computer. For those of us whose library exceeds their media player's storage capacity, iTunes has an option that automatically fills the device with selections from your library.
Connect your media player and choose "Manually manage music and videos" under Options. Then click the arrow on the left side of your device entry in the left pane and choose Music (or whichever type of file you want to fill the player with). Click the Autofill button in the bottom-right corner of the track-list window to have iTunes add tracks from your library to the device's capacity.

Use the Autofill From drop-down menu in the bottom-left corner of the main window to select the library from which tracks will be pulled, and click the Settings button on the right to reserve space on the device.

Save time with iTunes' playback-control shortcuts
To switch to iTunes' mini-player in Windows, click View > Switch to Mini Player, or press Ctrl-Shift-M (press Ctrl-Shift-M again to revert to the full iTunes window). On a Mac, click Window > Switch to Mini Player, or press Command-Shift-M. But you can control iTunes' playback without any player visible by using keyboard shortcuts.
The shortcuts corresponding to each iTunes option are shown on the main menus, which you can open in Windows by pressing Alt and then the underlined letter that appears in the menu item. On a Mac, press Control-Fn-F2 and use the arrow keys to move between and open the menus.
The Apple support site provides lists of iTunes 10 keyboard shortcuts for Windows and shortcuts for the Mac, as well as a compendium of Mac iTunes keyboard shortcuts.
I know: Who's going to remember another four or five dozen keyboard shortcuts? The shortcuts that I find most useful are for controlling playback (they also happen to be the easiest for me to keep in mind):
Start or stop playing the selected song: spacebar
Play the next song in a list: right arrow
Play the previous song in a list: left arrow
Increase the volume: Ctrl-up arrow (Command-up arrow on a Mac)
Decrease the volume: Ctrl-down arrow (Command-down arrow on a Mac)
Mute the sound (song keeps playing): Ctrl-Alt-down arrow (Command-Option-down arrow on a Mac)
Eject a CD: Ctrl-E (Command-E on a Mac)

IT TAKES A WHILE to notice Ruben's scars. Though they're hardly subtle, they don't catch your eye as readily as his strong, smooth features or the big-ass smile that's totally disarming despite his size: six foot three, 225 pounds. Neck like a waist. Friendly as you please. When I pointed to each of the healed-up gashes on his fists and asked what they were from, he replied, “Teeth. Teeth. These are all from teeth.” He charges $1,000 for every one that he knocks out of a person's head. It's the same price for each bone he breaks in a face, a practice that's cost him a couple of knuckles.
The first people who hired Ruben, five years ago, were a regular, law-abiding couple from the Cherokee Nation who had been robbed, their savings snatched from under the mattress. The couple knew who'd stolen from them, but they couldn't prove it, and they didn't have any faith that the cops would take action. Ruben was a young Pawnee who had always gotten in a lot of fights and always seemed to win. He didn't have anything against the guy; it was just a job, like his other odd jobs, roofing or tiling or cement work. He waited for the guy to walk out of a bar one night and started hitting him. Two facial fractures: eye socket and cheekbone. Two thousand dollars. Ruben—who's asked me to use that name to protect his identity—says he can't count how many times he's played vigilante since then in the Indian nations of northeastern Oklahoma. Most often, it's about stolen property. Sometimes, it's about a raped sister or daughter.
“It's about justice,” Ruben, 29, tells me when I say it doesn't make any sense for victims to scrape together a pile of beating-up money after getting their cash stolen. “People want people either beat up or locked up. And on a reservation, they're probably not gonna get anybody locked up.”
Statistically speaking, he's probably right. The rate of violent crime among Native Americans is twice the national average (PDF); on some reservations, it's 20 times higher. At least one in three American Indian women will be raped (PDF) in their lifetimes. Yet just 3,000 tribal and Bureaus of Indian Affairs (BIA) officers—the only kinds of cops with jurisdiction on Indian land—patrol 56 million acres. In 2008, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the Dakotas had nine officers for 9,000 people in an area twice the size of Delaware. (A typical town with the same population has three times that number.) Tribal courts can only prosecute misdemeanors such as petty theft and public intoxication. They can't issue sentences longer than one year without meeting special criteria, and even then, three years is the maximum. More serious crimes must be handled by federal prosecutors, who turn down 65 percent (PDF) of the reservation cases referred to them.
“People don't care to report crime because it's just blowin' wind,” says a former tribal police chief.
Non-Indians commit two-thirds of violent crimes against Indians, including 86 percent of rapes and sexual assaults. Yet thanks to a 1978 Supreme Court ruling, tribes can not prosecute outsiders who commit crimes on their land. (The case involved a white guy who'd assaulted a tribal police officer and another who'd attempted a high-speed getaway from reservation cops.)
“Going out there was like trying to do your job with one hand tied behind your back,” says Damon Roughface, a former tribal police chief of White Eagle, in Oklahoma's Ponca trust land. “People don't care to report crime, because it's just blowin' wind. I'll have to admit that sometimes people think the code of the street works a lot better than the BIA.” He points out that it's not uncommon in poor communities, Indian and non-Indian alike, for people to develop their own mechanisms of enforcement. “But on reservations,” he says, “it's only compounded by the BIA's history.”
“Informal justice on reservations is motivated by the perception that they will not receive justice, usually. Or that justice will take too long, or that the system is corrupt,” says Jeffrey Ian Ross, an associate professor at the University of Baltimore's School of Criminal Justice who studies Native Americans and the legal system. “In a system like that, there's vigilante justice.” Melissa Tatum, associate director of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the University of Arizona, says reports of vigilantism aren't unheard of in parts of Indian country beyond Oklahoma, though it's hard to say how widespread it is. And some tribes, she notes, are successfully bypassing the courts in favor of traditional conflict resolution. But one element is constant: “There's frustration with the jurisdictional maze on Indian territory,” says Carrie Garrow, a former St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Court judge and the executive director of the Center for Indigenous Law, Governance and Citizenship at Syracuse University.
That maze may not get more complex than it is in eastern Oklahoma, where Ruben and I drive past a series of signs announcing which Indian nation we're entering —Osage, Otoe, Iowa, Sac and Fox, Pawnee, Ponca—and where the land is a checkerboard (PDF) of tribal and non-tribal ownership [Click here to see Melissa Tatum's PDF chart of Indian Country jurisdiction]. County and tribal police sometimes agree to share jurisdiction over their mingled territory. But, as one Pawnee Tribal Police officer tells me, “They don't go out of their way to patrol our areas, and we don't really go in theirs.” Ruben's been arrested dozens of times, but never, he says, on tribal land—simply because “the cops don't come.”
Inside the Mint Bar in the town of Pawnee, the old men drinking draft beer at a big round table drop the phrase “those were the days” with almost comic frequency. One gestures above his head to a hole he once shot in the ceiling; the other guys instantly start pointing to the other bullet holes among the rafters. Nobody around here ever called the cops for nothin', they say. If someone roughed up your property, or your gal, you came down to the bar and got someone to take care of it.
When we leave, I get in the driver's seat of Ruben's car; his license has been suspended for DUIs. His rap sheet extends far beyond that: breach of peace, first-degree robbery, obstructing an officer, aggravated assault. He's never been arrested for a paid beating or done hard time for a regular fight, but he talks about how he should stop scrapping anyhow. He owes it to his kids. His ex has custody this week, but he talks to his five-year-old son and six-year-old daughter constantly on the phone. “You were the best player on that football team!” “I'm so proud of you doin' good on that test! You're going to be a spelling champion!” On the way back toward home in Osage Nation, he cracks into the 30-rack of Bud Light in the backseat and tells me how he landed a felony charge for assaulting an acquaintance who he felt was threatening his children.
He's determined to provide his kids with a better example than he had. “My dad used to make me and my brother fistfight, and hit us with a two-by-four if we didn't,” Ruben tells me when he's more than a few cans deep. Caseworkers “would come to my house and ask me how's my home life, if everything's okay. But he's right there in the same room. And what if I say no, and they don't take me? So I said everything's fine, and I would just pray that they'd see it behind my eyes: Get. Me. Outta here.”
We pull up to the house of two of Ruben's friends, where the guys show off the driveway they poured today and the cabinet renovation they've done in the kitchen. They all talk about Indian loan-guarantee programs, and, as is often a topic of conversation, the various benefits different tribes give out. Ruben's tribe, like most, isn't one of those wealthy ones with casino revenues to distribute in abundance or invest in tribal services. A quarter of American Indians live below the poverty level; Ruben is on food stamps. His casino royalty check last year was for $8. “I'd rather they send a midget to my house to knock on the door,” he says, “and when I open it, have him punch me in the nuts and say, ‘Thanks for bein' Pawnee.'”
His friends wince when we say we've been to White Eagle, where people keep telling Ruben he has no business taking a woman, much less a white woman. Where, Roughface told me, if a woman reports a rape to the BIA, “I guarantee you she'll be revictimized.” Where the BIA recently shut down the entire tribal police department for incompetence. At four in the morning, a guy who's even bigger than Ruben, parts Choctaw and Cherokee but nearly as pale as a Swede, pulls me aside and confesses he broke someone's arm once. He's not proud of it, but he needed the money, and anyway it was too expensive to hire a lawyer and the cops weren't going to do anything about somebody not paying off a debt.
In July, President Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order Act (PDF) in the White House's East Room. Standing beside him were two Indian men in headdresses, and Lisa Marie Iyotte, a Lakota woman whose rape case the feds had decided, without even interviewing her, not to pursue. (She couldn't stop sobbing, even after Obama put his arm around her.) The act includes reforms like increasing tribal courts' sentencing authority to three years—if they provide public defenders and trained judges. It mandates that tribal officers be instructed how to interview sexual-assault victims and collect evidence. It requires the Department of Justice to keep track of any Indian cases it declines to prosecute, and to gather more statistics on crime on Indian land. Obama called it “an important step to help the federal government better address the unique public safety challenges that confront tribal communities.”
Some Native American groups hailed the law, but not everyone is impressed. “The Indian communities have been longing for something for so long, they're just willing to grab whatever right now,” says Virgil Wade, a criminal defender in Arizona's Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. “I don't know that it has the teeth that it's gonna need.” Like, for example, the funds to pay for any of the proposed improvements—money the act doesn't guarantee. “Right now, with the economy, everybody's cutting back—tribes included.” Nor does the measure “bother to address the real problem, which is jurisdiction over whites,” says Syracuse's Garrow. Tatum says she can't be more than cautiously optimistic: “Endless bureaucracy and more data collection is a way of not dealing with a problem. And a lot of times, training gets mandated but never funded, and nothing happens with those mandates. It would not be uncommon to have requirements that just go by the wayside.”
Ruben's also been thinking about reform. He talks about the importance of continuing the Indian way of life, and not just the way of the streets. “I know fighting isn't the right way,” he tells me. He talks about his respect for one of his elder relatives, who showed him that not all Indians are drunks or fighters. But he's also told me that he'd probably do a severe beatdown for just $500, and only last week he whipped an elbow across the face of a 19-year-old who'd disrespected him.
On my last night with Ruben, we head for a hill in Ponca City. There he stoops into his “church,” a cramped tent that serves as a sweat lodge, where he suffers hours of suffocating heat to give thanks for his people and his life, and to pray that he might do better in it.
THE Small-Pox, which had been a Terror to New-England since first it paid a Visit there, coming into Boston, and spreading there in April, 1721, put the Inhabitants into great Consternation and Disorder. Dr. Mather, in Compassion to the Lives of the People, transcrib'd from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the Accounts sent them by Dr. Timonius and Pyllarinus of inoculating the Small-Pox in the Levant, and sent them to the Practitioners of the Town, for their Consideration thereon. Upon reading of which I was very well pleas'd, and resolv'd in my Mind to try the Experiment; well remembering the Destruction of the Small-Pox made 19 Years before, when last in Boston; and how narrowly I then escap'd with my Life. Now, when my Wife and many others were gone out of Town to avoid the Distemper, and all Hope given up of preventing the further spreading of it, and the Guards were first removed from the Doors of infected Houses, I began the Experiment; and not being able to make it upon my self, (such as my Faith in the Safety and Success of this Method) I chose to make it (for Example sake) upon my own dear Child, and two of my Servants.
JUNE the 26th, 1721. I inoculated my Son Thomas, of about six, my Negro Man, Jack, thrity six, and Jackey, two an half year old. They all complan'd on the 6th Day; upon the 7th, the two Children were a little hot, dull and sleepy, Thomas (only) had twitchings and started in his sleep. The 8th, the Childrens Fevers continued, tommy's twitchings and startings in sleep increased; and tho' the Fever was gentle and his Senses bright, yet as the Practice was new, and the Clamour, or rather Rage of the People against it so violent, that I was put into a very great Fright; and not having any Directions from Dr. Timonius and Pyllarinus concerning this Practice, I had nothing to have Recourse to but Patience, and therefore waited upon Nature for a Crisis (neither my Fears nor the Symptoms abating) until the 9th; when early in the Morning I gave him a Vomit, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the same Day, upon him and the black Child, a kind and favourable Small-Pox came out, of about an hundred a piece; after which their Circumstances became easy, our Trouble was over, and soon they were well.

NEWYORK (MarketWatch) -- The stock market in the week ahead will have its first chance to react to the U.S. payrolls report released on Good Friday, which showed the biggest increase in jobs in three years, adding to evidence that the world's largest economy is on the mend.
And first-quarter earnings season will kick off with four components of the S&P 500 Index reporting results, while retailers will release same-store sales for March.
U.S. stock markets were closed on Friday. In the week through Thursday, all three benchmark stock indexes advanced for a fifth straight week of gains, with oil and other commodities rallying as economic reports from the U.S., Asia and Europe combined to lift hopes of a global recovery. See Thursday's stocks report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% touched the highest level since September 2008, just after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the credit crisis deepened.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index SPX, -0.08% rose 1% for the week to 1,178.10.
The Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.07% rose to 2,402.58, up 0.3% for the week. Five weeks of consecutive gains is the longest string since July 2008.
"We're in a sweet spot," said Keith Goddard, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund CIAOX, -0.08% "The economy is definitely improving. Stocks are not cheap but they're not overly expensive, so we can keep grinding higher."
A strong payrolls report may lead to "some capitulation from whoever left is still thinking the economy is not going to recover," he said.
The Labor Department said Friday that the economy created 162,000 jobs in March. While that headline number missed analyst estimates, it was all due to smaller-than-expected number of hires by the Commerce Department to conduct the census. Analysts focused on private-sector payrolls, which rose more than predicted. Read about payrolls data.
"It's a good number after two years of a horrendous job market," said Thomas Nyheim, a portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust Co. "This jobs report shows companies are starting to hire."
Consumer spending, a crucial component to an economic recovery has been very slow for months but ticked up so far this year, he said.
"There are signs it's emerging again," Nyheim said.
Commodity trading was also shuttered on Friday. Gold futures for June delivery closed Thursday at 1,126.10 an ounce, after making the biggest weekly jump since mid-February. Read about gold futures.
Oil futures topped $85 a barrel, the highest since October 2008. See more on oil, energy.
Rising rates good or bad?
Treasury bonds, one of few markets open on Friday, for a half day, rose during the week. Benchmark 10-year yields TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.27% ended at 3.94%, the highest since October 2008.
Yields on 30-year bonds TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.05% reached 4.80%, the loftiest level seen since October 2007.
Rising yields, while typical in an improving economic environment, could become a concern for investors of all assets if they're rising for the wrong reasons, Goddard said.
"As long as rates are migrating higher because of a healthy economy, that's no problem," he said. "If borrowing costs go up because credit markets are oversaturated with debt or people don't trust buying U.S. government bonds, it could trigger serious problems in the stock market."
Besides payrolls, economic data tends to be thin in the first week of each month. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management's index on the services sectors of the economy is expected to improve modestly, according to economists surveyed by MarketWatch. The ISM survey of the manufacturing sector, released Thursday, rose more than expected to a three-year high. Read about ISM manufacturing.
The next most closely watched a bit of government data will be weekly jobless claims on Thursday.
Next week will also see retailers reporting sales for March, which investors look to as a barometer of consumer spending. Among the heavy hitters are Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, +0.26% Target Corp. TGT, -1.11% Gap Inc. GPS, -1.11% Macy's Inc. M, +1.48% and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, +2.46%
In other corporate news, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.06% put its hotly anticipated iPad on sale starting Saturday, so investors may look for any signals of initial sales strength. Analysts say hundreds of thousands could be sold in the first week alone. See more on Apple's iPad.
While Alcoa kicks off the unofficial start of earnings season on April 12, four S&P 500 members will report this coming week.
Retailers Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, -1.54% and Family Dollar Stores Inc. FDO, +1.59% report on Wednesday, as does agricultural giant Monsanto Co. MON, +114.29%
Alcoholic-beverage giant Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, +1.35% reports on Friday.
The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for the first quarter is 36%, according to Thomson Reuters. The ratio of negative-to-positive preannouncements for the S&P 500 for the quarter is 1.3. The long-term average is 2.1.
Still, as the Dow approaches 11,000 and stocks have had a good run, some have questioned how much higher they can go before the inevitable correction.
"We're not looking for much upside but we're not looking for much downside," Nyheim said. "If the market returns 10% for the year and has done 5% already, we'd look for slow growth in the market for the next three quarters."

[The team at Muse Games reflect son the development of its 3D action title Guns of Icarus, providing a look at the successes and challenges of indie game development.]
Having produced a few tiny games with the Unity engine, which was pretty new at the time, we -- the Muse Games team -- felt confident enough to do embark on a more challenging project. We put our two previous games, Extreme Sledding and Elementia, up on our site for people to play for free. These made no money, and we realized that ad revenue alone could never come close to sustaining us.
We started Guns of Icarus the same way we started everything else: saying, "It would be cool if..." In the case of Guns of Icarus, we thought of those moments in typical shooters where you get to briefly use the big mounted turrets, and thought that sensation could be made into a whole game itself. Guns, fire, explosions, and above all a sense of urgency and power -- just seems like the right thing to do. This dovetailed with our concept for a ruined world with large diesel-punk airships and bands of marauding air-pirates patrolling the wastes. Over a few conversations, scribbled notes, and sketches, the idea of Guns of Icarus started taking shape.
We didn't have a lot of money, and we knew that there wasn't anything else we'd rather do than make games. With a limited budget, we set a target of four months to develop the game. We were able to keep to our target, and craft a set of core gameplay mechanics that resonated well with players. We spent another month and a half testing and polishing before we put it up on our site. We envisioned a lot more for the game, but our budgetary constraints enforced discipline and a small scope. We just had to start somewhere and see where it takes us.
Initially after the release of the game on our own site, no one knew about Guns of Icarus, because no one knew about Muse Games. But things really changed in a big way when the game released on Steam, and then the Mac App Store. This is not the post-mortem of an IGF finalist, but it is one for a game that sold tens of thousands of copies and got featured on multiple platforms. Guns of Icarus was one of the first Unity games released on Steam. It ended up being successful and profitable enough for us as a small indie team to keep making games, and to have the opportunity to make Guns of Icarus Online -- the game we always wanted the original to be.
Concept sketches. Emily did concepts like these on notepads mostly. We used them get an overall sense of look and feel and art direction without having to spend a lot of time, and we transitioned to creating 3D assets quickly.
What Went Right
1. Clear Scope And Goals For Features, And Project Management
We laid out a few major features early on, and knew that we had to focus on those first and foremost to get the game out on the schedule we set. There were a lot of other ideas thrown around during development, but the ones that weren't absolutely essential to our core gameplay had to be tabled for later. "We'll do it in Guns 2" became a running joke, and maybe a way to vent our more ridiculous dreams without obsessing over them at the cost of more important things. In the end, while the game could have benefited from more features as well as content, its success gave us the opportunity to now actually realize those loftier goals. If we did not keep to our budget and scope, what we are doing today would not have been possible.
However, as we will detail later on in "What Went Wrong," the balance between building a game within scope and on schedule vs. more content and polish was a constant struggle and dilemma, and there were also negative consequences to the approach we took.
2. Our World Is Flat
We don't have a star game designer, producer, or artist on our team. We don't have a guy or a girl from a big studio with years and years of experience, where we can turn to that person and just nod our heads knowing everything will be okay because he or she said so. Maybe as a result, no one had a big head. It is actually pretty easy to build consensus without politics, ego, and personal agendas. We add to each other's ideas, and we argue like hell sometimes, but everything we do, we do it together. We don't really buy the argument that the buck always has to stop at someone. People might see this and laugh, but it works for us. A great idea can come from anywhere, anyone, at anytime. This way, we can harness it and not let anything go to waste.
We may not have a whole lot of experience making games, but we have a lot experience playing games. So for the team to buy into an idea, it's really quite simple. Is it cool enough to get people really pumped? If we execute on the idea, how would we as players feel? With Guns of Icarus, we developed a shared creative vision and bought into it completely very early on. Guns was a collective effort in so many ways, and it couldn't have happened any other way.
Scene: The office of a IT consulting firm. The wind is blowing hard, the sun is setting, but one group of cowboy programmers is working tirelessly through the night because….. well, because that's what the industry expects.
Programmer X gets a ping from his boss, using the latest and greatest chat tool, Slack, that uses 200GB of memory and crashes his PC everytime he gets a message. It does so again, so he can't read the message. He decides to go see his boss.
He opens the boss' door, only to see his boss quickly close his browser window and pull up his zip. With too much haste, X thinks.
“What?” says his boss. “I'm working.”
“Yeah, I didn't see your message. Slack crashed again, and killed my PC.”
“Okay,” said the boss. “It's my niece's birthday next week. She is 7 years old now. My sister wants me to make a website for her. One that will wish her happy birthday. Can you do that?”
“Sure,” said X. “Of course we can.”
X goes back and calls a meeting for the next day.
“We need to build a website for the boss' niece. How do we start?”
“Well,” said the engineers, “first we need to decide on the stack.”
They spent the next 2 weeks discussing which stack to use, and decided to come up with a list.
This was just the frontend:
1997: Let's make a website!
*fires up vi* 2007: Let's make a website!
*downloads jQuery*
*fires up vi* 2017: Let's make a website!
😵 pic.twitter.com/RT4VVnJjNS — Thomas Fuchs (@thomasfuchs) February 22, 2017
“Okay, now that we have front end, let's get started.”
3 months later
Scene: The boss' office. The boss is angry. He had ordered chicken tikka masala sandwich with extra pickles, but they gave him tikka masala sandwich with normal pickles. He's pissed.
And then he remembers something.
“X, 3 months ago I asked you to build a simple website for my niece. Where the hell is it?”
“Well sir, we follow test driven development. We are still writing the tests and creating mocks. We should be finished soon.”
“What?! Are you kiddin', right? Get out!”
X knows why his boss is angry. He knows they should not have used Fad.js, they should have used Even-More-Fad.js.
6 Months after Project Start
The front end was ready. But they still needed a backend. So X called another meeting.
“Right, we need to write the backend now, people. Suggestions on which framework?”
20 engineers gave him 20 suggestions. Basically, everyone chose the one they felt would help them get a better job.
After a week of arguing, they found out about a new programming language, released jointly by Google and Facebook called We Know All Your Naughty Secrets Script.
So of course they had to use it.
X fanatsised about how he'd finally be able to work at Face-oogle after this project.
1 year after start of project
X was sweating. The project had not been going well.
We Know All Your Naughty Secrets Script had a lot of bugs, and they had been working tirelessly to fix them. In effect doing free labour for Facebook/Google.
Which meant they hadn't written a single line of code for their original project.
But X knew success was just around the corner.
That's when his boss called him in.
“X, you idiot, I asked you to build a website for my niece an year ago. What the hell have you been doing?”
“Well sir, it's almost finished. Another 2 weeks. At most.”
“Forget it. In the last year, she learned a bit of HTML and Javascript. She has built the site herself.”
X was shocked.
A HTML website? Who the hell did that?
“But sir, that's outrageous. How did she test the site?”
“She opened it in a browser.”
“But how did she mock the backend database? How will she integrate it social media? What about caching? Load balancing? What happens if the content delivery network is down? What if she wants to turn it into a Single Page App that dynamically updates user data?”
“Get out, you idiot!”
X went back to his desk and wrote a long rant on Reddit about how these kids just entering programming had no standards, and how they were ruining the industry.
He got a thousand upvotes. Everyone agreed standards had gone down.

The Job Interview From Hell
10.37pm BST
We're going to wrap up the blog now, but here's a quick summary of the events of the day first:
Clashes between police and protesters erupted after tens of thousands of people took part in protests in Madrid. The demonstrations, organised by the Spanish indignados group, were called to protest at the country's austerity measures and to call for new elections in Spain.
After a peaceful start (see 17.13), there were clashes between riot police and some demonstrators, which included officers using batons on the crowds (see 19.15, 18.30) and then plastic bullets (20.01)
In other news across the eurozone, ECB president Mario Draghi called on European leaders to take decisive steps to ease the crisis (see 14.39 onwards) and there were reports that the IMF might withhold its aid payments for Greece until the issue of debt restructuring is resolved (see 17.52).
In an interview with CNN, during a trip to the US, the Italian President Mario Monti said he will not run for elections which are expected in the Spring. He also said that he hopes Italy won't need to ask for bond aid (see 21.20)

The Halifax Regional Police forensic identification unit and the medical examiner are on the scene of a suspicious death on Cook Avenue in Halifax.
Officers were called to a home in the 6900 block around 8:00 p.m. on Sunday, where they found the body of a man, who they believe to be in his late 20s.
At least six police vehicles were still on the scene around 9:30 p.m. The K-9 unit was also called.
Monday morning investigators were taking pictures and appear to be looking for fingerprints on the front door of the home, officers are also examining a vehicle parked in the driveway.
Police have closed a section of Cook Avenue where it meets Romans Avenue.
Residents who live in the neighbourhood said police with guns drawn came to their doors to tell them to stay inside.
"I went over shopping and I came over to Romans Avenue, and there was a cop right at the end there with the lights flashing," said Shirley McDougall.
"I'm kind of worried now, because I know a lot of people on this street."
Colleen Murphy Jones said police told her that she was safe but the investigation would take some time.

PHOENIX — President Donald Trump faces a decision on Tuesday evening with profound implications for his already strained relationship with the GOP: whether to attack a vulnerable Republican senator on his home turf.
White House officials won't say exactly what's on Trump's agenda when he holds a campaign-style rally here. But it's widely expected he will go after GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, a loud critic of the president who recently published an anti-Trump manifesto, “Conscience of a Conservative.”
Story Continued Below
Whatever he says about Flake, the president is clearly determined to send a message. State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, who is weighing a primary challenge against Flake, will join the president on Air Force One on Tuesday, according to two people briefed on the plans. And the daughter of another potential GOP candidate, former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham, is slated to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.
In the days leading up to Trump's Arizona trip, Senate GOP leaders have implicitly warned Trump that attacking Flake, who faces a treacherous path to reelection, would only serve to further rupture his relationship with a congressional GOP wing that he's grown increasingly isolated from in recent weeks. It came after Trump, in a tweet after the Phoenix event was announced, called Flake “toxic.” The president had earlier threatened to spend as much as $10 million to take out the incumbent Republican.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Majority Whip John Cornyn, and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner all declared that Flake had their full support.
On Tuesday morning, Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with McConnell, will amp the pressure. The group is set to release a blistering digital ad campaign that targets Kelli Ward, a conservative former state senator and Flake primary opponent who Trump praised in a tweet last week.
The ad paints Ward as an extreme figure with “crazy ideas” who engages in “embarrassing behavior.”
People close to the group describe the offensive as part of a broader effort to show that any Trump-led push to undermine Flake, or any GOP incumbent, for that matter, won't go uncontested.
"We're not willing to throw this Senate seat away to Democrats by nominating a fringe candidate like Kelli Ward," said Steven Law, Senate Leadership Fund's president and a former McConnell chief of staff. The group is spending over $10,000 on the ad, which will be geo-targeted to people who attend the rally and will run for three days.
Law said he had not yet decided how much to spend to defend the senator but that he had begun talking to Republican Party donors about the race.
Trump's fixation with Flake has been on display for months. Backstage before a campaign rally last fall, Trump raged to associates about the senator, who refused to endorse him. This year, the White House has met privately with three actual or prospective Flake primary opponents. One of Trump's top campaign aides, David Bossie, has privately spoken to a former Republican congressman, Matt Salmon, about his interest in running.
And one of Trump's top donors, the reclusive billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, has donated $300,000 to a pro-Ward super PAC — with more possibly on the way.
Trump's decision to venture to Flake's home state goes to what senior Republicans say is a much deeper concern: that the president seems more interested in exacting revenge against members of his own party than defeating Democrats. It is highly unusual for the president to openly campaign against a sitting member of his own party, let alone someone as vulnerable as Flake.
Yet he is not the only Republican in Trump's cross hairs. Earlier this summer, as the health care debate consumed Washington, a White House-sanctioned super PAC launched an attack against another endangered Republican senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, over his reluctance to support the legislation. During a meeting at the White House to discuss the legislation with the Senate GOP Conference, the president appeared to joke about Heller's political circumstances. “Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?” Trump asked.
“The president needs to decide not only on Tuesday but over the next 14 months whether he wants to help grow the Republican majority in Congress or whether he wants to engage in personal feuds that ultimately only help Chuck Schumer,” said Brian Walsh, a former top NRSC official. “It's perplexed and frustrated many Republicans that the president hasn't put his well-earned political capital to use in those states against the Democrats and instead has focused his energy and attention against the very senators whose support he needs today.”
Yet within the White House, there has been angst about how to handle the race — and particularly over Trump's decision to promote Ward, who is widely regarded as a subpar candidate. Ward received just 39 percent of the vote when she unsuccessfully challenged GOP Sen. John McCain in 2016, and she recently came under fire for saying that McCain should step down “as quickly as possible” following his brain cancer diagnosis — remarks that were widely panned as insensitive.

By highlighting Ward — as opposed to one of the other potential candidates considering a primary bid, such as stateDeWit or Graham — some White House aides are convinced that Trump may have actually made it harder to unseat Flake. There has been so much consternation over the issue that rally organizers have sought to deny Ward a speaking slot at the rally or even a seat in the VIP section, three people involved in the planning the event said. Ward, they worry, could use such prime real estate to advance the idea the president supports her.
GOP concerns about Trump's Arizona rally go beyond Flake. Many in the party are worried that he will use the event to pardon controversial former Maricopa County Sherriff Joe Arpaio, an immigration hard-liner who in July was convicted of criminal contempt in a racial profiling case. Trump has said he's considering a pardon, but it could reignite racial tensions that flared after the violence in Charlottesville, when Trump equated white supremacists with counterprotesters.
In the run-up to the event, Arizona officials said they were preparing for the worst and promised a substantial law enforcement presence.
Vice President Mike Pence is slated to join Trump at the rally, as is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, though some other senior Republicans are staying away. Neither Flake nor McCain is expected to attend. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey, who is thought to have national aspirations, will greet Trump at the Phoenix airport but won't attend the event.
“Gov. Ducey's focus has been working with law enforcement toward a safe event in downtown Phoenix for all those involved and in the area,” said the governor's deputy chief of staff. “That will continue to be his priority during the event and afterwards.”
Forensic Science International recently published an eye-opening study on a new generation of synthetic cannabinoids that have become popular as ‘legal highs', provided by a highly organised neuroscience-savvy industry that is ready and waiting with new compounds before the law changes.
The study concerns several legal smoking mixtures, ‘Spice‘ being the most well-known (pictured), which were recently found to contain synthetic cannabinoids.
Cannabinoids are named for their abundance in the cannabis plant, but this class of substance also naturally occurs in the nervous system as part of the normal biological signalling system. In fact, the street drug cannabis has its effect because its various cannabinoids, the most famous being THC, target one or more of the brain's cannabinoid receptors.
Marijuana and its derivatives are illegal in most countries but the brain's cannabinoid system is complex and so it is possible to synthesise other types of drugs in the same class as the plant's active ingredients, which target the same receptor sites, that have similar effects, but which are completely legal.
Although officially labelled as incense and not for human consumption, Spice was typically marketed as one of the many ‘herbal smoking mixtures' which traditionally have been sold in head shops on the basis of their druggy associations despite having no psychoactive effects to speak of.
However, this brand became wildly popular and in 2008 scientific analysis found that it also contained the synthetic cannabinoids CP 47,497-C8 and JWH-018 which are structurally similar to THC.
I can't imagine what it was like when this was first discovered. It reminds me of the hair bristling moment in movies when the scientists discover that some form of ultra-advanced technology is behind a spate of odd occurrences.
You see, drugs like speed, heroine, cocaine and ecstasy require legally controlled raw materials but the processing stage is low-tech. That's why some types of speed are called ‘bathtub crank', because some of it is literally synthesised in a bathtub, as images of meth lab busts illustrate.
But this is not the case with cannabinoids which require a complex and careful lab process with many stages and sometimes the separation of mirror image molecules (enantiomers) from each other as only one of the ‘reflections' is desirable.
These are not trivial process. They can't be done in back rooms and they can't be done by amateurs.
What's more, these aren't just copy-cat syntheses done by your average underground lab who know the illicit process and just want to recreate it. These are new compounds, perhaps reported only a handful of times in the scientific literature and selected for their specific effect on the brain.
The authors of the Forensic Science International paper note “It is evident that the producers of these products have gone about in a very methodical manner to mine the scientific literature for promising psychoactive compounds. Most likely the published CB1 binding affinities were exploited as primary criterion.”
CB1 is a specific type of cannabinoid receptor and is the one most activated by THC, the principal active ingredient in marijuana, and it seems the producers were making their selections based on their knowledge of neuroscience and psychopharmacology.
Several countries have now banned, or are in the process of banning, the synthetic cannabinoids found in Spice and related products. In fact, Germany was particularly quick off the mark and outlawed the products in January 2009.
Now this is where it gets interesting because the researchers note that a new product appeared on the market, containing JWH-073 – another synthetic cannabinoid, within four weeks of the ban. JWH-073 has similar similar effects, but isn't covered by the law and so remains legal.
The speed at which it appeared suggests that it had been selected and synthesised in advance, in anticipation of the ban:
Our analysis demonstrated that just 4 weeks after the prohibition took effect a multitude of second generation products were flooding the market. The speed of introduction of new products and the use of JWH-073 as a substitute for JWH-018 not only showed that the producers are well aware of the legal frameworks, but that they likely anticipated the prohibition and already had an array of replacement products on hand (JWH-073-positive products are still available on the German market; last checked: June 5th, 2009).
In other words, the legal high industry is packing neuroscientists and heavyweight lab pharmacologists. It is no longer just head-shop hippies repackaging obscure psychoactive and barely recreational plants as a poor substitute for street drugs. The legal high industry has become professionalised.
Seemingly based on the model of the pharmaceutical industry, it is becoming science-led, regulation savvy and is out-manoeuvring the authorities well before they catch up.
To use drug war terminology, it's an interesting new front because the producers are not trying to evade capture, they're using the agility of science of evade regulation.

Anti gay marriage activist Virginie Tellene, aka Frigide Barjot (C) take part in a demonstration of the movement 'La Manif Pour Tous' (Demonstration for all !), opposed to same-sex marriage in Paris, on April 12, 2013. France's upper house Senate voted today to approve a landmark bill granting homosexual couples the right to marry and adopt, after a heated debate and mass protests from conservatives and religious groups. AFP PHOTO / FRED DUFOUR (Photo credit should read FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images)
For the past several months, equal marriage supporters around the world have watched with excitement as a marriage and adoption equality bill winds its way through France's parliament. The French people strongly endorse same-sex marriage, and support for the right of married gay and lesbian couples to jointly adopt children sits just shy of 50 percent.
France's Senate voted Friday to approve the landmark bill, but because it made minor changes to the adoption portion, the National Assembly must vote to approve the measure one more time before President François Hollande can sign it into law, which he has promised to do. Also on Friday, Hollande's Socialist Party announced that the final vote -- originally scheduled for May 20 -- would instead be held the following Wednesday, April 17, keeping marriage and adoption equality on track to become law in France by summer.
But the push for equality has an ugly underbelly: hundreds of thousands of anti-equality protesters have marched through the streets of Paris, the nation's Catholic bishops have denounced the proposed law, and the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), a U.S.-based anti-gay organization, has taken a leading role in organizing the opposition, which consists mostly of Roman Catholics and conservatives. And as the marriage equality bill moves closer to passage, brutal and bloody attacks on LGBT people have surged: the head of a French anti-homophobia organization told Raw Story this week that reports of anti-gay assaults in the first two months of 2013 were up by 200 percent.
When Hollande's government announced the fast-tracked final vote on Friday, several proponents of marriage discrimination responded with disturbing and violent threats. Frigide Barjot, leader of "mainstream" anti-equality group Manif pour tous, vowed, "Hollande wants blood, and he will get it."
The threat marks a stark reversal from statements Barjot made just two days prior, when she claimed in the wake of a particularly savage anti-gay hate crime that her side "[denounces] violence."
Christian Jacob, a deputy from the right-wing UMP party, echoed Barjot's inflammatory words, warning that by speeding up the bill's near-certain passage, Hollande "is risking a violent confrontation with the French people." Fellow UMP parliamentarian Hervé Mariton added that the move was "an incitement to civil war."
France's gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community will find out in a matter of days whether these homophobes intend to make good on their chilling promises.
I wonder, do the French Catholic bishops and NOM -- responsible for stirring up much of this anti-gay fervor -- endorse their allies' vulgar threats and violent attacks? If not, the clock is running out for both groups to issue a forceful and unequivocal condemnation.
A beard-second is a measurement of length based on the distance that a beard hair grows in one second of time. This is similar, in structure though not in quantitative value, to a light-year, which is a measurement of length equal to the distance that light travels in one year. While a light-year is a very long distance, due to the tremendous speed of light, the beard-second is quite small since hair grows at a very slow rate. The exact length that this equals is the basis for some debate, and some sources cite it at about 10 nanometers (nm) while other sources use only 5 nm.
There are a number of ridiculous or unnecessarily complicated measurements used, often unofficially, in physics and engineering. In quantum physics, and other disciplines that use extremely small measurements of distance and space, one such measurement is the beard-second. There are two different values that can be used for the beard-second, based on the fact that beard follicles can grow at different rates on different people. The larger of the two measurements is 10 nm, while the smaller measurement is 5 nm in length; a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter (m), or about three-billionths of a foot, in length.
He dominated the 90s with hits such as Trainspotting and The Full Monty, but has spent the past 10 years avoiding blockbusters. Now he's back as the director, and accidental star, of Glaswegian comedy The Legend of Barney Thomson
Robert Carlyle walks into the room holding a small, pale pink alarm clock. Not, it turns out, a way of keeping tabs on how long he has to put up with me, but a present from Lorraine Kelly, whose TV show he's just come from. “That's going in my daughter's bedroom later,” he says, with an hint of paternal triumph.
If being invited on to breakfast TV is any guide, Carlyle is still riding the wave of admiration, respect and popularity he earned in the mid-90s, when first Trainspotting and then The Full Monty propelled him to household-name status. But in truth, he's been off the film-making grid for a while now, having spent the best part of the past decade in Canada, working in what he calls “American TV-land”. Not seen much of him lately? That means you haven't been watching Stargate Universe, in which Carlyle played a hunky scientist, or Once Upon a Time, a glossy, meta-fairytale fantasy show with Carlyle camping it up as a human/goblin hybrid called Rumplestiltskin. (In the latter series, which popped on Channel 5 for a year or two, he even had a Ross-and-Rachel-style multi-episode romance with Belle, from Beauty and the Beast, of inordinate interest to the show's legions of fans. Google “RumBelle”. I dare you.)
It's safe to say this is not where we might have imagined Carlyle to have fetched up.

Intense, articulate, and roiling with a sense of barely contained aggression, Carlyle's progress has been almost a cautionary tale for the British film industry. He rode the wave of the UK's burgeoning cinematic confidence in the 1990s, making it to the big league by the end of the decade: playing a Bond villain in The World Is Not Enough, heading for Hollywood with The Beach, propping up classy art cinema with Angela's Ashes. The righteous fury he evinced appeared to splinter during the frustrating 2000s, in which his efforts to fight the good fight foundered in a string of underperforming films and stalled production ventures. Now 54, his accent entirely undiluted by seven years in Vancouver, he seems mellow enough, and happy with his lot, even if his centre-parting, floppy-hair gives him a slight but disconcerting resemblance to Lol Creme.

Carlyle is back on the industry treadmill because, of all things, he has directed a film. The Legend of Barney Thomson, based on a series of novels by Doug Lindsay, is his feature-film directing debut (though he did get to direct an episode of Stargate Universe in 2010). It's very much a love letter to Glasgow, his home city, but it's far from the Ken Loach-style slice of angry social complaint that we might have expected from him. In fact, Barney Thomson is a comedy, albeit a pitch-black one, with copious gruesome murders and a deranged turn from Emma Thompson, playing Carlyle's foul-mouthed, chip-guzzling, cigarette-sucking mum.
“I've always loved comedy,” says Carlyle. “It's something I've not done an awful lot of, because I keep getting offered psychos. I'm not knocking the psychos – they pay the rent – but the biggest successes I had were comedic, if you think about it. The Full Monty is a comedy, and Trainspotting – well, Trainspotting is not exactly a comedy, but the part is.”

Yes, the psychos. He means the type of damaged, dangerous individual to which his acting persona has been irrevocably, if not entirely justifiably, yoked. Franco Begbie, Trainspotting's ultraviolent armed robber, may be a monstrous creation, but it gave Carlyle his initial dose of celebrity, which he is still not entirely comfortable with. “It was a false dawn, Cool Britannia or whatever it was. I hate even to say the words. I was fortunate to be in the centre of it, people like the Gallaghers and Damon Albarn were my friends. It was a fantastic time in my life, and I'm glad I went through it. But you wake up and think: what happened? Did it mean anything at all?”
There has always been a gentler side to his acting too – the homeless jobbing builder he played in Riff-Raff, Ken Loach's film that was his first significant role; the Hamish Macbeth TV show that gave him his first mainstream audience; the ex-steelworker from The Full Monty, and the ex-alcoholic carer in the 2008 film Summer. The latter, directed by Kenny Glenaan and set, like The Full Monty, in Sheffield, marked something of a watershed for Carlyle, when his frustrations with the British film world finally boiled over.

“In the mid-90s, there was a feeling of exuberance, anything was possible. By the time Summer comes along, the country isn't looking like that any more. I'd seen that budgets had got squeezed and squeezed and squeezed – and on Summer there was no money left in the kitty to publicise the film. Kenny had done a brilliant job on it, and the cast had put heart and soul into it – but nobody's going to see it. I thought: I'm throwing an awful lot into this, and there's not an awful lot coming back.” Hence, he says, he came to the decision to actively seek out more lucrative work. “I'd spent my whole career doing small, low-budget films. I thought: I need to make some money here, for the sake of my family.”
His change of tack, he says, wasn't just about money; doing the bigger films “don't feed your soul”. The boredom got to him on The World Is Not Enough, for example: he says he spent two and a half days sitting around waiting to do a shot of him just running down a corridor. “Don't get me wrong, I had a great time doing it, but that ain't what I become an actor for. Film-making was becoming more and more like that, and I couldn't stand it.” He also says he appreciates the more intensive acting TV calls for: “you're on all day, and your arc is just a lot more satisfying.”But his efforts on The Legend of Barney Thomson show that film does have its pulling power, even if he says he had to be backed into a corner to take it on.

It had been floating about as an acting job for years, he says, and there was nothing doing until a Canadian producer friend told him about a “Glasgow script” he should read, and “it was Barney Thomson, again. I thought: this thing's just never going to go away.” His eureka moment was working out why the script hadn't worked for him in the past: though the original novels were by a Scot, the adapter, Richard Cowan, was Canadian. (“He is a good guy, but he's not from where I'm from.”) That was Carlyle's cue to bring in a Glaswegian writer, Colin McLaren, and after the pair of them had worked on the script, it became a goer. He says he signed up to directing it without realising – “everyone said: this is great, Robert Carlyle directing and acting. I said: ‘What do you mean? I didn't say that.' My back was against the wall. Then I thought: nobody knows this as well as me, so maybe it is going to be OK.”
Working on the project has given Carlyle the opportunity to pay cinematic homage to his home turf in the east end of Glasgow; 95% of the locations, he says – such as the Barrowland ballroom, the Shawfield greyhound track and the Bridgeton umbrella – are within a one-mile radius. “It is a love of the city,” he says, “and it's almost like documenting it for the future, because I think most of these places will be gone in five or 10 years.”

It's a natural segue to talking about his childhood, when his father used to take him to the cinema four or five times a week, after his mother left them. “My dad used to say: this is to take your mind off what's missing. I used to sit there looking at my dad and think: it was to take his mind off the whole thing as well.” His dad, he says, loved westerns; Carlyle says that British films of the time – the late 50s and early 60s – became a big favourite. “Hopefully quite a bit of that is in Barney Thomson.”
It seems as if Carlyle is in a mellowing mood generally. The tightly wound, total-immersion actor who once slept on the streets to prepare for a role (Safe), or learned how to drive a bus (Carla's Song) beginning to recede into the past. “I still take it very seriously,” he says, pointing out he spent a lot of time in a barber with “a wee guy called Davey” who taught him how to hold scissors and use a razor. He also says the signature moves of his favourite Glaswegian variety acts – Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy, Jimmy Logan – have found their way into Once Upon a Time's Rumplestiltskin. “But you're right,” he says, “I have mellowed a bit. I'd think more than twice about going out on the streets 'gain. But that was my past, that was my grounding. That was me earning my stripes.”

The Astros already have addressed two of their biggest needs by acquiring a pair of impact left-handed bats in trading for catcher Brian McCann from the Yankees -- and paying him $23 million of the $34 million left on his contract -- and signing outfielder Josh Reddick to a four-year, $52 million deal. Houston also inked veteran starting pitcher Charlie Morton to a two-year, $14 million deal, plus incentives.
HOUSTON -- If everything goes the way Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow has scripted it, Houston will have the luxury of having its major offseason moves done by the start of the Winter Meetings, freeing the club to focus on complementary pieces.

Houston also inked veteran starting pitcher Charlie Morton to a two-year, $14 million deal, plus incentives.
The Astros still are in the market for another impact bat in their effort to beef up their offense and would like to land 39-year-old switch-hitting outfielder Carlos Beltran. The addition of one more bat would give the Astros one of the deepest lineups in the Majors following a 2016 season in which the lineup was top-heavy.

Fans can catch live streaming of all news conferences and manager availability on MLB.com, including the Rule 5 Draft on Thursday at 8 a.m. CT.
Club needs
Starting pitching: The signing of Morton gives the Astros experienced depth, but you can never have enough pitching. The club is banking on healthy seasons from Dallas Keuchel and Lance McCullers and another step forward from Joe Musgrove. Collin McHugh and Mike Fiers both made 30-plus starts last season, so there are definitely options. Still, there's room for another arm to compete, even if they don't land one of the big names on the trade market. They've been linked to free-agent lefty Rich Hill.
Outfield: The Astros are targeting Beltran, which would add some versatility to an outfield that already has plenty. Reddick can play the corner, with George Springer playing center or right field. Norichika Aoki and Jake Marisnick can also play multiple positions, but a chance to add a bat like Beltran to the mix would be something the Astros couldn't pass up.
Video: Reddick excited to contribute on offense and defense
Bullpen: After upgrading their bullpen in each of the last two offseasons -- Luke Gregerson and Pat Neshek in 2015 and trading for Ken Giles and re-signing Tony Sipp in 2016 -- the Astros could look to add another left-handed arm in support of Sipp, who struggled last season (4.95 ERA, 12 homers in 43 2/3 innings).
Who they can trade if necessary
OF Preston Tucker: Tucker, a left-handed bat with power, has some tools, as evidenced by his 2015 rookie season. He's coming off what was basically a lost year, though, after battling a shoulder injury that led to surgery. He's expected to be healthy in time for Spring Training and might find at-bats hard to come by in Houston with the additions the club has made this offseason.
1B A.J. Reed: The Astros' former top prospect had a disappointing debut in 2016 and was out of shape at season's end. Marwin Gonzalez would up playing more first base down the stretch, and Colin Moran and Tyler White will be in the mix at first base as well. With Yulieski Gurriel capable of starting at first, the Astros could try to package Reed in a trade for pitching.
RHPs Musgrove/Francis Martes/Brady Rodgers: If the Astros are able to acquire an impact starter, they're going to have to trade one or more of their multiple young arms. Musgrove has impeccable control and will be in Houston's rotation if he's not dealt. Martes is a hard-throwing premium prospect knocking on the door of the big leagues, and Rodgers was the Triple-A Pacific Coast League's Pitcher of the Year last season before making his MLB debut.
IF Alex Bregman: The Astros don't want to trade Bregman, and who could blame them? He overcame a slow start at the plate last season and wound up having a solid rookie campaign in the heart of Houston's batting order. Bregman has star potential, which is why they would likely have to include him in a trade if they want some of the big-name arms on the market, like Chris Sale of the White Sox or the Rays' Chris Archer.
Top prospects
Per MLBPipeline.com, the Astros' top 10 prospects are Martes, outfielder Kyle Tucker, right-handers Forrest Whitley and David Paulino, outfielders Derek Fisher and Daz Cameron, Moran, outfielder Teoscar Hernandez, right-hander Franklin Perez and infielder Miguelangel Sierra.
Paulino, Moran and Hernandez made their debuts last season and will be in camp battling for roster spots in 2017. Martes, the hard-throwing right-hander, could be Houston's next star prospect to hit Minute Maid Park, if he's not traded. Expect him to make his debut at some point next year and be a rotation fixture in 2018. Fisher could reach the Majors in 2017, as well.
Rule 5 Draft
The Astros' 40-man roster is at 38 players, freeing them up to make a Rule 5 Draft pick if they desire. They haven't picked a player in the Rule 5 Draft and held onto him since they took relief pitcher Josh Fields with the No.1 overall pick in 2012. As their Major League roster gets deeper, it gets harder to expect a prospect to stick on the big league club for an entire season.

Big contracts they might unload
None. The biggest deal the Astros have handed out since Luhnow took over five years ago is Reddick's deal last week. That makes him the highest-paid player on the club for 2017, if you account for the money the Yankees took back in the deal Houston used to acquire McCann.
Payroll summary
The Astros' payroll, which has been among the lowest in baseball the last five years, should push north of $100 million for the first time since 2009. The club has made recent big-money commitments to Gurriel (five years, $47.5 million), Reddick and McCann ($11.5 million in each of the next two years), with some heavyweights due for big raises in arbitration this offseason. Former Cy Young winner Keuchel is projected to earn $9.5 million next year by MLBTradeRumors.com. Aoki ($6.8 million projected), a non-tender candidate, Fiers ($4.3 million projected), McHugh ($4.6 million projected) and Springer ($4.7 million projected) will help push the payroll to new heights under Luhnow.

NEW DELHI: Telecom majors Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are at it again, squabbling over offering of services on prepaid connections in Jammu and Kashmir , which are currently suspended in the state.While Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel is offering incoming calls on prepaid connections in the state, Bharti Airtel has countered that the new entrant has continued mobile services by disguising prepaid connections as postpaid ones.The Zonal Police headquarters in Kashmir on May 27 directed telecom operators to stop all data services on mobile phones and all services on prepaid connections.According to sources, in its compliance letter submitted before Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, on May 29, Jio alleged that Airtel has allowed incoming calls for prepaid subscribers in clear violation of the government order issued by IGP Kashmir.The company has demanded "stringent action" against Airtel for non-compliance and violation of government order in the submission.When contacted Airtel denied the charge and responded with counter-allegation that Jio has violated rules in the states by disguising pre-paid connections as post-paid ones to bypass the the order."These allegations are completely false, baseless and only go to highlight the growing frustration of Jio. We would urge Jio to gather all the facts and not resort to kite flying. Airtel has always been and will continue to be in full compliance of all regulations and guidelines," Airtel spokesperson said.Airtel said that Just because it has raised the issue of Jio's blatant violation of regulations in Jammu & Kashmir by terming prepaid subscribers as postpaid, "thereby compromising national security, Jio is cooking up these false allegations to divert attention from the issue."The incumbent operator said it would once again urge the authorities to take the strictest possible action against Jio for their complete disregard of the regulations.A day after Reliance Jio made submission, Bharti Airtel too filed the complaint against the new entrant before the DoT alleging that Jio "in gross violation of the license conditions, claims 95 per cent of its subscriber base (approximately 7 Lakh customers) as postpaid, even though such subscribers are actually prepaid subscribers".The incumbent operator alleged that Jio is "tactically and deliberately" tagging pre-paid customer as as postpaid "for its economic gain and competitive advantage, at the cost of national security and putting the lives of our security forces in danger."Jio denied the allegations calling them "completely baseless, malicious and tantamount to wilful disparagement against RJIL", adding that the letter sent by Airtel to the DoT seems to be an act of retaliation, and nothing more."RJIL has always abided by the instructions issued by the local authorities... National security is of utmost importance to us, and we will always walk the extra mile to ensure that we are fully compliant and take requisite precautions in our services. We reject the instant complaint with the contempt it deserves," Jio said.It added that Airtel's move is a clear demonstration of use of false propaganda when competitors are unable to compete in the marketplace.A Reliance Jio spokesperson said: "It is worthwhile to also mention here that RJIL had escalated the issue of Airtel allowing incoming calls for their prepaid subscribers in the Kashmir valley despite written order on record from the Government of Jammu & Kashmir earlier this month to stop all prepaid services in the Kashmir Valley."This was a clear violation of Government Order completely disregarding security concerns of the Government."The new entrant said that it will be responding to the allegations in detail, factually and legally establishing its compliance with applicable regulations.Besides, it said it would independently examine and initiate appropriate legal recourse available to it as well.
In a single, chaotic day, Houston's reported 2017 tally of Zika cases appeared to double.
On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that six pregnant women in Harris County have tested positive for the mosquito-borne illness, bringing the definitive year-to-date number for Houston-area Zika cases up to 11. It's unclear at this point if any of these women's babies will suffer from microcephaly — the birth defect, present in about 5 percent of Zika cases, that causes infants to be born with small heads.
These latest infections were first detected by Legacy Community Health, a nonprofit that provides health care to underserved communities in Texas. Kevin Nix, a spokesman for Legacy, said the cases date from late 2016 until early this year. It took some time for the state and the federal government to confirm the findings, he said.

“I want to make it clear: It wasn't just like, all of a sudden, there were six,” Nix said. “But all the final confirmations on the tests came back in May.”
So far, all of Houston's Zika infections — included these six latest incidents — have come from people who traveled to Zika hot spots in Central America, South America or the Caribbean. Nix didn't specify which countries these six women had visited but stressed the cases were “all travel-related.”
Until Thursday, there were five cases of Zika confirmed in 2017 for Houston, with confirmation dates ranging from January through March, according to the Houston Health Department. One man and four women, all of whom had traveled to Mexico or El Salvador, were found to have the illness.
If these newest cases had been locally transmitted — or if six infections had been discovered all at once — that would have been far more serious, Nix said. He expressed concern that some news reports on the findings, including a Houston Chronicle article Thursday, had been insufficiently clear on these points.
“That's not the case," Nix said of the false impression that these six women had contracted Zika locally. “That would have been a whole other level."
A local Zika transmission — or six of them — would be troubling because it would indicate that Houston mosquitoes are now spreading the disease. That would put all Houstonians, and not simply people who have traveled abroad, at risk.
But the doubling of Houston's Zika cases has nonetheless ignited fears among residents and created a chaotic scene for Houston's mosquito control agencies, which are more focused on preventing local infections. Last year, the area around Brownsville and the Rio Grande Valley experienced some of the first locally transmitted Zika cases in the United States. A travel advisory for that region remains in effect.
On Wednesday, the Houston Health Department sent 80 public health workers to the Kashmere Gardens and Fifth Ward neighborhoods of Houston to hand out informational pamphlets, mosquito repellent and condoms to residents. That initiative came after Harris County Public Health “detected an unusually large number of mosquitoes in sections of the neighborhoods,” according to a news release from the health department.
Porfirio Villarreal, a spokesman for the Houston Health Department, said it's the first time the city has gone door-to-door in an effort to fight Zika.
But does this update make Houston more at-risk for a local Zika outbreak than it was on, say, Tuesday? Not really, according to local Zika experts who spoke to the Houston Press.
Martha Marquez, a spokeswoman for Harris County Public Health, expressed frustration that information-sharing about the new cases had been “not very well coordinated.” But she stressed that her agency has still not found a single Houston-area mosquito that has tested positive for Zika.
“Nonetheless, we continue to recommend that people take precautionary measures,” Marquez said. “Most importantly, do not bring any mosquitoes into your home.”
Off-duty CPD officer suspected of being drunk, firing at suburban cop near police station
An off-duty Chicago Police officer has been stripped of his arrest powers after he allegedly fired multiple times at an off-duty suburban cop who tried to pull him over after suspecting he was driving drunk, law enforcement sources say.
No one was hit by the gunfire, which happened about 4 p.m. Sunday near the Chicago Police Department's Morgan Park District station on the Southwest Side.
The 52-year-old Chicago cop, who has been assigned to the Morgan Park District, was charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol. Other charges are possible, police said.
“If the allegations are true, the actions and behavior demonstrated by this officer are beyond unacceptable, have absolutely no place in our department, and he will be separated from CPD,” according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department.
The off-duty Chicago cop was driving his personal vehicle with a fellow off-duty Chicago officer in the passenger seat when an off-duty Merrionette Park police officer pulled his vehicle behind them at 111th and Kedzie.
The Merrionette Park officer got out and showed his badge to get the off-duty officer out of his vehicle because he was allegedly driving erratically.
But the off-duty Chicago cop drove away. The Merrionette Park officer called 911 and followed the other vehicle. They stopped in the 1900 block of West Pryor near the Morgan Park station.
The Chicago cop is accused of exiting his vehicle with a gun in his hand and walking toward the Merrionette Park officer's vehicle, sources said.
The Merrionette Park officer ducked and drove away as the off-duty Chicago cop allegedly fired his weapon at the fleeing vehicle about five times, sources said.
The Merrionette Park officer went inside the police station to report the incident, and the off-duty Chicago cop allegedly left the scene.
The off-duty cop was later taken into custody on suspicion of driving under the influence.
The Independent Police Review Authority is also investigating. The agency examines every reported discharge of a weapon by Chicago Police officers, a spokesman said.
Our current laws prop up crime syndicates and waste police resources. Credit:NSW Police Cannabis hasn't always been illegal in Australia. From the arrival of the First Fleet and for the 150-plus years to follow, people in the colonies were encouraged to grow cannabis and it was consumed broadly across the nation. Those early settlers were apparently toasted on some wicked strains of Irish buds – thus explaining a great deal of early Australian music and all those whacky hats you see at the National Folk Festival. Until the mid 1920s ,when the movement to demonise the evil weed took hold worldwide and it was lumped into the same category as heroin and cocaine, cannabis was both recreationally legal and widely used and promoted as a medicine. A hundred years later, we are only beginning to make cannabis legal for medicinal purposes again – as though we just discovered it could help. Have you ever driven down Marcus Clarke Street in Civic, named after the author of For the Term of his Natural Life? It may surprise you that not only was Clarke a literary legend, he was also a prolific puffer of the Maui Wowie, an enthusiastic imbiber of the organic broccoli. He and his literary mates found cannabis relaxed them and helpd their writing – and no one batted an eyelid. But let's not ignore the massive high-grade bud in the drying shed here. While we acknowledge it's a huge problem, with a dealer on almost every street corner and at every IGA and Woolies, the most destructive drug in our society, alcohol, is legal, and drinking is our national pastime. It's a pretty huge double standard. And if you don't think alcohol is a drug, down a pint or two, abd maybe a shot of vodka, then come back and we'll continue the argument. But hey there son, don't you dare smoke that blunt and then try Smoke on the Water on a ukulele – that's illegal!
It's not often you turn on the news and hear of a massive car accident caused by the guy who smoked a joint. Research shows why. Serious road accidents where alcohol is a factor? Just over 20 per cent. Where cannabis is a factor? Just over 1 per cent. Heck, a staggering 22 per cent of road accidents in 2015-16 were caused by mobile phone distraction. You're over 2000 per cent more likely to be hit by Kelly-Anne texting Rhonda to tell her she can't find a parking spot near Mooseheads on a Saturday night than you are by Shaun who smoked a bong with Craig two hours ago and is biw on his way to pick up a meatlovers with extra cheese at Dominos. We're more sensible in the ACT than in other jurisdictions when it comes to how we view the recreational use of pot. While not legal, of course, the possession of up to 25 grams or two non-hydroponic plants in Canberra attract a fine of $150 and/or attendance at a government-sponsored drug-and-alcohol program. That seems a sensible law-enforcement approach to most people, but not to me. When it's legal to sell and buy cannabis for medicinal and recreational use in strait-laced US states like Massachusetts and Washington, I think it's time to acknowledge that Australia, as we have been on other social issues such as marriage equality, is well behind the rest of the world in cannabis law reform. There's no doubt this national conversation that is coming, whether that be next year or in five years. it would be smart for the ACT to be the first state or territory to light an incense stick under the debate by taking steps to regulate and tax cannabis for recreational use. We're a small area, where laws could easily be enforced. The benefits would be many. Besides a more chilled-out population, the ACT could grow an entire new industry, gaining the many jobs and other associated businesses that go with it: a real green economy. We'd dramatically decrease police spending and court costs on pursuing personal cannabis users while simultaneously destroying criminal enterprises that rely on millions of dollars in easy income from pot sales to prop up their ice trade. There'd be a new crop for local farmers and increased tax revenue for the government. Where's the downside?
I'm just one of many Canberrans who either does inhale, has inhaled or doesn't care if other people inhale. It's our life; it should be our choice. It's time we kick-started an informed community discussion about reforming laws around cannabis. If the surveys are right, there are a few votes in it, too. Perhaps Chief Minister Andrew Barr should pop some Bob Marley on, pass the dutchie to the left-hand side and declare Canberra to be to mull bowl of Australia for the social and economic benefits it would bring to our region.

He was a long-time director of the Canberra Fringe Festival and was recently chief of staff to Victorian parliamentarian Fiona Patten.
It took Mack Brown until 2011 to be convinced that adding junior college prospects was a feasible practice at Texas.
Charlie Strong is adding three for spring ball during his first full recruiting cycle.
The Longhorns have received national letters of intent from Navarro College offensive tackle Tristan Nickelson, his teammate and NJCAA All-American defensive end Quincy Vasser, and East Mississippi Community College offensive tackle Brandon Hodges on today's national signing day for junior college recruits. Texas will announce the signings once the paperwork of all three prospects has passed through the compliance office, but all three recruits are officially Longhorns for all intents and purposes.
All three are going to provide various levels of depth for the Longhorns at their respective positions.
2015 Junior College Signees
Brandon Hodges
Offensive Tackle
East Mississippi CC
6-5, 295
Honors: Started for the NJCAA national champions
Other offers: Louisville, Mississippi State, Missouri, Oklahoma State and others
How he fits at Texas: Hodges will step in and have a chance to compete for a starting job right away, most likely at right tackle. Those who have watched him have said he's somewhat of a poor man's Kent Perkins, who might be the best pro prospect on offense for Texas, and is a player who is ideally suited to play right tackle or guard. If he can at least come in and solidify one of the tackle spots will will make life easier for Joe Wickline as he'll have more options to put together what will hopefully be a better offensive line in 2015.
Tristan Nickelson
Offensive Tackle
Navarro College
6-8, 300
Honors: Honorable Mention All-SWJCFC
Other offers: Iowa State
How he fits at Texas: Nickelson played right tackle at Navarro but he's got the tools to eventually be a left tackle. He can take a redshirt year and still have three years of eligibility left, so if for whatever reason he's not ready to step in and compete for a starting spot then he's got time to develop. He was considered by the schools who recruited to be a prospect with a tremendous ceiling who might be a year away from being able to help a program, but that he could eventually blossom into a solid starting tackle in the Big 12. Wickline has a track record for developing prospects like Nickelson and in January the process of developing him from junior college prospect to Big 12 player will begin.
Quincy Vasser
Defensive End
Navarro College
6-4, 260
Honors: First Team All-SWJCFB, Second Team NJCAA All-American
Other offers: Georgia and Maryland
How he fits at Texas: A former Georgia commitment, Vasser's recruitment was handled by Chris Rumph. The Texas defensive line coach did an outstanding of getting Vasser, who fills an immediate need with the departure of Cedric Reed after the bowl game. Vasser profiles well as an end in the Longhorns' three-man front, a position Reed occupied most of the year playing a 4i technique. That's a role right in Vasser's wheelhouse, but he's also got the ability to rush the passer as a strong-side end in a four-man line. With Naashon Hughes profiling better to the FOX position as a hybrid end/linebacker and with the status of Caleb Bluiett being an unknown following a knee injury against TCU, Vasser will compete with senior-to-be Shiro Davis, rising junior Bryce Cottrell and former Under Armour All-American Derick Roberson (who redshirted this season) for snaps in the spring. Of those four players, Vasser and Davis profile the best to fill in for Reed, but Davis' inability to step forward and claim a more prominent role on the defense has left the door open for Vasser to make an immediate impact.

This is a great story. But really, I made it sound way more simple than it really is. You probably have some questions already, if you're a critical sort of person. Like:If the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Friesians all conquered areas of Celtic Britain, why is it that England is called England (which comes from Angle-land, the Land of the Angles) and not Saxonland or Juteland?If Old English has not been spoken since before the twelfth century, how do we know what it sounded like?When and how did Old English become the modern language that we speak today?Clearly, there is way more to it. Here are some resources that you can use to explore it further:The British Library has many great resources connected with the evolution of the English language and with the earliest complete work of literature in old English, the epic poem Beowulf. Click on this link to hear recordings of Old English and to examine texts in Old Engslish: http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/beowulf/beowulfpage1.html This link will bring you to an interactive timeline of the English language starting in the year 1000: http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/timeline/index.html This link contains a wealth of information about the development of English, along with recordings of people reading texts in Old and Middle English: http://www.1066andallthat.com/english_old.asp If you want to read about this subject in depth, I recommend Bill Bryson's book, English and How It Got That Way, or The Story of English by Robert McCrum, William Cran, and Robert MacNeil. The PBS series entitled The Story of English is also a great resource.This is the quote from Simeon Potter which inspired the visual exercise at the beginning of the lecture: "English and French expressions [in English] may have similar denotations but slightly different connotations and associations. Generally the English words are stronger, more physical, and more human. We feel more at ease after getting a hearty welcome than after being granted a cordial reception. Compare freedom with liberty, friendship with amity, kingship with royalty, holiness with sanctity, happiness with felicity, depth with profundity, and love with charity."

State and federal officials are investigating the Asian Food Center in Bellevue, WA, after a woman was diagnosed with a rare and sometimes fatal bacterial infection after handling raw fish from the grocery store.
The woman was diagnosed Nov. 10 with Vibrio vulnificus and required hospitalization, but has since returned to her home where her recovery continues, according to a news release from Public Health – Seattle & King County. The “likely source of infection was tilapia fish purchased from the Asian Food Center,” officials reported.
“Vibrio vulnificus can cause life-threatening illness, so health officials advise that anyone who has eaten or prepared fish from this location before Nov. 17 should be watchful for symptoms of infection for seven days, and people who purchased fish from this location should discard the fish,” according to the public health warning.
Jeff Duchin, health officer for the Seattle & King County department, said in the release that symptoms to watch for include skin infection, fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or unexplained serious illness. Anyone who has handled or eaten raw fish and develops these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.
“At this time, there is no known risk for people who have not been in contact with fish from this location, but people should always take precautions when handling raw seafood,” Duchin said in the release.
The woman who developed the infection probably contracted it when she cut her finger while preparing the tilapia fish, which allowed the bacteria to enter her bloodstream and infect the wound, public health officials reported.
All of the tilapia and other fish processed at the Asian Food Center in Bellevue were disposed of. Tanks and other equipment was decommissioned until they can be cleaned and disinfected.
“Public Health – Seattle & King County is testing samples of the fish and fish tanks at the Asian Food Center. The investigation focuses on tilapia, but they are also looking into the possibility that other seafood may have been contaminated,” according to the news release.
“Public Health – Seattle & King County is working with the Washington State Department of Health and with the regulatory authorities at the Food and Drug Administration to gather information about the distributors of any contaminated product.”
Vibrio vulnificus is very rare in the Pacific Northwest, according to the public health warning. It is more common in areas with warmer seawater, like the Gulf of Mexico. People can become infected with Vibrio vulnificus if they eat raw or undercooked shellfish, handle contaminated seafood, or have a wound and contaminated seawater gets in the wound.
Public Health – Seattle & King County regularly issues warnings about different types of Vibrio bacteria associated with shellfish. Vibrio vulnificus is a different and potentially more deadly species.

SEC charges ex-Goldman board member Rajat Gupta
NEW YORK  A former board member of Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs and ex-chief of one of the world's most prestigious consulting firms was accused by federal regulators Tuesday of leaking illegal insider tips to a hedge fund heavyweight who is at the center of a massive insider trading probe.
In the latest jab intended to punish those who allegedly cheat to make money in financial markets, Rajat Gupta, who once headed McKinsey & Co., was charged with insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Gupta, 62, allegedly tipped off Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, 53, who is set to go on trial next week in New York on insider trading charges, on a number of occasions while a Goldman board member. He allegedly leaked word of the $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs by billionaire investor Warren Buffett at the height of the financial panic in September 2008, the SEC's complaint said.
Following the end of a board meeting via teleconference on Sept. 23, 2008, that Gupta attended, he "immediately" phoned the hedge-fund manager, who two minutes after hanging up with Gupta, and just minutes before the close of trading that day, bought 175,000 shares of Goldman stock, the complaint said. Rajaratnam's fund sold the Goldman shares the next day, netting $900,000.
Gupta also allegedly provided Rajaratnam with tips regarding Goldman's quarterly earnings prior to official release of the news. In total the tips netted Rajaratnam almost $17 million in illegal profits, the SEC claims.
"Gupta was honored with the highest trust of leading public companies, and he betrayed that trust by disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets," said Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. The SEC says Gupta was an investor in a Galleon hedge fund that traded and profited on the inside information.
Gupta's attorney, Gary Naftalis, called the allegations "totally baseless," citing Gupta's four decades of "ethical conduct, integrity, and commitment to guarding his client's confidences (as) beyond reproach. There is no allegation that Mr. Gupta traded in any of these securities or shared in any profits ..."
Rajaratnam's lead attorney sharply criticized the timing of the complaint against Gupta so close to Rajaratnam's trial, slated to begin next Tuesday.
"There is absolutely no merit to it. This is simply an effort to destroy a favorable witness," said John Dowd of Akin Gump. "There is no case. Absolutely none. No conversations. No benefit. Nothing. These are old friends. Gupta is a distinguished human being."
The SEC also accused Gupta of passing along inside information about Procter & Gamble in 2008 while he was still a board member at P&G. Gupta "voluntarily resigned" from P&G's board Tuesday, P&G spokesman Paul Fox said.

The recently deposed crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Nayef has been placed under house arrest at his Jeddah palace and is barred from leaving the kingdom, in a bid to thwart any internal opposition to the prince who took his place as heir apparent, the New York Times reported Thursday.
Citing four current and former US and Saudi officials with ties to the royal family, the report says bin Nayef is to be confined to his home in the coastal city for an unspecified amount of time.
Saudi Arabia's Information Ministry was not reachable for comment, but a senior official from the Kingdom's Foreign Ministry denied the report to The Times as “baseless and false.”

Earlier this month, King Salman fired bin Nayef and named his 31-year-old son Mohammed bin Salman crown prince and next in line to the throne.
Bin Nayef, 57, a veteran law enforcer who served as both crown prince and interior minister, was a favorite of Western governments due to his counter-terrorism expertise.
The shakeup in the royal family comes at a crucial time for Saudi Arabia, which is in a battle for regional influence with Iran, bogged down in a controversial military intervention in neighboring Yemen, and at loggerheads with fellow US Gulf ally Qatar.
The 31-year-old prince already wielded huge power before he became heir, spearheading a sweeping economic and social reform program for the ultraconservative kingdom. His youth is a novelty for a country used to aging leaders — King Salman is 81 and his predecessor King Abdullah died in 2015 aged around 90.
Prince bin Salman's rapid ascent in the past two years has symbolized the hopes of the kingdom's young population, more than half of which is under 25.
Top Saudi officials pledged loyalty to their new crown prince in statements carried by the official news agency, while many ordinary citizens tweeted their allegiance.
But support for Mohammed has not been unanimous.
A royal order said his appointment was endorsed by 31 of 34 members on the Council of Allegiance, which decides on succession issues.
The king accompanied his son's elevation with measures to woo the many Saudis who work for the government, either as civilian or military personnel.
King Salman ordered the reinstatement of all civil service benefits cut in a controversial move as part of an austerity package late last year. He also extended the end-of-Ramadan Eid Al-Fitr holidays until July 9 for civil servants.
The enticements come as the kingdom's war in Yemen drags on and citizens for the first time paid taxes, imposed after oil prices fell.
Files show vast scale of current NSA metadata programs, with one stream alone celebrating 'one trillion records processed'
How the NSA is still harvesting your online data
A review of top-secret NSA documents suggests that the surveillance agency still collects and sifts through large quantities of Americans' online data – despite the Obama administration's insistence that the program that began under Bush ended in 2011.
Shawn Turner, the Obama administration's director of communications for National Intelligence, told the Guardian that "the internet metadata collection program authorized by the Fisa court was discontinued in 2011 for operational and resource reasons and has not been restarted."
But the documents indicate that the amount of internet metadata harvested, viewed, processed and overseen by the Special Source Operations (SSO) directorate inside the NSA is extensive.
While there is no reference to any specific program currently collecting purely domestic internet metadata in bulk, it is clear that the agency collects and analyzes significant amounts of data from US communications systems in the course of monitoring foreign targets.
On December 26 2012, SSO announced what it described as a new capability to allow it to collect far more internet traffic and data than ever before. With this new system, the NSA is able to direct more than half of the internet traffic it intercepts from its collection points into its own repositories. One end of the communications collected are inside the United States.
The NSA called it the "One-End Foreign (1EF) solution". It intended the program, codenamed EvilOlive, for "broadening the scope" of what it is able to collect. It relied on, legally, on "FAA Authority", a reference to the 2008 Fisa Amendments Act that relaxed surveillance restrictions.
This new system, SSO stated in December, enables vastly increased collection by the NSA of internet traffic. "The 1EF solution is allowing more than 75% of the traffic to pass through the filter," the SSO December document reads. "This milestone not only opened the aperture of the access but allowed the possibility for more traffic to be identified, selected and forwarded to NSA repositories."
It continued: "After the EvilOlive deployment, traffic has literally doubled."
The scale of the NSA's metadata collection is highlighted by references in the documents to another NSA program, codenamed ShellTrumpet.
On December 31, 2012, an SSO official wrote that ShellTrumpet had just "processed its One Trillionth metadata record".
It is not clear how much of this collection concerns foreigners' online records and how much concerns those of Americans. Also unclear is the claimed legal authority for this collection.
Explaining that the five-year old program "began as a near-real-time metadata analyzer … for a classic collection system", the SSO official noted: "In its five year history, numerous other systems from across the Agency have come to use ShellTrumpet's processing capabilities for performance monitoring" and other tasks, such as "direct email tip alerting."
Almost half of those trillion pieces of internet metadata were processed in 2012, the document detailed: "though it took five years to get to the one trillion mark, almost half of this volume was processed in this calendar year".
Another SSO entry, dated February 6, 2013, described ongoing plans to expand metadata collection. A joint surveillance collection operation with an unnamed partner agency yielded a new program "to query metadata" that was "turned on in the Fall 2012". Two others, called MoonLightPath and Spinneret, "are planned to be added by September 2013."
A substantial portion of the internet metadata still collected and analyzed by the NSA comes from allied governments, including its British counterpart, GCHQ.
An SSO entry dated September 21, 2012, announced that "Transient Thurible, a new Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) managed XKeyScore (XKS) Deep Dive was declared operational." The entry states that GCHQ "modified" an existing program so the NSA could "benefit" from what GCHQ harvested.
"Transient Thurible metadata [has been] flowing into NSA repositories since 13 August 2012," the entry states.
Matt Wuerker For presidents, beer is great leveler
When Sgt. Dakota Meyer won a Medal of Honor in Afghanistan for saving the lives of 36 Afghan and U.S. servicemembers, he had one request — he wanted to have a beer with President Barack Obama. So the day before the awards ceremony, Meyer sat down with Obama on the White House patio and described his dangerous mission over a cold beer.
Beer has come to symbolize the unique connection between presidents and the people they serve. Presidents are charged with bridging divides and finding common ground with citizens from all ideologies and backgrounds. There's no common denominator like beer.
Story Continued Below
Abraham Lincoln understood this well when he famously quipped, “If given the truth, [the people] can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts — and beer.”
As we celebrate Presidents Day, we realize that beer's role in presidential politics extends all the way back to the beginnings of our nation. After the Revolutionary War, George Washington, a beer lover himself, established a “Buy American” policy — and set the tone with beer.
“I use no porter or cheese in my family,” Washington wrote, “but such as is made in America.”
When President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the country was mired in the Great Depression and locked in Prohibition. After his first Fireside Chat, Roosevelt suggested, “I think it's time for beer” and immediately called on Congress to legalize it. Days later, beer was again legal.
FDR's effort, which eventually led to the repeal of Prohibition, was, according to Jonathan Alter, “one of the least appreciated elements of how FDR changed the country's psyche” during his first 100 days.
In presidential politics, both presidents and the public have used beer as a barometer of the American identity. In 1948, as Dwight D. Eisenhower began testing the political waters, he warned, during a speech in New York, that Americans were losing their identity.
“Some people wanted champagne and caviar,” Eisenhower said, “when they should have had beer and hot dogs.”
Just as Ike used beer as a measure of the average American voter, voters used beer to measure presidential candidates.
Oops!… DemoCrook Drops From Race After She Was Found Voting in 2 States
Bummer… Don't you just hate it when this happens?
Democrook Wendy Rosen dropped from her race against Republican Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) today after it was discovered she had been voting in two states in recent elections – Maryland and Florida. Rosen said she was saddened to leave the race in Maryland. (Hey, there's always Florida!)
Wendy Rosen leaves Congressional race.
Something came up-
Rosen was voting in two states but she was only running for Congress in Maryland.
The Washington Post reported:
A Maryland Democratic candidate quit her congressional race Monday after her own party told state officials that she had committed fraud by voting in both Maryland and Florida in recent elections. Wendy Rosen, a small-business owner running against freshman Rep. Andy Harris (R) in the Eastern Shore-based 1st Congressional District, released a statement saying that “with great regret, and much sorrow” she was resigning from the contest. “Personal issues have made this the hardest decision that I have had to make,” Rosen said Rosen's announcement came the same day the state Democratic party released a letter to state Attorney General Douglas Gansler and state prosecutors reporting the allegations against Rosen. “The Maryland Democratic Party has discovered that Ms. Rosen has been registered to vote in both Florida and Maryland since at least 2006; that she in fact voted in the 2006 general election both in Florida and Maryland; and that she voted in the presidential preference primaries held in both Florida and Maryland in 2008,” wrote Yvette Lewis, the state party chair. “This information is based on an examination of the voter files from both states. We believe that this is a clear violation of Maryland law and urge the appropriate office to conduct a full investigation.”
Now, weren't the loons at Media Matters just lecturing us that there was no voter fraud?
More… Wendy was just endorsed by the AFL-CIO. It's not clear if this was before or after they found out she had been voting in two states.
Students across the California State University (CSU) system are threatening to starve themselves until their school forks over $8 million for diversity funding, and some are even staging “die-ins” along the way.
On Monday, ten students played dead in front of the president's office at the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) for nearly an hour to protest a recent increase in administrative salaries.
"The CSU don't want none unless you got funds, hon."
“Recently, [die-ins have been] used in all sorts of social justice movements, and I think it's really good at getting the message across that whatever you're organizing against is on the demise,” sophomore Mick Bruckner told The Mustang News.
“Education is under attack. What do we do? Stand up, fight back!” protesters chanted.
“The CSU don't want none unless you got funds, hon,” one protester's sign said, spoofing the hit song “Baby Got Back.”
Students were protesting both a scheduled hike in tuition fees and an alleged lack of funding for the system's diversity offices.
“I'm angry and I want other people to be angry with me because we're paying for this institution. We're paying for the resources that we deserve and I think it's time to get them so we can graduate and make our economy great,” said student protester Shiba Bandeeba at San Francisco State University (SFSU), even though the CSU system is coming out of a four-year tuition freeze.
At least four of Bandeeba's peers are refusing to eat until their school allots $8 million in funds to the college of ethnic studies. Since the students announced their hunger strike, SFSU administrators have agreed to hand over $200,000 to SFSU's diversity office.
Meanwhile, at Cal Poly, protesters are alleging that the upcoming tuition hike would disproportionately affect illegal immigrant students, who will be burdened with increased out-of-state tuition fees.
“If you, yourself, don't feel like you'll be affected by these tuition increases, I just want to ask you to consider the fact that this proposal…it could end someone's life,” student Mick Bruckner said. “So the students who are not accommodated by AB 540 will see a $10,000 tuition increase. And, how does someone deal with that? I don't know. Loans? Drop out? It just—the effects of this are really much larger than a lot of people realize.”
The AB 540 legislation prevents illegal immigrant students who are not in the process of legalizing their residency from applying for an exemption from nonresident tuition rates.
Protesters later issued a letter to Cal Poly president Jeffrey Armstrong with a copy of their demands, asking him to reject the Board of Regent's recommendation to raise tuition two percent annually but invest more funds in his school's “ethnic, gender[,] and critical theory programs.”

Ultimately, the group of protesters hopes to make Cal Poly tuition free, saying it is “essential” that all students be exempt from paying tuition.
“Being tuition-free is actually possible,” said student Matt Klepfer. “It's happened before in the state of California, and it's essential.”

Arsenal serve traffic notices as they plan FA Cup victory parade (they did the same ahead of Champions League final in 2006)
Arsenal's plans for an FA Cup victory parade are well underway – six days ahead of the final against Hull City.
Traffic notices have already been served in Islington with the Gunners planning an open-top bus parade for Sunday, the day after the Wembley showdown with the Tigers.
Double decker: Arsenal paraded following their double victory of 1998
Spot on: Arsenal booked their place in the final following a penalty-shootout victory over Wigan
Notice: Arsenal are planning an FA Cup victory parade around the streets of North London on Sunday
Scrapped: Arsenal made plans for an open-top bus tour ahead of their Champions League defeat in 2006
Arsenal made similar plans in 2006 before their Champions League final against Barcelona in Paris. Arsene Wenger's men were beaten 2-1 and the parade was duly scrapped.
The club's last bus celebration came in 2004 following ‘The Invincibles' unbeaten Premier League season. They did not parade in the wake of their 2005 FA Cup victory over Manchester United; incidentally, this was the last time the club won a trophy.
This weekend's planned parade would start at 11am from the Emirates Stadium before going through Drayton Park, Aubert Park, Highbury Park, Highbury Grove, St Paul's Road and into Upper Street and a reception at Islington Assembly Hall.The parade would conclude with a team appearance on the Emirates podium.

This is a story of snakes, islands and students. Let's start with the snakes.
Among the many different kinds of snakes are the constrictors: boas and pythons. They are close relatives that diverged millions of years ago. Pythons are found in the Old World (Africa and Asia) as well as Australia. Boas (family Boidae) are found in the New World (North, Central and South America including some Caribbean islands). All of them kill their prey by wrapping around it and squeezing it to death.
Among the boas there is an island-dwelling form in Belize that is the subject of interest to conservationists, ecologists and, lately, behavioral biologists. This is the miniature boa of Snake Cayes, a group of islands off the coast of southern Belize. When I say “miniature” I mean that they range in length from 30 cm to about 2 meters (1 to 6 feet). This is small compared to the mainland boas of the same species, which can reach 4 meters (13 feet) in length.
It is common for animal populations that live on islands to exhibit differences in size from those on the mainland. Medium and larger mammals like deer tend to be smaller on islands, small mammals like rodents tend to be larger. Something like this may happen with snakes as well.
Scott Boback is an expert on these animals, and from the time he was a graduate student at Auburn University, he's been trying to answer the question “how and why are these snakes small?”
The most likely explanations for size differences would seem to be either diet or other features of the environment, or genetics. Perhaps there is a limited food supply on the islands, so snakes grow slowly, and thus there are few or no large ones. It would take them so long reach a large size that somewhere along the line they would have met their demise. Alternatively, it could be that snakes that grow slowly or nearly stop growing as they approach a certain size survive longer or reproduce more effectively (probably owing to food supply being limited). If so, the genes involved in growth would be shaped by natural selection and over time the island snakes would be small because they are genetically different. You can easily imagine how the two processes would work together, perhaps with environmental effects working initially but genetic changes accruing over time.
Boback did eventually come to a conclusion about the small size of the island boas. He recently told me, “we determined that there is some genetic component to dwarfism on islands. However, we believe that it is actually a combination of genetic and environmental effects that ultimately determine island boa size. That is, growth rates are different between island and mainland boas and this appears to be determined partly by genetics.” (See below for the reference to his paper on this research.)
More recently, Boback and his students at Dickinson College have been addressing a different question about boas: How do they know when to stop squeezing their prey? This is an interesting question because, as you might imagine, contracting the majority of muscles in one's body for an extended period of time is energetically costly, but letting go of prey before it is fully dead may cause the loss of a meal. As an informal experiment, I asked five different people this question over the past two days, after reading of Boback's research, and everyone gave approximately the same answer: The snakes let go when the prey is dead and stops struggling.
Well, it turns out that we do science to prove ourselves wrong, because that is not the answer. Suspecting a particular mechanism, Boback his students, who maintain a colony of these boas in their lab at Dickinson, devised a brilliant experiment. They took a number of dead rats that would normally be fed to the snakes, and installed robotic “hearts” in them. When the snakes constricted the rats, the hearts were allowed to beat for a while, then they were turned off. Soon after, the snakes loosened their grip, then let go.
It turns out that boas have the ability to detect a heartbeat in the prey, and they use this information to determine how much pressure to apply. Snakes that had never killed or eaten live prey acted the same as snakes with experience with live prey, suggesting that this behavior is innate and not learned.
“Many of us think of snakes as audacious killers, incapable of the complex functions we typically reserve for higher vertebrates,” says Boback. “We found otherwise and suggest that this remarkable sensitivity was a key advancement that forged the success of the entire snake group.”
One of the neat things about this project is that it involved the efforts of undergraduate researchers. The undergraduates not only participated in the research, but they helped produce the peer reviewed paper and are listed as authors. Katelyn McCann, who was a student on this project and now works as a clinical-research coordinator at Children's Hospital in Boston, notes, “I got to experience the true collaborative nature of research as well as the hours of independent work that go into the final product. Now, working in research I feel like I truly understand the scientific method and what goes into any study.” Boback adds, “student-faculty research at Dickinson is an opportunity for students to experience science in action. It is the most fundamental level of learning in science as the student actively participates in the process of discovery.”

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey interviewed Edward Snowden today, and the big topic was technology.
During the Q&A (which was broadcast live from the Pardon Snowden Periscope account) Snowden discussed the data that many online companies continue to collect about their users, creating a “quantified world” — and more opportunities for government surveillance.
“If you are being tracked, this is something you should agree to, this is something you should understand, this is something you should be aware of and can change at any time,” he said.
Snowden acknowledged that there's a distinction between collecting the content of your communication (i.e., what you said during a phone call) and the metadata (information like who you called and how long it lasted). For some, surveillance that just collects metadata might seem less alarming, but in Snowden's view, “That metadata is in many cases much more dangerous and much more intrusive, because it can be understood at scale.”
He added that we currently face unprecedented perils because of all the data that's now available — in the past, there was no way for the government to get a list of all the magazines you'd read, or every book you'd checked out from the library.
“[In the past,] your beliefs, your future, your hopes, your dreams belonged to you,” Snowden said. “Increasingly, these things belong to companies, and these companies can share them however they want, without a lot of oversight.”
He wasn't arguing that companies shouldn't collect user data at all, but rather that “the people who need to be in control of that are the users.”
“This is the central problem of the future, is how do we return control of our identities to the people themselves?” Snowden said.
That might seem to be overstating things, but when asked about the “normalization” of government surveillance, Snowden suggested that the issue goes beyond surveillance: “What we're actually talking about is democracy, what we're talking about is civil empowerment.” Specifically, he said there's “an increasing imbalance of power” where public officials know more and more about private citizens, while those citizens know less and less about the officials: “We can't even see their tax returns.”
At the same time, he suggested that technology presents opportunities for freedom and empowerment that go beyond any one country. Yes, he said, “the law is important” (a previous interview where Snowden seemed to downplay the weight of laws and politics prompted Gizmodo's Matt Novak to describe him as a “fucking idiot“) but he added, “We need to think about things not just in the national context, not just in the local context, but in the global context.”
“Can we correct things in the United States without correcting them for everyone else in a lot of contexts?” he asked. “No — but in the context of technology, maybe.”
For example, he said that if someone built encrypted communication technology that “that can't be intercepted, that can't be censored, that can't be controlled, that can go anywhere on Earth,” they would be helping to create a “fabric of freedom” across the globe.
Snowden covered another hot topic — fake news. He criticized the idea of having companies like Google and Facebook take down offending content (whether that's fake news or posts that support terrorists), because many countries have highly restrictive, or downright oppressive, rules around free speech.
“The problem of fake news isn't solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because … we as users of these services help each other,” he said. “We talk and we share and we point out what is true. The answer to bad speech is more speech. We have to exercise and spread the idea that critical thinking matters now more than ever.”
Not everything in the interview was quite so heavy, by the way. Snowden also offered some product feedback for Dorsey — he'd like to be able to edit tweets. Should we expect that to actually happen? Well, Dorsey responded by moving along to the next question without comment, so make of that what you will.
Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a leading voice on trade, immigration and executive powers, is urging Americans to choose their next president carefully because 2016 "is the last chance for the American people to take back control of their government."
In a sober interview with Secrets, the Republican warned that liberal special interests, Wall Street moguls, and international media conglomerates are fast turning the United States into just another member of the European Union and that the effort is being led by a Democratic president eager to go his own way with executive orders.
"This election is different because we have pell mell erosion of law, the constitutional order, where President Obama has pushed an agenda that eviscerates the immigration legal system, and pushed this trade agreement that will commence decades of transferring American economic power to an ever-expanding international commission. It's just not going to stop" unless voters take action, he warned.
"This is the way the European Union began," he added.
Highlighting immigration and trade, Sessions urged voters to choose a candidate who will commit to killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with nearly a dozen Asian nations which is slated to cost 448,000 U.S. jobs, and finally make good on 30 years of promises to put an end to illegal immigration, which is costing the nation billions in welfare and undermining U.S. wages.
"This election will be the last chance for Americans to get control of their government," said Sessions, repeatedly making that point. "I think this election is the big one. To win, Republicans need to demonstrate that they care about the average person who goes to work every day," he added.
Most Republicans are against TPP, and even Hillary Clinton has come out in opposition of a deal she laid the groundwork for and once called the gold standard. And there is some difference on immigration between the Republican candidates.
Sessions said that if candidates don't promise to end TPP and close the border, voters should move on. "People should have total confidence and a clear commitment on those issues. If they don't, then they don't have my vote," he said.
The influence of Sessions on key issues in the presidential race, especially TPP and immigration, can't be underestimated. He was the loudest voice against TPP, which the president plans to sign in the coming weeks, and helped Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz on immigration issues.
He warned that if the next president OK's TPP, it would erode U.S. economic power and put trade under a powerful commission on which America would have just one vote.
On immigration, he slammed decades of failed promises.
"It's been a sham, decade after decade, and the voters need to know that this might be the last chance to elect a president who can reduce this tide and to end the illegality and serve the interests of working Americans. Their jobs, their wages, their hospitals, their schools the public safety, have to be put first," Sessions urged.
"We need a president with the credibility to tell the world that the time of illegality is over not come to this country unlawfully," he said.

Kaitlin Devine, 18F's Director of Engineering recently noticed this tweet:
Does your project pass the Bechdel test? To pass, a function written by a woman dev must call a function written by another woman dev. — Laurie Voss (@seldo) February 27, 2015
The coding Bechdel test, as described above, is a variant of the original Bechdel test, which was created by writer and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel. The Bechdel test was originally designed to evaluate works of fiction. A work passed if at least one woman had a conversation with another woman about something other than a man.
We decided to see how many 18F projects pass this modified test. To pass, a project had to have at least one function written by a woman dev that called another function written by another woman dev.
Kaitlin posed the question to a group of 18F employees, which prompted a long conversation about our internal values and culture. The conversation started with us quickly listing the projects that passed the Bechdel coding test, but then shifted after one of our devs then raised a good point: She said some of our projects had lots of female devs, but did not pass the test as defined. 18f.gsa.gov, for example, uses a framework and language called SASS to generate the styles used on each page. The overwhelming majority of our custom SASS was written by a woman, and another woman wrote a significant amount of HTML that relies on that SASS, but because neither language has “functions” it fails the test.
The conversation also caused us to think about how we holistically evaluate our inclusivity as a team. There are also many roles on our product teams other than developers that are just as important to the success of a product. Visual designers, content designers, user experience researchers: all of these roles are critical to shipping a product. Is there another way of evaluating our teams that takes these roles into consideration? This test is also limited with respect to other protected classes. It only addresses gender: race, socio-economic status, disability, and others are important considerations when building successful, diverse teams.
Nevertheless, a “Bechdel Test for Code” is valuable because it addresses that tech as a whole has issues that it needs to surmount. Gender balance in engineering, therefore, needs to be acknowledged specifically even if this test isn't the only way we measure inclusivity at 18F. It is a conversation we will continue to have at 18F to make sure we are building a team that looks like America and works like America. As our projects become Bechdel compliant, we plan to note the change.

Scotland's health "is not improving" as the NHS faces "significant challenges", Audit Scotland has warned.
The watchdog's annual report lists concerns over missed targets, longer waiting times, "stalled" improvements and growing pressure on budgets.
Scottish Labour has renewed its calls for Health Secretary Shona Robison to quit in light of the report.
Ms Robison insisted that "significant" improvements have been made, while stressing that there is "no quick fix".
The report was the focus of much of Thursday's weekly session of questions to the first minister at Holyrood, with Nicola Sturgeon acknowledging "big challenges" for the health service.
But she insisted that "against many measures" the Scottish NHS was performing better than elsewhere in the UK.
The Scottish government published its "blueprint" for the future of the NHS in December 2016, aiming to treat people closer to home rather than in hospital.
'Significant challenges'
Audit Scotland's latest annual report stated that there was a "general consensus in Scotland that healthcare cannot continue to be provided in the same way", but concluded that "more progress needs to be made if transformational change is to happen".
It found that existing challenges like "increasing costs, growing demand, and the continuing pressures on public finances" had continued to "intensify" in 2016-17.
The public spending watchdog said there had been progress, but warned that "fundamental" areas still needed to be addressed.
"Significant concerns" flagged up in the report include:
A 99% increase in the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for an outpatient appointment - "more people are waiting longer to be seen"
"The majority of key national performance targets were not met in 2016-17"
General practice faces "significant challenges", including recruiting and retaining GPs and "low morale"
There is a "lack of financial flexibility" for health boards and a "lack of long-term planning"
The overall health of Scots "continues to be poor and significant health inequalities remain"
Life expectancy is "lower than in most European countries" and improvements have "stalled"
Drug-related deaths have "increased significantly" with the rate "now the highest in the EU"
"There are warning signs that maintaining the quality of care is becoming increasingly difficult"

At £12.9bn, health funding now accounts for 43% of the overall Scottish government budget.
Despite an increase in the NHS budget, rising operating costs have meant health boards had to make "unprecedented" savings of almost £390m in order to break even.
And while the budget for 2017-18 saw an increase in cash terms, there was actually a decrease of 0.1% in real terms from the prior year.
The Audit Scotland report concluded that simply adding more funding was "no longer sufficient" to achieve the "step change" needed across the system.
It said that budgeting on a year-by-year basis is "hindering development of longer-term plans for moving more care out of hospital", and said a clearer long-term financial framework was "critical".
'Positive impact'
However, the report did state that there is a "positive basis on which to build" for Scotland's NHS.
It noted that Scotland has had "a consistent overall policy direction in health for many years" and there was "broad consensus" on goals.
It said that staff "remain committed to providing high-quality care", while levels of overall patient satisfaction "continue to be high" and the Scottish public "hold the NHS in high regard".
And it noted that early signs are that changes in the way services are planned and delivered are "beginning to have a positive impact", such as a reduction in delayed discharges.
Image caption Caroline Gardner said there was "no simple solution"
Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there was "widespread agreement" that healthcare "must be delivered differently if it is to withstand growing pressure on services".
She said: "There is no simple solution, but these fundamental areas must be addressed if reform is to deliver the scale of transformation that's needed across the NHS.
"Involving staff, the public and bodies across the public sector will also be crucial for success."
At Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of trying to sweep concerns about the health services under the carpet.
She said the Scottish government was "struggling to do the basics", adding: "The SNP set their own targets to make things better but they've improved in only one in the last five years.
"We know there's no long term plan even though one was promised for the start of this year, that GPs are being underfunded and that we spent £171 million hiring in agency staff to plug the gaps."
'Big challenges'
Labour's interim leader Alex Rowley said problems with the health service were "spiralling out of control".
He acknowledged that reform of the NHS was not easy, but said the government was "not doing enough and is not moving fast enough".
In response, Ms Sturgeon said there were "big challenges" for the NHS - but said these existed "in every health service across the developed world".
She said: "In meeting these challenges in Scotland, and they are big challenges, I think against many measures we are seeing the NHS in Scotland perform better than the NHS in any other part of the UK - and that's because of the actions we're taking."
Image caption Health Secretary Shona Robison said there was "simply no quick fix" for the challenges facing the health service
Labour also said the report showed that it was "time for Shona Robison to go as health secretary".
Ms Robison insisted there were some "encouraging" elements to the report, highlighting high patient satisfaction and "innovative work being done".
She said there had been "significant improvements in Scotland's health system" under the SNP, "driven by our clear vision for the future for the NHS", citing increased staff levels and "record investment".
The Dundee MSP said: "We have long been realistic about the challenges for the NHS and the need for change.
"We're working to develop a medium term financial framework, within the context of the budget settlement that the Scottish government receives. This will be to outline the broad direction for the NHS and care services to meet the changing needs of the people of Scotland, including shifting the balance of care towards community health services.
"It's important to stress however that improving the nation's health for the long term requires more than acute care - there's simply no quick fix."
She said the government had introduced a range of long term measures designed to make Scots healthier
"Ultimately, our work across government will ensure the people of Scotland can continue to look forward to a healthier future," she said.
House Speaker Paul Ryan was shouted down by chants of “Trump” at his Fall Fest event Saturday in Wisconsin. Ryan, who kicked off the speech talking about the “elephant in the room,” said that Trump's banter with Billy Bush before taping an Access Hollywood segment in 2005 was “a troubling situation.”
The chants for “Trump” start at about the 6:40 mark in the video below.
Ryan was joined onstage by Wisconsites Ron Johnson and Scott Walker after the “Trump” shouts began, at the end of Ryan's speech. Some also shouted, “God bless Trump,” and “See ya, Paul! Jackass!”
Gammas never grasp that the crowd is always going to choose the Alpha male over them, no matter how adroitly they virtue-signal:Ryan's miscalculation wasn't quite as bad as Ted Cruz's at the RNC, but it was still pretty impressive.
CLOSE Michael Ohman became stranded when his vehicle got stuck near Crown King. Luckily, after a couple nights, Ohman ran into a dirt biker who rescued him.

After a touristy morning and a leisurely lunch in the historic Arizona mining town of Crown King, Michael Ohman punched his home address into Google Maps and selected the "avoid highways" option hoping to find a scenic route home.
That was his first mistake.
He took off in his two-wheel drive Honda CR-V, unwittingly heading toward a path so rugged that off-roading websites describe it as rutted and steep with tight switchbacks that require skilled drivers with vehicles designed to cross boulders.
Undaunted, he pressed on.
That was his second mistake.
After just a few miles, his transmission succumbed in the middle of some of Arizona's most rugged wilderness, miles from any cell service.
A leisurely afternoon spirals out of control
Ohman, who is 55 and goes by the nickname "Mick," is relatively new to Phoenix.
Originally from Minnesota, he spent most of his life as a "homebody" and has become more adventurous since he moved to Arizona in January 2016.
He describes himself as "new to Christianity," and was baptized in the Jordan River in Israel last summer. A couple of weeks ago he became scuba-certified in Cozumel, Mexico.
And it was that adventurous spirit that took him to Crown King, roughly 80 miles north of Phoenix, on July 27.
Shortly after starting toward home, Ohman said he knew something was wrong. At times the rocky path had him driving right next to a steep drop-off.
He looked for a place to turn around but once he found one, the CR-V couldn't make it back up the steep road. So he kept driving, navigating around 2- and 3-feet-deep ruts, or stopping completely to get out and move basketball-size boulders.
During one of the stops, he noticed fluid dripping from under his car. He had gas, the tires were inflated, but it wouldn't move. The transmission was shredded.
Left with an immobile car and little else
He surveyed his situation: No phone signal, but he did save an offline map of the route home. He had a lighter and two old flares he wasn't sure would work. One bottle of water, a slushie, a sandwich, some bagel chips, a few beers and what he thought were a few cans of sparkling water. On second look he realized the seltzer was alcoholic, too.
“That was excruciatingly hard. There's not a friendly bush out there.” Michael Ohman
In hopes of finding cell service, he hiked up a nearby mountain.
"That was excruciatingly hard," he said. "There's not a friendly bush out there."
After finding no service, he hiked back to his car, disappointed and parched from the afternoon sun. By 5 p.m. he was out of water, and "alcohol tasted like saltwater."
He arranged rocks into a big letter H next to his car and put his spare tire on his windshield, anything to signal to someone overhead that he needed help.
Eventually he fell asleep in his car, waking up often out of thirst.
Day 2: Surprises bring tears of joy

Sunrise woke him up around 5 a.m. The sandwich he saved had rotted overnight, the smell so repulsive he threw it in the weeds. The bagel chips were too dry to choke down.
He took the cooler with the few beers to explore, eventually finding a small stream a few inches wide at most, trickling through rocks and disappearing under sand about a mile away from his car.
"I found these tiny little puddles and that water, oh my goodness, it was so refreshing, so clear, so sweet," he said, beginning to cry. "I kind of knew everything was going to be OK if I could just keep that water going."
He dumped the alcohol and refilled the cans with water, drinking as much as he could.
Not a single plane, vehicle, or sign of life passed nearby. So he decided to try something else: Set the hill on fire.
He ignited a pine tree, but the flame didn't spread. He took a break in his car to cool down and charge his phone. Then he filled shopping bags with brush, sticks and animal poop, trying to collect enough to set a bigger fire.
'I'm terrified. I love you guys. I hope this isn't the end.'
Around 3 p.m. Friday, 24 hours after he got stuck in the desert, he was down to one can of water, so he headed the mile back to the stream.
"When I got down there, my gorgeous little creek was gone."
“Tell my niece and nephew how much I love them. I've been praying all night. I'm terrified. I'm terrified. I love you guys. I hope this isn't the end. Goodbye.” Michael Ohman
He eventually found a small puddle where he could scoop up a few tablespoons of water at a time.
"I knew that this was going to be my last opportunity," he said. He decided to save the fire for Saturday when there might be more people around.
Before sunset, he recorded a video on his phone, a sort of final statement in case he didn't make it out.
"If you find this phone and I didn't do so well, please tell my sisters how much I love them," he says in the video, pausing as he gets choked up.
"Tell my niece and nephew how much I love them. I've been praying all night. I'm terrified. I'm terrified. I love you guys. I hope this isn't the end. Goodbye."
Nature changes his plan

As the sun set Friday, thunder cracked and it began to rain.
"I stood there, soaking it up and oh, now I had water again," he said, tearing up again. He had "the windows rolled up and everything's clammy and foggy in there, but I was the happiest.
"I knew that little creek would be going again. That's what made me actually able to sleep with all the stress."
He woke up early Saturday morning knowing his idea to light a fire was ruined because of the rain. He was starving, and he hadn't told anyone he was leaving Phoenix, so he knew no one would be reporting him missing.
"It's not like I have a wife waiting at home with a cold dinner," he said.
He looked at his map and decided it was time to leave.
He wrote notes to leave on the inside and outside of his windshield with his name and address, his plan to head toward Castle Hot Springs Road and eventually Lake Pleasant, 19 miles away. He also left a request for whoever found the notes to call 911.
Leaving everything behind in a last effort
Ohman walked for two hours, never seeing a cabin or tracks from another vehicle.
"It felt like I wasn't getting anywhere, and then I came to a fork in the road and I had to go right or left. I took a right and it was all uphill. I'm just shaking my head," he said.
“It didn't take long to assess. I could see he was heat exhausted, emotionally broke down.” Troy Haverland
"I don't know how much more of this I can do," he thought, and that's when the miracle he'd been praying for came around the corner.
Troy Haverland lives in Phoenix and has been riding up to Crown King regularly since 1991 and knew he wanted to go Saturday morning because heavy rain washes the roads, making for a nice ride.
"It didn't take long to assess. I could see he was heat exhausted, emotionally broke down. As I was rolling up to him, you see his hands waving, they went into a prayer."
Haverland, 52, gave Ohman his half-bottle of water and invited him onto his one-person dirt bike. They rode for an hour, weaving their way to the lake.
"It turned out Troy was my guardian angel," Ohman said.

A Maricopa County Sheriff's Office spokesman confirmed that a man on a motorcycle brought Ohman to the pay station in the Castle Creek area of Lake Pleasant and found a deputy at 12:28 p.m. Saturday.
Peoria Fire Department officials evaluated Ohman, who turned down further assistance, MCSO spokesman Sgt. Calbert Gillett said. Ohman said he just wanted to go home and feed his cats, so the deputy drove him home.
Group finds Ohman's chilling notes

Andrew Austin and two of his friends took their motocross bikes off-roading to Crown King on Sunday morning and on the route back stumbled upon Ohman's car.
Austin, 28, took photos of the car, the notes and the "H" made of rocks before he, Jesse Stanton and Taylor Jordon spent two hours tracing Ohman's planned route to the lake, criss-crossing the 19 miles in hopes of finding him.
The men are in the military and are trained for emergencies like this. They were ready to help Ohman and felt "huge relief" when they made it back to an area with cell service near the lake, called the number and Ohman picked up.
"I just think it's a prime learning experience for anyone that wants to get into the off-road world Arizona has to offer because it's not nearly as friendly as it may seem," Austin said.
He posted the photos on Imgur, where they have been viewed more than 139,000 times.

"Even though he managed to get in way over his head and get in a desperate situation, he managed to get himself out of it, which I think is really impressive."
A cautionary tale for others
Ohman said he hopes his story of spending more than 45 hours stranded in high desert can help others know they need to plan when visiting remote areas.
"Mistakes can happen, and the small little mistakes all lined up to make that perfect storm."
He said he believes he survived thanks only to help from God.
"I know for a fact that God's love was with me out there and I know because those rains came at the perfect time," Ohman said, getting choked up.
"I really feel that there was something special going on out there and maybe my story can help somebody else."

What if you could receive a potentially life-saving medication on time every day without injections or taking pills? That may be possible sooner than you think thanks to an MIT spinoff company called Microchips Biotech. The firm has developed an implantable microchip that can hold hundreds of doses of medication, delivered automatically to treat illness. This isn't a pipedream, either — it's already been successfully tested and is now being developed into a real product.
The microchips contain tiny individual reservoirs the size of a pinhead, each with a single dose of medication that may treat diabetes, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, or some other chronic disease. Each capsule is covered by a metal membrane that is removed by a tiny electric impulse at set intervals. It can be programmed wirelessly to change the deployment schedule as needed as well.
Previous tests of the chip with osteoporosis sufferers showed very similar dose response compared to injections, and there was no problem with adherence to doctor's orders, of course. You can't forget to take your pills when the pills were implanted inside your body months or years ago on a timer. Patients failing to follow a therapeutic regimen is a surprisingly serious issue in healthcare. In the US alone, failing to take prescribed medication on the proper schedule results in $100-289 billion of additional health care costs each year.
Microchips Biotech is partnering with Teva Pharmaceutical, which paid $35 billion for access to the technology, to bring the chips to market. Making these chips viable required new manufacturing methods that take into account the delicate nature of many drugs. For example, sealing the reservoirs needed to be done at room temperature as soldering or micro-welding could destroy the drugs. The company developed a clever tongue and groove cold-welding process wherein a gold alloy was used to create tongues on the cover and grooves on the base. By pressing the two together, the two structures mesh together and plastically deform to create a seal.
The final design will still need to go through regulatory approval, but it may be possible before long to get more than a decade of medication implanted in a single procedure. Perhaps you'll even be able to trigger drug release with your phone, assuming possible security issues can be worked out. You certainly don't want someone hacking your medical implants.
"In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun, and *SNAP* the job's a game!" -- Mary Poppins
My parents' four-acre landscape company was a maze of greenhouses and storage bays brimming with every variety of tree, flower, stone or pebble a child could fathom. The weekends and summers of my childhood were spent watering young plants, pulling weeds and mowing a one-acre lawn on a weekly basis. Because my parents weren't about to turn their 10-year-old loose with a riding mower, I walked it the old-fashioned way.
The monotony of my responsibilities -- often times carried out under the blistering Texas heat -- brought to vivid life the words spoken, rather, sung by Mary Poppins in her eponymous Disney flick. My youthful mind would play every last angle in an attempt to find delight in the manual labor I was tasked with. How many weeds can I pull in a minute? What if I mow this lawn east to west instead of north to south? Can I hold more than 6 one-gallon buckets at a time?
I learned quickly to have fun amidst the daily grind as the only child of entrepreneurial parents.
Making a game out of life's tasks is nothing new. The effervescent Jane McGonigal has been exploring real world games for some time now. Yet there is emerging movement today -- especially among the early adopting tech set -- to turn all of one's online and real-world activities into a game. Think of it as an "achievement system for life" if you will.
It all sounds fun, but is this newfound love for all things game-related really the future?
About two and half years ago I found myself sitting on a park bench at the edge of Lake Tahoe. There was a low cloud hanging over the mountain lake that cast a beautifully ominous shadow over the small waves lapping up onto shore.
I was on the phone with my dad and I couldn't help but brag about the amazing scenery I was soaking in. After we finished the call I took a long look at the phone in my hand. It was a white iPhone 3G, the first iPhone with built-in GPS. The idea struck me like a bolt of lightning.
What if we created a passport -- a travel journal -- for your phone?
My co-founder Scott and I had a history a building fun and unique services on the web. Our first product -- an online invoicing service for small businesses -- featured beautiful iconography and a delightful user-interface that made the painfully dull task of invoicing clients easy and fun. Unwittingly, we had turned billing clients and getting paid into a game.
We also created a niche community site for web designers that rewarded power users with iconic badges for their activity. I even worked with the team building Causes, where game mechanics were employed to encourage the masses on Facebook to give to charitable organizations. We wanted to learn if the online achievement systems pioneered by the teams working on XBOX Live and World of Warcraft -- leaderboards, points, icons and badges -- could be applied to social activity on the web.
So when the low flying cloud caught my attention on that October day I quickly grabbed my sketchbook and started imagining what this passport on a phone might look like. Would beautiful iconography and a delightful user interface inspire people to share their favorite places and travel moments with their friends?
The Lake Tahoe Photo and Sketches
A few months of feverish work later, Scott and I introduced Gowalla to the world at the SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas. It so happened that Dennis Crowley (of Dodgeball fame) and Naveen Selvadurai unveiled a somewhat-similar project called foursquare. You've probably heard of it. Overnight, a new genre of mobile and social services had galvanized. Icon badges and game mechanics quickly became the talk of the tech world.
We awarded iconic "pins" (the moniker is a throwback to those retro ski-area pins I collected as a kid) for taking a walking trip around a city or for visiting a new state or country. Foursquare awarded badges for activity like checking in a certain number of times at a restaurant or gym.
Silicon Valley took notice and a plethora of services cropped up in the months that followed, rewarding badges for watching television, reading books and giving to charity -- amongst dozens of other activities, both online and off, one might participate in. A couple sites even launched to aggregate activity across these services to reward people with badges for earning badges.
The "game" was on.
Two years have now passed and it's impossible to attend a technology or social media event where game mechanics are not discussed. The fever pitch reached a new high earlier this month when SXSW once again convened in Austin.
The conversation went something like this: Want new users for your fancy mobile social app thing? Add a leaderboard! Trying to get people to care about your old media publishing company's website? Give 'em a badge! Need a solution for global warming? Game mechanics to the rescue!
There's even an awful new word to describe this phenomenon: Gamification.
Some have gone so far to propose that game mechanics will revolutionize society over the next decade in the same way that the social utility of Facebook and Twitter have done so over the last one. Imagine a world with point systems and badges for brushing your teeth, doing your taxes, or even going on a date with your significant other.
Sadly, this is early adopter navel-gazing at its best.
The sentiment that games are -- or will be -- as important as our social connections over the next decade is laughable.
Social validation is the primary driver of activity on the web. I'm no philosopher, but I'd venture to say that social validation is the primary driver for almost anything we fickle humans do on our big blue earth.
Photos are posted to Facebook to be shared and commented upon by friends. Millions of tweets take flight daily to be retweeted in a never-ending loop to boost follower counts. Even LinkedIn understands that at the end of the day social connection reigns supreme over its game-like approach to managing your professional contacts.
While badges and game mechanics may have raised the awareness of our service and industry in the closely held world of Sand Hill Road investors, the true value of a service like Gowalla is found in millions of people sharing their life stories with the people they care about.
In our case, those stories are often about the places we go; the photos, friends and highlights we journal and share as we travel. It's our goal to see the Gowalla community inspire others to see the world through new eyes. The fuel for this inspiration is ultimately personal connection, not a game.
We are human beings. The stories that define our lives are each unique. Pretending we can be boxed like a board game and shipped with a set of rules that define success is shortsighted and naive. The musings of a "world as a game" seem even more uncomfortable in light of the recent social uprisings in the Middle East or the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We won't even explore how preposterous this must all sound to the children living in poverty -- or even slavery -- around the world.
There will always be value in making the everyday tasks of life delightful and fun. There will be no lack of opportunity for those who can turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. But if in our effort to "level-up" we lose mindfulness of the world around us, we have failed at the greatest game of all.
Life is not about winning. It's about finding delight in the journey.
A couple of weeks ago, I had to carve up a large tree limb that had fallen on my house. As my 4-year-old daughter helped me stack the branches to be bundled, it brought back fond memories of working at the landscape company with my parents. I didn't get a badge for pulling those weeds. My daughter didn't get a badge for stacking the branches.

Frozen 2 is officially in the works, according to Elsa actress (and original belter of 'Let it Go'), Idina Menzel.

In an interview with the UK's Telegraph, Menzel confirmed that the sequel and the stage musical are going ahead.
“...they're all in the works,” said Menzel. But as for her involvement, the actress played it a little more cautiously.
“Ah, yeah sure… Not the stage show – I don't know what will happen with that – but the movie hopefully. We'll see. I'm just going along for the ride."
When we recently spoke to Georgina Haig, who plays Elsa on Once Upon a Time, she also said she believed Disney was working on a Frozen sequel (see below at the 10:35 mark).

The Republican National Committee revealed Thursday in a 21-page memo that Hillary Clinton's State Department spent millions of dollars on lavish goods and initiatives on the taxpayers' dime.
The State Department spent $5.4 million on a “no-bid contract for crystal stemware” and $630,000 to “increase Facebook likes on four State Department pages.”
The memo also highlighted that the State Department spent more than $600 million on failed projects in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Washington Examiner reported.
The projects included a $3.6 million fleet of “unused broadcast TV trucks” in Afghanistan and $167.5 million on “preventable cost overruns while expanding embassy Kabul.” The State Department spent an additional $9.8 million on purchases the GOP characterized as “frivolous,” such as the $79,000 in taxpayer funds Clinton's agency used to buy up copies of President Obama's book or the $53,004 her agency spent on “marble polishing services” at the U.S. embassy in Brasilia “during the summer of 2010.”
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has previously seized on the State Department's questionable bookkeeping methods under Clinton when she was secretary of state. In the third presidential debate, Trump said that $6 billion went missing during Clinton's tenure at the State Department, the Examiner noted.
His comments were likely based on a March 2014 memo from the State Department inspector general in which the watchdog noted contract files for projects worth up to $6 billion had disappeared since 2008. With no paper trail to document the progress of those projects, there was no way for the inspector general to verify that the money ended up in the proper place, the watchdog argued.
This memo plays into Trump's latest push to “Drain the Swamp” as his campaign seeks to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse among federal agencies.
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika brought a rugby league influence one step closer to his side on Tuesday, running an opposed session with NRL side, the Sydney Roosters.
Cheika has a long-standing relationship with Roosters coach Trent Robinson, who has previously been a part of Wallabies training.
The sides played out a hybrid game on Tuesday, playing rugby in attack and the 13-man game in defence and vice versa, a different structure for the future Moore Park neighbours.
Broncos fan Nick Frisby was one especially excited to have the Roosters drop in.
“I'm a massive rugby league fan, I am a Broncos supporter but it was a huge thrill to see some of those guys up close and then to actually train with them and against them was awesome,” he said.
“I just tried to stay away from the big boys.”
Frisby said it was a good chance to test out some different skills against players of a different code, in what was a physical encounter.
“I think there was a good respect for both games there today and we ran a bit of a hybrid game, attacking in union and defending in league and vice versa.
“It was interesting to see how the different skills transfer across the different games.”
Nick Phipps, whose Waratahs are based next door to the Roosters during Super Rugby season, said it was enlightening to change things up in the session.
“It's obviously something different that we haven't done before but it was great training against some of those great players,” he said.
Lucky enough to train against the wallabies today and awesome to meet this guy! @quadecooper #Theman #UptheAB's #TokTown #886 👑 A photo posted by 🇳🇿🇨🇰 (@josephmanu_) on Aug 1, 2016 at 11:23pm PDT
“Such a prestigious club, a lot of history there and their players are obviously at the peak of their game and getting to share a few ideas and going against each other in training against teams that haven't seen how they play too much, is something that's been pretty good.”
While there were a few ideas exchanged, Phipps joked there was some information they couldn't get out of their league counterparts.
“It was different for them, not having that 10-metre line against them and it was different for us the way they defended,” he said.
“It was great sharing a bit of knowledge... it was a great experience.”
Swansea's Tammy Abraham: I have to dream big... I would love to win the Ballon d'Or

Swansea striker Tammy Abraham has outlined his ambition to win "major trophies" - and even land the Ballon d'Or.
The 19-year-old joined Swansea on a season-long loan from Chelsea after scoring 26 goals in 48 games for Bristol City last season.
Although his start against Southampton last Saturday was only his third appearance in the Premier League, the England Under-21 international has high ambitions as he prepares to face Manchester United this Saturday, live on Sky Sports Premier League.
"I would love to win some major trophies and I would love to win the Ballon d'Or, that would be a perfect career," he told Sky Sports. "It's something to push for and work hard for. I have always been ambitious.
"I have to dream big this year. Last year I would have never dreamed of getting near 30 goals and I got 26 which was a massive thing for me. My dad said this year you have to aim for what you got last year, even beat it...I love it, it drives me and it's something to work hard for."
Abraham made his Swansea debut against Southampton
After returning to Chelsea in the summer, Abraham was wanted by Swansea, Newcastle and Brighton, but he revealed how a home visit from Swansea manager Paul Clement helped influence his decision.
"He came to my house and got to know my family," said Abraham. "We made a decision from there that he is someone I would love to work with and he had good ambitions for me. That's always nice and that's when I decided.
"You get to know the coach and what he wants and what his plans are for the season and for you. It gives me confidence.
"It was a big decision and we sat down as a family and put all the facts down and decided Swansea was the place to be. I spoke to staff at Chelsea as well and they said Paul is a fantastic guy and is really going to improve you."
2:46 Watch: Southampton 0-0 Swansea Watch: Southampton 0-0 Swansea
Abraham has been with Chelsea since the age of seven and made his first-team debut in a draw at Liverpool in May 2016.
He signed a five-year deal with the Premier League champions in July and harbours hopes of succeeding at Stamford Bridge in the future.
"Chelsea is a fantastic place for young kids," he said. "They develop you, work you hard, and you can see they have top-class talent all around the world.
"For me it's the right place to be. I have always wanted to play for Chelsea as a young kid so it would be nice to get into that team one day."
Paul Clement says Swansea will not pay over the odds for the players they want in the current transfer window Paul Clement says Swansea will not pay over the odds for the players they want in the current transfer window
While Abraham's long-term ambitions are at Chelsea, this season he is focused on Swansea, with Manchester United in his sights on Saturday.
"It's the biggest game of my career so far," he says. "We need to go into the game and give 100%. This is when you get to see what you are truly made of.
"I haven't got a target this season but I want to help the team as much as I can. We have a fantastic side. The boys showed that towards the end of last season. Hopefully we can take that confidence forward."

Microsoft opened up the Skype for Web Beta to everyone in the US and the UK last week — now it has rolled the service out to the rest of world.
“We've been hard at work and are pleased to announce that Skype for Web (Beta) is now available worldwide,” the Skype team say in a blog post.
‘Chromebooks can now use IM features, but can't make calls'
Skype for Web brings all of the VoIP service's popular features to the browsers, supporting video and voice calls, send instant messaging and file sending, all without the need to download a desktop app.
The expansion of the beta brings good news for Chromebook and Linux users too. Both platforms are now “allowed in” and can use the Skype for Web (Beta) website for instant messaging.
You need to be running Chrome on Windows (or Safari on Mac OS X) to make and receive voice and video calls through your browser. This is because the WebRTC plugin it requires is not (currently) available outside of these platforms.
Microsoft has not intimated when or if the plugin will be made available for Chromebooks.
How Well Does It Work?
I've spent some time trying the beta out and it works well. Calls are crisp and video streams at a decent clip.
Skype is a popular service and people like using it. It's just not reasonable (barely feasible) to expect everyone you know to switch to a different service just to speak to you, so seeing it widen access online is a really welcome move by Microsoft.
‘That Skype for Web exists shows how forward thinking Google were in making a cloud-centric OS'
And now that Chromebooks can join in the fun using the IM feature it should prove even more valuable, especially for those who like to stay in touch no matter where they are or what they're doing.
Try It, It's Free
The limited functionality on offer to Chromebook users may leave a little bitter taste. But if one takes an objective step back the fact that Skype for Web even exists underlines how forward-thinking Google was in building an OS built around cloud-centric services (and just how far Microsoft has evolved under the leadership of Satya Nadella).
To try the service out for yourself just hop, skip and jump to the Skype for Web website, sign in with your Skype or Microsoft Account details and you should be good to go.

This is the statement that the Presidential Transition Team posted not to long ago on social media regarding the phone conference president-elect Donald Trump had with Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Similarly, the en.Kremlin.ru website had this to say about today's phone conversation.
It should be noted that this conversation was planned in advance to ensure the fluid nature of US-Russian relation transitions smoothly and without any surprises.
It appears that after 4-8 years of ruinous Neo-con foreign policy, the two world powers will finally be working closer with each other to resolve a wide range of issues and abandoned disputes.
The US and Russia have many things to try and make right such as the situation in Syria, bilateral sanctions, and the Ukrainian situation.
Only time will tell if and how these two countries will plan on working with each other, but this bit of news is a good sign pointing to things going to the right direction.
CHICAGO - There was a shoulder to cry on if he wanted one late Monday, but all Ryan Miller needed was his dad's ear.
“Last night we were up for an hour talking about every goal,” Dean Miller said Tuesday. “Everything.”
Ryan Miller allowed five goals on 18 shots in the Vancouver Canucks' 5-3 loss to the Minnesota Wild and was hooked for the fourth time this season — one game after a 31-save 5-0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Turns out it is a good thing Dean Miller is here, along with many other dads on the National Hockey League team's fathers-and-sons trip.
Ryan Miller always has a lot on his mind. Following his first pre-season game in Vancouver after signing a three-year, $18-million-US contract with the Canucks, Miller answered a question by talking about the rain that day and its affect on humidity and ice conditions inside Rogers Arena. We weren't sure initially if Miller was joking. He was not.
The 34-year-old American is hyper-analytical.
According to Dean, Ryan was born that way.
“He was one of those kids when he was a baby, somebody might look at him and say ‘isn't he cute,' and poke him,” Dean said, watching his son practise Tuesday just down the road from the United Center, where the Canucks play the Chicago Blackhawks Wednesday night. “And Ryan would look at them, like: ‘What was that all about?' You could see him processing what happened. They poked me, so what do they expect from me? You could see it on his face. Mr. Serious here. He was always like that.
“He really thinks things through from a lot of different angles. It's one of the things that I think made him a pretty good goaltender. When he was coming up (through minor hockey), he was the smallest kid on a lot of his teams and had to be pretty smart to get to certain positions on the ice. He sees patterns and the odds of certain things happening.”
Ryan pleads guilty to being an analyst.
“I'm the oldest grandchild, the oldest sibling, so I've seen my younger (relatives) as infants and young children, and it's amazing how you pretty much are who you are,” he said. “You can maybe tip one way or another, but I've been pretty much like this for a long time. I try not to fight against it. Sometimes I ramble too much, but this is pretty much how I see the world now.”
None of the Minnesota goals appeared to be Miller's fault, although he got across his goalmouth slowly on a couple of them as the Wild, faster and sharper than the Canucks, found gaping holes in defensive coverage.
“We'd like to have them all back; that's how we think, that's what we strive for,” Miller said. “You want to come up with the timely save, get the guys going in the right direction.”
He'll have more time to think Wednesday night because it appeared Canucks coach Willie Desjardins would start backup Eddie Lack, who stopped all 14 Wild shots he faced in relief.
Like all good parents, Dean, 57, seems to be a good listener.
The Millers are hockey royalty in Michigan.
Starting with Dean's father, Elwood, 10 members of the Miller clan have played hockey for the Michigan State Spartans. Dean, who was born in Regina but grew up in East Lansing, Mich., played two college seasons in the late 1970s before embarking on a career in computer software, which took the family to both U.S. coasts.
Ryan Miller started playing goalie in a rink at a mall in Silicon Valley, where Dean worked as a distribution executive for security software-maker Symantec in Cupertino, Calif.
“The ceiling was about eight feet high and it had maybe two lights,” Dean said of the mall rink.
Ryan and younger brother, Detroit Red Wings forward Drew Miller, also went to Michigan State. Including their cousins, Kelly, Kevin and Kip Miller, the family has logged more than 3,000 games in the NHL.
Ryan said his dad can tell when he is frustrated and needs to talk.
“He'll recognize it more from my body language or my eyes,” Miller said. “He'll speak up when it's necessary (but) he gives us space to work things out. Just to be here and spend time with him is great.”
Dean figures he made five fathers' trips during Ryan's nine seasons with the Buffalo Sabres. Dean just finished a tour with Drew and the Red Wings.
“Yeah, he's doing an NHL schedule right now,” Ryan quipped.
Dean Miller said his son is happy in Vancouver, comfortable with the scrutiny and his new team.
“You watch somebody's career evolve over time,” the elder Miller said. “You think, here's this skinny kid from Michigan who nobody gave a chance to make it at this level, and he's done it himself. You go through stages: you're the guy who's fighting for the job, to the guy who has the job, to the guy who's fighting to keep the job, to the guy who will help the next guy transition to the job. Watching him go through that maturation and the cycle of life, it's impressive. It can be disconcerting a little bit, too, so you just try to let him know you're there and will help him no matter what.”
WHO'S NEXT: Canucks at Blackhawks
RECENT FORM
The Canucks lost 5-3 Monday in Minnesota, continuing a win-loss-win-loss pattern from the last three weeks. Their erraticism is reflected in their margin of victory or loss: two-or-more goals in 10 of the last 12 games. The Blackhawks are also scuffling along, albeit higher in the standings. Their 3-2 shootout loss at home Monday vs. Arizona, above, left Chicago's record at 8-8-1 in 2015. The Canucks beat the Hawks 4-1 in Vancouver Nov. 23.
WHO'S HOT, NOT
Canucks RW Radim Vrbata is on a seven-game points streak (2-5-7). LW/C Shawn Matthias and RW Zack Kassian has each scored in his last two games, the latter matching his output from the first four months of the season. C Linden Vey has one goal in 24 games and C Nick Bonino one point in nine. For Chicago, RW Marian Hossa has four goals in two games, but C Jonathan Toews' two assists on Monday tripled his points from the previous eight games.
BONI-YES OR BONINO
C Nick Bonino left Monday's game in the second period after blocking a shot, and departed the rink in a walking boot. He did not practise Tuesday but Canucks coach Willie Desjardins said Bonino could play tonight. If he can't, Shawn Matthias will switch to C and LW Ronalds Kenins return to the lineup. Canucks D Adam Clendening played four games before his trade from Chicago, but none at the United Center. He makes his debut Wednesday.
LACK BACK
On the strength of a perfect relief appearance Monday, backup goalie Eddie Lack is expected to start Wednesday night instead of Ryan Miller, who surrendered five goals in 18 shots. It would be Lack's third appearance in nine days, matching his workload from the previous six weeks. Lack won his last start 3-2 against the Winnipeg Jets last Tuesday and has allowed two or fewer goals in four of his last five starts.
QUOTEBOOK
“We've got to make sure we're ready. You know it's going to be a tough game. All five guys (on the ice) have to be committed and have to battle. If one guy breaks down, it's going to be trouble.” — Canucks coach Willie Desjardins.

[Welcome, National Newswatch readers!]
While Justin Trudeau's Liberals are trying to shape an economic policy that "builds from the middle out", the political challenge they face is to rebuild their party's vote-share from the centre out.
During the last general election, as John Ivision and others reported at the time, the Liberals' objective was to pursue a two-election strategy in which they would roll over the NDP in 2011, and then having consolidated the centre-left could turn rightwards and defeat a new Conservative leader in 2015. This was the strategy advocated by then-Ignatieff chief-of-staff Peter Donolo, the bulk of whose political experience came in the NDP-less era from 1993 forward, and who readily admits now that they underestimated the NDP in the lead up to the 2011 campaign.
Others have pointed to the lack of fit between the more blue-Liberal vibe of leader Michael Ignatieff and the nod-left tone of the party's "Family Pack" platform. If the party wanted to shift to the left to pick up NDP seats, undoubtedly they had the wrong leader to do so. But at the end of the day, it was exposing their flank to the right that was more costly to the party's seat count on May 2.
There was certainly more positioning than policy being considered during the Liberal leadership race of 2012-13, with the exception of Deborah Coyne who laid out extensive policy options, Joyce Murray who staked out clear policy positions and electoral strategy on the party's left, and Martha Hall Findlay who explicitly advocated a blue Liberal shift, having personally paid the price for lack of sufficient right-ward defences as her Willowdale seat fell along with sufficient others in north Toronto and the 905 to give the Conservatives their majority.
The approach of the Trudeau leadership campaign was for the most part to defer the left-vs-right decision as long as possible, by emphasizing values of Liberal pride, and "hope and hard work", rather than stake out policy positions that could constrain their options down the road. And what policy positions Trudeau did advocate were balanced off against one another. For a position against Northern Gateway, there was support for Keystone XL. For a strongly free trade orientation, there was opposition to ending supply management.
More recently, it has become clear to some observers (not only me) that the Liberals are orienting themselves economically more towards the right. This is a wise decision on their part, given the current weakness of the Conservative government, and also the availability of seats that should be low-hanging fruit for them that the NDP is unlikely to contest on a priority basis. Think Willowdale, but also Eglinton-Lawrence, York Centre, Thornhill, Newmarket, Vaughan, Oak Ridges, Halton, Oakville, Burlington, Wellington-Halton Hills … pretty much any seat with high average incomes and educational attainments, and no historic working class or social democratic voting traditions.
Even in Toronto Centre on Monday, the Liberal margin was bolstered generously from the Liberal-Conservative swing polls in Rosedale, while the NDP added to its strength south of Bloor and otherwise defended its base vote which should be sufficient to win the seat on its new boundaries in 2015.
To the extent that Justin Trudeau's election night remarks about Jack Layton were premeditated rather than ad-libbed, I'm guessing that this clear on-going effort to usurp the upbeat positioning of Barack Obama, personified by Jack Layton in Canada until his recent death, is a key part of the Liberals' play towards their left flank (along with the legalization of marijuana). Again, it's their best play, particularly given the sunny magnetism and youthful demeanour of their new leader, who is strong on the hustings if not in the House. But it did not prove sufficient to collapse the NDP vote in either of the central Canadian by-election seats.
Where Trudeau went too far on Monday night, was in explicitly trying to claim Jack Layton's mantle so soon after his death (and if you doubt the continued depth of feeling about this on the orange team, you haven't watched how your orange friends' Facebook feeds change every year on May 2, August 22 or any of the other meaningful anniversaries). First of all, it was an over-reach of Quayle-an proportions in the sense that if you have to say you're the next Layton instead of simply showing it, the proposition suddenly becomes ridiculous. Secondly, it showed Trudeau not to be a gracious winner (the way Layton had always been) and incapable of observing the gentleman's convention that election nights are for marking the temporary end of hostilities, to allow the parliamentary process to proceed.
But with more far-reaching consequences, Trudeau's comments touched a nerve within a party that has to this point maintained a disciplined public face of solidarity even as it grappled with its own changing of the guard. He at once thoroughly galvanized his competitors for the centre-left behind leader Tom Mulcair, and caused real damage to any future working relationship between the two opposition parties. These are mistakes the far more strategically adroit Layton would never have made, as he prized above-all his ability to work across party lines.
Looking ahead, there are seats the Liberals' growth at the expense of the Conservatives makes easier for them to win (such as the two-way races listed above), and others where it puts the NDP in a better position to win (Saskatchewan, southwest Ontario, and the interior of BC for example). The shadow cast by unpopular provincial governments mid-term will be felt more by the Liberals in 2015 (think Nova Scotia and BC) than by the NDP (as this past month in Manitoba). If the Liberals pursue their current path, and the government continues to suffer under the weight of its own scandals, they could see the Canadian political spectrum reshaped into a Liberal-vs-NDP contest with the Conservatives holding up the rear as a third party: arguably a better reflection of the range of Canadian political views that we have at present.
On the other hand, if they try to fight on two fronts simultaneously, any mistake could see them squeezed from both sides.
A basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML is needed to follow this tutorial.
An electronic poll simplifies the way polls are carried out and aggregates data in realtime. (These days, nobody needs to take a bus to town just to cast a vote for their favorite soccer team!) As voters cast their votes, every connected client that is authorised to see the poll data should see the votes as they come in.
This article explains how to seamlessly add realtime features to your polling app using Pusher while visualising the data on a chart using CanvasJS, in just 5 steps.
Some of the tools we will be using to build our app are:
Node : JavaScript on a server. Node will handle all our server related needs.
: JavaScript on a server. Node will handle all our server related needs. Express : Node utility for handling HTTP requests via routes
: Node utility for handling HTTP requests via routes Body Parser : Attaches the request payload on Express's req , hence req.body stores this payload for each request.
: Attaches the request payload on Express's , hence stores this payload for each request. Pusher : Pub/Sub pattern for building realtime solutions.
: Pub/Sub pattern for building realtime solutions. CanvasJS: A UI library to facilitate data visualization with JavaScript on the DOM.
Together, we will build a minimalist app where users can select their favourite JavaScript framework. Our app will also include an admin page where the survey owner can see the polls come in.
Let's walk through the steps one by one:
1. Polling screen
First things first. The survey participants or voters (call them whatever fits your context) need to be served with a polling screen. This screen contains clickable items from which they are asked to pick an option.
Try not to get personal with the options, we're just making a realtime demo. The following is the HTML behind the scenes:
<!-- ./index.html --> <div class="main"> <div class="container"> <h1>Pick your favorite</h1> <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="poll-logo angular"> <img src="images/angular.svg" alt=""> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="poll-logo ember"> <img src="images/ember.svg" alt=""> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="poll-logo react"> <img src="images/react.svg" alt=""> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="poll-logo vue"> <img src="images/vue.svg" alt=""> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="js-logo"> <img src="images/js.png" alt=""> </div> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axios/0.16.2/axios.js"></script> <script src="app.js"></script>
The HTML renders the polling cards and imports axios and our custom app.js file. axios will be used to make HTTP calls to a server we will create. This server is responsible for triggering/emitting realtime events using Pusher.
2. Send vote requests
When a user clicks on their chosen option, we want to react with a response. The response would be to trigger a HTTP request. This request is expected to create a Pusher event, but we are yet to implement that:
// ./app.js window.addEventListener('load', () => { var app = { pollLogo: document.querySelectorAll('.poll-logo'), frameworks: ['Angular', 'Ember', 'React', 'Vue'] } // Sends a POST request to the // server using axios app.handlePollEvent = function(event, index) { const framework = this.frameworks[index]; axios.post('http://localhost:3000/vote', {framework: framework}) .then((data) => { alert (`Voted ${framework}`); }) } // Sets up click events for // all the cards on the DOM app.setup = function() { this.pollLogo.forEach((pollBox, index) => { pollBox.addEventListener('click', (event) => { // Calls the event handler this.handlePollEvent(event, index) }, true) }) } app.setup(); })
When each of the cards are clicked, handlePollEvent is called with the right values as argument depending on the index. The method, in turn, sends the framework name to the server as payload via the /vote (yet to be implemented) endpoint.
3. Set up a Pusher account and app
Before we jump right into setting up a server where Pusher will trigger events based on the request sent from the client, you'll need to create a Pusher account and app, if you don't already have one:
Sign up for a free Pusher account. Create a new app by selecting Apps on the sidebar and clicking Create New button on the bottom of the sidebar. Configure your app by providing basic information requested in the form presented. You can also choose the environment you intend to integrate Pusher into for a better setup experience. You can retrieve your app credentials from the App Keys tab
4. Realtime server
The easiest way to set up a Node server is by using the Express project generator. You need to install this generator globally on your machine using npm:
npm install express-generator -g
The generator is a scaffold tool, therefore it's useless after installation unless we use its command to create a new Express app. We can do that by running the following command:
express poll-server
This generates a few helpful files including the important entry point ( app.js ) and routes (found in the routes folder).
We just need one route to get things moving: a /vote route which is where the client is sending a post request.
Create a new vote.js file in the routes folder with the following logic:
// ./routes/votes.js var express = require('express'); var Pusher = require('pusher'); var router = express.Router(); var pusher = new Pusher({ appId: '<APP_ID>', key: '<APP_KEY>', secret: '<APP_SECRET>', cluster: '<APP_CLUSTER>', encrypted: true }); // /* Vote router.post('/', function(req, res, next) { pusher.trigger('poll', 'vote', { points: 10, framework: req.body.framework }); res.send('Voted'); }); module.exports = router;
For the above snippet to run successfully, we need to install the Pusher SDK using npm. The module is already used but it's not installed yet:
npm install --save pusher
At the top of the file, we import Express and Pusher, then configure a route with Express and a Pusher instance with the credentials we retrieved from the Pusher dashboard.
The configured router is used to create a POST /vote route which, when hit, triggers a Pusher event. The trigger is achieved using the trigger method which takes the trigger identifier( poll ), an event name ( vote ), and a payload.
route which, when hit, triggers a Pusher event. The trigger is achieved using the method which takes the trigger identifier( ), an event name ( ), and a payload. The payload can be any value, but in this case we have a JS object. This object contains the points for each vote and the name of the option (in this case, a framework) being voted. The name of the framework is sent from the client and received by the server using req.body.framework .
. We still go ahead to respond with “Voted” string so we don't leave the server hanging in the middle of an incomplete request.
In the app.js file, we need to import the route we have just created and add it as part of our Express middleware. We also need to configure CORS because our client lives in a different domain, therefore the requests will NOT be made from the same domain:
// ./app.js
// Other Imports var vote = require('./routes/vote'); // CORS app.all('/*', function(req, res, next) { // CORS headers res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // Only allow POST requests res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST'); // Set custom headers for CORS res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-type,Accept,X-Access-Token,X-Key'); }); // Ensure that the CORS configuration // above comes before the route middleware // below app.use('/vote', vote); module.exports = app;
5. Connect a dashboard
The last step is the most interesting aspect of the example. We will create another page in the browser which displays a chart of the votes for each framework. We intend to access this dashboard via the client domain but on the /admin.html route.
Here is the markup for the chart:
<!-- ./admin.html --> <div class="main"> <div class="container"> <h1>Chart</h1> <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div> </div> </div> <script src="https://js.pusher.com/4.0/pusher.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/canvasjs/1.7.0/canvasjs.js"></script> <script src="app.js"></script>
The div with the id charContainer is where we will mount the chart.
is where we will mount the chart. We have imported Pusher and Canvas JS (for the chart) via CDN as well as the same app.js that our home page uses.
We need to initialize the chart with a default dataset. Because this is a simple example, we won't bother with persisted data, rather we can just start at empty (zeros):
// ./app.js window.addEventListener('load', () => { // Event handlers for // vote cards was here. // Just truncated for brevity let dataPoints = [ { label: "Angular", y: 0 }, { label: "Ember", y: 0 }, { label: "React", y: 0 }, { label: "Vue", y: 0 }, ] const chartContainer = document.querySelector('#chartContainer'); if(chartContainer) { var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", { animationEnabled: true, theme: "theme2", data: [ { type: "column", dataPoints: dataPoints } ] }); chart.render(); } // Here: // - Configure Pusher // - Subscribe to Pusher events // - Update chart })
The dataPoints array is the data source for the chart. The objects in the array have a uniform structure of label which stores the frameworks and y which stores the points.
array is the data source for the chart. The objects in the array have a uniform structure of which stores the frameworks and which stores the points. We check if the chartContainer exists before creating the chart because the index.html file doesn't have a chartContainer .
exists before creating the chart because the file doesn't have a . We use the Chart constructor function to create a chart by passing the configuration for the chart which includes the data. The chart is rendered by calling render() on constructor function instance.
We can start listening to Pusher events in the comment placeholder at the end:
// ./app.js // ...continued // Allow information to be // logged to console Pusher.logToConsole = true; // Configure Pusher instance var pusher = new Pusher('<APP_KEY>', { cluster: '<APP_CLUSTER>', encrypted: true }); // Subscribe to poll trigger var channel = pusher.subscribe('poll'); // Listen to vote event channel.bind('vote', function(data) { dataPoints = dataPoints.map(x => { if(x.label == data.framework) { // VOTE x.y += data.points; return x } else { return x } }); // Re-render chart chart.render() });
First we ask Pusher to log every information about realtime transfers to the console. You can leave that out in production.
We then configure Pusher with our credentials by passing the app key and config object as arguments to the Pusher constructor function.
The name of our trigger is poll , so we subscribe to it and listen to its vote event. Hence, when the event is triggered, we update the dataPoints variable and re-render the chart with render()
Conclusion
We didn't spend time building a full app with identity and all, but you should now understand the model for building a fully fleshed poll system. We just made a simple realtime poll app with Pusher showing how powerful Pusher can be.
Max Verstappen is Belgian says his mother
Max Verstappen's mother says the 17-year-old is in fact Belgian and not Dutch..
The Toro Rosso rookie, now making waves as the youngest ever driver and points-scorer in F1 history, is the son of former grand prix star Jos Verstappen.
Jos is Dutch, and Max now competes with a Dutch racing licence. But the youngster was, in fact, born in Belgium, the native country of his mother Sophie Kumpen.
Kumpen is a famous female kart star, who fell out badly with Jos some years ago. Their dispute involved the police and went all the way to court, with Jos Verstappen said to have been threatened with jail at one point for alleged harassment and assault.
Now, Kumpen has told Het Laatste Nieuws, a Dutch-language Belgian newspaper, that her son is in fact Belgian.
“The only identification that Max has is Belgian,” she claimed. He turns 18 on September 30, and on that date, and not before, he can opt for Dutch nationality. In the meantime, he is Belgian and nothing else.”
You might assume that the only connection that Japanese gangsters have with video gaming is via Sega's popular Yakuza series, but a little digging reveals anecdotes about console shipment times being shifted to avoid criminal interference and even suggestions that Nintendo itself could have historic ties with the organisation.
While these disturbing reports trickle through from time to time, it is clear that western knowledge of other criminal activity in the Japanese games industry over the past few decades is almost non-existent, and even in Japan such events are hushed up to prevent any problems or embarrassment. However, we've come across a truly staggering story which involves one of Japan's most famous video game companies, an alleged kidnapping and a totally smashed-up arcade unit.
Before we fully recount this disturbing and almost unbelievable tale, it's worth pointing a few things out. The following interview is found in John Szczepaniak's book The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Volume 2, and many of the names are redacted for legal reasons. Szczepaniak also interviewed the source under the agreement of complete anonymity.
The interviewee - speaking under the catch-all pseudonym Hideo Nanashi (the interview in question is in fact an amalgamation of several interviews with different people) - talks to Szczepaniak about cancelled titles and other topics before addressing what has to be one of the most explosive stories in the entire book - his sibling's abduction by gangsters at the behest of a leading Japanese game maker, which shall remain nameless:
My younger sister was kidnapped. [REDACTED] hired some gangsters to do it. They did it to make me stop cooperating with Nintendo.
While this all sounds stranger than fiction, a little context is called for. In Japan, the arcade industry had links to organised crime - namely the Yakuza. Nanashi explains:
In Japan, you have these evil companies that always crop up, and unlike the West, in Japan there's a perception that "play" is bad, the opposite of hard work. So amusement-oriented industries inevitably become infested with evil companies and ties to the underworld. Take arcades, for example. In legal terms, they're covered under laws regarding the entertainment and amusement trades. So they're managed under the same laws that regulate the adult, or "pink", industry. Because of that, the underworld gets involved. The only companies that have been able to do business while staying clean are probably Nintendo and Namco.
Nanashi then recounts the amazing kidnapping story in more detail, explaining that he hired a truck-mounted crane to drop an arcade machine in front of the company's offices to show he meant business:
It was one of their game machines. I dropped it in front of their offices, smashed it. And I told them that one of their employees would be next. To show them that I was serious. That way they would feel ashamed of their actions, you know? It was easy for me to get a [REDACTED] arcade cabinet cheaply, so I bought one from a distributor. I thought about robbing a [REDACTED] arcade, too, but that's much more difficult, and that would make me a criminal. With what I ended up doing, I could have been charged with something like unlawful dumping of garbage, but that's a minor offence. Whereas if I had robbed a [REDACTED] arcade, I would have been arrested. [REDACTED] was well-versed in using the underworld to get what they want, so if you're going up against them, you have to be smart. They're a big company, so if you try to fight them with ordinary methods, they'll work with the police and get the legal system to come after you. They might even pay off a politician, like a member of the National Diet. Who knows what they're capable of?
I just smashed it in front of their main office in the middle of the night. It was easy. The [REDACTED] headquarters are in [REDACTED] now, but back then they were near [REDACTED] Airport. Their office building was right in front of a major street, in a commercial district without any residential homes. ...I didn't dump it myself. I had someone else do it, because I don't have a driver's license. I had him just drop the machine and dump it, so I don't know how damaged it was, but I assume it smashed apart. And then I sent [REDACTED] a letter.
Apparently, this isn't the first time that the company in question has come under fire in Japan for its shady working practices, and Nanashi touches upon another controversy from a while back:
I don't know how much you know about [REDACTED], but are you aware of the "quarantine room" [隔離部屋, literal translation: "Isolation room"] problem from around the year 2000? They would put employees alone in a room and give them absolutely nothing to do, in order to make them resign. [REDACTED] did that, and former [REDACTED] employees sued them and won. That's the kind of thing [REDACTED] did back then. They didn't just put people behind a partition or something, they sent them away to a completely different floor of the building. [REDACTED] didn't just lose a lawsuit over this, they completely tarnished their image. Nobody wanted to buy games from a company like that. It became a major social issue. Like this article, about [REDACTED] being sued for the quarantine room and issuing a public apology.
We've done our own research to verify such claims and are aware of the identity of the company in question and the person being interviewed, but like Szczepaniak we are withholding names as not doing so could trigger legal action. In addition, for those of you that dig and uncover the name of the company, this report should not be considered to be reflective of the company as it stands today. Even so, it nevertheless stands as a terrifying example of just how deeply organised crime managed to penetrate the Japanese video game industry 20 years ago.
Szczepaniak's book is utterly essential reading, and is available now.
On Saturday, a man allegedly stabbed three people in a London subway and then approached several officers. What happened next might surprise some Americans.
In video released on Twitter, the knife-wielding suspect can be seen lunging toward a man standing near two officers; the victim pushes him off. The officers, pointing stun guns at the suspect, appear to show restraint even after he moves toward them. They don't discharge their weapons until after they've notified him several times that they're about to do so.
VIDEO: Attacker shouted “This is for #Syria” as he slit the throat of another passenger - @News_Executive pic.twitter.com/BEb9wGxmiJ — Conflict News (@Conflicts) December 5, 2015
In comparison, here's how officers in San Francisco reacted on Wednesday to a stabbing suspect who was stumbling against a wall while holding a knife. (Note that the video is graphic and disturbing.)
A video posted by HotRod (@daniggahot) on Dec 2, 2015 at 4:59pm PST
In both incidents, the suspect is holding a knife near police. But there's a glaring difference in the officers' reaction to the situation.
In the San Francisco video, far more officers respond and all of them are carrying guns, though officers later said they tried to subdue the suspect with beanbag guns before shooting him. In London, the two officers in the video carry stun guns.
In San Francisco, the suspect died in a hail of bullets. In London, the suspect was subdued.
Meanwhile, the U.K. is on its second-highest alert level, meaning a militant attack is considered highly likely.
Few officers carry firearms in the U.K. In fact, a 2006 survey of the British Police Federation, which represents all officers in the U.K., found that 82 percent of members didn't even want officers to be armed. Each police unit has its own firearms team, but police-involved incidents are routinely gun-free, according to the BBC.
Gun violence remains low in the U.K., and officers have less of a need to fight fire with fire, the BBC reports.
Many of you will be aware of the new core storage features that were introduced in vSphere 6.5. If not, you can learn about them in this recently published white paper. Without doubt, the feature that has created the most amount of interest is automated unmap (finally, I hear you say!). Now a few readers have asked about the following comment in the automated unmap section.
Automatic UNMAP is not supported on arrays with UNMAP granularity greater than 1MB. Auto UNMAP feature support is footnoted in the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide (HCL).
So where do you find this info in the HCL? I'll show you here.
First, navigate to the VMware HCL – Storage/SAN Section. Click here for a direct link.
Next select ESXi 6.5, the vendor of the array, and in the features section, Thin Provisioning. Finally click on “Update and View Results”. This will provide a list of supported arrays and models. In this example, I selected DELL as a vendor. It produced a range of Compellent and EQL arrays. I choose Compellent Storage Center with Array Type FC, as shown below:
Now, if I expand on the 6.5 supported release, I can see the tested configurations, including the supported driver, firmware, multipathing and fail-over policies associated with this array config.
If I expand any of those entries, I will see the footnote entries. In this example, let me select the FW version 7.1, with 16GB FC Switch and lpfc HBA.
And there you can see the statement in the footnotes that this configuration support automatic storage space reclamation on VMFS6.
Let's compare this to an iSCSI configuration using the same arrays. Here is the list of iSCSI Compellent configurations, once more detailing the supported driver, firmware, multipathing and fail-over policies associated with this array config.
Let's select the 7.1 firmware version as before, and examine the footnotes:
As you can clearly see, there is no mention of automatic unmap/space reclamation support in the footnotes in this example. Therefore unsupported. Note: Since this article was published, the HCL listing shown above has been updated to reflect the automatic unmap certifications are completed on Compellent, and are now supported!
As you can see, support statements around unmap will continue to change, so check back regularly to see whether or not your array vendor has passed the certification tests required to support automated unmap. Alternatively, speak to your array vendor to find out where they are on the certification path.
The more than 700 “shared” red scooters available for rent via technology app Scoot may soon be allowed to park for unlimited time in neighborhoods that require parking permits.
Currently, the mopeds are able to do so under a pilot program. But before 2015, the shared vehicles would be ticketed even if no one rented them.
The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors will take up the decision Tuesday on whether to move forward with a new Shared Electric Moped Parking Permit Proposal.
“We're really glad the MTA is moving forward,” said Eli Saddler, head of public affairs at Scoot.
That's a major step in allowing shared vehicles access to curb space in parking permit areas, which are traditionally where vehicles owned by San
Franciscans take priority. Under the proposal, shared mopeds would be exempt from the residential parking permit time limits that cars with stickers must abide by.
Scoot will also pay for annual permits for each of its 750 mopeds, at $325 per vehicle — that's close to $240,000 a year.
Andy Thornley, a senior analyst with the SFMTA, said that Scoot will need to share data with the SFMTA as part of the deal.
“This is a way for the MTA to get a binding relationship with Scoot in a friendly cooperative way,” he said.
However, ahead of that approval Scoot is hoping for one major tweak: Scooters, they say, should be able to park on any curb.
Right now, the permit proposal limits shared electric mopeds to curbs less than eight feet long. But Saddler said Scoot's mopeds are slender, and can fit in longer curb spaces in between cars, and at the ends when there are a few feet of space remaining.
The eight-foot restriction limits Scoot's ability to expand in The City, he said: “There are just some streets in San Francisco without an eight-foot curb.”
Thornley said the SFMTA found that some neighbors wanted to park their cars partially across their own driveways, and a portion of the nearby curb.
Restricting Scoots to less than eight feet of curb helped preserve this while still allowing Scoot to expand — a compromise.
“Everyone gets a little something,” Thornley said.

(CNN) -- She said she was a scapegoat. She said she was just following orders. She said she was demoted unfairly.
Retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski was one of two officers punished over Abu Ghraib.
Now, retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski can say: I told you so.
Karpinski was one of two officers punished over the aggressive interrogations at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Pictures of detainees caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. The photos showed naked prisoners stacked on top of each other or being threatened by dogs or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution.
Throughout the ordeal, Karpinski maintained that she and her troops were following interrogation guidelines approved by top brass. Today, Karpinski has found validation in a few Bush-era memos released last week by the Obama administration.
"The outrage was over the photographs, because the photographs were living color of what those top-secret memorandums authorized," Karpinski said in an interview Wednesday. "So, it is unfair ... the soldiers may have moved through [the military justice] system, but they never had a fair court-martial. Not any one of them, because they were condemned as one of the 'bad apples.' "
Karpinski, then a brigadier general and commander of Abu Ghraib, was demoted to colonel because of the scandal. A second officer, Col. Thomas Pappas, the commander of the military intelligence unit assigned to Abu Ghraib when the offenses occurred, was relieved of duty and fined in May 2005. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz as "bad apples" -- were disciplined.
The memo, by then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and then-Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury, allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper, and putting detainees on a liquid diet. One memo said aggressive techniques such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain.
"I will tell you that when I read those memorandums, when they were first released a few days ago, I did -- I did feel this sense of being able to exhale after five years," Karpinski said.
"That is what we have been saying from the very beginning, that, wait a minute, why are you inside pointing the finger at me, why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here? There's a bigger story here."
The Senate Armed Forces Committee released a report Tuesday, five days after the memos were released, stating that senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists, despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys.
The report points to then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's approval of such techniques -- including stress positions, removal of clothing, use of phobias (such as fear of dogs), and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli -- in December 2002 for detainees at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His OK prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques.
The guidance was delivered to Abu Ghraib by then-Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, who was summoned to Baghdad from Guantanamo to evaluate the prison system.
"We had a myriad of problems in our -- in the prison system, not with detainees who were undergoing interrogations, but with Iraqi criminal prisoners," Karpinski said. "And instead of coming to give us support, he was sent specifically to work with the military intelligence interrogators to teach them the harsher techniques that were being used down in Guantanamo."
Shortly before he left office in late 2006, Rumsfeld said the day the Abu Ghraib scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary.
"Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened," he said at the time. "I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse."
But Karpinski said the condition of detainees at the prison should have come as no surprise for the Bush administration.
"I think it was torture, absolutely. You know, I was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations, but I read the memorandums many times over," she said. "Waterboarding is torture."
Karpinski said that while she was the commander of Abu Ghraib, she didn't personally witness any of the interrogation techniques.
"The first time I saw the photographs was at the end of January [2004]," she said.
Karpinski said she was ordered by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the U.S. commander of operations in Iraq at the time, not to discuss the photographs or the investigation with anybody.
Now, despite any relief felt by the release of the memos and the Senate report, Karpinski said she will have a hard time shaking off the humiliation and disgrace brought on by the Abu Ghraib scandal.
"I think that, you know, you cannot dismiss five years of having to live under these accusations," she said, "and people associating my name and these soldiers' names with what they were so unfairly accused of."

The Lowe's Companies, the nation's second-biggest home improvement retailer after Home Depot, said Friday that its fourth-quarter profit dropped 60 percent, and it forecast 2009 earnings short of Wall Street's expectations.
The latest results narrowly missed analysts' estimates as consumers spent less on items for their houses amid a deepening recession.
Its shares fell 6.6 percent, to $15.86.
Earnings declined to $162 million, or 11 cents a share, in the three months ended in Jan. 30, from $408 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
The retailer said revenue fell 4 percent, to $9.98 billion from $10.4 billion a year ago.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 12 cents a share on revenue of almost $10.1 billion. Those estimates typically exclude one-time items.

Lowe's said it faced intense competition during the holiday season and had to make more aggressive discounts on seasonal products. That decision squeezed Lowe's gross margins but helped it reduce inventory in stores.

Sales at stores open at least a year dropped 9.9 percent.
“The economic pressures on consumers intensified in the fourth quarter, resulting in a further decline in consumer confidence and dramatic reductions in consumer spending,” Robert A. Niblock, Lowe's chief executive, said in a statement.
MOSCOW -- Turkish nationals in Russia have been grimly exchanging horror stories ever since Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 bomber near the Syrian border on November 24, an incident that has spurred a furious Russian response.
Scores of Turks have been detained by immigration police at construction sites and Turkish factories have been hit by unscheduled tax-police raids. Hundreds of angry Russians gathered outside the Turkish Embassy and threw rocks at the windows. And Turks say they fear police harassment and are avoiding the subway.
But perhaps worst of all for Russia's community of up to 90,000 Turkish nationals -- many of whom work in construction -- is the realization that they may have to uproot themselves and their families as the Kremlin's retaliatory measures against Turkey begin to bite.
On November 28, four days after the downing, President Vladimir Putin signed a raft of measures designed to enhance Russian "national security" and the "protection" of Russian citizens. They included scrapping Russia's visa-free regime with Turkey, ending charter flights between the two countries, and banning Russian companies from hiring Turkish workers for projects commissioned after this month.
Even Turkish nationals who are spared the sanctions' direct effects are likely to feel the chill.
It seems likely to spell the end of the Moscow years for 34-year-old Umut, who works for a Russian construction company selling equipment to Turkish companies.
He has called the Russian capital home for over a decade and has a Russian wife, Anna, and a 1-year-old son, Roman, who's also a Russian citizen.
"She is afraid, she doesn't know what will happen," Umut says. "She always thought we would stay here and that Roma would grow up here. I can't see the future here anymore. We need to make plans to leave -- in either the next six months or the next year."
How long they have left depends mainly on how Putin's sanctions play out.
Details of the bomber incident are disputed, but both states continue to dig in their heels.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on November 30 that construction contracts signed before the end of the year will not be affected, which Umut believes should give him another year in Russia.
But Svetlana Gannushkina, a leading human rights worker who specializes in migration cases for the NGO Civic Assistance, warns that the sanctions are vaguely defined and expresses pessimism about the future for Turkish nationals in Russia.
"I think they will all be forced to leave the country," Gannushkina says. "I don't really understand what legally is supposed to happen -- it is absolutely unclear [in legal terms], but in practice, we see what [frequently] happens."
Since the bomber was downed, Russian border guards have barred entry to scores of Turks even though the visa-free regime with Turkey is supposed to remain in place until January 1. Gannushkina says she was awakened one night earlier this week by acquaintances complaining that their friend, a young Turkish woman living in Budapest, had been turned away at the border.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says the families of Turks living in Russia number up to 200,000.
Hitting Home
The Russian wives of Turks are circulating an online petition seeking help from Russia's president.
The document, which had garnered nearly 4,000 signatures by December 2, sought help to allow law-abiding Turks with Russian families to keep their Russian jobs and to discourage the Federal Migration Services from creating unwarranted problems for them, and urged a stop to a perceived anti-Turkish campaign on state media.
Many Turkish companies effectively put their operations on standstill in hopes the crisis might be defused if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Putin met at the UN Climate Change Summit in Paris, where both leaders were in attendance for the opening on November 30. But they did not meet.
Ankara insists the downing came after multiple warnings over the plane's incursion into its airspace, while Moscow says its Su-24 never left the skies over Syria, where Russia continues a two-month-old bombing campaign to prop up Syria's government and strike at alleged terrorist targets. Russia has buried the pilot, who was apparently shot and killed by militants as he parachuted into the war zone, and a Russian service member killed during a rescue mission to retrieve the pilot and navigator.
End Of An Era?
The dispute appears to spell the twilight of Turkish business in Russia and the country's dominant role in the construction sector. Experienced Turkish companies rapidly carved out a niche for themselves 15 years ago, when Russia entered a construction boom in the early years of Putin's rule as the price of oil climbed precipitously, flooding the country with cash.
Turkish builders occupy prominent space in the capital. Renaissance Construction, a major Turkish company, is currently building its own skyscraper in Moscow City, the Russian financial center.
"When the plane crashed, the work simply stopped -- suddenly," says Umut. "We are not working."
For several years, Umut has used his contacts within Turkish companies in Russia to help rake in millions of euros in profits for the Russian construction company where he sells construction equipment. His clients have frozen operations, though, which means he currently has little to do.
Mustafa, 34, a longtime Moscow resident who also doesn't want his surname revealed, has imported Turkish construction equipment for sale in Russia for several years. But his operations have been thrown into disarray as equipment is stopped by Russian border guards.
Having worked his whole adult life in Russia, Umut is not relishing the prospect of moving. "If I go to Turkey, I can't do anything. In Turkey the job I do is done by trained engineers. I have this job in Moscow because I came at the right time," he says. "Maybe I can open up a cafe. That's the only thing that I can do."
Lying Low
Turkish expats in Moscow say they have been unnerved by the wave of anti-Turkish sentiment, which has shown echoes of the anti-Ukrainian fervor that has dominated Russian media since the Euromaidan unrest that unseated a pro-Moscow leader in Kyiv in early 2014.
It is also manifesting itself in peculiar public gestures. Local media in Saratov report that a restaurant chain called Turkish Tandoor has ordered its branches in the central Russian city to cover up the word "Turkish" in its restaurant placards.
But it is a major cause of concern for Turks. Can, 29, a mechanical engineer in Moscow from the Turkish city of Ismid, no longer takes the subway out of fear that police will harass him for his documents -- a problem often encountered by Central Asian labor migrants.
One of Can's Turkish friends was kicked out of a taxi recently after he responded honestly to the cab driver's question about his nationality.
Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Kremlin Human Rights Council, on December 1 warned the country in comments carried by Interfax to dial down rhetoric against Turkey. "I entirely understand the perturbation experienced because of the attack on the Russian warplane, which is a crime and a tragedy, but this is not a reason to stoke this anti-Turkish atmosphere."
Turkish nationals in Russia who have been caught in the crossfire between Erdoğan and Putin variously blame both men for the current situation.
But Umut says he hopes that with Russia hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and committed to some ambitious construction projects, the Kremlin might quietly remove barriers to Turkish construction companies operating in Russia.
"I have hope," he says, "but then Putin can just [ban us all anyway]. He's like Erdoğan, they're the same. Their character is the same; they're dictators."
What is autoimmune disease? You are likely hearing this term more and more every day, and you are likely meeting more and more people who claim to have one. What does it mean, though?
"A disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy cells."
That is the generic definition. Basically, it means that in some way that person's body has turned against itself. It has begun to view healthy tissue as "the enemy" and the immune system starts to attack and break down things that it shouldn't. This starts to make certain organs within the body function improperly, creates a wide variety of sometimes debilitating symptoms, and usually means that person gets to be on a lifetime of medications to help control their disease and keep their organs functioning properly so that they can live their lives as best as possible.
It's really hard to fully describe what having an autoimmune disease is like to someone who is not experiencing it themselves. I feel that even the description above doesn't do full justice to trying to get someone to understand what it's like living with an autoimmune disease.
I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, as an example. With this autoimmune disease my immune system has viewed my thyroid tissue as an enemy, and has thus started attacking and killing my thyroid, which has placed me into a state of hypothyroidism. The kicker with this version of hypothyroidism vs. a state of hypothyroidism that comes without Hashimoto's is that wider array of symptoms I mentioned above. What are some of these symptoms? Some that I, personally, have experienced include: brain fog, severe joint pain, muscle weakness, weight gain, dry/itchy skin, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, puffy eyes, sensitivity to cold, tightness in throat, enlarged lymph nodes...
The disease that I have is just one of many, many autoimmune diseases that have been identified (see a full list here). They are exceedingly hard to diagnose because many of them have cross-over symptoms with each other and various non-autoimmune diseases as well. If not properly diagnosed, treated, and monitored, there are some of these diseases which can be fatal as well.
They are hard for doctors to predict and diagnose because the jury is still out on what really, really causes these autoimmune diseases to form within people. There is no set formula and no way to fully predict that someone may or may not develop one. There are documented cases that link people with autoimmune disease to environmental pollution and prescription drugs, but genetics can also highly play a role here as well. One viewpoint on autoimmune diseases calls it finding "the perfect storm." Meaning, when a person's body experiences their own perfect storm of genetics + environment + medications + nutrition = autoimmune disease outbreak within.
One of most frustrating reasons that they are hard to diagnose is that many, many doctors still don't fully understand autoimmune diseases and there are some, yet still, who don't really believe in their existence fully. Most people with autoimmune disease diagnosis have seen multiple doctors to try and figure out what's wrong with them before they are able to finally find a doctor who believes them and doesn't think they are "making things up." To get an idea of what this is like, I can't describe it any better than this article from The New Yorker called "What's Wrong With Me?" It describes, so closely, what I went through and what I continue to go through as an autoimmune sufferer. Please, take the time to read this, especially if you know someone with an autoimmune disease. This will give you such a greater understanding of what they've been through and what they continue to go through.
You see, most people with autoimmune diseases "look fine." Meaning, we don't have any outward characteristics that are easy "tells" for our illnesses. Because of this, many people have a hard time believing us when we mention our symptoms and how we are feeling on any given day, because nothing can be wrong with us... we look fine. Top that off with the fact that we don't want to burden anyone with how we may feel, so we've gotten really good at "faking it," and with overcoming it. Ask us how we feel and we'll likely reply, "I'm fine." Those with autoimmune diseases are some of the strongest people I know because of this very reason.
The truth is, we really don't want pity either, as we fight every day to learn how to live with our diseases and learn what we can do, lifestyle wise, to ease the burden of the disease itself. What we do ask, though, is for a greater understanding of autoimmune diseases in general, as well as how they affect our daily lives. We also hope that you'll understand what we may be like when we are experiencing an autoimmune flair up and to be kind and understanding with what we are going through. Sometimes we may not be thinking as clearly due to brain fog, we may have trouble finding words, we may not want to go out due to extreme fatigue or bodily pain, or we may feel anxious or depressed. Mostly, though, we just want you to believe us when we mention what we are experiencing, and not to brush it off as "all in our head" simply because we "look fine."
These are the faces of autoimmune disease sufferers. We are all beautiful people fighting every day to live normal lives, and we are succeeding at it pretty well, I'd say, because you can't tell what we have by looking as us, can you?
Those pictured above suffer from an array of autoimmune diseases including, but not limited to: Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Vitiligo, Fibromyalgia, Interstitial Cystitis, Celiac Disease, Pressure Urticaria, Crohn's Disease, Psoriatic Arthritis, Sjögren's Syndrome, Scleroderma, Lupus, Lichen Planus, Raynaud's Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis.
(Thank you to the friends who let me share your photos, and also to those whose photos I wasn't able to fit into the collage.)

Class is everything in Britain. It dictates how the British live and when they die, which children succeed and which fail. Above all else, class imposes silence. Counterfeit controversies obsess the media and politics. When presented with a genuine scandal that cries out for punishment and reform, the talking heads and the professional contrarians say nothing.
Readers would not guess from the "national conversation" that the construction industry is sitting on a story as grave in its implications as the phone-hacking affair – graver I will argue. You are unlikely to have heard mention of it for a simple and disreputable reason: the victims are working-class men rather than celebrities. The parallels between what happened in the news and building businesses are almost exact. As in the media, there was a corporate conspiracy. Sir Robert McAlpine, Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Amec, Skanska, Taylor Woodrow and 34 other construction companies behaved like a secret police force monitoring a subject population. The files of their "Consulting Association" – and what a soothingly bland name they chose – refer to construction companies by a code name.
Anonymous site managers supplied details, often false, of alleged troublemakers in the building trade. Some human resources departments then checked job applicants against the Consulting Association's records, paying £2 per check for the service, and never told the men they rejected why they had banned them for work. In its pomp, the CA was a busy place. Records suggest McAlpine alone spent £28,000 on checks. By the time the Information Commissioner's officials seized its database, 3,400 workers were on the blacklist.
As with News International, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting police collusion. The files contain accounts of building workers attending demonstrations against the BNP, which are highly unlikely to have come from construction industry managers. "They read like police reconnaissance reports," said one investigator for the Information Commissioner, who is also a former police officer. As with News International, there is now a mass legal action. Daniel Boffey, our dogged policy editor, reports in today's news pages that the first of what may be many claims by blacklisted workers has begun. Eighty-six men are suing Sir Robert McAlpine for £17m in lost earnings. By a neat serendipity, McAlpine not only funded the Tory party but also built the Olympic stadium, so the action doesn't lack topical resonance. Its lawyers will claim blacklisters' files contained details of the builders' political views, attitudes towards health and safety, relationships and friendships, which would make News of the World hack gasp with envious admiration.
At this point, comparison breaks down. Hacking hurt reputations but it did not threaten lives. Blacklisted workers, by contrast, have shared the anger and amazement of the citizens of dictatorships after a revolution. They have gone through files their employers never meant them to see and marvelled at how malicious minds twisted their past to put them on the dole. Like so many other blacklisted men, Dave Smith, a genuine working-class hero and leader of the campaign against the blacklist, wondered why he could never get work. He would turn up to a site with his friends. The foreman would take on his friends but not him. "By 2000, I couldn't sleep. I was defaulting on the mortgage and the kids were on milk tokens." On one occasion, Smith protested after an explosion of compressed air in a tunnel blasted a crater in a school playground. If children had been at school, they would have died. But in the files he found that the spy beside him on the job mentioned only his protests, not the threat to lives.
Construction is a trade where men leave for work in the morning and come back in a coffin at night. Even in 2010-2011, in the middle of a recession and with the construction industry on its knees, 50 died in accidents that might have been preventable. There will be many more coffins when and if growth returns. The construction companies could not be clearer that men who try to enforce minimum safety standards are their enemies. The files included formal letters notifying a company that a worker was the official safety rep on a site as evidence against him.
Construction is a casual industry because companies do not want to employ craftsmen full time: 50% are self-employed and most of the rest are agency workers. Even the British law, so negligent about health and welfare of building workers in many respects, recognises the position of safety reps. The files show that the construction industry sees becoming a rep as grounds for banning workers for life. Even those they label as "not a militant" – and there are many – are on the blacklist because at some point they have spoken about dangers at work.
The blacklisting puts conservative protests about "'elf and safety" and "political correctness gone mad" in their place. The trouble with political correctness in Britain is that it is not nearly mad enough about cowboy multinationals, which regard the lives of casual labourers as dispensable. Steve Murphy, the general secretary of the builders' union UCATT, says that business's influence in politics and the media is having an effect. The coalition has commissioned one Ragnar E Löfstedt, an American academic with a laissez-faire bent, to recommend that self-employed building workers, who pose no threat to others, should be exempt from health and safety rules.
The British Labour movement has inspired few novels. One undisputed classic is The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. Robert Tressell's despairing leftwing hero tries to persuade builders of Mugsborough, a fictionalised Hastings, to embrace socialism. The builders won't listen. They respect their employers as their "betters", listen to the advice of religious hypocrites and refuse to fight for their own interests. Tressell's picture of builders welcoming exploitation is not true now and I am not sure if it was true of Edwardian Hastings. Building workers want and need men who will stand up to employers and protect their safety. Naturally, they do not wish to die.
For almost a decade, construction conglomerates blacklisted those who tried to speak on their behalf. In that same period, scores died and hundreds were maimed. It says much about Britain that the loud voices that boom across our media cannot talk about a scandal that is in front of their eyes.
New technology can extract visual images from yout brain. Whole scenes can be reconstructed via fMRI, right out of your visual cortex. And shockingly few people know this is happening.
The most common reaction is astonishment. "This makes me giddy!" says one commenter. It's "one of the most amazing things I've ever seen," says another.
"This is the beginning of the end of free thought," says a third.
That last pundit may have a point: Like the pensieve in the Harry Potter series, this new technology seems to promise us physical access not only to our own memories, but to the memories and thoughts of others. In short, mind is becoming matter.
Surely, though (you might say) we're not all going to start recording our thoughts and memories and leaving them on thumb drives or in the Cloud, where, you know,anyone could be pawing around in them.
Well, here's the thing: Aren't we mostly doing that already? Think YouTube and LiveLeak.
Still, what makes this technology different from everyday video recording is its intimacy with the human mind. As a paper in the scientific journal Neuron explains, the new technique takes advantage of a phenomenon called retinotopy: The fact that spatial relationships among things we see are preserved in certain parts of our brains as we process the images.
Scientists have been studying retinotopy since the 1970s -- but researchers at the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, recently took advantage of the phenomenon in a creative new way: They recorded high-resolution fMRI scans of volunteers' brains as the subjects watched video clips, and designed a computer program to match specific video frames with the activity of specific neurons in the brain's retinotopic maps. So now, when the volunteers watch new clips, the computer can monitor their brain activity and reconstruct video footage of what they're seeing.
These thought videos, like the earliest photographs and film strips, are undeniably blurry. But the point is, this technology works. We humans have been striving to record our thoughts since the dawn of cave painting -- and now, in the most literal sense, we're actually doing it.
This is, to put it mildly, a pretty big deal. We find ourselves at one of those rare moments in history when a scientific breakthrough stands poised to give birth to a new art form. Or a game-changing technology, depending on who you ask. In fact, quite a lot will depend on who controls this technique -- who's the first to patent it for commercial use.
You don't need me to tell you that in the hands of Hollywood directors, it has the potential to inspire works of haunting vulnerability and honesty. Or that in Madison Avenue offices, it could inspire ad campaigns of unprecedented penetration. Or that in the hands of the military....
Let's imagine for a second, though, that none of that happens.
Let's imagine that in 2019, a kid in India figures out how to capture video of his thoughts on a computer he's hacked together in his basement. He posts a few tutorials, and suddenly a whole network of young artists and students are sharing their own thought videos.
A nerdy girl from Argentina dives into the mind of an archaeologist in Beijing; a videographer in Tel Aviv; a politician in Denver. An artist in San Jose records his acid-infused visions and lets local bands rear-project the footage during their shows. In Upper East Side high schools, sons of stockbrokers gather around minds-eye recordings of Pashtun refugees, and get riled up like never before because all of a sudden it's like this is happening to them.
Am I getting ahead of myself? Maybe so -- this technology is still in its infancy.
All I'm saying is, this first gasp of astonishment -- this banquet of childlike giddiness over this new technology, this unique new form of art -- is something that begs to be shared with others. Every human being deserves to watch a demonstration; to be delighted or terrified by it; most of all, to see firsthand that this is really, truly happening.
If you've been a pelican fan these last 48 hours, a lot of your optimism may have already faded.
You watched 22-year-old “superstar” Anthony Davis go 4-20 in the season opener, you saw an injured and depleted roster embarrass themselves in front of last season's champs, and you saw NBA fans everywhere react quickly and rashly to this team's early struggles as they opened the 2015-2015 NBA season at 0-2.
Tonight's loss against Portland provided some hope, though.
The first half was just “Golden State: the Sequel” as far as being competitive goes, but the second half brought back some of the excitement and warmth that came with the offseason hype around new head coach Allen Gentry and a revamped Anthony Davis.
Blazers guard C.J McCollum straight up exploded in the first half and would end the game with a career high 37 points in 37 minutes on 14/22 shooting from the field. Damian Lillard looked good out the gates as well, contributing 21 points and a game high 11 assists.
Meanwhile, Davis really struggled.
In the first half, Davis scored only 8 points, missed numerous defensive rotations, and had a general “I don't care” aura about him. Frankly, it was alarming to watch.
Twitter, Reddit, and everywhere else where basketball is spoken erupted with fear mongering statements and ideas about Davis sudden and abrupt change in production.
Some hypothesized that the effect of signing a $145 million dollar contract this summer may have taken away some his drive to prove himself.
There is a distinct difference in this league between the guys who are fighting for eternal financial security, and the guys who will never need to worry about money ever again. This summer Davis became the latter, so his early season “motivational” woes were cause for concern.

Another theory that spouted was that Davis was having somewhat of an “identity crisis” pertaining to his role on the offense end.
He was playing farther from the basket, he was chucking threes and long twos, he wasn't boxing out, he wasn't crashing the boards, he wasn't driving to the rim, and he generally looked like a guy afraid to play like big man on the offensive end.
This could be a result of the training staff this summer pumping ideas into Davis' head about his role as a “stretch” big man and encouraging him to stray from his previous style of play.
Limitless confidence and positivity towards this idea may have led him to believe he could be an entirely new player this season fairly easily, when in reality there is a decidedly clear learning curve.
In the words of J.K. Simmons character in the film Whiplash: “There are no two words more harmful than Good Job.”
Is it possible that AD heard those words so much this summer he simply got confused when he didn't deliver?
Regardless of the reason why, for the first six quarters of the 2015-2016 NBA season Anthony Davis was a shell of himself.
Then the second half began, and the sun came out in New Orleans once again.
Ryan Anderson was bombing from deep, Jrue Holiday was driving to the basket and taking heat check threes (played 21 minutes by the way), Eric Gordon was playing well of his teammates and for the first time Anthony Davis looked like he cared about winning the game.
Davis started fighting for offensive rebounds, competing on the defensive end (Though for some reason it didn't affect C.J. “Michael Jordan” McCollum all that much) and hitting shots he knew he could hit.
He looked like the guy we watched last season, and he made a lot of Pelicans fans hop back on the ship before it sank and burned.
The Pelicans fought back in the fourth quarter and narrowed Portland's lead to just 8 points (they were up by 27 at halftime) and looked like a professional basketball team again. No one was spectacular, but they weren't the garbage group of moody looking dudes we watched last night or before halftime.

Davis ended the game with 25 points, 10 rebounds, 2 steals, 2 blocks and 2 turnovers while shooting 10/17 from the field and 3/5 from deep (Once the threes started falling his confidence immediately improved). He was starting to find comfortable spots, but mostly he was just trying).
He pouted less and ran a little quicker, allowing his energy to feed the rest of the team.
I'm not sure AD will be the behemoth sure-fire MVP monster a lot of us thought he would be this year, but this game showed he's still capable of being the guy who led us to the playoffs last season (with a three-point shot).
On Saturday, the Pelicans will rematch the Golden State Warriors at home in NOLA; and all eyes will be on Davis once again — hopefully after a night where he will have learned how to deal with the pressure……………
Hot on the heels of our Top 5 Yamaha SR500s feature comes this rather sharp looking example from new Swabian outfit Scramblers Motorcycles.
Based in Schnaitheim, in the south of Germany, Daniel and Michael Bosch and Sven Paukner share a love of motocross, skateboarding and snowboarding. Originally disinterested in road-going motorcycles, the switch flipped when they stumbled across a custom café racer that inspired them. After almost four years of dreaming about building their own bikes, they've finally kicked things off with this 1980 model Yamaha SR500.
They've named it ‘KRAD XX1'—KRAD being a shortened form of ‘Kraftrad' (German for ‘motorcycle') and ‘XX1' signaling it as their first official build. It's a stunner, combining the trio's influences with a vision to “bring bikes to the street that have a classic style and spirit—no plastic!”
Scramblers MC stripped the SR of all non-essentials, aiming to slim it down and improve handling. As is necessary with older motorcycles the engine has been overhauled, with a K&N air filter and engine breather installed, and the wiring has been redone and simplified. The subframe has also been altered and the front and rear turn signals swapped for smaller units and relocated.
Shorter and slimmer fenders have been fitted, along with Bates lights front and rear, and a smaller speedo. The rear suspension's been replaced with longer shocks, and the bike rolls on stock SR mags wrapped in Avon rubber. A short, blacked-out reverse cone muffler has been fitted to the wrapped header.
For paint, Scramblers MC settled on Java Brown for the tank and fenders. “We love that color very much because it always appears different,” says Sven. “It switches from dark-grey-brown, with a very little bit of green, to coffee brown.” A simple black section on the tank matches the bespoke leather seat.
The engine covers have been beaded blasted, with the Scramblers MC and ‘KRAD XX1' logos laser etched into them. It's clear that the team is obsessive over little details—according to Sven, “plastic cable ties do not fit into our ethic”—so they made their own leather and wire ‘cable ties' instead.
Considering this is Scramblers Motorcycles' first build, I can't wait to see what they get up to next.

(CNSNews.com) – Teachers heading back to the classroom will be adding renewable energy to the curriculum to mold future “energy leaders to save the planet,” thanks to a summer training program run by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Smithsonian Science Education Academies for Teachers.
“By teaching the teacher, events like this one make a powerful impact on public understanding of America's energy needs,” states a back-to-school announcement posted on the DOE website earlier this month.
“This year's academy has just graduated a pool of motivated teachers, ready to arm the next generation of energy leaders to save the planet!” said the DOE.
“August means ‘back to school' for students, but for many teachers it's a time to apply what they've learned over the summer in training and professional development courses,” the announcement said. “The Energy Department teamed up with the Smithsonian Science Education Academies for Teachers this year to promote an understanding of renewable energy resources in the classroom.”
“The Energy Innovations and Implications Academy -- a week-long training -- brought together scientists, engineers and experts from the Smithsonian Science Education Center and the Department of Energy,” the announcement states. “These experts shared the latest research, ideas and activities in bioenergy, hydrogen and fuel cells, and geothermal to get teachers and students excited about renewable energy innovation.
“Teachers learned how the technologies work, how they are being used today and how they fit into a clean energy economy,” the announcement states.
The DOE statement links to “energy literacy resources” used to instruct teachers participating in the program and defines an “energy-literate” person as follows:
Now that daycare has begun, so has the socializing. It's great that he can interact with his tiny new human friends because it's an important step in his development. Meanwhile, he is getting along well with his little classmates and inevitably all of their germs too. The identity of patient zero remains a mystery, for all we know he could have been an initial carrier. The first symptom appeared a couple weeks ago as a small cough and shortly there after he developed a stuffy nose. He was visibly uncomfortable, and had a bit of trouble sleeping. At the time, it was just a little cold that made him slightly more fussy than usual.
We had just finished up a fun filled Saturday and started the bedtime routine when we noticed his nose was getting very clogged. In addition his eyes were getting really watery and his cough sounded much more congested. It was way worse than the week before, it was difficult for him to eat because he couldn't breathe very easily. Things were escalating quickly. We were equipped with our trusty Bulb Aspirator, but sticking that thing up the nose of a squirmy infant while trying to avoid poking his brain is damn near impossible. We had a thing called the NoseFrida, aka, the Snot Sucker. We saw this thing last year when we were doing our baby registry and both my wife and I were disgusted and shocked that such a device existed. We thought “Ewww, who would want to suck snot out of a babies nose through a tube like a straw? Aren't there other ways to do that?” Fast forward to having a crying and congested baby that's hungry, and that thing is a miracle invention. It was after some snot was sucked that we noticed the telltale tint of an infection. Which was accompanied by a temperature of 100.4. We also have the technological luxury of a instant ear thermometer. I highly recommend one, mainly because you can avoid waiting for a reading while dealing with a fussy baby. To make matters worse his watery eyes were building up a greenish gunk just as quick as we wiped it away. To top it all off, he was throwing up like we've never seen before. A little baby puke here and there we have gotten used to, in fact it's pretty much a guarantee. But the sheer volume of liquid being expelled from his tiny body was nothing short of spectacular and exceedingly frightening. It was like something out of The Exorcist. We were pretty worried. Needless to say it was a rough weekend for wife and baby. I managed to sleep a couple winks more than them, but that is not a surprise because I could sleep through the four horsemen of apocalypse galloping around our bedroom.
So Monday morning rolls around and the symptoms are significantly worse. It's clear that he is going to be missing daycare for the first time. My wife stayed home with him and I went into work. We made an appointment for the pediatrician and I took off early to go with them. It's a group of about 8 doctors, normally we see the same one every time we go, but because of the last minute appointment we ended up with someone new. This guy stated the obvious and informed us it was a cold, and that we just needed to do a better job of clearing his nose. We told him about the eye gunk, and his response was, “If it gets worse it could be a concern”. We mentioned the insane volume of puking, “He's not wasting away” the doctor responds. The pediatrician had objections to all of the symptoms. It was as if I was trying to sell him on the shit our son was dealing with and he already had a pre-conceived diagnosis in mind. The entire interaction was extremely unprofessional and unsympathetic. He didn't prescribe any medicines and sent us away without a solution to his many ailments.
The following day, every issue he had was exacerbated. The eye gunk was so bad, he could barely open his eyes after each small moment of rest he managed to get in between the coughing fits. This was a really brutal superbug of some kind, but he handled it like a champ. Through out it all he still managed to be a happy go lucky little guy. He held up better than I would have under those circumstances. My wife can attest which one of us is the bigger baby when we're under the weather. I went to work that day and made another doctors appointment as soon as the office opened, this time with our trusted pediatrician. My wife said that he took one look at him at diagnosed pink eye in both eyes and bronchiolitis. He prescribed eyedrops and amoxicillin and told her to get some pedialyte if the excessive vomiting continued. The eyedrops began working almost instantly and within hours his eyes were gunk free. The antibiotics were a thick sticky syrup that tastes like bubble gum. At first he wasn't too keen on the new flavor, but a few days in he started really enjoying his medicine….maybe a little too much. He stayed home from daycare one more day after that, and Grandma watched him while Mom and Dad went to work.
The most heartbreaking thing we've experienced as parents so far was having to watch our little man suffer through the symptoms of such a severe cold. We were constantly wishing we could take the pain and discomfort away while we soothe his woes. The most heartbreaking thing for our bank accounts thus far was having to pay for a full week of daycare even though he only attended two days that week. That's a contract for you. Luckily he is all better now. It most definetly felt like the longest five days we've had since the hospital stay when we welcomed this little goober into our arms. At least his immune system has that notch on its belt, learning, adapting, and most of all strengthening because we damn well know it's not going to be the last.
CONSTRUCTION has begun on the second part of a controversial flood prevention scheme along the Water of Leith.
Around 1.2km of flood defences will be built along the river at Murrayfield and Roseburn, with contractors McLaughlin and Harvey Ltd already on site.
It comes after a review was launched into botched works during the first phase – in Stockbridge and Canonmills – which saw costs almost double to £30 million.
Council bosses said they had “learnt lessons” from the mismanaged scheme, with the second part due to be completed in early 2018 at a cost of £25m.
Councillor Lesley Hinds, environment leader, said: “We have been working closely with the community and local stakeholders to ensure they are well aware of the work taking place, and to ensure the process goes smoothly.
“It's been great to visit the site to see construction begin and I look forward to all the benefits these improvements will bring to the area.”
Work will include the building of new walls, embankments and floodgates beside the waterway, as well as replacing two bridges over the river at Baird Drive and Saughtonhall Avenue to provide room for vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians.
The defences are designed to protect homes and businesses and come after severe floods wreaked havoc in 2000.
Scores of properties were evacuated as flood waters rose by more than 4ft, leaving a trail of destruction many blamed on a lack of action from the council.
As part of the wider project, contractors have pledged to carry out landscaping to improve the appearance of the surrounding area, including Roseburn Park.
Martin Curran, contract manager at McLaughlin and Harvey, said: “We are delighted to be working alongside Edinburgh council in the delivery of this essential scheme. Having recently undergone a period of detailed design we are glad to say that the main construction works have begun in various locations throughout the project.
“We are making excellent progress to date which has been aided by the cooperation of the stakeholder groups, local residents and the general public at large. Stakeholder management is fundamental for the project, [and] we are actively engaging with the local residents and businesses on a daily basis, keeping them up to date with our work activities.”
He added: “We hope to achieve successful delivery of this project over the coming months with as minimal disruption as possible to the local residents and businesses. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the local residents for their continued support.”

A memorial on Bebelplatz , site of a Nazi book burning in May 1933. Empty shelves are visible through a window in the pavement.
This list includes both authors whose entire literary production was officially banned in Nazi Germany and authors who were only partially banned.[1] These authors are from the prohibitions lists in Nazi Germany and come from the following lists and others:
List of damaging and undesirable writing, Liste des schädlichen und unerwünschten Schrifttums, December 31, 1938 Jahreslisten 1939-1941. Unchanged new printing of the Leipzig edition, 1938-1941, Vaduz 1979
The official list was published by the Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda. Authors, living and dead, were placed on the list because of Jewish descent, or because of pacifist or communist sympathies or suspicion thereof.
In May and June 1933, in the first year of the Nazi government, there were book burnings. These book bans compose a part of the history of censorship and a subset of the list of banned books.
After World War II started, Germans created indexes of prohibited books in countries they occupied, of works in languages other than German. For example, in occupied Poland, an index of 1,500 prohibited authors was created.[2]

I would like to thank everyone who submitted articles to the 15th Humanist Symposium. There were many great articles submitted to the Symposium, and I found it painful to winnow them down to a mere ten that I think the best. (I intend to refer to some that didn't make the Symposium in my “From Around the Net” feature, for there was some really great writing that, nevertheless, had very little to do with Humanism.) Here are the guidelines for the Symposium:
Submissions should touch on one or more of the following categories, or on topics similar to them:
The happiness and freedom of life as an atheist, or other positive aspects to living a life without religious belief
Efforts to evangelize for atheism, and stories of people who have recently deconverted from religion
How to find meaning and purpose in a godless life
How non-religious people deal with weddings, child-raising, deaths, and other significant life events
Posts that stir up the human sense of awe and wonder
The ethics and moral philosophy of the non-religious
How nonbelievers can foster and nourish a sense of community
So, without further background, here are the ten articles I've selected for this issue of the Humanist Symposium:
As Humanists, how can we make our lives meaningful? Each of has — or will — face that question at one time or another. In a well-written post, Professor V. N. K. Kumar systematically lays out three sound strategies for making our lives meaningful. His article should help anyone sort through their thoughts about meaning. The article is hosted at Daylight Atheism and can be found here.
Perhaps one of the more exciting areas of science these days is the research being done into the nature and origin of human morality. Over at The Picket Line, David Gross takes a look at one of the questions raised by the new research: What, if anything, is the relationship between the morals we evolved and the morals we choose? That question, or something like it, is only going to become more important as the science of morality progresses. Check out his article here.
Sometime ago, my friend Don and I discovered the local chapter of Freethinkers and attended a couple meetings. We lost interest, however, when we found the meetings were largely for people who'd been religiously abused as children. Nothing wrong with that, but Don and I wanted something more — something like a support group to help us deal with current challenges — rather than the problems of childhood. At The Atheist Revolution, VJack proposes precisely such a support group atheists, freethinkers and the like. He writes, “I'd like to learn something from others about dating, raising children, dealing with religion in the workplace, and many other topics.” Is this an idea whose time has come? Check it out here.
Alonzo Fyfe, over at The Atheist Ethicist, lays out an entirely logical and insightful argument against the notion that “only atheists can be moral”. Alonzo is one of the best ethicists I've found on the net, and his article — which can be found here — is alone worth reading as an example of how to reason well about ethics. But also take a look at Alonzo's brilliant essay on the nature of lying and why we should condemn liars.
Greta Christina is both a fiery atheist and someone sensitive to the humanity we all share — believers and non-believers alike. She has often tried to bridge the “belief gap” between believers and non-believers by appealing to our common humanity. For instance, in her recent review of the book, Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), she writes:
If I'm right, and religion really is (among other things) an elaborate rationalization for hanging on to a mistaken belief… well, that doesn't make believers ridiculous and atheists superior. It puts us all in the same human boat. It puts religion in the same category as hanging onto ugly clothes and shoes that gave me blisters, for years, because I didn't want to admit that I'd made a mistake when I bought them. It puts it in the same category as going through with a disastrous marriage, because I didn't want to admit I'd made a mistake when I got engaged. It puts religion into a particular category of human fallibility… a fallibility that we all fall prey to, every day of our lives.
It's an interesting thesis and well worth noting because there is a tendency to demean or even demonize those who believe differently than us. You can find that tendency everywhere these days and it's an ugly one. Moreover it is decidedly anti-humanist. Check out Greta's article here.
Are there any practical suggestions for living life as a Humanist? Ebonmuse — at Daylight Atheism — shares nine practical things you can do to have a richer, more fulfilled life here. The suggestions include such things as “exercise regularly” and “volunteer and give to charity”. He ties each suggestion into Humanist principles in an interesting and often inspiring way.
Over at Elliptica, Lynet writes about finding meaning in self-expression — especially (but not exclusively) through art. Her post is found here.
Mindfulness training has been demonstrated to help adults with reducing stress, reducing depression, and increasing health and happiness. Now, there's a new movement to include mindfulness training in school curriculums. Jill Suttie writes about it here.
In “Test Your Sense of Natural Wonder”, Christian notes that “a sense of natural wonder” is important to our quality of life, and he proposes a simple thought experiment that anyone can do to determine whether that sense of natural wonder is best brought about by regarding the world as a creationist or as a scientist. From the blog, Free Thinking Joy.
For ages, some religionists have from time to time found it expedient to claim a false dichotomy between morals “anchored in God and scripture” and moral nihilism. Black Sun tackles the claim in an article that can be found here, at Black Sun Journal.
Once again, I'd like to thank everyone who submitted an article to this edition of the Symposium. The 16th Humanist Symposium will be held in three weeks at Glittering Muse. Please consider submitting articles to it using the form found here.
Democratic presidential candidate accuses Super Pac associated with Hillary Clinton of crude slur after it reportedly criticised his support for Jeremy Corbyn
An uneasy truce between Democratic presidential frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders broke down on Tuesday as the Vermont senator accused a group associated with the former secretary of state of a “vicious” attack on his support for new British Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
In a war of words that heralds a new phase in the hitherto relatively polite Democratic primary campaign, Sanders was reportedly criticised over his backing of Corbyn – the leftwing socialist who came from nowhere to win a landslide victory in the Labour leadership contest on Saturday – by Correct the Record, a so-called Super Pac that raises unlimited sums from wealthy donors to support Clinton.
According to journalists who received an email from the group, it attacked Sanders for congratulating Corbyn on winning the Labour leadership election and drew attention to the British politician's “most extreme comments” on foreign policy.
Many of the alleged comments, such as remarks referring to Hamas and Hezbollah as “friends” and the death of Osama bin Laden as a “tragedy” are similar to attacks on Corbyn from rightwing critics in Britain that his supporters say are based on distortions of his positions.
The email also reportedly compared Corbyn's support for the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez with a decision by Sanders to help negotiate the purchase of discounted heating oil from the Latin American country for a number of US states.
Sanders has spoken little about his foreign policy during the campaign but responded angrily to the attack on Tuesday, suggesting it was a crude slur more worthy of Republican opponents than a fellow Democrat.
“Yesterday, one of Hillary Clinton's most prominent Super PACs attacked our campaign pretty viciously,” said the senator in a statement sent to supporters. “They suggested I'd be friendly with the Middle East terrorist organizations, and even tried to link me to a dead communist dictator.

“It was the kind of onslaught I expected to see from [Republican donors] the Koch Brothers or Sheldon Adelson,” he added.
Sanders has pulled ahead of Clinton in opinion polls for early states in the Democratic primary and his campaign believes it has also been targeted by the group before for appearing on stage with outspoken black academic Cornel West.
“It's the second time a billionaire Super PAC has tried to stop the momentum of the political revolution we're building together,” added Sanders in his letter to supporters, which sought small campaign donations to combat the influence of big donors on the presidential election.
Direct contributions to candidates are limited to $2,700 per election but Super Pacs are unlimited so long as their activities are seen as independent from the candidate they support. Correct the Record is one of two hybrid groups associated with Clinton that are able to make direct contributions and independent expenditure so long as separate bank accounts are used. It has already raised $1.4m from wealthy donors.
Neither Correct the Record nor the Clinton campaign responded to requests for comment on the alleged attack on the Vermont senator, who has featured little in the former first lady's speeches, especially compared with the bitter infighting the Republican primary has seen so far.
Sanders campaign insiders say they have no desire to escalate any tension with Clinton but felt it necessary to respond to the attack when questioned on it by journalists.
Nevertheless the comparison with Corbyn could raise problems in future for Sanders, who is generally less radical than his leftwing British counterpart, particularly on foreign policy, and is seeking to find out more about his positions.
“At a time of mass income and wealth inequality throughout the world, I am delighted to see that the British Labour party has elected Jeremy Corbyn as its new leader,” Sanders said in an initial statement on Monday.
“We need leadership in every country in the world which tells the billionaire class that they cannot have it all. We need economies that work for working families, not just the people on top.”
Balls spent more than a few shekels to evict the last pack of spendthrift jackals from Congress, and the ad spend produced banner results. No longer will steal from the Balls estate be the answer to every fiscal problem facing our once proud republic! No longer will the Speaker of the House spew hate speech about our nation's battered CEOs! Business leaders can once again venture outside without the fear of being spat upon by the great unwashed! Yes, my friends, the glorious wave of Tea Party victory has ushered in a new era of freedom, happiness, and civil liberties for Balls and his closest friends!
To my newly elected Tea Party minions, Balls offers a word of caution. It will be tempting for you to believe that it was your razor-sharp wit and extraordinary good looks that earned your seats in the hallowed chambers of Congress. Nothing could be further from the truth! On the contrary, my friends, you were elected solely because Balls and a handful of friends chose to bankroll your campaigns with the reasonable expectation of a healthy return on our investment! While Balls at times has donated vast sums of money to worthy charities in the past completely out of philanthropic motives, this is most certainly not one of those times. In other words, the time has come for Balls to extract his pound of flesh.
My marching orders for you are rather simple and easy to understand, even for the less cerebral among you. Job one will be to permanently extend the Bush tax cuts for those making above 250k per year, until we transition to a flat tax of no more than ten percent. You must not waiver or compromise on this point. When pressed about the resulting expansion of the already obscenely bloated deficit, reiterate the fact that 99.9% of all people making more than $250,000 per year are small business owners (like yours truly), and 99.9% of all jobs are created by small businesses. Remember to use the words “job-killer” and “non-starter” whenever some wild-eyed liberal asks about raising taxes on the wealthy.
Anecdotal evidence also suggests passionate and near unanimous support among your constituents for ending the hated “death tax”. Wipe a tear from your eye and spin the tale of a ragtag gaggle of dirt farmers back home who were forced to live in the old family pickup because of the overwhelming tax burden hoisted upon them when Ma and Pa passed on. They, along with a host of other grieving, salt-of-the-earth sadsacks are forced to sell everything in order to stave off the IRS wolves at their door. Never, never use the term “estate tax”.
When your first two objectives have been accomplished, Balls will schedule a conference call to communicate the details regarding your next mandates: ending all burdensome regulation on business, eliminating taxes on corporations, opening up a flood of cheap labor from south of the border, expanding tax breaks for building new plants overseas, doing away with the minimum wage, gutting Social Security, ending Medicare and Medicaid, and opening up a new front (or two) in the war on terror. If you earnestly and faithfully follow these orders in a timely manner, Balls & friends will be absolutely delighted to finance your re-election. In the meantime, follow the sage advice of not biting the hand that feeds you. -Balls

In June, we told you about BlueStacks. It is a tool that allows Android apps to run on a Mac. The alpha only officially supported 17 Android apps, with Pulse and Words with Friends being the two of the more notable apps at launch, but the application has improved immensely. As Venture Beat first noted, BlueStacks has moved into beta this morning. It now allows users to run every Android app that the Google Play Store has to offer. Some may be puzzled at the need to run a mobile application on the desktop, but it does come in use for apps like Instagram and Flipboard that have no desktop equivalent. BlueStacks reminds us a lot of Parallels or VM Ware, and it definitely becomes more useful with the added apps.
As of earlier this month, the Silicon Valley-based company passed 5 million installations on both Windows and Mac. BlueStacks also plans an even more impressive growth with partners AMD and ASUS, as TechCrunch noted, where the software would be pre-installed on over 100 million devices. Upcoming features include an App Discovery system in the Mac app to make it easier for users to find apps. Interested? You can download the beta from BlueStacks.
The number of graduates applying for each job has doubled since 2009, as three successive years of university leavers struggle with an over-saturated market.
Figures out today reveal that although the number of available jobs is slowly increasing, the largest employers now receive an average of 83 CVs for each single vacancy, with some top companies inundated by as many as 150 applications per job.
Following two years of economic hardship employers can choose from a much larger pool of graduates, many of whom have missed out during previous hiring windows.
We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.
The new figures from the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), which surveys more than 200 employers twice a year, show that before the global economic crisis hit three years ago the same employers could expect to receive 31 applications for each vacancy, and in 2009 the figure was still a comparatively small 49.
The number of CVs sent in for each vacancy is now the highest on record. But commentators said the graduate job market is starting to show signs of recovery with a slight increase in average starting salaries and a small growth in the overall number of jobs.
Companies in the survey reported that they were intending to increase their starter salaries by two per cent to £25,500. The number of jobs available, meanwhile, is expected to rise 2.6 per cent this year on top of a much larger 8.9 per cent rise the year before.
But competition for graduates looking for top jobs is more intense than ever. Employers are increasingly resorting to online tests and phone interviews to whittle down the number of applicants.
The banking sector may have taken a battering in the court of public opinion, but financial services are still by far the most popular employers. Investment banks and fund managers can now expect to receive more than 232 applications for every place. The next most popular industry is energy, water and utilities with 187 applications for every vacancy. Three-quarters of the companies surveyed insist that a 2:1 degree is the minimum requirement for the CV to make it past the first round.
London and the South-east continue to dominate the graduate recruitment market, offering more than half (54 per cent) of all vacancies in 2010-11. More vacancies (14.6 per cent) are likely to be offered in accountancy than in any other career area.
"But there are some very encouraging signs for graduates," said AGR chief executive Carl Gilleard. "Not only have starting salaries increased, albeit slightly, the number of vacancies continues to increase which can only be seen as a good sign. I am cautiously optimistic about today's findings, which provide a welcome indication that the graduate recruitment market is beginning to overcome the impact of the recession."
Richard Irwin, head of student recruitment at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Britain's largest private graduate recruiter, told The Independent that the latest figures suggest students are hedging their bets by sending out larger numbers of CVs.
"We have seen an increase in the number of applications from students in postgraduate positions," he said. "But I think the sheer number of applications – which far outstrips the number of students graduating each year – shows that students are trying to send out as many applications as possible. That might seem like a good idea but I'd actually argue that those who send fewer, but more focused and targeted CVs, tend to do much better."
The figures suggest that the number of new graduate jobs is now rising at a significantly higher rate than the wider job market, which remains stagnant. According to the Office for National Statistics, the total number of vacancies in April stood at 469,000 – a tiny 0.02 per cent increase on five months previously when the number of jobs available was 468,000.
Graduate prospects are also to be addressed in a Government White Paper on higher education that is expected to be published today. Among the proposals are likely to be moves to allow more private universities to open in the UK.
It is also expected to propose making universities publish data on the quality of teaching, facilities and how well their graduates perform in the job market. This data would be published in an easily accessible format to allow students to compare universities based on how their graduates perform, among other measures.
Case studies
Scott Bryan, 22, graduated last year from York in politics
"I had two weeks at a marketing firm and after that, they offered me a six-month freelance contract. But in April, it was terminated at very short notice. It's been quite a knock to the confidence, to be honest. A lot of companies want really exact experience. I think I've applied for about 80 or 90 placements."
Joseph Donaldson, 21, has just completed a degree in music at Goldsmiths University. He is working in a shop while job hunting
"I've been looking at some internships with people who write music for adverts, but other than that there isn't much around. My friends studying less specialised subjects have had slightly more success."
Jonny Mallinson, 25, from London, graduated from Bristol University in politics and philosophy before doing an MA in international relations
"Despite my extensive further education, I am getting interviews but being leapfrogged by people with a few years of experience in the industry. That is all employers seem to want now. I wish somebody had told me that before."
Victoria Lam, 23, graduated from Southampton University in 2010 in film and English
"I have managed to secure some running work on sets but they usually last only a few months and pay £65 a day. Nor do they come along very often. In between that I have done three internships to gain experience. But none ever seems to lead to a real job. If I don't get work by Christmas, I will move to Hong Kong."

From sand-filled houses to rusting railway stations and entire ghost towns, abandoned places have a haunting beauty. Richard Happer has travelled the world to find the best
Fifteen years ago Richard Happer was staying on a small Scottish island and took a boat out to St Kilda. Forty miles west of North Uist, the St Kilda archipelago is the westernmost point of the Hebrides, and perhaps the remotest place in the UK. Until the 1920s it had a small but resolute population of around 80. By 1930, the island was completely evacuated, rendered uninhabitable by a combination of disease and crop failure. Seeing the abandoned husks of homes sitting deserted in the grass, Happer was moved.
“I fell in love,” he says. “The outside world caught up with these remote people and it was too hard for them to live there, so the entire population upped and left. Visiting it was quite intoxicating. I realised that there were all these places on our doorstep that people didn't know about.”

His love of these abandoned places has grown in the years since. He has now turned it into a book. It features 60 abandoned places from around the world, with short texts explaining what happened. Some are very famous, such as Machu Picchu and Chernobyl. Others were big stories at the time that are now fading from memory, such as Plymouth, the capital of Montserrat, buried by a volcano in 1995, and the Six Flags amusement park in New Orleans submerged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. They tell stories of shifting environments and geopolitics – once-great trading centres that now lie crumbling in the desert, or grand feats of central planning that never fulfilled their ambitions.

“Some of the sites are about hubris. The Buzludzha monument in Bulgaria is a huge dome on top of a hill. It was built at the height of communism to be a symbol of an empire for the ages. Now it is an eerie alien shell of a place. A testament to fallen pride, I suppose.”

Happer says that other sites are about humanity and human accomplishment. “Take the Red Sands sea forts. They were built to guard the Thames estuary from German bombers, but then they became a base for pirate radio stations, and now they are a popular site for people to come and take pictures. Many of the abandoned places are visually striking because they're in amazing places.”

Some are monuments to war. On 10 June 1944, an SS division massacred 642 people, including 452 women and children, at Oradour-sur-Glane, in central France. “They killed everyone in a single day, and nobody's gone back,” Happer says. The town has been left as a museum, its ruined buildings strewn with household debris.

Tyneham, in Dorset, has also been empty since the Second World War. It was evacuated in 1943, when the War Office requisitioned the land as a practice site for D-Day. “You can imagine being a person in that little village, almost unchanged for 800 years before they gave everything up for the greater good,” says Happer. “They really believed in what they were sacrificing.
“I don't want to get too philosophical, but something about decay suggests human endeavour. There's something about the fallen majesty of human hope that has an eerie beauty. It makes you remember the things that are still around you.”

Night of Champions 2015 is here! All the championships are up for grabs and I think we'll be seeing a few title changes. Here are my predictions.
Lucha Dragons & Neville vs. Cosmic Wasteland
The Pre-Show will kick things off with Neville and the Lucha Dragons taking on Cosmic Wasteland. I really like the idea of making the Ascension Stardust's minions. This could be the thing that can bring the Ascension to relevance on the main roster. This will also add another layer to Stardust's character and help give him some steam after losing the feud with the Green Arrow. I don't see this going any other way than Cosmic Wasteland picking up the win.
WWE United States Title
Seth Rollins vs. John Cena
There has been a rumor that this match will end the show, but I have a feeling it's going to open the show. Cena and Rollins have put on some stellar matches this year and this should be no difference. I'm going with Cena winning this one mainly because I want to see the return of the weekly Cena Open Challenges.
Dolph Ziggler vs. Rusev
I'm so over this rivalry. I feel both men could be utilized better and should be involved in a storyline of more importance. Ziggler seems to be driving a wedge between Summer and Ru Ru. I see Summer somehow costing Rusev the match. Hopefully, this is the blow off and both these guys can go their separate way.
WWE Tag Titles
New Day vs. Dudley Boys
The New Day is the hottest act in WWE right now. Everything they do is brilliant and hilarious. It's hard not to be entertained by this trio. I walk around my house doing the “New Day Rocks” clap. They are slowing shifting from heels to babyfaces. This can be easily be stopped if they incorporate some heel nuances into their work. Working with the Dudleys will also help them get a heel reaction. I'm happy the Dudleys are back. With their passion for tag team wrestling, we could possibly see a Tag Team Revolution. It looks like at some point the Dudleys will win the belts so they can accomplish their 10th WWE Tag Championship win. I don't think that should happen here. I think there is more intrigue in watching the Dudleys chasing New Day. I think New Day wins via disqualification. This should set up a table match at Hell In A Cell next month.
WWE Intercontinental Title
Ryback vs. Kevin Owens
I'm a Ryback guy. There I said it. I'm a fan of the Big Guy. I was hoping the Daniel Byran rub and the Intercontinental title was going to help elevate Ryback, but due to a lack of quality opponents and the staph infection, he really hasn't been able to do much. Owens has been doing a great job at whatever has been thrown his way. As much I want to see Ryback be pushed, Owens should win here. Having the Intercontinental title will give Owens a platform to have more high profile matches.
WWE Divas Title
Nikki Bella vs. Charlotte
On Monday night, the internet erupted with hate as Nikki Bella broke AJ Lee's record for the longest reigning Diva's Champion. All these haters don't realize they're being WORKED! Nikki is not the best in ring wrestler, but she has decent matches. Her heel persona makes up for what she lacks in the ring. People seem to forget that the main concept of Pro Wrestling is good vs. evil. Nikki has done a tremendous job being the evil of the Diva's Division and generating heat. Nikki winning on Monday makes you want to see her get beat even more at Night of Champions. For the rematch, the stipulation has been set that if Nikki loses via disqualification or count out she will lose the title. I can see Charlotte winning this match, but I can also see them pulling the trigger on Paige's heel turn and have her cost Charlotte the title. If Charlotte wins, I can also see a scenario where Stephanie McMahon immediately makes Charlotte defend her title against Sasha Banks since she's won like 3 matches in a row against Paige. Many possibilities for the outcome, but I think I'll go with Charlotte winning. Maybe Paige will attack her during the celebration.
Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, & ??? vs. The Wyatt Family
The big question going into this match is who will be the third man to join Ambrose and Reigns? There have been rumors of Erick Rowan and Baron Corbin. Both of those would be horrible choices. From what I've seen Rowan is still rehabbing. Corbin is one of the top heels in NXT right now and also they run the chance of the crowd in Houston not knowing who Corbin is. I'm praying and hoping that the third man is Daniel Bryan. He's been cleared by his doctor, but not WWE doctors. Bryan would get a huge pop and bring more excitement to this match. No matter who the third man is I think Ambrose and Reigns will get the win here. Then they could do a six-man tag inside Hell In A Cell next month for the blow off.
WWE World Heavyweight Title
Seth Rollins vs. Sting
This match should be the main event and Rollins second match of the night. With it being Rollins second match. I can see him pulling every trick out of his book to try to retain. This could mean the return of Kane and J&J Security. No matter what Rollins does it think it will fail and Sting will make history and become WWE Champion for the first time. His title celebration will be probably cut short with Sheamus cashing in his Money in the Bank. I will be very surprised if Rollins or Sting leaves with the WWE Championship.
What is your Night of Champions 2015 Predictions?
In a letter to be delivered to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in several days, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is demanding that Israel accept the establishment of a Palestinian state “on the 1967 borders” with possible minor adjustments, halt all building over the Green Line, and release all prisoners.
If Israel fails to do this, Abbas vows, the Palestinians will “seek the full and complete implementation of international law” to deal with Israel's presence “as occupying power in all of the occupied Palestinian territory.” The situation as it stands, he states, “cannot continue.”

The letter is set to be delivered later this week. The text referred to in this article was obtained by The Times of Israel on Sunday, and may be changed before the letter is presented. Netanyahu is set to meet with PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad on Tuesday. The Israeli prime minister called last week for direct talks with Abbas, but Abbas refused, demanding a freeze in Israeli building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
In the letter, some of which is markedly bitter in tone and questions Netanyahu's commitment to a two-state solution, Abbas comes close to threatening to dismantle the PA in frustration at the diplomatic deadlock, as he had reportedly contemplated doing, but he refrains from such a threat.
“As a result of actions taken by successive Israeli governments,” he writes, “the Palestinian National Authority no longer has any authority, and no meaningful jurisdiction in the political, economic, social, territorial and security spheres. In other words, the P.A. lost its reason d'être.”
Abbas states that the Palestinians have submitted a “historic Peace Proposal” but are “waiting for an answer from Israel” on its specifics. “We asked your government to also submit comprehensive proposals on territory, security, and to commit to a settlement freeze, and release prisoners. These were not preconditions but Israeli obligations. To our deep regret, none of these commitments were honored,” he writes.
Among the elements in the Palestinian proposal cited by Abbas:
• “We agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine-on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967.
• “The establishment of independent Palestinian State that can live side-by-side with the State of Israel in peace and security on the borders of 1967 with mutually agreed swaps equal in size and value.
• “Security will be guaranteed by a third party accepted by both, to be deployed on the Palestinian side.
• “A just and agreed resolution for the refugees' problem as specified in the Arab Peace Initiative.
• “Jerusalem will serve as a capital of two States. East Jerusalem capital of Palestine. West Jerusalem capital of Israel. Jerusalem as an open city can be the symbol of peace.”
The letter details the history of Israeli-Palestinian negotiating contacts since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. It acknowledges that both leaders “face skepticism and opposition” and declares: “In the quest of peace we have to help each other. We know that violence and terror whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis is not the way. I know that it erodes both of our public's trust in peace. Therefore, I reiterate our full commitment to a policy of zero tolerance against violence.
“At the same token,” it continues, “I expect your understanding that settlement building is eroding the Palestinian trust in your commitment to reconciliation and the idea of the two states solution. The logic is simple: If you support the establishment of a Palestinian state, why do you build on its territory?”
Abbas also explains his efforts at reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas: “Among the most critical components of the signed agreements between the PLO and Israel is the recognition that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitute a single territorial unit, the integrity of which must be preserved until a final status agreement is reached,” he writes. “As such it is subject to one law and one authority. In recognition of this, I have been determined to end the division of my people through national reconciliation, in accordance with my political program which respects signed agreements, recognizes the State of Israel, and renounces violence. With regret, the Government of Israel has chosen to take a position diametrically opposed to Palestinian national reconciliation.”
Abbas ends the letter with a series of demands: “In furtherance of the peace process and the agreements we signed with Israel, which were premised on international legitimacy, international law, and internationally-recognized terms of reference, we call on the Government of Israel to do the following:
“1- Accept the two-state solution on the 1967 borders with possible minor and mutually agreed upon land swaps of equal size and value;
“2- Stop all settlement activities, including in East Jerusalem;
“3- Release all prisoners, in particular those imprisoned prior to the end of 1994; and
“4- Revoke all decisions taken since 2000 which undermine agreements signed between Israel and the PLO.”
If Israel does not “honor these above-referenced obligations,” Abbas writes, “we will seek the full and complete implementation of international law as it pertains to the powers and responsibilities of Israel as occupying power in all of the occupied Palestinian territory. For the Palestinian Authority—now stripped of all meaningful authority—cannot continue to honor agreements while Israel refuses to even acknowledge its commitments. The P.A. is no longer as was agreed and this situation cannot continue.”
“Mr. Prime Minister,” Abbas concludes, “I strongly believe that both our peoples yearn for peace. As leaders, it's our historic task to make it happen. Let's not fail our peoples.”
Kiev doesn't seem to have lost its appetite for hiring foreign officials and advisors. Their latest acquisition is Anthony Tether, the former head of the Pentagon's secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA. Tether is now an advisor for Ukraine's state-owned defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom.
According to Ukroboronprom's official press release, Tether will serve as an "advisor on the long-term development" of the Ukrainian defense industry. The American made history by becoming the conglomorate's first-ever foreign consultant. His competencies are expected to include offering advice on developing Ukraine's military-industrial complex, and selling its weapons abroad.
Behind the scenes, speaking to US media after his swearing-in ceremony, Tether hinted that US defense firms will now be more interested in direct investments into Ukrainian companies. He also admitted that discussions about possible US buyouts of major Ukrainian enterprises like Antonov were part of the mandate granted to him by Ukroboronprom, though they do not constitute the focus of his efforts as an advisor.
Ukroboronprom director Roman Romanov praised the ex-US official, saying that Tether would "help us to integrate global management practices, and establish a modern system for the management of business processes." The Ukrainian military-industrial complex, he said, "has already fulfilled its priority tasks of repairing and restoring military equipment. Now, we will enter into a new level in the exchange of technology, and will be able to produce modern equipment and weaponry. As a result, we will receive access to new markets and integrate even deeper into existing ones."
Tether, in turn, officially emphasized the importance of creating synergy between the US and Ukrainian defense sectors, as part of expanded cooperation between the two countries. "I think that this will allow us to add 2 plus 2 and get the answer 5," he quipped, using the Orwellian turn of phrase to describe this 'synergy' effort.
Over the next six months, the American consultant is expected to study the "culture" of Ukraine's military industry. "Today we start writing a new page in the history of the rapid development of Ukraine's defense complex," he said.

Beginning in 2015, Ukroboronprom has been making a concerted effort to transition to NATO standards for defense production.
Experts can't help getting the feeling that Tether's appointment at Ukroboronprom is either directly or indirectly connected to Kiev's recent diplomatic offensive to see the joint production of weapons with the US. Last week, Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Valeriy Chaly said that he had high hopes that Ukraine could "produce weapons in cooperation with the Americans on Ukrainian territory."
Accordingly, Tether's appointment may very well be Washington's effort to test the waters and get a real sense of the state of the Ukrainian military industrial complex, and whether there are any tasty morsels left within its mostly Soviet-era R&D and production capabilities.
Jay Heaps has been fired as the manager of the New England Revolution, the MLS club confirmed on Tuesday.
Heaps was let go with five games remaining in the regular season after spending six seasons in charge of the Revs, compiling a regular season record of 75-81-43.
Assistant coach Tom Soehn, who has prior managerial experience with D.C. United and the Vancouver Whitecaps, will take over the club on an interim basis.
"Jay has done a great deal for the club over the years and had considerable achievements. I have great respect for him and wish him well in the next steps of his career," Revolution general manager Michael Burns said in a statement.
"This decision has not been taken lightly, however, we need to do better than the results have shown from the last couple of seasons and this season left us convinced we need to go in a different direction."
The Revs have been outside the playoff places for most of the year, but looked like they might enjoy a late-season revival after beginning the month of September with victories over Orlando City and the Montreal Impact. But consecutive defeats, including a humiliating 7-0 hammering at the hands of expansion side Atlanta United, hastened Heaps' dismissal.
1st official tweet but not my last. After parting ways with the Revs, I had a few thoughts to share and people to thank. I love u DJJLiv. pic.twitter.com/f6CPJAJyUz — Jay Heaps (@JayHeaps722) September 19, 2017
New England currently sits in eighth place in the Eastern Conference, seven points behind the New York Red Bulls for the sixth and final playoff spot.
Heaps was hired after the 2011 season without any prior managerial experience, taking over for Steve Nicol. Aided by the midseason acquisition of Jermaine Jones, Heaps guided the Revs to the 2014 MLS Cup final, losing out to the LA Galaxy, 2-1 in extra time.
New England's form has steadily eroded since then. New England missed the playoffs in 2016 when it was edged out for the final spot by the Philadelphia Union.
After starting his professional career with the now-defunct Miami Fusion in 1999, Heaps spent 11 seasons as a player in MLS, nine with the Revs.
All told he made 344 league and playoff appearances, scoring 18 goals and 34 assists.

Common toads sense danger
Common toads appear to be able to sense an impending earthquake and will flee their colony days before the seismic activity strikes.
The evidence comes from a population of toads which left their breeding colony three days before an earthquake that struck L'Aquila in Italy in 2009.
How toads sensed the quake is unclear, but most breeding pairs and males fled.
They reacted despite the colony being 74km from the quake's epicentre, say biologists in the Journal of Zoology.
It is hard to objectively and quantifiably study how animals respond to seismic activity, in part because earthquakes are rare and unpredictable.
Some studies have been done on how domestic animals respond, but measuring the response of wild animals is more difficult.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
Even those that have been shown to react, such as fish, rodents and snakes tend to do so shortly before an earthquake strikes, rather than days ahead of the event.
However, biologist Dr Rachel Grant of the Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK, was routinely studying the behaviour of various colonies of common toads on a daily basis in Italy around the time a massive earthquake struck.
Her studies included a 29-day period gathering data before, during and after the earthquake that hit Italy on 6 April 2009.
The quake, a 6.3-magnitude event, struck close to L'Aquila city, about 95km (60 miles) north-east of Rome.
Dr Grant was studying toads 74km away in San Ruffino Lake in central Italy, when she recorded the toads behaving oddly.
Five days before the earthquake, the number of male common toads in the breeding colony fell by 96%.
That is highly unusual for male toads: once they have bred, they normally remain active in large numbers at breeding sites until spawning has finished.
Yet spawning had barely begun at the San Ruffino Lake site before the earthquake struck.
Also, no weather event could be linked to the toads' disappearance.
Three days before the earthquake, the number of breeding pairs also suddenly dropped to zero.
While spawn was found at the site up to six days before the earthquake, and again six days after it, no spawn was laid during the so-called earthquake period - the time from the first main shock to the last aftershock.
"Our study is one of the first to document animal behaviour before, during and after an earthquake," says Dr Grant.
She believes the toads fled to higher ground, possibly where they would be at less risk from rock falls, landslides and flooding.
Sensing danger
Exactly how the toads sense impending seismic activity is unclear.
The shift in the toads' behaviour coincided with disruptions in the ionosphere, the uppermost electromagnetic layer of the earth's atmosphere, which researchers detected around the time of the L'Aquila quake using a technique known as very low frequency (VLF) radio sounding.
Such changes to the atmosphere have in turn been linked by some scientists to the release of radon gas, or gravity waves, prior to an earthquake.
In the case of the L'Aquila quake, Dr Grant could not determine what caused the disruptions in the ionosphere.
However, her findings do suggest that the toads can detect something.
"Our findings suggest that toads are able to detect pre-seismic cues such as the release of gases and charged particles, and use these as a form of earthquake early warning system," she says.
Ants ignore quakes
One other study has quantified an animal's response to a major earthquake.
Researchers had the serendipitous opportunity to measure how the behaviour of the desert harvester ant (Messor pergandei) changed as the ground began to tremble in the Mojave Desert, California, on 28 June 1992.
The largest quake to hit the US in four decades struck during the middle of an ongoing study, which measured how many ants walked the trails to and from the colony, the distributions of worker ants and even how much carbon dioxide the ants produced.
However, in response to that 7.4 magnitude quake, the ants did not appear to alter their behaviour at all.
Absoloo, the French e-retailer of XXX items, has come out with a generous offer to accompany the recent release of Blizzard Entertainment's fantasy game Diablo III.
Making the very stereotyped assumption that only men play video games, Absoloo is urging women—video-game widows, they call them—to snap a photo of themselves holding the Diablo III box, then post that photo to the sex-toy seller's Facebook page to receive a coupon code for a free vibrator.
There are so many strange components here, it's difficult to know who is coming out on top. Is it Absoloo, who is surely getting some big publicity thanks to this stunt? Is it the women, who are getting free sex toys? Is it Blizzard Entertainment, who is clearly doing well, if this is the kind of raunchy remediation needed in the wake of its big release?
To recap: Electronic entertainment robs women of male attention —> vibrator-hawking website solicits Diablo-promoting Facebook photos —> photos are uploaded —> code is sent —> vibrators arrive, free of charge.

Is this how the human race expires? A clue of what's to come? Is this great, or is it crazy?

For more than two years Republicans have campaigned and legislated against the right of certain groups of people to vote. On Election Day, Republicans suffered the consequences. The very groups the GOP targeted -- among them African Americans, Latinos, and young people -- turned out in record numbers, propelling to victory the president and Democrats across the country. The Republicans' strategy failed because it awakened the most powerful force in a democracy: the determination of the voters themselves.
To reduce turnout among these groups, Republican officials deployed a variety of tactics. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted and Florida Governor Rick Scott slashed the amount of time available for early voting, which is disproportionately utilized by minority and low-income voters. GOP legislators in Pennsylvania enacted a photo ID law, and then failed to establish adequate procedures for allowing more than 700,000 Pennsylvanians who lacked photo ID to obtain one. Voter purges attempted by Gov. Scott and Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler targeted thousands of lawfully registered voters. "True the Vote" -- surely a leading candidate for the Newspeak Award -- challenged minority voter registrations on an unprecedented scale.
The Obama campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and other voting rights advocates responded by challenging many of these restrictions in court. The courts blocked many of the worst measures, including Pennsylvania's photo ID law and the bulk of Florida's voter purge. The Obama campaign and the DNC successfully litigated to restore the final three days of early voting for all Ohioans, and defended this right all the way to the Supreme Court.
Yet the untold story of the 2012 election is not the efforts of lawyers or activists, but the unyielding determination of everyday ordinary citizens determined to cast their ballots. They won on Tuesday. Here's why.
When Secretary Husted tried to change election rules last year, Ohioans responded by gathering 300,000 signatures toward a referendum that successfully suspended the law. After we successfully restored access for the last three days of early voting, the African-American community participated in record numbers, aided by a massive turnout for Souls to the Polls on the Sunday before Election Day. Overall, the African-American share of the Ohio electorate was more than one-third higher than in 2008.
In Florida, 150 black pastors organized "Operation Lemonade" -- named for the "lemon" they were handed when Gov. Scott cut early voting. Although the state reduced the number of early voting days from 14 to eight, and eliminated voting on the Sunday before Election Day, nearly as many voters -- 2.4 million in all -- voted early as in 2008.
On Election Day, voters stood with determination in unconscionably long lines, some that stretched for up to seven hours. Though some voters were elderly, frail, missing work, or simply exhausted, theyrefused to leave, undeterred by the line and in fact galvanized by the bad intent. Voters and activists used social media to stand in solidarity as the hashtag #StayInLine quickly began trending on Twitter. People were so determined to vote that many polling places ran out of provisional ballots.
When the dust settled, the very groups targeted for suppression and intimidation had voted in record numbers. Compared to 2008, African Americans, Hispanics, and people under age 29 all represented a greater share of the national electorate.
In September, Georgia congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis told the Democratic National Convention:
I've seen this before. I lived this before. Too many people struggled, suffered, and died to make it possible for every American to exercise their right to vote. And we have come too far together to ever turn back... [W]e must not be silent. We must stand up, speak up, and speak out. We must march to the polls like never, ever before.
AFL UMPIRES manager Jeff Gieschen is adamant that the goal umpire who appeared to deny Richmond a goal late in the Tigers' one-point loss to Fremantle on Friday night did nothing wrong.
The umpire was standing against the goal post when a shot from Richmond's Matthew White struck him in the leg.
The ball rebounded off the umpire and was rushed through for a behind by Freo's Stephen Hill.
Tigers coach Damien Hardwick was furious after the match, believing the goal umpire was in the wrong place and should have called for a score review to check whether the ball crossed the line before striking him.
But Gieschen is happy with the way the umpire handled the situation.
"He was extremely confident, and that's the reason why he didn't call for a score review," Gieschen said on Monday.
"The goal umpire knew exactly where it hit him and where he was in relation to the line.
"The field umpire, who was down in a good position to see where it was as well, also believed it hadn't crossed the line, and there was a boundary umpire down there as well.
"So there was no doubt in any of the umpires' minds … (about whether) that ball had crossed the line. They all believed it hadn't – it stayed in play."
As for whether a video score review should have taken place anyway, Gieschen said: "Possibly, one of our score review people could've said, 'This is an interesting one, it 's quite close, let's have a look.'
"But they've only got a short period of time to make up their mind on that as well."
The incident at Patersons Stadium has ignited much discussion about whether goal umpires should be encouraged to straddle the goal-line or should stand further back.
The AFL's new general manager of football operations has asked Gieschen to look into it.
"I would think that first of all we need to get it so that the ball doesn't hit the umpire in the first place," Evans said on Monday morning.
"If the ball's rolling towards him, is there a position that the goal umpire can take so he doesn't actually come onto the field of play?"
But Gieschen is not convinced that a change is necessary.
"They do that because they want to try and adjudicate accurately touched balls on the line," he said.
"If they're not on the line people are going to say, 'Why aren't they on the line?'
"If they are on the line they run the risk of getting hit a few times and that's exactly what happened on the weekend."
The League is aiming to find a high-tech system to aid the goal umpires in the future.
Introducing two goal umpires has been thrown up as a stop-gap measure, but that has all but been ruled out.
"A goal umpire, right now, can be in the perfect position underneath the post and still not get that slight deflection off the post," Evans said.
"Having two goal umpires won't solve that; having two goal umpires won't solve whether the ball has been touched off the boot or touched in flight.
"It may assist as to whether the ball has crossed the line, but we need to try and progress towards a system – if we're going to spend money on a system – that eradicates this problem for supporters."

A pair of would-be thieves stepped into a trap laid by the Eugene Police Department last week.
The department said it caught two people within an hour of each other attempting to steal a “bait bike,” deliberately placed by police and left unattended in a part of the city where property crimes have been an issue.
The department said in a statement that it placed one of the bicycles it uses for theft stings at an undisclosed ­location late on Nov. 16.
At about 11:30 p.m. that night, a man later identified as Randy Paul Miles, 54, took the bike and began to ride away.
Officers caught him moments later and charged him with second-degree theft. They then returned the bait bike to its location.
Forty-two minutes later, at 12:12 a.m., a man later identified as Mark Christian Dalby, 46, rode his bike up next to the bait bike, placed his bike next to it, and walked off with the bait bike.
Officers contacted Dalby and charged him with second-­degree theft.
The department said in the statement that bicycle theft is a continuing problem in Eugene.
So far in 2016, 642 bikes have been stolen in the city. Just 95 of them — less than 15 percent — have been recovered.
The department urged people to lock up their bikes, ­preferably using a hardened steel U-lock.
Eugene residents also can register their bicycles for free with the police department, which noted that bicycle registration is ­essential for recovery and return to the owner.
There certainly seems to be some trouble in the merry land of Ralph Northam and his run for governor of Virginia. As Twitchy readers know, last week a repugnant and vile commercial from Latino Victory Project aired basically showing Republicans trying to run over illegal immigrants in a giant black truck with a Confederate flag.
It sounds crazy when you write it out, no?
So basically they were claiming Gillespie and his supporters are violent racists. Not a great look for this group, so it was no surprise when Ralph Northam insisted he didn't approve the ad.
There's just one problem:

Oopsie.
That's not a good look, Ralph.
In fact, it was such a BAD look that the super progressive and liberal group, Democracy for America, announced they would no longer support Ralph's campaign because it was RACIST.
This is almost as delicious as the news about Hillary Clinton and the DNC yesterday.

Add in the proof that his campaign funded the racist attack ad and it does indeed appear to be raining crap all over Ralph Northam.
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

Google is shutting down SuperPoke! Pets -- and the cash users spent on virtual goods has likely flown out the window.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Dedicated social gamers devote many hours to tending their online farms and digital pets -- and lots of money, too. This year they'll spend an estimated $650 million in real cash on virtual goods.
But when those games are shut down, the digital items -- and the cash -- are left in limbo.
Fans of SuperPoke! Pets were crushed recently when Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) announced it was pulling the plug on the game. Google killed off all but one project from social app maker Slide, which it bought last year for around $200 million.
Players posted a torrent of comments on Web articles about the shutdown, saying they were upset to lose their beloved game -- but they also wanted to know what would happen to the cash they've plowed into it.
SuperPoke! Pet lets players buy online "gold," which can be redeemed for virtual goods in the game. Many other social games, including Zynga's wildly popular Farmville, also make money by encouraging users to shell out cash for virtual decorations, livestock and more.
Those paying customers keep the games afloat -- and they're not happy about the prospect of losing their digital stash.
"You do realize that people paid REAL MONEY for gold items, don't you?" Jennifer Gyurkovic-Hagmann commented on a TechCrunch article. "I expect a check in the mail for all of the gold items that I have in the SuperPoke Pets game."
But it's not as easy as simply refunding what's been spent, says Net Jacobsson, a former Facebook exec who now advises game companies including CrowdStar and Aurora Feint.
"The accounting issues can be massively complicated," Jacobsson says. "They've already counted it as revenue. They've taxed it. Refunding $20 would cost more than $20, not to mention the man-hours involved in dealing with it."
Slide seems to be mulling its options. In an e-mailed statement, a Google representative acknowledged that many people had asked about virtual goods, and confirmed that they'll be usable until SuperPoke officially goes offline (which is slated to happen "in the coming months").
But both Slide and Google are vague about what will happen after that point.
"One thing you can't do [with virtual goods] is bring them home and keep them forever," Slide's communications team wrote in a post to the SuperPoke! Pets user forum.
They also offered up a clunky comparison calling Halloween costumes the "closest real-life analog" to virtual bling: "You purchase it to dress up and enjoy the experience, but likely don't wear that costume day in and day out, or for every Halloween thereafter."
Slide said is trying to find a way to help users export some of their content and virtual items for access outside of the game, but is still "working out the details." Google declined to comment beyond that post.
Jacobsson thinks Slide should compensate users in some way, possibly with a credit toward another Google product.
That's a tactic other companies have used. Tom Sarris, a representative for Electronic Arts (ERTS)-owned social games maker Playfish, recalls the "difficult decision" to shutter a handful of games in April.
"We knew it would disappoint players who were still engaged in the games earmarked for retirement," Sarris says.
To heal some of the gamers' pain, Playfish allowed players of Pirates Ahoy!, Gangster City and Poker Rivals to move their currency to another game. Playfish also offered free gifts to entice users to transfer to a new game, Monopoly Millionaires.
FarmVille maker Zynga made a similar move last year when it shut down its Street Racing game. But the terms were stricter: Zynga offered credit only for purchases made in the last 90 days, plus an extra 100 units of virtual currency.
No matter what Slide decides, Jacobsson warns that Google should not make the mistake of marginalizing its customers.
"People in the tech community tend to laugh at them a little bit, asking why a single mom in Texas loves her virtual pets so much," he says. "That Silicon Valley ivory tower attitude is completely disrespectful."
Plus, it erodes the trust that keeps the entire virtual-goods economy afloat. If too many people get burned, they'll stop spending.
"These people are paying your salary, and they loved your game," Jacobsson says. "They were invested emotionally and financially, so they deserve to be upset. And they also deserve answers."
Angela Michelle Graham, 41, faces multiple charges, including attempted murder. WVVA reports she is accused of beating an 81-year-old woman from Bluefield with a baseball bat, sledgehammer and rolling pin to get drug money. (Southern Regional Jail)
An 81-year-old woman from Bluefield is in critical condition after police said she was beaten with a baseball bat, sledgehammer and rolling pin by her son's girlfriend for drug money.
Angela Michelle Graham, 41, was booked into Southern Regional Jail on Saturday and charged with attempted murder, malicious wounding, domestic assault, domestic battery, felony conspiracy and assault during commission/attempt to commit a felony, according to West Virginia Regional Jail records.
Officers with the Bluefield Police Department said the victim was beaten repeatedly with a baseball bat, sledgehammer and rolling pin in an attempt to extort drug money, WVVA-TV reported. The incident occurred in the Wythe and Pearl Street area of Bluefield.
Graham told officials it had been two days since she had used drugs and she was in desperate need, authorities said.
Police said the victim's son came into the room where the beating occurred and wanted to call an ambulance, but was brushed off by Graham.
The victim was transported to Charleston Area Medical Center, where she is listed in critical condition, officials said.
Graham is currently being held in Southern Regional Jail on a $1 million bond.

#OccupyRaleigh occupies Moore Square
First things first: Mark your calendars for this Saturday, October 15 from 11 am-3 pm. That's when #Occupy Raleigh will be occupying the State Capitol grounds for purposes of — well, that's a long story.
The short version is, #OccupyRaleigh (like #OccupyDurham and #OccupyChapel Hill/Carrboro) is an off-shoot of #OccupyWallStreet, and if you don't know what #OccupyWallStreet is: a) Blame the mainstream media for its/their abject failure to cover it; and b) Nobody knows how important it is yet, but #OWS may be the spark that finally lights this benighted country's candle.
In other words, it's a movement, and only later will you know whether it was The Movement. But if it was, do you wanna miss it?
For an introduction to #OccupyWallStreet, you can visit the OWS website. Or, check out DailyKos, which is all over it with a variety of diaries, including those of the suddenly famous — and rightly so — Jesse LaGreca, whose twitter handle is @JesseLaGreca. He's the man who schooled George Will yesterday on ABC's "This Week" program by noting, among other things, that he, Jesse, was the only working-class person on "This Week" — as he said, since maybe ever?
Suddenly the MSM is pushing the #OWS folks to publish an agenda, or a list of demands, or something to simplify why they're occupying Liberty Park in the Wall Street district of NYC. LaGreca's answer: We're the 99% of Americans who are pissed off that the richest 1% have stolen the country (and outsourced it to Goldman Sachs, China and other high bidders). So, LaGreca says, we're listening .... and it's up to our nation's alleged leaders to explain themselves to us.
What do they propose?
Update 2: Do see this.
Update: Here's something they should be talking about — in 4:25:
Second bit of news: #OccupyRaleigh voted last evening to meet twice daily, at 12 noon and 6:30 p.m., in Moore Square. Anyone who comes is welcome. See below for the rules on participation.
***
I was among the 300, or some say it was 400, who occupied Moore Square in Raleigh Sunday evening. This was #OccupyRaleigh's second General Assembly. (The first was last Sunday.) A General Assembly is a sort of People's Assembly, and if you're old enough to remember the movement against the Vietnam War, you'll understand the ground rules with no difficulty. Others may take awhile getting up to speed.
Going over the ground rules.
Quite a bit of time was spent explaining the ground rules. What's the agenda? It's whatever you decide it is. (The organizers bring a draft agenda, but it may or may not hold.)
The basic rule is, anyone can speak. They do so by putting their names on a 'stack list." But you don't necessarily speak in the order you signed up. Marginalized populations are favored, so if we've just heard from five fully abled white dudes in a row, the woman/minority/poor/disadvantaged person farther down on the list will come next before the sixth white dude. This is the sort of rule that drives conservatives around the bend. You know, because it's fair.
So now, folks are speaking. But the listeners have a role too — they ARE the General Assembly. So if they like what the speaker's saying, they're supposed to wiggle their fingers up in the air. Only OK with the speaker? Wiggle the fingers, but lower. Don't agree? Fingers down, like you're pawing the air. Have a point of process to raise? (Much discussion about what constitutes a point of process.) Form a triangle with your index fingers and thumbs. Point of information? One index finger up.
A moderator will recognize you.
Here's a signal you want to use sparingly. You've had it. You're being ignored. You sense the group is far off-course and about to sell out the mission. Before you storm off in disgust, you cross your arms in front of your chest, making an X.
This is called a block.
A block must be recognized, and you must be heard. But obviously, you don't want to wear this one out.
Democracy, as someone said, is messy. This is an attempt at pure democracy. Power to the people.

Mark Miller came from Apex last evening to be part of the #OccupyRaleigh group. His sign said, "I Can't Afford a Politician. So I Made This Sign." (Signs are key. Another one I liked: "The Beginning is Near."
Mark Miller couldn't buy his own pol so he made a sign.
"I can't go to New York City. I've got a job and a life and all that," Miller said. "But what I can do is come here and be part of the movement," which he likened to the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and so on. Others, too, talk about #OWS as the newest phase in a worldwide movement that, for example, recently caused the government in Iceland to resign.
Miller isn't a political activist, I gathered, but he is a TV watcher — not a good thing in these days of idiot political coverage. He's been watching Republican presidential debate audiences booing a gay soldier and cheering at the thought that if you don't have health insurance, you should just die.
"People are hurting in this country, people are desperate and losing their homes, and what's the biggest story of the last three years?" he asked me. Before I could answer — and I don't watch a lot of TV news, so I mercifully would've gotten this one wrong — he filled in the blank. "It's 'Was Barack Obama born in this country?' and where's his birth certificate," Miller said.
I'm afraid that's right.
"This is not the country I want for my son," Miller said. Like Jesse La Greca, he doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or any of them, for that matter. He does think answers can be found if people pitch in together — or at least, if the 99% of people who aren't filthy rich pitch in together and take power from the 1% who are.

Stacie Borrello is a writer, blogger (liberallamppost.com; addictinginfo.org) and at-home mom from Fuquay-Varina whose first reaction to the OccupyWallStreet movement was, Raleigh needs to be part of this — I hope somebody organizes Raleigh.
Fingers up!
Oops, that's not how movements work. So she started a Facebook page for OccupyRaleigh, and on Sunday there she was in the lead-off position with the megaphone shaking in her hand. But her voice was clear: "We don't plan on packing up and going home after a few hours of exercising our free-speech rights, do we?"
Wiggling fingers up on that.
The plan is for a four-hour demonstration at the Capitol Saturday, 11-3, a block of time for which the #OccupyRaleigh folks have a permit. But they've applied for a permit to continue a camp-in on the Capitol grounds beyond 3 pm Saturday — no response on that one yet — and they're pretty determined, Borrello said, to do it, permit or not.
Friendly lawyers believe they'd be within their First Amendment rights to occupy the Capitol grounds without a permit, and/or they'll litigate the issue is they're turned down for a permit.
Movements, Borrello said, require that people make a "leap of faith" to be successful. If enough people make the leap, movements do succeed — and the more successful they are, the more people make the leap with them. "I realized the passive approach wasn't the right one to take," she said. "I want to be part of the solution."

Egypt's military has moved against the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, a day after deposing President Mohammed Morsi.
Mr Morsi is in detention, as well as senior figures in the Islamist group of which he is a member. Hundreds more are being sought.
The top judge of Egypt's constitutional court, Adly Mahmud Mansour, has been sworn in as interim leader.
He has pledged to hold elections based on "the genuine people's will".
At a news conference, Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad declared "our full refusal and revoking of the military coup" and demanded Mr Morsi's immediate release, along with the other detainees.
He declared the Brotherhood's "full denial of co-operation" with the new regime and said it would take part in all "peaceful, people-led protest".
A couple of months ago, people were sceptical of the army. However, we have now seen our faith restored Reem Shalan , Cairo Voices from the streets
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamel Amr - who resigned from Mr Morsi's government on Monday - said he had assured US Secretary of State John Kerry in a telephone call on Thursday that the overthrow of President Morsi had not been a military coup, but the "overwhelming will of the people".
The upheaval in Egypt comes after days of mass rallies against Mr Morsi and the Brotherhood, who are accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and failing to tackle Egypt's economic problems.
Some 50 people have died since the latest unrest began on Sunday, with correspondents saying that there are continuing fears of confrontation between the pro- and anti-Morsi blocs.
A coalition of Islamist parties - the National Coalition in Support of Legitimacy - has called for mass demonstrations to denounce the army's actions following Friday prayers.
'Police state'
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Mansour praised the armed forces and the Egyptian people
The Egyptian army has gambled that it can contain the situation, but that's by no means certain, says the BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Cairo.
There have been reports that Morsi supporters in a town north of Cairo have been set upon and badly beaten - an illustration of the potential for danger.
Mr Haddad earlier told the BBC that Mr Morsi had been put under house arrest and the "entire presidential team" was in detention.
The army said that Mr Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, had "failed to meet the demands of the people".
But in the news conference, Mr Haddad said the arrests had no legal basis and decried "the prospect of a police state in action now", citing as a particular example the arrest of the former Muslim Brotherhood chief Dr Mahdi Akef - "a non-political, non-office figure, 85 years old and yet arrested".

Mr Haddad's father, senior Morsi aide Essam el-Haddad, and Saad al-Katatni, head of the FJP, are among those being held.
On Thursday afternoon unnamed officials said Mohammed Badie, supreme leader of the Brotherhood, had been arrested in Mersa Matruh, a Mediterranean coastal city to the west of Cairo.
Arrest warrants have reportedly been issued for some 300 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood, including Mr Badie's deputy, Khairat al-Shater.
Some of those held, including Mr Morsi, are being charged with "insulting the judiciary", and the public prosecutor's office told AFP news agency travel bans had been placed on 35 senior leaders.
Several TV stations sympathetic to the Brotherhood have been taken off the air, and a state-owned printing press is said to be refusing to print a newspaper run by the FJP.
Security forces raided al-Jazeera's Egypt channel and detained members of its crew - a move denounced by the Arabic broadcaster.
Rights group Amnesty International said the shutdowns were a "blow to freedom of expression".

"Charter of honour" to be drawn up and followed by the media
Measures taken to empower young people and a national reconciliation committee to be formed Profile: Adly Mahmud Mansour Coup or no coup? Twitter translates Egypt tweets Laser pens light up protests
Fighter jets trailing smoke drew love hearts in Cairo's smoggy skies on Thursday in apparent celebration of the military's role in ousting Mr Morsi's government.
But across the city, his despondent supporters staged sit-ins in protest at what many are calling a betrayal of the democratic process.
'Spirit of revolution'
Mr Mansour took an oath to become interim head of state, vowing to safeguard "the spirit of the revolution" which had removed Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011.
Fresh elections were "the only way" forward, he said, without indicating when they would be held.
He held out an apparent olive branch to the Muslim Brotherhood, saying they were "part of this people" and were "invited to participate in building the nation".
This will be interpreted by many political Islamists as sending a blunt message: it doesn't necessarily pay to choose the ballot over the bullet Dangerous moment for the Middle East Egypt stocks jump
The army's roadmap for the post-Morsi era includes:
Suspension of the constitution
A civilian, transitional technocratic government
Supreme constitutional court to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections
A "charter of honour" to be drawn up and followed by national media
Events in Egypt have divided international opinion, with the US, UK and UN among those expressing concern and calling for a swift return to civilian rule.
Others, such as Turkey and Tunisia, have been more forthright in their condemnation of the way Mr Morsi has been ousted.
Yet others, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - have welcomed the turn of events.
Mr Morsi became Egypt's first Islamist president on 30 June 2012, after winning an election considered free and fair following the 2011 revolution that toppled Mubarak.
Image caption Vietnam's central bank has been infusing ACB with cash to reassure depositors
A second top executive in Vietnam has been arrested in a case that has led to a plunge in bank shares and a run on deposits, state-run media report.
Ly Xuan Hai, former chief of the Asia Commercial Bank, was arrested on Thursday for breaching "state regulations on economic management", says the Vietnam News Agency.
He had resigned after bank co-founder Nguyen Duc Kien was arrested on Monday.
Vietnam has been pumping money into the bank to reassure depositors.
Mr Kien, a well-known entrepreneur with close government links and one of the country's richest businessmen, co-founded ACB in the 1990s. He was arrested in Hanoi on suspicion of "economic violations".
His arrest triggered a slide in ACB shares. It also caused a drop in the country's stock exchange up until Thursday.
Panicked depositors have been withdrawing millions of dollars from the bank.
ACB said on Tuesday that Mr Kien was not involved in the day-to-day operations of the bank and the arrest would not impact its business.
Mr Hai has been accused of "intentional wrongdoings that violated state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences", VNA says. No other details were provided.
Mr Hai's arrest did not come as a surprise, as state-run media had already reported on it in the last few days before taking these reports offline, says Nga Pham of the BBC's Vietnamese service.
This unusual practice shows that the government is keen to prevent further panic spreading through the banking system, she said.
While government institutions are saying that deposit withdrawals remain within safe margins, the public are asking for more transparency as worries over the economy increase, she adds.
Mr Hai, 47, who has doctorates in mathematics and physics, joined the bank in 1996, reports say.
The bank run has put pressure on the Vietnamese dong and led to an increase in the price of gold - traditionally seen as a safe-haven investment at times of economic instability.
ACB also faced a run on its deposits in 2003 after rumours - later proved false - spread about the arrest of one of its executives at the time.

MURRAY COUNTY, Okla. - Authorities say they are still investigating a deadly crash involving a bus carrying college students and a semi-truck.
Shortly after 9 p.m. on Friday, the bus, which was carrying the girl's softball team from North Central Texas College, was hit by a semi-truck along I-35 in Murray County, near Turner Falls.
Officials with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol say three students died at the scene of the accident.
The Department of Public Safety says 19-year-old Meagan Richardson, 18-year-old Katelynn Woodlee and 20-year-old Jaiden Pelton all died at the scene from massive injuries.
However, a fourth student died at a hospital in Sulphur a short time later.
Authorities say 20-year-old Brooke Deckard was pronounced dead at the hospital from massive injuries.

The students had just played a softball game at Southern Nazarene University and were on their way back to Texas at the time of the crash.
Authorities say a semi-truck was heading northbound before it crossed over the center median and hit the team's bus.
The bus rolled over in the crash, and the semi headed off the roadway into a wooded area.
The bus was headed back to the college when the semi-truck crossed the center median.
In addition to the deaths, several other people were injured in the crash.
According to the Department of Public Safety's report, there were 16 people on the bus at the time of the accident.
Everyone was taken to the hospital but most were treated and released for minor injuries.
Three students were admitted to various hospitals across the state in stable condition.
Dr. Brown Wallace, president of the North Central Texas Community College District, released the following statement on Saturday morning.
"As each of you must imagine, words are difficult for us this morning. Last evening, the North Central Texas College girl's softball team was involved in a major accident around 9 p.m. on Interstate 35 in southern Oklahoma. The NCTC Police Department is waiting on official notification from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol before releasing any further details. We are aware of four fatalities bur are not yet able to release these names. On behalf of the NCTC Board of Regents, administration, faculty and staff, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to these families. This is indeed a sad day for these families and for North Central Texas College. We covet your prayers for all of these young ladies and families and those who have lost loved ones. The NCTC counselors are available for students and staff on the Gainsville campus today, Saturday, September 27, 2014, and will continue to be available as students work through this tragic event."
Dr. Wallace says a prayer vigil is scheduled for Sunday so families, students and faculty members can remember the young women who were lost in the crash.
He added that many of the players are experiencing some "deep emotion" when it comes to dealing with their friends' deaths.
"This is the most traumatic event that NCTC has had in its 90 years of history," Wallace said.

Losing games is not the only problem Gene Chizik has faced this fall at Auburn. The embattled coach of the Tigers also is overseeing a program being investigated by the NCAA, Yahoo! Sport has learned.
According to multiple sources, NCAA investigators have spent weeks looking into potential improprieties involving Auburn recruits, players, coaches, representatives of the school's athletic interests and third parties. Assistant coaches Trooper Taylor and Curtis Luper have been scrutinized by the NCAA, sources said. Taylor is the assistant head coach and wide receivers coach, while Luper coaches running backs and is the recruiting coordinator.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Both Taylor and Luper were taken off the road recruiting several weeks ago amid the NCAA probe, sources said. Taylor was a finalist this season for national Assistant Coach of the Year honors from the American Football Coaches Association.
With Auburn 3-8 and winless in Southeastern Conference play, Chizik's job is in jeopardy. The ongoing NCAA investigation only heightens the likelihood that the Tigers' game Saturday against rival Alabama will be Chizik's last at the school.
Auburn officials declined comment Wednesday.
NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn told Yahoo! Sports on Wednesday that she cannot comment on current, pending or potential investigations.
Chizik was asked in late October about a radio report that some of his coaches had been taken off the recruiting trail. He did not confirm or deny the report at the time.
[Also: Jeff Tedford becomes the latest casualty of firing season]
Story continues
"I don't have time for all of that," Chizik said, according to an Auburn transcript of his press conference Oct. 30. "I've got one direct focus: that is my team and my players. That has nothing to do with us winning. Whoever said that has nothing to do with anything, so I am not getting into any of that stuff. I've got one track, and that is our players and our coaches, and trying to get us to the next win, so, all of that stuff, I have no comment on that."
Sources told Yahoo! Sports in September that the NCAA has been investigating the recruitment of 2012 Auburn signee Jovon Robinson, whose Memphis Wooddale High School academic transcript was found to be forged and was subsequently declared ineligible in August to play this year at the school. The Memphis Commercial Appeal reported in August that a guidance counselor at Wooddale admitted creating a fraudulent transcript and resigned.
[Listen: The Dan Wetzel College Football Podcast]
Robinson declined comment to Yahoo! Sports through a family member in September. He is not enrolled at Auburn this semester.
In addition to the academic issues involving Robinson, sources told Yahoo! Sports the NCAA has investigated whether a Wooddale P.E. teacher, Rhonda Wilkinson, provided impermissible benefits to the player during his recruitment, including transportation to the Auburn campus on at least one occasion. Wilkinson is an Auburn graduate and fan – her vehicle and home are extensively decorated with Auburn memorabilia.
When approached at her Memphis home in September, Wilkinson declined comment to Yahoo! Sports.
The NCAA probe is believed to be more widespread than just Robinson, but is not believed to revisit the 2010 allegations involving former star quarterback Cam Newton – allegations Chizik and the school vigorously combated at the time. Auburn went on to win the national title that year after Newton was cleared by the NCAA late in the season.

Why did I say that the pocket camera review would be 3 parts? Am I mad? Why paint myself into a corner?
Well I am glad I did, and I am also glad I waited this long to do the 3rd part. My original intention was not for it to be a long term test, I just simply didn't have the time to get it done. Thankfully, this delay meant I was able to include both the raw firmware and the crazy impressive new “Speed Boosters” from Metabones.
All this is covered in-depth in the review here. After the review, there are some more images and tech specs on the new Metabones Speedboosters, plus of course the two previous reviews and the video content shot on the camera.

1915 Subway Explosion Kills Seven, Injures Scores: 7th Avenue Between 24th and 25th Streets
This photograph taken on September 24, 1915 looking east across Seventh Avenue between 25th and 24th Streets shows the extent of a tragedy that took the lives of seven people and injured more than 100.
At about 7:50 a.m. on September 22, 1915 during the subway excavation for a new line, an explosion followed by a massive street collapse threw 7th Avenue into a scene of pandemonium and carnage. A blast of dynamite caused the temporary roadway of wood planking to give way. A trolley loaded with passengers plunged 30 feet into the abyss created by the cave in. A beer truck minus the driver also fell into the excavation.
The reason more people were not killed was because the street undulated for a few seconds before collapsing which allowed precious time for people on the street to scatter to safety.
The motorman of the northbound trolley, John Mayne said, “The car sank just where I stopped it. I had no stop at Twenty-fourth street and there was no warning there. When I was halfway to Twenty-fifth street I saw a flagman and set my brakes. As I set the brakes I felt the earth going from under me. The next thing I knew I was being pulled out of hell.”
Fanny Borie, 18, of Brooklyn was on the trolley, on her way to work when it went down into the hole. “When the car started to sink there were terrible screams, and I think I fainted,” she said. “I remember feeling people tugging at my feet, as I was buried under some timbers. Then I lost consciousness and came to again when I was being carried up a ladder to the street.”
She was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital with her left side crushed. Two people on the trolley were killed and the others who died were workers at the excavation site, many who were crushed when the trolley fell on them.
Three priests from nearby St. Columba's Church were among the first to climb down into the hole to give aid to the victims. Father Higgins said, “On every side men with smashed arms and legs were begging us for aid, some of them crying in a foreign tongue. ‘Help me, help me,' they were all crying, and the horror of it was that we could not help one of them. From one mound of earth and network of steel I saw the arm of a buried man.”
As police and firemen descended they heard cries and groans of those who were terribly hurt. Girls shrieked that their arms and legs were broken. Many of the injured were rushed to hospitals with leg, arm and skull fractures. Some had limbs severed.
The blast which caused the shoring of the street to give way, was initially thought not to be from an unusually large charge of dynamite. The shoring which held up the street was designed to withstand 700 pounds per square foot if the street was loaded to capacity. The weight at the time of the collapse was 1/10 of that. The chief engineer of the construction company C.H. Stengle said, “It's a puzzle to me. It was the strongest subway shoring ever built in New York, yet it went down like a house of cards.”
The chief blaster, Augusto Mezanitte, also known as August Midnight initially ran away from the scene, but came to authorities a day later to tell what had happened. He explained that he had successfully set off one blast earlier that morning and that the second blast was what preceded the cave in.
“Three or four seconds after the blast went off the whole street started to wave and tremble,” he said. “Then it started to crash down beginning at the end where I was standing and sagging down in the middle, then breaking up all at once with an awful noise.”
Some workers and investigators believed that rocks flying into the supports from the explosion resulted in the shorings holding up the street to fail. Other experts theorized that the explosion had damaged the gas mains and a gas explosion lead to the street collapse.
After a month-long investigation by the coroner's office, it was determined that the blast was excessive and that while Mezzanitte was in some way responsible for the accident, it was an error in judgment and it was recommended he should not be criminally charged. The blame was placed with The Bureau of Combustibles under the Fire Prevention Bureau which had not carried out their duties to enforce all the regulations with proper inspections.
The head of the Fire Prevention Bureau J.W. Hammitt denied responsibility saying there was no failure to carry out inspections relating to the kind of blasting that was going on at the Seventh Avenue excavation.
The coroner's jury made two recommendations for future public safety. The first was that at the time of blasting in all future subway work, no traffic of any kind be allowed over any part of the temporary structure. The second recommendation was that the Public Service Commission should designate the maximum distance at which temporary work should precede the permanent subway structure.
About the buildings in the photograph: Number 255 Seventh Avenue housing Family Wines and Liquors was demolished years after the accident and a new building was put up in its place. But the the other three buildings to the left are still in existence, although they have each been modernized to some extent.
Abstract
Background: Severe chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE) is associated with degenerative tendon changes, extracellular matrix breakdown, and tendon cell loss. On the basis of positive outcomes from preclinical studies, this study is the first clinical trial of autologous tenocyte injection (ATI) on severe tendinopathy associated with chronic LE.
Hypothesis: Autologous tenocyte injection is a safe and effective procedure that enables a reduction in pain and improvement in function in resistant LE.
Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
Methods: Patients with severe refractory LE underwent clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before intervention. A patellar tendon needle biopsy was performed under local anesthetic, and tendon cells were expanded by in vitro culture. Tenocytes used for the injection were characterized by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Autologous tenocytes were injected into the site of tendinopathy identified at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon under ultrasound guidance on a single occasion. Patients underwent serial clinical evaluations and repeat MRI at 12 months after intervention.
Results: A total of 20 consecutive patients were included in the study. Three patients withdrew consent after enrollment and before ATI. No adverse event was reported at either biopsy or injection sites. Furthermore, no infection or excessive fibroblastic reaction was found in any patient at the injection site. Clinical evaluation revealed an improvement in mean visual analog scale scores, for a maximum pain score from 5.94 at the initial assessment to 0.76 at 12 months (P < .001). Mean quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) and grip strength scores also significantly improved over the 12-month follow-up (QuickDASH score, 45.88 [baseline] to 3.84; grip strength, 20.17 kg [baseline] to 37.38 kg; P < .001). With use of a validated MRI scoring system, the grade of tendinopathy at the common extensor origin improved significantly by 12 months (P < .001). One patient elected to proceed to surgery 3 months after ATI following a reinjury at work.

Vettel has won the last four races, leading for 205 consecutive laps in the process, to establish a 13-point lead over Alonso in the title race. But the fact that Vettel's only other win this year came in Bahrain back in April has led some to suggest that it was the decisive step forward taken by the Adrian Newey-designed RB8 in Singapore in September which has proved the difference rather than any particular brilliance on Vettel's part.
Sir Jackie Stewart, the three-time world champion, said last month that he did not believe that Vettel had yet earned the right to be labelled a “great” as his wins had come in a “superior” car. "To really show you're one of the greatest, you have to deliver when you haven't got the best machinery,” Stewart said.
Hamilton has now fanned the flames by stating that Vettel “misses” a lot of corners on his flying laps yet still manages to claim pole. “I think lots of people in the paddock wish they could have Adrian's car so they could show that they're just as competitive as Sebastian,” Hamilton said. “Fernando, for me, is more accurate. He hits all the apexes [the perfect racing line through a corner]. Sebastian misses four apexes on a single lap and still goes quickest. He goes off and he still goes quickest. And I think ‘Holy crap, I couldn't do that lap even if I was on the limit'. His car is just that far ahead of everyone else's. They made such a big step for some reason.”
Hamilton added, though, that he felt Vettel would be a worthy champion if he was to prevail this season and claim his third straight crown. “I think he's a true champion,” Hamilton said. “He's polite, he's never in trouble, he's squeaky clean and a genuinely nice guy. He speaks incredibly well and carries himself really well. And at the end of the day you have to do the job even if you do have the best car.
“He qualifies really well, he pulls out fantastic gaps. But when your car is that far ahead it's easier to do that. I've had that experience, when I was quite a bit quicker than everyone. And you get that gap immediately. It's easy. And when you have it all the time you get really good at it.”
I finally got to watch the movie Killing Jesus which debuted on the National Geographic station on Sunday.I think many progressive Christians would balk at the movie because it is based off of Bill O'Reilly's book (with Martin Dugard) Killing Jesus . But here's my assessment.I thinkjust became my all-time favorite Jesus movie.Here are three quick reasons why progressive Christians would likeFirst, the movie (and the book) attempt to portray the historical aspects of the gospel story. The theological, supernatural and miraculous aspects of the story are downplayed. What this means is thatis about the cultural, historical and political reasons Jesus was killed. Jesus's confrontation with "the principalities and powers" makesa whole lot more attractive to progressive Christians than a movie like Gibson'swith its emphasis upon penal substitutionary atonement. If you think Jesus was killed because of his conflict with Empire then this is the movie for you.Second, finally we have a Jesus movie where Jesus isn't a white guy of European descent. Inwe have a Jesus that looks like a Palestinian Jew. Haaz Sleiman, the actor who plays Jesus, was born and raised in Lebanon. We finally have a movie where we can say, "I think Jesus might have actually looked like that guy."Third, progressive Christians like a low Christology. Given its focus upon historical events, as mentioned above,downplays the supernatural. There are a few miraculous moments in the movie, but there are also "miracles" of a more human sort. Specifically, the scene with Jesus and the lepers is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a Jesus movie. Jesus's healing of the leper isn't supernatural but I think it's miraculous. That scene with the lepers captures everything I was trying to say in Unclean And a final note about the low Christology. The most theologically fascinating aspect ofis how Jesus comes to gradually discover his identity and vocation as the movie progresses.For example, Peter's confession of Jesus is a moment of discovery, for both PeterJesus. Who am I?, Jesus asks. Jesus isn't quizzing his disciples, Jesus is asking the question for himself.And when Peter confesses, "You are the Messiah," Jesus's suspicions about himself are confirmed. Through Peter's confession Jesus's vocation comes fully into view. Peter's confession is, the confessionJesus the Christ.This aspect alone will makea theological case study for decades to come. The movie explores some interesting Christological ideas.
Today, Texas executed Humberto Leal Garcia, a Mexican national who was tried, convicted and sentenced to die in the state of Texas without ever being given access to the Mexican consulate. Most agree his sentence would have been different if he had been given that access. It is certain that his lawyer would have been different – Mexico pays for experienced lawyers to defend against death penalty cases for its citizens.
Texas violated Leal's rights under Vienna Convention on Consular Relations when it neglected to inform him of his right to consult the Mexican consulate upon his arrest. The Texas authorities don't even deny that – they simply say, in legalese, “too bad.” Because of their ability to rely on the hypertechnical timing requirements of state and federal law, Texas prosecutors can afford to ignore a legitimate legal claim. Not deny the claim, mind you – just ignore it.
In 2004, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that Leal was entitled to that remedy by way of a court review to determine if his sentence had been different if he had been given access to the consulate. A bill is pending in Congress that would give him the right to a hearing. The Obama administration, the United Nations and the country of Mexico all petitioned the Supreme Court to order Texas hold off on the execution until Congress has time to make the fix. Even President George W. Bush – whose support for the death penalty during time as governor of Texas is well known -- said states should comply with the ICJ decision.
But Texas ignored the ICJ, along with the requests of Obama and Bush, the U.N. and the Mexican government and the pleas of former diplomats, Justice Department officials, judges and prosecutors. Texas went ahead with the execution, even disregarding the actions of other states like Oklahoma which, when faced with the same choice, opted to commute the death sentence of a Mexican national to life in prison.
The execution of Leal flies in the face of international treaties by which we are all bound, and it poses a real danger to the many Americans travelling abroad who have always counted on the American embassy for legal assistance. Texas refused to recognize the importance of giving Mexican national access to the Mexican consulate, and in doing so turned its back on American students, aid workers and members of the military overseas who depend on our consulate in times of distress. Texas courts and politicians talk piously about the importance of “the rule of law,” but that rule only works when the law is followed by all, for all.
Despite it all, Texas executed Humberto Leal Garcia today. Our foreign allies and enemies alike may well wonder how important treaties are to the United States. Unfortunately, when it comes to the death penalty, it seems the eyes of the entire world just don't matter in Texas.

Given that the Federal Reserve is now the nation's largest creditor, through expansions of the money supply, one should hardly be surprised that prices are rising. Although the inflation tax has not reared its ugly head so much in the last couple of years, more reports are coming in that the devaluation of the currency has arrived.
The American Institute for Economic Research (where I worked in 2009) has shown a particular interest in this development, and they're publishing a new measure, one which they call the Everyday Price Index. This only measures frequent purchases—once per month or more—which accounts for almost half of all spending but excludes big ticket items such as household appliances, automobiles, and houses.
AIER has chosen these items because individuals have less ability to avoid or put them off. Additionally, one cannot plan well for them, and therefore price changes will have a greater impact on people's wallets. These particular price changes also explain, to a large degree, people's experiences and perceptions the best, since they are the prices they deal with most regularly.
For this refined measure, AIER finds an inflation rate of 8 percent between 2010 and 2011—compared with 3.1 percent for the official, published rate (the Consumer Price Index). This finding caught the attention of media outlets across the country, including the Wall Street Journal. Here is their concise overview and analysis:
And here is the AIER breakdown, showing transportation costs increasing by 21 percent in just one year:
Assuming This frequents spending components also have more rapidly adjusting prices, this disparate price change finding could suggest that the remaining components of the CPI are set to grow rapidly as well. One of the authors of the AIER report, Polina Vlasenko, spoke with me. She has yet to run an analysis of the prospect of such a lag-time, but she did not rule it out.
More interesting for her, though, is that until around the year 2000, the EPI tracked the CPI very well. But since then, the two data sets have diverged. She is not sure what changed at that time, but she speculates that perhaps the EPI components of consumption are less buffered by international trade. Therefore, they have been particularly sensitive to domestic fluctuations within the United States, including monetary policy.
Cow and Chicken is an American animated comedy television series created by David Feiss for Cartoon Network, and the 3rd of the network's Cartoon. It follows the surreal adventures of two funny animal siblings, Cow and Chicken. They are often antagonized by the Red Guy, a cartoon version of the Devil who poses as various characters to scam them.
The original pilot appeared as an episode of the animation showcase series What a Cartoon!. The popularity of the original short allowed Hanna-Barbera to give it the green light for a full series, which premiered on July 15, 1997. Originally, Cow and Chicken was attached to another segment called I Am Weasel, which was later spun off into its own half-hour series on June 10, 1999. The series was produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons. It was nominated for two Emmy Awards.
Premise [ edit ]
left), Cow (center), and Chicken (right). Poster for the series' pilot, featuring the Red Guy (), Cow (), and Chicken ().
The program focuses on the misadventures of two unlikely yet somehow biological siblings: the sweet-natured, dim, ecstatic anthropomorphic Cow and her cynical older brother Chicken (both voiced by Charlie Adler). The two are often caught in escapades with their flamboyant enemy, the Red Guy (Adler), who disguises himself under various personas to attempt to scam the two.
Supporting characters include Chicken and Cow's delirious human parents (Dee Bradley Baker, Candi Milo) who are only ever seen from the waist down, Chicken's two best friends Flem (Howard Morris) and Earl (Dan Castellaneta), and his appropriately-named cousin, Boneless Chicken (Adler).
The series draws on eccentric, surreal, grotesque, and repulsive humor. For example, Cow and Chicken always order "pork butts and taters" when in the cafeteria, the Red Guy always shows his butt, and characters often pepper their speech with malapropisms and sarcasm. The humor and storylines depicted in the series are sometimes based around traditional childhood worries, anxieties, or phobias such as cooties or venturing into the girls' restroom, but enhanced comically.
Many of the slapstick antics involve Cow getting physically abused. Because Hinduism considers the cow a sacred animal, the series was largely ignored in India.[1]
Production [ edit ]
Development [ edit ]
David Feiss first created Cow and Chicken as a story for his daughter.[2] Feiss was an animator who had worked with Hanna-Barbera and related projects since 1978.[2]
Years later, Feiss was called to submit ideas for What a Cartoon!, a series of various animated shorts from numerous creators and writers. Feiss submitted three ideas to executive producer Larry Huber, one of which was Cow and Chicken.[3] Cow and Chicken premiered on What a Cartoon! in 1995. Later, Hanna-Barbera decided to turn Cow and Chicken into a full series, following many letters from fans asking for more.[3]
Voice actors [ edit ]
A single actor, Charlie Adler, voiced the three leading roles of Cow, Chicken, and the Red Guy. Supporting voices included Candi Milo and Dee Bradley Baker as Mom and Dad, and Dan Castellaneta and Howard Morris as Earl and Flem.
Guest stars included Feiss, Will Ferrell, Carlos Alazraqui, Tom Kenny, Jill Talley, Dom Deluise, Michael Gough, Mark Hamill, Jess Harnell, Pamela Segall Adlon, and many others.

Cow and Chicken has a total of 52 episodes in 3 seasons that were produced from November 1996 to April 1999. Each half-hour contains 2 Cows and Chicken and 1 I Am Weasel segment.[4] Cow and Chicken premiered as a full half-hour on July 15, 1997.[5] The series ran for 52 episodes through 1999. As a supporting segment, the show included a cartoon called I Am Weasel; this segment was spun off as an independent series late in the show's run. Typically, an episode would consist of two seven-minute Cow and Chicken shorts playing back-to-back, then followed by a seven-minute I Am Weasel short before the end credits.[5] The exception to this structure was episode 105 ("The Ugliest Weenie"), which had the Weasel short ("I Are Big Star") play in-between the two Cow and Chicken shorts, possibly because said shorts were one storyline.
Reruns continued to be shown on Cartoon Network from 1999 to 2003, and again from 2005 to 2008 as part of the network's blocks titled The Cartoon Cartoon Show and Top 5.
Controversial episode [ edit ]
"Buffalo Gals" (season two, 1998), which was paired with the segment "Cow and Chicken Reclining," was banned by Cartoon Network after receiving a complaint from a parent about the episode's liberal visual and verbal innuendo about the titular biker group being lesbians (the Buffalo Gals break into people's homes and literally chew on the carpet, one of the bikers is named Munch Kelly and has a carpet swatch for a calling card, and when Dad freaks out over the Buffalo Gals in the house, Mom says, "They're not after you.")[6] In addition, the Buffalo Gals play softball and talk about pitching and catching. Although it was only shown on air once, it was replaced by "Orthodontic Police" in future airings, including on Netflix streaming and reruns on Boomerang. The episode was also discussed on an installment of Rob Paulsen's Talkin' Toons special featuring Cow and Chicken creator David Feiss and voice actor Charlie Adler when an audience member asked why "Buffalo Gals" only aired once. Since Cartoon Network Studios was not involved in this production, the controversial episode "Buffalo Gals" was uncensored.

Of all the legendary concert venues in Toronto, Nirvanna the Band frontmen Matt Johnson and Jay McCarrol are interested in playing a show at only one: the Rivoli, a Queen St. W. club known these days for its standup comedy scene and cavernous pool hall. In fact, playing a show at the Rivoli is entirely the premise of Nirvanna the Band the Show, Johnson and McCarrol's hilarious new “semi-scripted” television series that's to debut weekly on Viceland and City on Feb. 2.
Matt Johnson, left, and Jay McCarrol of Nirvanna the Band the Show, which films throughout Toronto.
“It's unanswerable why these guys want to play at the Rivoli,” says real-life Johnson, the director of the show, who plays a hyperactive version of himself in Nirvanna. “Nobody could give you an answer. It's not like they need to play the Silver Dollar and it's not like they need to play Massey Hall. Either of those would have seemed stupid, but the Rivoli, for whatever reason . . . ” Johnson grins as he explains the genesis for Nirvanna the Band the Show, which began as a web series in 2007 (albeit with one fewer “n” in “Nirvanna”), ran until 2009 and, in the fall of 2015, was picked up by Vice through the support of executive producer Spike Jonze. McCarrol, a legitimate professional musician by day, remembers it equally well. “They call themselves something really obvious, like ‘Nirvanna,'” recalls McCarrol, whose straight-man chops and piano talent make the perfect foil for playing Jay, his TV self, opposite Matt's mania. “And just so there's no confusion, they actually call themselves ‘Nirvanna the Band.'”

For any established band, playing a show at the Rivoli sounds as easy as emailing their booking staff. (Or, you know, walking in.) For Nirvanna's Matt and Jay, however — who still haven't figured out what their musical act will look like onstage — the Rivoli is an impenetrable fortress, well-guarded by stubborn bouncers and skeptical servers. More pertinently, the venue is assuredly not in on the joke. And so the joke improves. Instead of writing and rehearsing music, Matt and Jay choose to invent ways to convince the Rivoli they are deserving of a gig, rather than actually perfecting one. “The Nirvanna the Band Christmas float!” says Jay in Episode 3 (“The Bean”), holding up a copy of the Toronto Star's feature on the Santa Claus Parade. “The parade route goes right by the Rivoli! The Rivoli will be watching us!” Matt replies, turning to their drawing board and brainstorming ideas for their latest scheme: stealing a pickup truck, decorating it with an assortment of ornaments and driving it to the actual parade to try to sneak their “float” in.
Such is the structure of Nirvanna the Band the Show, a high-concept, high-energy romp on Queen St. W., featuring two characters who are trapped in the 1990s and yet have never heard of the biggest band of that decade. Each episode features one crazy idea after another, always in an attempt at impressing the Rivoli, often winking at popular TV shows or movies in the process. (The pilot episode, “The Banner,” loosely resembles Jurassic Park; a later episode, “To Blindside,” spoofs Marvel's Daredevil series.) Perhaps most amazing about Johnson and McCarrol's 2017 update to their web series is their commitment to Toronto and eternalizing city landmarks like Honest Ed's, the Toronto Reference Library and the 501 Queen streetcar — which they were kicked off for filming in, an occupational hazard of Johnson's guerrilla-style shooting that he's honed through two feature mockumentaries, The Dirties and Operation Avalanche.

“We're on the streets of Toronto and we're interacting with real people in a way that every single show made in this city isn't,” says Johnson. “It's the Toronto that university students care about. It's the Toronto that when you come to this city as a young person to live for the first time, you just go: ‘Wow.'” Nirvanna the Band the Show's wild antics will elicit similar reactions, whether you laugh or cringe at its political incorrectness. It's supremely funny; a wonderfully fresh Canadian TV show that makes no apologies for the scenes it causes on location. “We're (making the show) very flagrantly flaunting the things that you're not allowed to do on TV,” says Johnson. “I hope that Toronto gets behind it, because we are so desperately trying to make Toronto look good. Desperately.” And when that happens, maybe the Rivoli will finally take notice.
It's been a while since I posted any of these but welcome back to Trivia Tidbits. For those of you out of the loop, this is a little compilation of 10 movie related facts that I always find interesting. So without further ado, this week's are…
1: When “Donnie Brasco” was in its first stages, Joe Pesci was the first and main choice for Nicky. But after the release of “Goodfellas“, the idea gradually faded. This is the second film where Joe Pesci was considered for a role that eventually went to Bruno Kirby. The first was “The Godfather: Part II“, the role in question being that of the young Clemenza.
2: Joel Schumacher was originally set to direct the film “Devil's Advocate” in 1994 before Taylor Hackford took over. Brad Pitt was also set to star as Kevin Lomax. Christian Slater, John Cusack and Edward Norton were also considered for the role before it eventually went to Keanu Reeves.
3: In Peter Mullan's “NEDS“, many of the film's events parallels Mullan's own experiences growing up in the 1970's Glasgow. Mullan was part of a street gang, and tried to kill his abusive father at 14, both of which the protagonist does in the film.
4: Originally Charlie Sheen was turned down for the main role of Chris Taylor in “Platoon” because it was felt he was too young for the part. His older brother Emilio Estevez was offered the part but the project fell apart due to financial problems. Two years later the project was given the go-ahead, but Estevez had already committed to other projects. Charlie Sheen again read for the part and won it.
5: In the Coen Brothers' “Miller's Crossing“, the character Eddie Dane (played by J.E. Freeman) was originally written for Peter Stormare and was to be named The Swede. Stormare had to decline as he was appearing as “Hamlet” in the Broadway production. The part was then re-written and re-cast, and became The Dane.
6: Terry Gilliam's “Brazil” was apparently River Phoenix's favorite movie, and while he was filming “Dark Blood” with it's leading actor Jonathan Pryce, a gift was arranged. Pryce arranged for Phoenix to meet Gilliam, his hero. The meeting was set to happen the day Phoenix died outside the Viper Room. They never met.
7: In “One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest“, most of Jack Nicholson's scene with Dean R. Brooks upon arriving at the hospital was improvised – including his slamming a stapler, asking about a fishing photo, and discussing his rape conviction; Brooks's reactions were authentic.
8: Paramount tried to go ahead with “The Godfather part III” for many years without Francis Ford Coppola who had refused to make another sequel. About twelve scripts were written. Most of the scripts included the Corleone family being led by Michael's son Anthony, battling the CIA, Castro's Cuban government, or South American drug cartels. A 1978 draft by Mario Puzo dealt with Anthony Corleone being recruited by the CIA to assassinate a Latin American dictator. Dean Riesner also wrote a draft based on Puzo's ideas. Drafts were also written by Paramount producers Michael Eisner and Don Simpson. The film was scheduled for a Christmas 1980 release date. These scripts were discarded when Coppola decided to work on the script with Puzo. But Coppola eventually abandoned the project. Puzo wrote another script in 1986 with producer Nicholas Gage that featured Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini while showing the early life of the young Sonny Corleone. Paramount considered directors Martin Scorsese, Sidney Lumet, Costa-Gavras, Alan J. Pakula, Robert Benton, Michael Cimino and Michael Mann. At one point they were even close to signing Sylvester Stallone to direct and star in the film.
9: In “Oldboy“, four live octopodes were eaten for the scene with Dae-su in the sushi bar, a scene which provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. When the film won the Grand Prix at Cannes, the director thanked the octopodes along with the cast and crew.

Throughout “The Departed“, Martin Scorsese used X's mostly shown in the background to mark characters for death; examples include shots of Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the elevator before his death. Queenan (Martin Sheen) falling to his death (on the building's glass windows as Queenan falls to the ground), and Sullivan (Matt Damon) in his office discussing the flow of information with Jack Nicholson's Costello (the X is created by the light shining through the window). This is a homage to Howard Hawks' classic film “Scarface” (1932).

On Thursday Night, General Manager Todd Kelman welcomed back Neil Francis as bench coach to the club he has been a part of for nearly 20 years. Francis also explained his new role as Director of Hockey Operations, a role that will see him working closely with the coach on player recruitment and team management throughout the season.
Francis announced that Andrew Lord would be the player coach for the Devils for the upcoming season and that he was already working away on building his team.
The appointment of Andrew Lord means that Dave Whistle will not be back as Head Coach next season. Kelman who won 3 championships playing under Whistle, first in Bracknell then in Belfast, said it was a very tough decision but one that fits with the plan for the team this season.
“The rebuilding process requires a lot of changes and this was one that we felt was necessary to ensure we had the best opportunity to improve the on ice product,” explained Kelman.
“At this time, we wanted to ensure that our money was spent on the ice and although this was a very tough decision, it was one that had to be made.”
“I obviously hope Dave lands on his feet, which I am sure he will. He is a great coach and has had a lot of success in UK hockey and we wish him well.”

Bernie Sanders, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and independent senator from Vermont, said Monday that the country's leaders "are going to have to engage in serious discussion" to further prevent mass killings, including last week's incident at Umpqua Community College in Oregon.
"Like the rest of the nation, I am appalled by gun violence in our country and the mass shootings in our churches and colleges," Sanders said in a statement. "While there is no simple fix, that does not mean we should do nothing. The status quo clearly is not working and people on both sides of this issue cannot simply continue shouting at each other. Nobody wants more mass killings and serious people are going to have to engage in serious discussion."
Sanders, who touted his "D-minus" rating by the NRA in his statement, said America needs to take "very concrete steps ... to lessen the number of tragedies and to make those that happen less lethal."
He said some of his proposals are backed by the majority of law-abiding gun owners, including strengthening the instant background check system, closing the gun show loophole that lets unlicensed gun dealers sell weapons to people who wouldn't pass a background check and banning semi-automatic assault weapons "which are designed strictly for killing human beings."
Sanders added that there need to be reforms to the country's mental health system.
"We must recognize that our mental health system is seriously broken. While there has been much talk about mental health parity in our health care system, we are not even close to achieving it," he said. "It's past time for a serious discussion about identifying, intervening and treating mental illness and ensuring access to care."
While Sanders lacked specifics, his campaign is formulating "a comprehensive package of measures to address gun violence."
Sanders' stance on gun control came hours after Hillary Clinton, the 2016 frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination and ex-secretary of state, unveiled her own gun control platform. Clinton and Sanders are virtually in agreement on the issue.

"Captain America: Civil War" will feature new details on Martin Freeman's character, The Hulk and Pepper Potts added to the film and a new MCU supercut trailer.
YouTube username MCUExchange posted a compilation trailer from past Marvel Cinematic Universe films showcasing certain events which will lead to "Captain America: Civil War. The video features several destructions from various cities like the Chitauri invasion in New York during the "Avengers" movie, the Dark Elves invaded London in "Thor: The Dark World", Sokovia being destroyed in "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and many more.

Various clips cited different opinions from certain MCU characters that the power displayed by the Avengers, Chitauri and other super powered being cause a huge amount of unwanted destruction and grief. Even certain scenes from MCU TV series like "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." and "Jessica Jones" preached the dangers that super powered beings like the Inhumans or other "gifted" individuals and vigilantes are capable of both salvation and at the same time destruction.
All of thsi events will lead to the main plot of "Captain America: Civil War" as Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and his Avengers team fight Tony Stark/iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and his own team in a war that determines the fate of Avengers and the super powered community when "the Accords" are in effect.
In other news, "Iron Man 3" star Gwyneth Paltrow will be returning to the role of Pepper Potts in "Captain America: Civil War as the latest issue of Empire Magazine revealed that Paltrow has been doing reshoots for the film, and will have "small yet key" role during the events of "Civil War", TheWrap reported
Empire Magazine further revealed Martin Freeman's mysterious role in "Captain America: Civil War" as "The Hobbit" star will be playing United States Government agent Everett Ross, who also acts as the liason for the African nation ofr Wakanda, home to King T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Ross will also be working with former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent turned CSI Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp).
Lastly, co-star Anthony Mackie teased that Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) will likely be featured in "Captain America: Civil War" as Mackie accidentally name dropped his name during an interview with the BBC Radio 1. It is speculated that Mackie was not aware that Ruffalo was not included in the film or that directors Anthony and Joe Russo did not "cut" the Hulk at all in the film, ScreenCrush reported. Bruce Banner will be featured in "Thor: Ragnarok) joining his fellow Avengers teammate Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) in saving Asgard.
"Captain America: Civil War" will be release in cinemas on May 6.
Screen Time Reality Check — For Kids And Parents
'Tis the day after Christmas and all through the house many kids aren't stirring... They're joyfully lost in their new smartphones, tablets or smart TVs.
And it's likely mom and dad are a little digitally distracted too.
In many households, screens are omnipresent. That reality has some big implications for children. Researchers, for example, have found language delays in those who watch more television.
So what are parents and caregivers to do? That question can be tricky to answer, says Amanda Lenhart, who studies how families use technology at The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
"The thing about parenting today with digital technology is that you don't have your own experience to go back to and look at," Lenhart recently told NPR's All Things Considered. "When you were 10, there probably weren't cellphones. Parents think it's kind of a brave new world, and it changes so fast."
For guidance on screen time, parents often turn to the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 2016, the group pulled back from its longstanding recommendation of no screen time for children under 2 years.
The AAP stance is now more nuanced. For babies under 18 months, screen time is still discouraged, except for things like Skype or FaceTime calls with grandma. The big change in thinking is around children aged 18 to 24 months. Instead of urging an outright ban, the pediatricians' group suggests parents who want to introduce screen time do so with high-quality programming, viewed in small quantities alongside their children. That recommendation holds for children 2 to 5 years old, limited to less than an hour a day.
Advice from the AAP and others in the education world emphasizes parent participation in the digital lives of children — to help kids tap into what's fun and creative, and not just use a device as a quick babysitter. Putting that advice into practice is not always so easy though. And as kids get older, the challenges get more complex. The NPR Ed team heard a lot about that when we gathered a group of parents at an NPR Generation Listen event this year in New York City.
"If I can just like get them out the door with their pants on, [it] feels like we've won the morning," said participant Justin Ruben about his two kids — aged 3 and 7. "I feel overwhelmed at the prospect of trying to curate my kid's digital experience."
Lenhart, who studies how families use technology, can relate. She has four daughters and says even she has a hard time following the recommendations: "We get all these great ideas from literature, but then putting it into practice is nearly impossible or is really, really difficult, given the modern lives that we lead — whether it's that your kids won't touch a carrot from 20 feet away or that you really just need 25 minutes and so you put your kids in front a screen so you can get that time."
And to complicate matters further — it isn't just kids' screen time that parents need to think about. A recent study by Common Sense Media found that parents spend, on average, almost nine and a half hours a day in front of a screen. And nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they think they're modeling good media and watching habits for their kids.
Parents, it seems, need a little screen time reality check too, says Common Sense Media founder and CEO James Steyer. His bottom line for them: Try to model moderation, set some house rules and talk about device use with your kids.
"As a parent, you are your child's most important role model," Steyer says. "How you use media, how you use technology and how much you use it, is critically important."
In an exclusive interview with NY1 Political Anchor Errol Louis, Mayor Bill de Blasio delivered a withering critique of Governor Andrew Cuomo, saying that his "lack of leadership" got in the way of the city's business during this year's legislative session.
"What I found was, he engaged in his own sense of strategies, his own political machinations, and what we've often seen is, if someone disagrees with him openly, some kind of revenge or vendetta follows," de Blasio said of the governor.
"I don't believe the Assembly had a real working partner in the governor or the Senate in terms of getting things done for the people of this city and, in many cases, the people of this state."
"And I want to hasten to say there was some interesting back and forth last week, and some unnamed sources well-placed in the Cuomo administration had a few things to say. I'm here in front of you on record saying what I believe," de Blasio tells Louis.
"And what I believe here is the governor worked with the Senate in some cases to inhibit the work of the Assembly, to inhibit the agenda that New York City put forward."
De Blasio also said he was confounded by Cuomo's resistance to his proposed changes to the 421-a tax credit program for developers.
"I find that to be a lack of leadership because here was an opportunity actually to get something done for people," de Blasio said.
"In my many efforts to find some common ground, suspiciously, it seemed that every good idea got rejected or manipulated," the mayor said of his talks with the governor.
De Blasio also said that the governor is dominated by "transactional" politics.
"I think he believes deeply in the transactional model, and I think he needs to transcend that model if he wants to be a more effective leader," de Blasio said of the governor.
In response to the mayor's interview on Inside City Hall, the mayor's communications director, Melissa DeRosa, issued a statement that reads, "For those new to the process, it takes coalition building and compromise to get things done in government. We wish the Mayor well on his vacation."
House Democrats on Wednesday announced that they are turning to another tool in their quest to see President Trump's tax returns.
Democrats are starting a “discharge petition” on a bill that would require Trump and future presidents and presidential nominees to disclose their returns. Bills can be brought to the House floor for a vote with discharge petitions if they are signed by a majority of House members.
Under the bill, offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), presidents would have to disclose their three most recent years of tax returns to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). Presidential nominees would have to provide their three most recent years of tax returns to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

If presidents or nominees fail to take those actions, the OGE and FEC would request the returns from the Treasury Department and make them publicly available.
The petition faces long odds in the House, where Democrats hold a minority of seats. So far, only two GOP lawmakers have cosponsored the bill: Reps. Mark Sanford (S.C.) and Justin Amash Justin AmashHouse to push back at Trump on border Ex-GOP lawmakers urge Republicans to block Trump's emergency declaration This week: Congress, Trump set for showdown on emergency declaration MORE (Mich.). Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) has joined onto other Democratic efforts on Trump's tax returns.
But Eshoo said in a news conference that she's optimistic that more Republicans will support the effort.
“I think it's going to grow because it's meritorious,” she said. “I am hopeful that Republicans will see the light.”
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that tax returns don't tell the public everything, but “they are a key that opens the door to so much information.” She said she's particularly concerned about any information that may show links between Trump and Russia and China.
The last successful discharge petition occurred in 2015, when a bipartisan group of lawmakers used the tool to force a vote on a bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.
The petition on Eshoo's bill is the latest of many efforts that Democrats have taken on Trump's tax returns in the last several weeks, none of which has been successful. Democrats have been bringing up the matter to highlight the issue and to force Republicans to take tough votes.
In each of the last six weeks, Democrats have offered resolutions on the floor directing the House to request Trump's tax returns. The House Ways and Means Committee has also taken several votes on the topic.
Lawmakers have also sent letters to Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradySmaller tax refunds put GOP on defensive Key author of GOP tax law joins Ernst and Young Lawmakers beat lobbyists at charity hockey game MORE (R-Texas) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchThe FDA crackdown on dietary supplements is inadequate Orrin Hatch Foundation seeking a million in taxpayer money to fund new center in his honor Mitch McConnell has shown the nation his version of power grab MORE (R-Utah), urging them to request Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department. Under federal tax law, the chairman of those committees can ask for tax returns so that they can be reviewed in a closed session.
Hatch and Brady have said that it would be an inappropriate use of their authority to request Trump's tax returns.
Having some famous names in your family tree certainly has its advantages. Just ask Jaden Smith, Brooklyn Beckham, or Rocco Ritchie—all of whom are making waves on the fashion scene and all of whom also happen to have some A-list pedigree. (Or just ask any Trump child—except Tiffany.) While these sorts of dynasties tend to be entertainment-oriented, the political sphere has officially entered the fray with the mega modeling agency IMG's latest get, Tyler Clinton, a.k.a. nephew of Bill and Hillary.
At five-eleven-and-a-half inches tall, with a 30-inch waist and murky age (Radar said 22 last November, while US Weekly clocked him in at 18 back in July), Clinton—who is the son of former president Bill's brother Roger—seems primed for a career fronting campaigns for brands like J.Crew and Abercrombie & Fitch (especially ones reminiscent of those sexy Bruce Weber years), and we know that he's not just all-American in appearance—he's got patriotism built into his genes. And he comes with a built-in bad-boy reputation!

Continued from yesterday.
For a man who's such an indisputable master of language, Moore seems to be surprisingly unconscious of how his own words reveal aspects of his character.
If a fictional character said writers should find their own voice, then indirectly used as a contrary example a rival's work that's kind of defined by that rival finding his own voice… I'd like to think any thoughtful reader would recognize that the emotional stakes of the rivalry got in the way of the intellectual point.
If a fictional writer pretended not to have read a decade of his own work, which didn't achieve the same critical and commercial success as his earlier work, in order to dismiss everything since that same earlier work… I'd certainly suspect no small amount of insecurity at play.
If this fictional writer then went on to talk about how these rivals' audiences, many members of which are also this fictional writer's own readers, are “emotionally subnormal”… well, that's an odd phrase, and I'd suspect something was going on, even beyond the obvious resentment and bitterness. For instance, that the speaker was worried, at least in some part of himself, that he was “emotionally subnormal” — and perhaps that this was something, given the conversation, that he worried had played a role in the direction his own career had gone.
But I'm not a psychiatrist. I can only tell you what a character saying this would mean.
Still, it's hard not to read a certain insecurity into all of this. It can be a shocking insecurity, at least to outsiders. Because Moore's place in comics history couldn't be more secure. He's a titan. Even his minor works are studied, analyzed, and referenced in new stories. Even Moore's strongest critics admit his brilliance and his influence. What Moore seems to interpret as imitation or plagiarism is actually a reflection of his own status. In the same way, Moore might not like that DC did prequels to Watchmen, but it did so because Watchmen is so revered.
In other words, Moore's in a position to be as generous in his treatment of others. He can say, “I'm sure there are many talented people working in super-hero comics today, but their work doesn't speak to me, personally. Maybe I'm old, but I don't think they mean what they used to mean.” His entire quote on super-heroes can pick up from there. Objectively, there seems to be zero reason for Moore to not take the high road.
Unless, of course, you think Moore's upset that, despite being so brilliant and having accomplished so much, he didn't reap the rewards. People named Morrison and Johns and Hickman and Aaron dominate the sales charts — people Moore might think aren't as smart or as accomplished. Meanwhile, Moore's paid an immense price for his moral stances over the years. I assume Moore's not poor, but he walked away from the Big Two, and he's burned a lot of bridges in Hollywood. He's reportedly burned a lot of friendships too. And just because you feel compelled to say “fuck you” to the Big Two, or to Hollywood, or to people, and have the courage to act on this, doesn't mean there's not an emotional remainder.
Saying “fuck you” and staying away are one thing, as anyone who's gotten out a bad relationship knows. Saying “fuck you” in your heart is another.
Now, I don't know about any of this about Alan Moore. I'm only guessing, based on my own understanding of character. And based, if I'm being honest, on my own experience as someone palpably aware of my own brilliance from an early age. That changes you. Warps you, perhaps. There isn't a year that's gone by, since my teens, when I didn't feel anything I'd attained measured up to the expectations I'd set for myself as a child. I'm still inclined to think, when someone can't follow logic, “You know I'm smarter than you, right?” It's an ugly thought, but it's there. I've gotten a lot better about all of this, but I can tell you from personal experience that the ivory towers of academia are filled with people — men, especially — who grew up thinking they were going to be president, an expectation for which no amount of degrees and books can ever quite compensate. Moore's not an academic, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of the same dynamics applied.
I'd like to give Alan Moore a hug. In all seriousness. Big beard and all.
I don't suppose it would change anything. I don't suppose for a second he'd see me as a comrade, or an intellectual equal, or an intellectual inheritor. I don't suppose, either, that this gesture would melt away any particular insecurities.
But still, I'd like to tell him he's changed the world. That he made a difference in my life and aided my own development, not only in terms of writing but politically and ethically. And that there are millions like me. Those who grew up pouring over his words have taken over comics, and we're taking over academia too. Few people in the history of the world have moved as many minds or hearts.
No, he's not alone in these things, and that's okay. Much the same praise can be said of Grant Morrison, who happens to have more directly changed my own life for the better, in ways he may never fully understand. Both I and Sequart — and more people in comics and comics criticism than the public may ever know — owe a great deal to Grant's kindness. It's his if he wants one, but Grant doesn't seem like he needs a hug nearly as much.
Calling your own fans “emotionally subnormal” because they're still reading the genre you helped make them love? That guy needs a hug.
Unfortunately, all of this language like “emotionally subnormal” — language about not reading comics since Watchmen, and about Grant Morrison and Geoff Johns — gets in the way of Moore's points about super-heroes.
And here's the thing: underneath all the imprecision, all the authorial self-fashioning and the accompanying psychological carnival, Moore's points about super-heroes aren't wrong.
Continued Monday, with a look at Moore's points about the super-hero genre.

Emo is about halfway between two bridges to the United States, one at Fort Frances (approximately a 30-minute drive) and the other at Rainy River (about 40 minutes by road). It is identified in many cycling resources as an excellent overnight stopping point because of the facilities (shelter, showers and bathrooms) available in the waterfront park.
There are many volunteer groups and a strong sense of community in Emo. In Emo's Lion's Park, a picturesque riverfront area, a new play structure was funded through volunteer fundraising efforts, and a 2005-2006 fiscal year grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation [1]. The park is also home to the Emo Spray Park, a $500,000 community-driven project completed in July 2010. A safe way for kids to engage in water play, the spray park attracts thousands of visitors in the summertime.
The Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps 144 Fort Frances meet in Emo, led by Lieutenant Terry Newman until its disbandment due to lack of interest in 2011.
The spring brings the opening of the walleye fishing season, and the annual Emo Walleye Classic.
The Emo Speedway draws race participants and fans from the central United States, Northwestern Ontario and Manitoba. The track is a 600-metre, high-banked dirt oval track which operates every Saturday from May through Mid-September.
Emo is also home to five different religious denominations, including Knox United Church of Canada,[6] as well as Baptist, Catholic, Anglican and Christian Reformed churches.
Initially located in private homes of local women, the town library was moved to the schoolhouse in 1940 and to its own building in the 50s.

Emo Walleye Classic [ edit ]
The Emo Walleye Classic is a two-day catch and release fishing tournament held annually in Emo, during the final week of May each year.[10] It takes place on the Rainy River, which marks the border between Minnesota and Ontario.
Upwards of sixty Canadian and American teams of two participate each year, each paying a participation fee ($500 in 2015). An organizing committee and many local volunteers assist at the event, and many local businesses and individuals sponsor the event.[10]
On each morning of the tournament, anglers head upstream and downstream from the Emo waterfront to their chosen fishing spots. The weigh-ins are held in the evenings at the Emo/LaVallee Community Centre where results are posted live. On the final day of the tournament, the top ten teams from day one are brought into the arena with their boats.
Classic history [ edit ]
The tournament began in 2002 with forty-four participating teams, and has grown since then, with thirty-eight teams competing in 2013. The first winners were Harvey Cochrane and Oliver Gibbons who won as a result of the leading team having three fish over the legal size. In 2008 Doug McBride of Devlin, Ontario and Steve Ballan of Fort Frances, Ontario became the first team to win the tournament twice.[10]

More than 1,600 cannabis plants seized in Riverstone warehouse raid
Updated
Three men have been arrested after police seized more than 1,600 cannabis plants from a warehouse in Sydney's north-west - the largest hydroponic haul in the state's history.
Police raided the property on Victoria Street in Riverstone and found what they said was $6 million worth of the plants growing in a hydroponic set-up.
Three men were arrested at the scene and taken to Quakers Hill police station, where police said they were assisting officers with their inquiries.
Chief Inspector Graeme Wright said police expected to charge the three men - aged 20, 36, 30 - with cultivating a commercial amount of cannabis.
"To the best of my knowledge, this is the largest seizure that has actually occurred with NSW, of plants that are grown in this method," Chief Inspector Wright said.
He said more drugs had been seized grown in other ways, but this was the largest amount found to be grown hydroponically.
Chief Inspector Wright said the warehouse was split up into 28 rooms.
"Each room is at a different stage of growing," Chief Inspector Wright said.
"Inside they're all set up with lights and a watering system and it's very, very sophisticated. In my opinion this is an expert operation."
He said police have been watching the site since December and had not seen any legal business activity happening in the warehouse.
"I haven't got any evidence of who they were supplying to, but from the scale of the amount of plants that they're cultivating, it would be fairly substantial."
Chief Inspector Wright said this was one of the more sophisticated set-ups that he had seen.
"An investigation with this result will obviously have an impact to the supply of cannabis in this area."
He said no other arrests were expected at this stage, but officers would continue to investigate.
"If anyone has any information, we would like them to come forward."
He said police were dismantling the operation and the cannabis would be taken away and burnt.

DES MOINES, Iowa – Even when one of them isn't in the NCAA tournament, and the other is 600 miles away preparing to start its run, it's always about Kentucky and Louisville's bitter rivalry, apparently.
During a radio appearance on ESPN's Mike and Mike Tuesday, Cardinals coach Rick Pitino roped the Wildcats into an answer about what he'll tell NCAA investigators when they interview him about U of L's scandal involving strippers and sex for players and recruits.
“If I could just get Andre McGee (his former assistant accused of arranging the parties) in a room for 10 minutes, I'd say, ‘Why? Why would you do this? What purpose did it serve? We didn't need this to get recruits. You know we're not Kentucky where we're recruiting the one-and-dones,” Pitino said. “We're recruiting the Russ Smiths of the world. He's a two-star athlete who becomes a first-team college All-American.”
GAME PREVIEW: Starting lineups, TV info, stats, storylines
Of course, incoming U of L freshman V.J. King is a five-star recruit, as was Antonio Blakeney, who eventually signed with LSU but was one of the prospects alleged to have been entertained by strippers at McGee's request. So what did UK coach John Calipari make of Pitino's comments?
“I would really rather not respond,” Calipari said Wednesday. “I don't know exactly what you're talking about. They run a terrific program. He's a terrific coach. He is a Hall of Famer. We're in the same state (so) sometimes you've got to rub elbows; sometimes you've got to throw elbows. But I respect him.”
Maybe so, but Calipari couldn't resist taking a jab at Pitino earlier in the press conference. Asked to recount some of his early NCAA tournament memories, he noted a loss to Pitino's Cats in 1992, which “led to Christian Laettner's catch against Kentucky, when Rick should've had the guy on the ball and he took the guy off the ball and they throw it deep and he turns and scores.”
As deep a wound as that left on UK fans, Calipari is perhaps the only man on the planet who could bring it up – and only because he used it to dig at Pitino. Ah, rivalries.

Aerogels are among the world's lightest materials. Graphene aerogel, a record holder in that category, is so light that a large block of it wouldn't make a dent on a tiny ball of cotton. Water is about one thousand times more dense. The minimal density of aerogels allows for a number of possible applications, researchers have found, ranging from soaking up oil spills to “invisibility” cloaks.
Now, scientists from State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo and Kansas State University report in the journal Small that they have found a way to 3D print graphene aerogel, which has only been used in lab prototypes. This technology will make the material much easier to use, and open it, and hopefully other aerogel materials, up to wider applications.
Graphene is just a single layer of carbon atoms. Since it was isolated for the first time in 2004, it has been touted as a wonder material for its strength, pliability and conductivity. Aerogel is essentially a gel where the liquid is replaced by air. Graphene aerogel is known to be highly compressible (so it can bear pressure without breaking apart) and highly conductive (so it can carry electricity efficiently). The very structure of the material that gives it these properties, however, makes it difficult to manufacture using 3D printing technology.
Typically, to 3D print aerogel, the core material is mixed with other ingredients, such as a polymer, so that it can be pushed out using inkjet printers. Once the structure is made, the polymer is removed by a chemical process. In the case of graphene aerogel, however, doing this destroys its delicate structure.
SUNY Buffalo and Kansas State University researchers came up with a solution. They mixed graphene oxide—graphene with extra oxygen atoms—with water and deposited layers on a surface at -25°C. This instantly froze each layer, and allowed the undisrupted construction of the aerogel, with ice as its support.
Once this process was completed, the ice was removed using liquid nitrogen in a “freeze drying” technique. This expelled the water without damaging the microstructure. The material was then heated to remove oxygen atoms, which left only graphene in the aerogel. The resulting solid had densities ranging from 0.5 kg per cubic meter to 10 kg per cubic meter. The lightest aerogel ever produced is about 0.16 kg per cubic meter (compared to 1,000 kg per cubic meter for water).
3D printing of materials is becoming crucial for translating technology into industrial applications. 3D printers create objects in the exact shape and form as needed, which helps with rapid prototyping and adoption of new technologies. For instance, 3D printing has helped the aerospace industry to innovate more quickly on new models but also build parts for old models that are no longer being manufactured.
SUNY Buffalo and Kansas State University researchers are now looking to expand their 3D printing technology to build other types of aerogels.

The new feature, Touch to Search, appears to be hitting devices thanks to a server-side update from Google, but it isn't appearing on all devices just yet. Touch to Search allows users to highlight text and be shown additional search results from Google, just as you would if you had searched the term from Google Search.
This feature is similar in nature to Google's upcoming Now on Tap functionality, but this functionality only works within Chrome, while Now on Tap will work system wide. Google is a bit vague when describing the new functionality to users, with an on screen prompt reading:
Q: Will Pat Riley and Micky Arison keep the team intact (meaning Mario Chalmers and Chris Andersen) and pay the tax if Miami is deemed a title contender this year? -- John, Manila, Philippines.
A: That's what they've said from the start, that they would pay above and beyond when contending for a championship. But when is that determination made, since one essentially will have to be made by midseason when it comes to the tax and trading deadline? Right now, I don't think you can put the Heat among the NBA's elite, when considering the Cavaliers, Spurs, Warriors, Clippers and even Rockets. But do you consider a team a "contender" if it begins to chart a course toward the conference finals? Is that enough to then move into the "repeater" tax going forward? Right now, there simply are too many questions about Chris Bosh's health, Dwyane Wade's endurance, Hassan Whiteside's comportment and even Justise Winslow's readiness, to blindly consider another piece of Larry O'Brien hardware. So I think you wait, assess, and then determine a drop-dead date to determine "contention," a date that still gives you enough time and flexibility to deal with the realities of the luxury tax (and, therefore, the fates of Chalmers, Birdman and perhaps others on the current roster going forward).
Q: I think the team now is lacking at guard, especially a qualified backup point guard, isn't it? -- Lin, Guangzhou, China.
A: Not if Chalmers stays. Look, I can appreciate the concerns when Chalmers was the starter, and some of the erratic play. But we're talking a reserve role behind Goran Dragic, on a team that probably will have Dwyane Wade often handling. With his defensive disruptiveness, Chalmers still has value. And when put in stand-still spot-up situations still can be a reliable 3-point shooter. When evaluating Chalmers, judge him against other backup point guards. I'm just not sure, with the Heat's salary situation, you're going to find a greater value at the position. Now, if Josh Richardson or Tyler Johnson quickly emerge, that's another story.
Q: Ira, what's the worry with dealing Rio? Miami wins in the end. We get rid of his salary and further help the tax issue. We already have young guys that could do better than him. Josh is a 3-and-D PG and Tyler is explosive. Worst case is that Wade plays backup PG minutes. No problem for us, so what is the worry and why isn't he dealt yet? -- Mak, Toronto.
A: Because, as stated above (and even for the reasons mentioned above that), Chalmers, at this moment, is a better-tested option behind Dragic (and for the games he might miss), than Richardson or Johnson. So if you are in win-now mode, and if you're trying attempting to define whether you are a "contender," then I think you line up your best available option at every rotation spot.
The hanafuda card deck has twelve suits, each named for a month and an associated flower (or flowerlike plant) . The seasonal flowers have long histories in poetry and art, often tracing back to Heian Japan or Táng China, and are rich in folklore and trivia. A large part of the appeal of hanafuda for me is the contrast drawn by such poetic themes in a gambling game of the yakuza. The cards pop now and then in popular culture, as in the moveset of Kibagami Genjūrō from the fighting game Samurai Spirits , or the protagonist of female yakuza sexploitation flicks Inoshika Ochō , or in the Ino-Shika-Chō team in Naruto , &c.
These are their flowers.
January: 松 matsu , pine
Photo by Ruiwen Chen. Being a winter-resistant evergreen, the pine is an auspicious symbol of longevity. The Chinese grouped it with two other plants that endure beautifully in winter, bamboo and plum blossoms; together they make the Three Friends of Winter (歲寒三友 suìhán sānyǒu/saikan-no-san'yu). In Japanese culture this combination of pine, bamboo and plum (松竹梅 shō-chiku-bai) became an important decorative motif; they're also auspiciously tied to gates in the New Year festivities, and they're used as a grading system (as symbols for high-, middle- and low-rank). The crane of the first card has a similar set of associations: longevity and New Year. Cranes often rest atop high pines in Japanese painting, but they can't climb trees in real life; they probably were confused with tree-loving storks. The red poem doesn't say *anoyoroshi but akayoroshi; the second character is a hentaigana character for “ka”. The meaning, however, is disputed (Nintendō's website says, perhaps in jest, that it's currently under research). One possible derivation is 明らかに良い akiraka ni yoi, “clearly good”.
February: 梅 ume , plum
Photo by Kempei. Prunus mume, the Japanese apricot or Chinese plum. Another of the Friends of Winter loved in Chinese art. The fruit is used for umeboshi and umezuke pickled plums (often dyed with red shiso) – and also umeshu, the delicious fruit liquor. Being the first flower to blossom still during winter, it's a symbol of perseverance, strength, and of the arrival of spring. Often pictured as red, though the real flowers range from white to pale rose to a lush pink. Long associated with the bush warbler (uguisu) (depicted in the animal card), the cry of which was also considered to be a sign of the arrival of spring.
March: 桜 sakura , cherry blossoms
Photo by Penta. A symbol of the transience of things (mono no aware) since they die (fall) while still beautiful. A standard symbol of spring, and often called a symbol of Japan. Very similar to the peach flower; cherry blossoms can be distinguished by distinctive cuts in the petal tips. The cultivated flower tree doesn't produce edible fruit, devoting all its energies to blossoming. In the Nara period the word hana “flower”, by itself, indicated the plum blossom; tastes shifted progressively, and by the Middle Ages the cherry had won the word. Hanami, the custom of “flower viewing”, changed accordingly. The curtain of the first card is hiding a flower-viewing party. The poem strip says “Miyoshino”, thought to refer to a place in Nara famous for its cherry blossoms.
April: 藤 fuji , wisteria
Photo by Masao. Thanks to the prestige and power of the Heian-era aristocratic Fujiwara (“Wisteria Plains”) clan, the character 藤 (fuji) is still a very popular component of family names, including the most used in Japan, Satō 佐藤. The flower is a valued subject of art and nature observation, and an important motif in Heian literature (onwards). It makes one think of Genji and courtly elegance. The hototogisu cuckoo is said in the Man'yōshū to sing from the season of wisterias. The old “April”, i.e. the fourth lunar month, was named uzuki, after the small, white deutzia flowers (u-no-hana)—or possibly the other way around. In any case hanafuda cards don't use the deutzia.
May: 菖蒲 ayame , iris
Photo by autan. A purple water flower. It's associated in poetry with summer, and in art with the eight-plank bridge (yatsuhashi)—a kind of low, zig-zag bridge often built over iris marshes in gardens, in reference to an episode in the Ise Monogatari (an actual yatsuhashi can be in fact longer than eight planks).
June: 牡丹 botan , peony
Photo by ks-studio. A flower admired since Táng China, an admiration which also spread to Heian Japan (when, judging from the Makura no Sōshi, it was considered to contribute to a Chinese atmosphere). In the arts a floral arabesque pattern (botan karakusa) became popular, spreading quickly, and many variations were devised.
July: 萩 hagi , bush clover
Photo by usagi205. The bush clover or lespedeza is one of the Seven Grasses of Autumn (aki no nanakusa), as first defined in the Man'yōshū by Yamanoe no Okura. The seven would go on to become subjects in poetry, ceramic, textiles &c., and of the group, the bush clover was the most praised in the Man'yōshū. Together with silver grass (susuki) and dumplings (dango), it's offered to the moon in harvest-moon viewing festivals (tsukimi).
August: 芒 susuki , silver grass
Photo by chūnen oji-san. Also translated as Chinese silver grass, pampas grass, Eulalia grass, maiden grass &c., and called the “tail flower” (obana) for its resemblance to an animal's tail. Another of the Seven Grasses of Autumn, and paired with the bush clover as decoration and offering in moon-vieweing festivals. In Okinawa, the leaves are knotted as talismans against evil. The hanafuda suit is also called “baldie” (bōzu) for obvious reasons.
September: 菊 kiku , chrysanthemum
Photo by West Zest. Symbol of the Japanese Throne and crest (mon) of the Imperial Family; also a motif in many other family crests. Metonimically, a symbol of Japan. The Chrysanthemum Festival (chōyō), celebrated in the 9th day of the 9th month, originated as a religious observance in China to ward off the excess energy of the day—the number 9 being considered particularly yáng (thus the name, “piled yáng”). One of several cleansing practices was to drink chrysanthemum saké (kikuzake). The Heian nobles thought it all very poetic and turned the festival into an elegant celebration, with banquets and singing.
October: 紅葉 momiji , maple leaves
Photo by Kanops. By far the favourite of autumn, a main topic of poetry since forever, and target of “red leaf hunting” (momijigari)—the practice of traveling to see the autumn colors. The word momiji often refers to the colored leaves more than to the maple plant itself. It's associated with the deer, to the point that venison was called maple meat (momiji-niku). The cry of a lone deer is thought to deepen the feeling of solitute (sabi) typical of autumn.
November: 柳 yanagi , willow
Photo by Masao. Perhaps because it likes dampness and grows next to water bodies, the tree is associated with rain, and the hanafuda suit can be called “rain” (ame) instead of “willow”. The bark and leaves contain salicin, a component of aspirin, and have long been used as pain and fever medicine worldwide, Japan included. There are a number of folkloric stories and traditions about spirits living inside of or being reborn as willow trees. Saigyō has a famous tanka about resting under a willow tree, which inspired the Nō play Yugyō Yanagi, in which a wandering priest meet the spirit of Saigyō's willow. Bashō, a Saigyō fan, would later seek the same willow and gleefully rest under it, waxing poetic about the experience. Pictured in the first card is Ono-no-Michikaze, one of the Three Great Names of kana calligraphy. It's said that he was inspired to persevere on the path when he saw a jumping frog trying to reach a willow branch. I don't know what's the association with the swallow (tsubame) of the second card, other than the flowing tails of tree and bird. There's something disturbing in the abstract design of the kasu card for this month. It's called a “demon hitting drums in the rain” (as in thunder) or a “devil's card” (onifuda), and some decks picture it literally as such. In the common rules it's just another low-value kasu, but in some game variants it's used as a joker-like wildcard.
December: 桐 kiri , paulownia
Photo by Tony Rodd. Considered to be a holy tree in Shintoism. There's a folkloric tidbit teaching that the phoenix bird (hō-ō) will only land on the paulownia tree, and then again only if a wise ruler rules the land. The light, high-quality wood is prized for carving, furniture and instrument-making, especially for the koto. Copyright information and other unpoetic data is usually printed in the last three cards, as in this standard Nintendō 任天堂 deck.

The Shas party is pushing forward with a proposal that would make it illegal to hold pluralistic prayer services at the Western Wall plaza, calling for the bill to face a ministerial vote as early as Sunday.
The proposed law would impose penalties of six months' imprisonment or a fine of NIS 10,000 ($2,600) on anyone who holds a mixed-gender service or women's Torah readings, and women who don a prayer shawl or phylacteries, at any area of the Western Wall, even those that had not been traditionally set aside for prayer.
In its description of the bill, the ultra-Orthodox party said it was meant to prevent actions, including “religious ceremonies,” that “do not fit the custom of the place, which would offend the congregation that prays there.”

Shas has asked for the bill to face a vote at Sunday's Ministerial Committee for Legislation, which decides government policy on legislative proposals and could guarantee coalition support for the measure. The party is said to expect other coalition members to support the bill.
“We supported an increased tax on third homes, banning the muezzin call and other laws because it was important to our coalition partners. We expect them to support this even if it's not their preference,” a party source told the Walla news site.
The proposal would define the entire area as a holy site governed under the same definitions of religious practice and law set by Israel's rabbinic courts and the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Prayer services would thus be limited solely to state-approved Orthodox practice.
Should it pass into law, it would effectively end the negotiated agreement passed by the cabinet almost a year ago that approved the construction of an egalitarian prayer plaza alongside the Orthodox-controlled one at the holy site.
The compromise called for a permanent prayer platform to be built along the southern end of the Western Wall in part of the Davidson Archaeological Park, otherwise known as Robinson's Arch. There is currently a smaller, temporary prayer platform set up at the site.
In September, the High Court of Justice called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to implement the compromise agreement allowing for egalitarian services and non-Orthodox prayer at the Western Wall, noting that it had already passed as a cabinet decision.
Ahead of a further hearing set for next week, the Chief Rabbinate will on Friday present a petition to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit claiming that the High Court does not have jurisdiction over the Western Wall, Army Radio reported Thursday.
According to the opinion written by the rabbinate's chief legal adviser Harel Goldberg, the courts are prevented from making decision pertaining to “holy sites” based on a British Mandate law dating to 1922. Goldberg claims that the law is still legally binding given that it was never nullified by Knesset legislation.
Despite gaining support from a number of Likud and Jewish Home MKs, the Shas proposal on the Western Wall is likely to be opposed by Netanyahu and Jewish Home chair Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who back the 2015 compromise, as well as religiously liberal ministers and lawmakers in the coalition, including in the Kulanu and Yisrael Beytenu factions. It is thought to stand little chance of making it into law.
Reform and Conservative leaders from both Israel and the US have rallied against the proposal, calling on Netanyahu to fulfill the compromise agreement and torpedo the bill.
When it was approved, the Robinson's Arch plan was heralded as a symbol of “Jewish unity” by many Diaspora leaders, but within days became the target of ultra-Orthodox ire and threatened to cause tension in Netanyahu's tenuous coalition. Its implementation has been frozen for the past year.
In March, Shas chair Aryeh Deri reportedly proclaimed that the Western Wall plan “is over.”
The deal was reached after three years of negotiations led by Jewish Agency chairman Natan Sharansky and then-outgoing cabinet secretary Avichai Mandelblit, who currently serves as Israel's attorney general. The negotiations included representatives of the Reform and Conservative movements, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which runs the site, and the Women of the Wall activist group, which has campaigned for egalitarian prayer to be permitted at the site.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: We're speaking to Spencer Ackerman of The Guardian. Last week, he published a story headlined “Bad Lieutenant: American Police Brutality, Exported from Chicago to Guantánamo.” The article looked at Richard Zuley, who used torture to extract confessions from minorities for years in Chicago and then went on to work at Guantánamo. This is a clip of Lathierial Boyd, one of the innocent men Zuley interrogated in Chicago.
LATHIERIAL BOYD: I was mounted to the wall and floor. I remained in that room through two lineups. And I remember I asked—after that second lineup, I asked Zuley if anybody had picked me out of the lineup, and he said no. And I said, “See, I told you. You got the wrong guy. I haven't done anything.” He smiled at me and said, “We're charging you anyway.”
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Lathierial Boyd served 23 years in prison before he was found to be wrongfully convicted. So, Spencer, can you talk more about Richard Zuley and how you came across his police record?
SPENCER ACKERMAN: Sure. The Guardian excerpted the Guantánamo Bay manuscript of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, whose interrogation at Guantánamo Bay is just one of the most brutal that we've ever known about thus far. And my editor asked me if I would go through the manuscript ahead of the excerpt and just see if there were any news stories we might want to do out of it. And one of the footnotes mentioned that in government reports and other sources, including a really fantastic piece of reporting by Jess Bravin of The Wall Street Journal, his 2013 book, The Terror Courts, the lead interrogator during the most intense torturous period of Slahi's interrogation was a Chicago police officer named Richard Zuley.
And I thought, “Well, I had never heard about a U.S. police officer being in any U.S. military or intelligence interrogation facility. What must his record in Chicago have been like?” and, from there, found some court cases, including Lathierial Boyd's federal civil rights case against Zuley, got in contact with his lawyer, found out about some more cases and started pulling records to find out what this guy's record in Chicago was. And we found some really ominous parallels between how he policed Chicago streets and what he did in Guantánamo Bay torture centers.
AMY GOODMAN: And what happened with Lathierial ultimately?
SPENCER ACKERMAN: Lathierial Boyd, after 23 years of being put in prison on a murder that there was never any physical evidence that he committed, was found in 2013 by an investigation from the Cook County state's attorney to have his conviction voided, as it was completely baseless, and they found there was no evidence that could justify keeping him in prison, even though he had served 23 years.
AMY GOODMAN: And the suit?
SPENCER ACKERMAN: And now, after he got out, they file—Lathierial Boyd and his attorney, Kathleen Zellner, filed a civil rights suit to try and get some kind of justice for Lathierial and, as well, try and create both more disclosure around the way Chicago police practices have operated, including Richard Zuley.
AMY GOODMAN: So, let's go back to one of Zuley's victims—this one, though, not in Chicago, in Guantánamo—Mohamedou Ould Slahi. During interrogations at Guantánamo, you report—approved then by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld—Slahi detailed the treatment in his memoir, which was just published. In this clip from The Guardian's video report about his case, we hear his lawyer Nancy Hollander and actor Dominic West reading from his diary.
NANCY HOLLANDER: Mohamedou was subjected to a whole list of torture techniques that had been approved by the secretary of defense.
YAHID OULD SLAHI: [translated] They told him they had taken my mother from Mauritania and put her in a single cell in Guantánamo. And if he didn't give officials the information they expected, she would be severely tortured.
NANCY HOLLANDER: Significantly, they included what in Guantánamo was known as the “frequent flyer program.” And they called it that because they wouldn't let people sleep. And they proceeded to torture him.
MOHAMEDOU OULD SLAHI: [read by Dominic West] “Blindfold the [expletive] if he tries to look.” One of them hit me hard across the face, and quickly put the goggles on my eyes, ear muffs on my ears, and a small bag over my head. They tightened the chains around my ankles and my wrists; afterwards, I started to bleed. I thought they were going to execute me.
AMY GOODMAN: Mohamedou Ould Slahi remains at Guantánamo to this day and is yet to be charged with a crime. Spencer Ackerman, if you can talk about this and then also talk about whether the Chicago media is following up on these explosive reports where you're making these connections?
SPENCER ACKERMAN: Yeah, so, it wasn't just that the military couldn't charge—or anyone couldn't charge—Slahi with anything. Military investigators for the prosecution found that the reason why they couldn't charge him with anything is what Richard Zuley did to Mohamedou Slahi, that the torture that Slahi was subjected to by the United States of America so tainted all of the evidence in this case that it became fundamentally unchargeable. In 2010, by the way, a federal judge ruled in Slahi's habeas case that he had to be let go. Barack Obama's Justice Department has appealed that decision, and that's why Slahi is still in Guantánamo Bay today.
Now, as we were reporting this, we found that there were these connections between the way Zuley tortured Slahi and his police work as a Chicago detective. Slahi was short-shackled for extended periods of time. We found that happened to Lathierial Boyd. We found that happened to Benita Johnson. We found that happened to Andre Griggs. Johnson and Griggs, for instance, were shackled for between, they say, 24 and 30 hours in their cases. Andre Griggs was suffering through heroin withdrawal during that time, and he wasn't given medication for that.
This was done as a method to try and get Griggs and Johnson to confess to crimes that they say they never committed. Those confessions formed the vast majority of the evidence against them. And this was something that we saw, as well, Zuley doing at Guantánamo. He told Slahi, “You can either be a witness, or you can be a defendant.” All he had to do was confess. Slahi's torture, much like with Griggs and with Johnson, was so bad that eventually he just said, “I'll sign whatever you put in front of me.” As he put it in his book, “If you want to buy, I am selling.”
Before that happened, as just one of the methods that Zuley employed, Zuley threatened to have his mother taken to Guantánamo Bay in what he described as its all-male environment. I don't think it's particularly hard to understand that to be a rape threat.
AMY GOODMAN: Very quickly, before we go, Chicago has a long history of this issue of police torture. This month, the notorious Chicago police commander, Jon Burge, was released from a halfway house after he served four-and-a-half years for lying under oath. But what he's accused of was leading a torture ring that interrogated more than a hundred African-American men in Chicago in the 1970s and '80s. They routinely used electric shock, suffocation with plastic bags, typewriter covers, among other methods, to extract confessions from men who were later shown to be innocent. The Chicago Torture Justice Memorials Project documented some of the men's stories. This is Shadeed Mu'min.
SHADEED MU'MIN: He handcuffed me real tight, know what I'm saying? He cut my circulation off. He went out of the room and stayed, I guess, for about an hour, and then came back and tried to talk to me. What could I tell him, you know, about the robbery? I told him, “I couldn't tell you anything about no robbery. I know nothing about what you're talking about.” And he said then that, “Oh, you're going to play tough.” Said, “You will tell us, before you leave here, what we want to know.” Said, “I've been known to get out of peoples what I want.” He got real upset and said, “You will talk, you black mother [bleep].” He said, “I'll make you talk, or kill you as I want.” So, I still don't understand. So he—in anger, he rushed to the typewriter and grabbed the plastic cover off there and just crammed it down over my head. And it's like he was a madman. And several officers were helping him. But I was trying to get my arms out from behind the chair, but I couldn't do anything. And I passed out. And like I say, he gave me a breath of air. And I came to, conscious. And he—”You ready to talk?” And I said, “I don't have anything to tell you still.” So he does it again. The third time, out of the third time, that's when I told him, I said, “I'll tell you whatever you want to know, man. Just don't do this no more.”
AMY GOODMAN: That's Shadeed Mu'min speaking about his interrogation by former Chicago police commander Jon Burge. Statistics compiled by the People's Law Office show Chicago has paid at least $64 million in settlements and judgments in civil rights cases related to Burge's police abuses alone. The Chicago Reader reported some of the Burge techniques may have been learned when he was in Vietnam, where he served as a military policeman. Spencer, we're going to end on Jon Burge. Any connection to Richard Zuley?
SPENCER ACKERMAN: So, not directly. Even though they served in Chicago around the same time, supposedly, from everyone I've talked to, including Flint Taylor, who's Burge's probably chief legal investigator, doesn't seem like they actually worked together. Nevertheless, there is a context for this in Chicago. There's a long-standing tradition of police abuses, primarily against African-American residents of Chicago. It sits now, with what we're reporting, at this uncomfortable intersection between both that long and nefarious history of abuse against African Americans, primarily, in Chicago and this post-9/11 era in which secret detentions, longtime interrogations without charge, and so forth, seem to be now increasingly influencing domestic police work.
AMY GOODMAN: And is the Chicago media picking it up, especially in this time of a mayoral re-election race?
SPENCER ACKERMAN: They seem to be running reports based primarily on the Chicago police denial given to us. We'll see if that changes.
AMY GOODMAN: Spencer Ackerman, national security editor at The Guardian, where he's published a two-part series on police abuse in Chicago, “The Disappeared: Chicago Police Detain Americans at Abuse-Laden 'Black Site'” and “Bad Lieutenant: American Police Brutality, Exported from Chicago to Guantánamo.” We'll link to them at our website, as well as your interview, as well, with Victoria Suter.

A Texas man is suing a woman for texting during a movie date, according to the Austin Statesman
Brandon Vezmar filed a claim against the woman on Thursday that alleges her texting went against the movie theater's policy and disrupted his viewing experience, the Statesman reported.
He has asked for $17.31, which was what he paid for two tickets to see “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2” in 3-D, according to the Statesman.
"While damages sought are modest, the principle is important as Defendant's behavior is a threat to civilized society," the lawsuit read, according to CBS News.
The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she was unaware of the claim.
Vezmar said he met the woman online and asked her out. The couple's first date happened on May 6.
Vezmar said the woman started texting on her phone 15 minutes into the new Marvel movie.
“This is like one of my biggest pet peeves,” Vezmar told the Statesman.
He also said the woman read through her phone between 10 and 20 times in 15 minutes, the Statesman reported.
Vezmar said he asked her to stop, bu the woman refused. He asked her to text outside. So she did, and never came back.
“I had my phone low and I wasn't bothering anybody,” she told the Statesman, saying she was texting a friend. “It wasn't like constant texting.”
She sent a statement to KVUE-TV that explained her side of the date.
“I did have a very brief date with Brandon, that I chose to end prematurely. His behavior made me extremely uncomfortable, and I felt I needed to remove myself from the situation for my own safety,” she wrote. “He has escalated the situation far past what any mentally healthy person would. I feel sorry that I hurt his feelings badly enough that he felt he needed to commit so much time and effort into seeking revenge. I hope one day he can move past this and find peace in his life.”

Megyn Kelly forcefully denounced former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly for “shaming women into shutting the hell up about harassment” allegations on Monday, delivering her most candid remarks on the matter since leaving the network earlier this year.
Kelly, the former anchor at Fox whose program followed O'Reilly's on cable news' leading evening news lineup, blasted the ousted host and the network for attacking sexual assault accusers on air and allegedly creating an unsafe environment for victims to come forward with complaints about sexual misconduct in the workplace.
Story Continued Below
Kelly, who reportedly left Fox News in January to launch a new show on NBC's morning lineup, in part due to O'Reilly's behavior, directly refuted his past dismissals of sexual harassment accusers, citing her own experience with the network's past top anchor.
“O'Reilly's suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false,” she said while addressing the controversy on her show “Megyn Kelly TODAY.” “I know because I complained.”
Kelly's comments come on the heels of a New York Times report that Bill O'Reilly settled sexual harassment claims with a Fox News analyst to the tune of $32 million last January, just six months after network chairman Roger Ailes was ousted from Fox amid his own sexual misconduct controversy.
O'Reilly denied the allegations as “lies and smears.” But Kelly, delivering her most stinging rebuke of her former employer since her high-profile departure, said O'Reilly's refutations highlighted a larger issue of dismissing victims' claims at the network.
“Perhaps he didn't realize that his exact attitude in shaming women into shutting the hell up about harassment, on grounds that it will disgrace the company, is in part how Fox News got into the decadelong Ailes mess to begin with," she said.
Kelly said that while the issue is “not unique to Fox News” and that the network had “absolutely made some reforms” to address the issue, the shaming of accusers had to come to an end.
“This must stop. The abuse of women, the shaming or them, the threatening and the retaliation, the silencing them after the fact — it has to stop,” she said.
Kelly added: “Women everywhere are used to being dismissed, ignored or attacked when raising complaints about men in authority positions. They stay silent so often out of fear, fear of ending their careers, fear of lawyers, yes, and often fear of public shaming, including through the media.”
During her emotional monologue, the NBC host cited a November 2016 letter she said she sent to Fox News executive Bill Shine in which she decried O'Reilly's actions, writing, "you've got a hell of a guy hosting that 8 pm hour," according to a copy of the letter posted online by NBC.
O'Reilly responded to the allegations on social media Monday by maintaining that he didn't “do anything wrong,” while stating that he largely settled the harassment claims to minimize the strain on his family. O'Reilly also denied Kelly's claim that she had complained about his behavior while both were at Fox during an appearance on Glenn Beck's radio show.
"She didn't file a complaint that I know of, and she is not mentioning that there was an anonymous hotline at Fox News for years,” O'Reilly said. “Anyone could have called and said, 'Someone is doing something to me and you'd better stop it.'”
The former Fox News host posted pictures online of letters of appreciation written to him from Kelly and Gretchen Carlson, who filed a harassment lawsuit against Ailes after departing the network last summer, both of whom have offered stinging public critiques of Fox and O'Reilly in recent days.
Carlson on Saturday blasted Fox News for re-signing O'Reilly despite reportedly being aware of the multimillion-dollar settlement he made last January.
“It's horrifying and outrageous that any company, after dismissing somebody for allegations such as that, would not only re-sign a contract but allow that person to come back on the air,” she told CNN.
Kelly on Monday also interviewed Juliet Huddy, one of several women who reportedly has settled sexual harassment allegations against O'Reilly, who spoke about the challenges of speaking out against powerful male media figures.
“I am terrified. I am actually terrified," she told Kelly. "I don't know why I am about to cry. It is difficult. It is difficult."
According to a January report in the Times, O'Reilly sought to retaliate against Huddy and derail her career after he rejected her advances while working under him at Fox in 2011. Huddy later lodged and secretly settled harassment claims against O'Reilly in the months following Ailes' depature.

Huddy told Kelly that fears of retaliation often lead victims to stay silent.
"You have to think about your future and some people just want to make it go away and just move on with their lives,” she said.
Representatives for Fox News declined to comment. A representative for 21st Century Fox, Fox News' parent company, did not immediately return a request for comment.

Bernie Sanders critiqued fellow Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during a rally in Mason City, chastising her for fundraising instead of campaigning in Iowa on Wednesday night.
"My opponent is not in Iowa tonight. She is raising money from a Philadelphia investment firm," Sanders said. "Frankly, I would rather be here with you."
At the Music Man Square, Sanders fired against Clinton, saying that her campaign is "in trouble" as his poll numbers rise before the Iowa caucus Monday. The latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll shows Clinton and Sanders virtually tied, with Clinton slightly leading. A recent Quinnipiac poll shows Sanders 4 points ahead.
“Needless to say, our opponents are not all that enthusiastic about that reality,” Sanders said, about potentially winning the Iowa caucus. “One of the things they say, 'Bernie Sanders, nice guy, interesting ideas, but he just could not win a general election.'”
He then cited polls from Iowa and New Hampshire that shows him ahead of Clinton in a battle against Donald Trump, saying he would be electable in a general election despite criticisms.
Along with that, he said his supporters show more vibrancy for him versus Clinton's supporters.
"I think anybody who … fairly looks at our campaign versus our opponent's campaign knows that the energy, the enthusiasm, the momentum is with us."
Clinton, who met with voters earlier Wednesday in Philadelphia, released an ad in Iowa comparing Sanders and Clinton. The ad criticizes Sanders on issues like health care and guns, stating that Clinton is the better candidate.
However, in a press release from Mason City Wednesday, Sanders retorted back.

"We were disappointed, but not surprised that Secretary Clinton has decided to broadcast a television ad in Iowa that completely distorts my record,” Sanders said, according to the release.
Lily Adams, Iowa communications director for the Clinton campaign, pointed to a PolitiFact fact check that reported Sanders' statements about being more electable are false. She also pointed to a press release from today that states, “It's disappointing that Senator Sanders has abandoned his claims of a positive campaign in order to parrot Karl Rove's attacks against Hillary Clinton,” said Christina Reynolds of the Clinton campaign in the release.
Kellie Craig, 52, of Forest City said she plans on caucusing for Sanders, choosing him over Clinton because of his record.
"Hillary changes with the popular vote," Craig said. "A lot of the things that Bernie's been talking about, she's starting to talk about now."

Actress Susan Sarandon introduced Sanders in Mason City, saying she endorses him because of his consistency.
"For me, gender is not what's important. Issues are what's important," Sarandon said. "I want a candidate who has the courage to stand and do the right thing when it is not popular."

In addition, there are medics on site full-time. Seigler told us that each morning begins with a 06:30 safety meeting and ends with a debrief.
2. What impact, if any, does the extinguishing process have on our health?
According to Noblett and Seigler, probably none at all. The water they are spraying is suppressing the particulates from the dump. When firefighting is complete for the day, the dump is capped so there is no open, free burning. This means that no toxins are being released into the air specifically due to firefighting.
3. And what about the environment?
The fire team is flowing about 1200 gallons of water per minute, and that's a lot of water to use and to contain. The water is sourced from a creek and placed in a berm for spraying. To prevent waste, the run-off, which is called the leachate, is funnelled to a temporary drafting pond, where it is mixed with freshwater. The leachate-freshwater mix is then pumped back into the hoses and used to fight the fire. Once the firefighting is complete, any leftover leachate will be treated and then drained. All of these water-related processes are monitored by City engineers and staff from GN Environment, Environment Canada, and AANDC.
4. How long will this take?
At the time of our chat, Seigler and Noblett estimated that the fire was about 50% extinguished; later in the week, they raised that value to 60%. Though they have made a great deal of progress, Noblett explained that as they are not just getting to the hottest part of the fire (burning at over 1100 degrees Fahrenheit), firefighting from this point on will be more difficult and time-consuming. Thus, they are sticking to their original 30-day estimation of a September 30th end date.
5. Are they doing anything to make sure this doesn't happen again?
The contracted companies like Hellfire Suppression and Global Forensics are working with our City staff on a number of preventative measures. First, there is a system of mentoring between the industrial firefighters and our municipal firefighters. Secondly, Noblett is studying the fire and working with the City on an Action Plan that will be added to the existing Solid Waste Management Plan. The Action Plan will include recommendations for better dump management (example: ensuring proper layering and sorting procedures when piling trash) and better waste separation.

On behalf of everyone who is part of Iqalummiut for Action, I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to Mike and George. They went out of their way to talk with us when they were under no obligation to do so, and they gave us frank, honest answers to our questions. We are also grateful for the hard work they are putting in to extinguish the fire and we look forward to hosting the entire crew at a celebratory feast once the Iqaluit dump fire has been put to rest.
Thank you very much, Mr Rosindell, for allowing me to sneak in at the last minute. I congratulate my hon. Friend Mr Raab on securing the debate. He mentioned the well-known case of Gary McKinnon, and I want briefly to add my support to his cause.
That case, and some of the figures we have heard in the debate, show that we exist in an imbalanced relationship with the United States. That is reinforced by the fact that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were so reassuring on this case while in opposition, but now seem to feel at least that they do not have the power or the authority to follow through with some of those reassurances. That has to be addressed.
I am here to speak about a case that has already been mentioned briefly—that of a constituent of mine, Deborah Dark. She was arrested in 1988 in France, on suspicion of drug-related offences, and held in custody for eight and a half months. She was eventually found not guilty by a French court, and was released and returned to the UK, where she tried to get over the fact that she had wasted eight and a half months in jail.
Nearly 20 years later, in 2007, Deborah travelled to Turkey for a holiday, but instead of being able to enjoy it, as she would have expected, she found herself stripped at gunpoint at the airport by Turkish police. According to the police—whose behaviour, incidentally, was unspeakably disgusting and life-changingly appalling—they were acting merely on a tip-off from Interpol. That was the only explanation she was given; they did not elaborate in any way.
As we would expect, Deborah wanted an immediate explanation when she arrived in the UK. She called the police and was told there was no outstanding arrest warrant; they shrugged their shoulders. She asked the Serious Organised Crime Agency and was told it had no records on her either. Helpfully, it added that her arrest might have been a mistake.
Time passed and, with extraordinary calm, Deborah accepted that explanation. Then, in 2008, she travelled to Spain to visit her father, who had retired there and who was unwell. She tried to return to the UK after her holiday, which lasted a few weeks, but she was arrested at the airport. She was taken into custody by the Spanish authorities and told that she faced extradition to France.
That is when the penny began to drop. Seventeen years before, the French prosecutor had appealed the verdict clearing Deborah. That happened without her knowledge. She had been found guilty, without anyone bothering to tell her. In her absence, she was sentenced to six years. I repeat that she was never summoned to appear in court, never asked to defend herself and never given an opportunity to do so. She was never told that her acquittal had been overturned; these things happened entirely without her knowledge.
That was in 1989. More than a decade later, the French authorities issued their European arrest warrant, meaning that EU member states were compelled to arrest Deborah and send her to France to serve the sentence. As it happens, she refused to consent to the extradition and was granted an extradition hearing. Fortunately, the Spanish court chose not to extradite her, on the basis that so much time had passed and she was unlikely to get a thorough, proper or fair trial. After one month in custody, she was released from prison, and she returned home. However, it was not over.
When Deborah arrived in the UK, she was arrested by the British police at Gatwick airport. Again, she refused to consent to extradition, and she was released on bail, pending another hearing. In 2008, extradition was again refused, for the same reason—the passage of time.
Despite being cleared by two courts, however, Deborah remained subject to the European arrest warrant in other EU states until 2010, when the French finally withdrew it. Until that moment, she was, in effect, trapped in the UK and unable to visit her family in Spain for more than three years, all because of a conviction that she was never allowed to contest.
I have chosen to speak about Deborah not only because her case is horrific and she is my constituent, but because there are hundreds of examples of the European arrest warrant failing. Julian Assange, the boss and founder of WikiLeaks, is a well-known figure. He faces extradition to Sweden, despite the fact that he has not been charged anywhere or for anything, and despite the fact that the extradition is being demanded by a private prosecutor, described as a partisan prosecutor—in other words, they are not a member of the national judiciary or a formal representative of the state.
The system clearly needs changing, and it needs changing soon, because the number of such cases is rising. One thousand people were subjected to the European arrest warrant last year, and the figure grows every month. A remedy suggested by Fair Trials International would involve applying the principle of mutual recognition to the European arrest warrant. That would mean that once one member state had refused to execute a European arrest warrant, as happened with Deborah, it would automatically be withdrawn, along with any alerts on EU and international police databases. That remedy would have prevented Deborah from being subjected to her grim groundhog-day experience.
One alternative that has been proposed—including, I believe, by Fair Trials International—is that we raise the bar to capture only the most serious cases, and I certainly go along with that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton said, that is what this tool was originally designed for. I am sure there are alternatives, but I am no expert, and it is for the Government to identify the most appropriate steps. What is certain, however, is that the system needs radical and rapid reform to prevent such appalling abuses from happening again.
Hope HB.211
I'm not sure about you, but I think of things like aluminum cranks and stems when I hear someone mention UK component manufacturer Hope. And rightfully so - they've been making their own components in the UK since 1989 and have recently moved towards using carbon fiber for their latest handlebars and seatposts, which are also made in-house. It's that carbon work over the last handful of years that has helped prepare them for the HB.211, a 160mm-travel, all-mountain frame that features a carbon fiber front triangle that Hope produces in their new carbon facility, with a fully CNC'd rear triangle that they also make themselves.
HB.211 Details:
• Intended use: all-mountain / enduro
• Rear wheel travel: 160mm
• Wheel size: 27.5''
• Carbon front end
• CNC'd aluminum rear end
• Suspension design: four-bar
• 17 x 130mm rear hub spacing
• Zero dish rear wheel
• Weight: 30lb (as shown)
• Availability: maybe... maybe not
• www.hopetech.com / @hopetech • Intended use: all-mountain / enduro• Rear wheel travel: 160mm• Wheel size: 27.5''• Carbon front end• CNC'd aluminum rear end• Suspension design: four-bar• 17 x 130mm rear hub spacing• Zero dish rear wheel• Weight: 30lb (as shown)• Availability: maybe... maybe not
UK-Made Carbon
The HB.211 shown here is the only one in existence right now, and inspecting the frame closely does reveal that there are some prototype-ish imperfections in the finish that they are ironing out for the next run of ten frames. And no, none of those are going to be for sale, either. It's all development at this point, but Hope did sound upbeat about the chance of the bike going into production.
The burly looking prototype is overbuilt for obvious reasons, and the bike weighs around 30lb with a coil-spring shock and no real weight-minded concessions. The next run will be lighter, I was told. Hope also wasn't ready to comment on the HB.211's geometry, but it appeared to be contemporary rather than featuring numbers from a few years ago.
Standards Shmandards
The bike uses very few current standards since it has been developed as a design concept rather than a product design exercise. Maybe not the best solution for compatibility, but when you make every part, it gives you the opportunity to manufacture a bike without compromise. - Hope

What Came Before
So if you're probably not going to end up building it, why not design something really freaking cool. Enter the steel trellis front triangle and CNC'd heart of a wild looking, 210mm-travel downhill sled that looked like a non-motorized offspring of a Ducati Monster and a dirtbike. This was in 2009, so not everything had to be carbon to be any good, and Hope's single-pivot beast looked damn good.
Two shorter-travel machines were up next, with 140mm and 160mm of travel, neither as wild as what Hope had been 3D modeling before, however. And none of them came to life.
Until now. Will the HB.211 actually be for sale at some point? I sure hope so.
While the HB.211's UK-made origin is interesting, the real story is Hope's decision to shirk so-called industry standards for the project, one that may or may not reach production.Wondering where the HB.211 name, which doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, comes from? Hope is paying homage to another very British company, aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, and their RB211 high-bypass turbofan engines that have hung off the wings of everything from the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar to the Boeing 747, 757, and 767.Hope has been making their own carbon seatposts and handlebars for a while now, so while them showing up at Sea Otter with a carbon fiber frame might seem like it came out of the blue to some, it's not as far-fetched as it might seem. Consider that you need rather expensive aluminum molds to bladder-mold a carbon frame, something that is rumored to cost well over $50,000 for each size. Hope is pretty handy with aluminum, however, so they simply made their own molds so they could make their own carbon front triangle. That's some British DIY attitude right there, and also, an approach that surely saved them a big chunk of money. Manufacturing is taking place in a new building that's been built specifically for the project, and if Hope do decide to take the HB.211 to production, they'll likely hire a number of new staff for the task.The thought of yet another brake mounting "standard" or proposed hub spacing change is bound to send a lot of us into angry spasms, and rightfully so, but Hope has done exactly that with their HB.211. They are not intending to force any industry-wide changes, however, and the bike may or may not even reach production. All Hope wanted to do was to see what they could come up with if they built a frame the best way they saw fit while taking advantage of their brake, hub, crank and bottom bracket manufacturing abilities.''The bike uses very few current standards since it has been developed as a design concept rather than a product design exercise,'' Hope explained about the bike's ethos. ''Maybe not the best solution for compatibility, but when you make every part, it gives you the opportunity to manufacture a bike without compromise.'' To Hope, a bike without compromise features a zero-dish, 17 x 130mm rear hub spacing, a radial mount rear brake setup, a 30mm crank and bottom bracket interface, and a proprietary chain guide mounting pattern.The HB.211's rear-end looks normal-ish from twenty feet away or to someone who couldn't tell the difference between a four-bar and faux-bar layout, but there's some trickery going on here. Or, to put it better, straight up ignoring what the rest of the industry is doing. Let's start with the rear brake mount which appears to be a normal post mount setup but is anything but. It's actually a radial mount, with the two bolts being in-line with the axle center so that the caliper doesn't need to be offset with an adapter as you go up or down in rotor size. Instead, you simply stack or remove washers under it to move it up or down in height to where it needs to be. This is not possible with industry standard 160mm post mount, and Hope looks pretty clever with their radial caliper mounting.But... There's always a but. Radial brake mounting requires a different caliper due to the position of the mounting bolts in relation to the pistons. Good thing they make their own brakes, so whipping up a new caliper wasn't the end of the world, and Hope actually used to make a radial-mount caliper many years ago. This is system integration taken to, well, somewhere that many riders will have issues accepting. Hope is well aware of this, but that didn't stop them from seeing how far they could take things.A wheel with zero dish and equal spoke tension on either side should be stronger than what's currently the norm, so that's what Hope did. The CNC'd aluminum chain and seatstays are asymmetrical to provide the required clearance, and the 130mm wide rear hub sees the rotor and disc-side spoke flange moved closer together. Why 130mm and not 142, 148, or some other random number? Hope says that the slim rear end is less likely to catch on things that don't move, like rocks and trees, which should help to keep your derailleur safer, and 130mm is the space required for everything to fit in nicely.In the past, I've argued that all-mountain and enduro race bikes are the most exciting, fastest evolving breed of mountain bike, and I still believe that. Downhill race bikes used to hold that crown, of course, but the demands put on a capable 160mm-travel bike these days are pretty high when it comes to every aspect of its performance. Hope kinda feels the same, it seems, as they considered putting a downhill rig together back in 2005 before looking at something with less travel. That unnamed, fully CNC'd bike with 200mm-travel was never made, and neither was the carbon and aluminum hybrid cross-country bike that they designed in 2006. Those two stillborn projects at opposite ends of the two-wheeled spectrum were followed by a 24'' wheeled kids bike with a CNC'd rear-end that was glued to carbon fiber tubes. Cool stuff, sure, but there's a bigger market for cantilever brakes and purple bar-ends than mega-trick bikes for kids that reportedly cost in the five digit range to make.

London's 24-hour Tube service is being trialled this weekend ahead of its official launch on August 19.
Transport for London have confirmed that passenger-free trains will be running overnight on the Victoria and Central lines on August 12 and 13 - one week before the service goes live.
A TFL spokesman said: "The trains will involve operational staff - station and train staff - and no customers so it will be behind closed doors"
The trial, testing the operational readiness of the new service, will commence after the last Tube on Friday and Saturday night so won't impact customer travel.
The Night Tube was announced in September 2014 but has been repeatedly delayed by a series of disputes between Tube workers and TFL over pay and work conditions.
The service will decrease journey times by an average of 20 minutes and support around 2,000 permanent jobs, boosting London's economy by £360m.
TfL chief Mike Brown said: “It is good news for London. More than half a million people use the Tube after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays, and the introduction of the Night Tube, which will support London's businesses and jobs, is a historic step in our modernisation of the Underground and our work to support London's economic growth.”
It will go live on the Central and Victoria lines next week, with Piccadilly, Jubilee and Northern lines to get the 24-service in the autumn.
There will be six trains per hour on each line between 00:30am and 05:30am, which will rise to eight per hour on the Northern line to meet demand between Leicester Square and Camden Town.
Trains will run on the entire line on the Victoria and Jubilee lines, on the Central between Ealing Broadway and Loughton / Hainault, on the entire Northern line except Mill Hill East and Bank branches, and between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5 on the Piccaddilly line.
What is the True Nature of Cities?
Brendon Harre Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 18, 2017
Are cities humanity's greatest invention or does the economics of land supply inevitably lead to an ever widening divide between the haves and have-nots?
“A City upon a Hill” is a phrase from the parable of Salt and Light in Jesus's Sermon on the Mount. In Matthew 5:14, he tells his listeners, “You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.” Image source: churchsermonseriesideas.com/city-on-a-hill/.
Are cities on course to a class divide reminiscent of Dickens's time -or even worse, some sort of neo-feudal state?
Should we be optimistic or pessimistic about cities?
Many cities around the world, including in my country New Zealand, are struggling with the issues of housing affordability and congestion. Social ills related to housing affordability are becoming more pronounced. There are concerns about a growing underclass of homeless and the inadequately housed. While the middle class is fractioning because housing security is not being achieved like it was for previous generations.
Housing affordability and congestion -the ability of cities to inclusively allow more people to affordably live and interact in urban environments is the modern equivalent of past crises where cities were incubators for fatal diseases.
Some people and many politicians deny the seriousness of what is happening in the housing market. For example, despite rising public outrage, New Zealand's last government refused to utter the words ‘housing crisis'. This despite the facts on the ground indicating its housing policy settings had failed to work, especially in New Zealand's biggest city -Auckland.
Worldwide there is a growing movement focusing on urban issues, in particular, housing affordability and congestion. Generation Rent is a phrase that has entered mainstream talk. There are multiple ‘Yes in my backyard' groups -centred in unaffordable cities like San Francisco, Seattle and London. There are activists, academics and politicians dedicating themselves to finding the right policy tools to rectify the problems cities face in housing affordability and congestion.
Within this wider housing affordability movement it is possible to discern housing optimists and pessimists, the issue which seems to divide them is whether cities have reached peak space or not. In economic speak -whether land for new housing supply is inelastic (fixed) or elastic (flexible). Housing optimists believe space in a city hasn't peaked -there is flexibility to supply more if needed, while pessimists conflate urban space with land and believe it is fixed. Because of this belief in the inflexible nature of urban land supply housing pessimists believe policies should be focused on equity -capital gains taxes, betterment taxes, banking and finance reforms etc.
Housing optimists
Edward Glaeser
One of the best housing optimists is Edward Glaeser. He believes cities are a triumph of human inventiveness. On the issue of housing affordability Glaeser's extensive studies indicates it is the particular infrastructures, rules and regulations regarding how urban space is utilised, specific to each particular city which are the biggest factors.
Wikipedia has done a good job summarising Glaeser's economic research on housing.
During the 2000s, Glaeser's empirical research has offered a distinctive explanation for the increase in housing prices in many parts of the United States over the past several decades. Unlike many pundits and commentators, who attribute skyrocketing housing prices to a housing bubble created by Alan Greenspan's monetary policies, Glaeser pointed out that the increase in housing prices was not uniform throughout the country (Glaeser and Gyourko 2002).
Glaeser and Gyourko (2002) argued that while the price of housing was significantly higher than construction costs in Boston, Massachusetts and San Francisco and California, in most of the United States, the price of housing remained “close to the marginal, physical costs of new construction.” They argued that dramatic differences in price of housing versus construction costs occurred in places where permits for new buildings had become difficult to obtain (since the 1970s). Compounded with strict zoning laws the supply of new housing in these cities was seriously disrupted. Real estate markets were thus unable to accommodate increases in demand, and housing prices skyrocketed. Glaeser also points to the experience of states such as Arizona and Texas, which experienced tremendous growth in demand for real estate during the same period but, because of looser regulations and the comparative ease of obtaining new building permits, did not witness abnormal increases in housing prices.
Edward Glaeser's approach is beginning to influence New Zealand policymakers. Steven Joyce, the former Minister of Finance commissioned a report, called “Quantifying the impact of land use regulation: Evidence from New Zealand” published in July 2017. This report almost exclusively used Edward Glaeser's techniques to show that the cost of new housing in many urban areas of New Zealand, had deviated above its marginal cost due to land use restrictions.
Note, land use restrictions are not just zoning which prevents the outward expansion of a city, it is also restrictions, such as, height, setback, shade planes, heritage, view shafts, minimum car parking requirements etc, which limit the upward expansion of a city.
Auckland's house building restrictions were assessed as being the worst of any urban centre in New Zealand -56% of the final cost of an average home being estimated to be the result of overly restrictive land use regulations.
In 2016, Edward Glaeser was interviewed by a Australian news channel about his book “Triumph of the City” and how that applied to Australian cities.
Edward Glaeser takes a constructive approach to the problems cities face. Believing that housing affordability and congestion can be fixed by better infrastructure combined with rules and regulations which allow urban space to be more efficiently used. Glaeser's message is that by taking this approach, cities can continue their successful role as providing the contacts and connections which drive human inventiveness.
Note Glaeser in his interview mentions tax policy -advocating for land value taxes. In New Zealand we would call this unimproved value rates -a type of local government tax. He prefers this tax because it does not add to the marginal cost of building more houses on an urban site. Glaeser also argues that taxing road congestion is an exciting idea, along with Bus Rapid Transit and allowing commercial landowners around train/subway stations to benefit, by being able to develop commercial and residential space and in return to fund, in part, the commuter rail systems. Glaeser stating the closer these transit systems are to being fully commercial operations the better. With regard to automobile dependence Glaeser discusses in some detail that if highways are free, they encourage too much sprawl, causing cities to be somewhat dysfunctional.
Other housing optimists highlight that a number of different cities have solved the issue of affordable housing and there is in fact a variety of successful city development models that could be adopted. I particularly like the following article for the way it describes how different cities using a variety of different urban development models have been successful in building their way to affordable housing.
Housing Pessimists
There is a side of housing affordability movement which is more pessimistic and focuses on the negative outcomes resulting from the housing crisis. For this reason I have called them housing pessimists. They see the property market as unfixable, which will cause an inevitable slide into an increasing class divided society. In their minds political intervention on equity grounds is imperative.
Land supply is seen by housing pessimists, as the root of the problem for a growing divide between the haves and have-nots. This is the contention of the authors of “Rethinking the economics of land and housing”.
Their argument is that land is not being made, that it is just there, fixed in quantity. It is the ultimate monopoly. They argue that fixed land supply and all that follows from that -in particular economic rent and the division of the factors of production into labour, capital and land -was acknowledged in the past but in recent times has been downplayed if not forgotten by the economics profession. They believe this is the driver of an increasingly unequal housing market and a loss of productivity in the economy.
I find housing pessimists good at explaining what is happening in highly supply restricted markets and the implications for those missing out on affordable housing. But their explanation for why a housing crisis exists in the first place I find flawed. It is dependent on the theory that the supply of new residential space is fixed, which as I will explain in the next section is not necessarily the case.
Housing pessimists believe in the importance of reforms to finance and taxation to mitigate the intractable problem of fixed land supply. Below is half-hour interview of the authors of “Rethinking the economics of land and housing”, where they explain their argument -it is certainly worth watching. As I have said, I have serious doubts about the starting premise that a fixed land supply really is the main issue. But otherwise they make an interesting and intelligent argument and it is always good to acknowledge the best differing viewpoints, rather than arguing against strawmen.
In New Zealand's political economy there are people who advocate for variations of the housing pessimistic view. Gareth Morgan, for example, a rich philanthropist who attempted to start a new political party called The Opportunity Party, has long advocated tax reform to fix the housing bubble and lack of productive investment in New Zealand's economy. In all his writings and speeches he concentrates on how demand for speculating on the housing market is encouraged through the finance and taxation system at the expense of other productive investments. Gareth thinks that tax reform -a comprehensive capital gains tax is needed to fix this problem This is a quite common argument taken up by a wide group of people. In my opinion Gareth type arguments lacks balance because they do not consider the effects of supply on the housing market.
I doubt that tax reform alone will lead to more affordable housing and I think it is unlikely this sort of demand side consideration is in the long run as important as sorting out the land use considerations which underpins housing supply.
Does it matter that land is not being made anymore?
If any part of the world had reached its limit of ‘production' with respect to land for housing it would have been Tokyo in the decades since 1963. In that year Tokyo's inner municipal precinct reached a population of 10 million. But in fact in the decades since, the city has found the land to nearly triple its residential space.
Tokyo Precinct is the central municipality of the world's largest metropolitan district. Tokyo-Yokohama has a population of 38 million. The metropolitan area extends into four prefectures -Tokyo, as well as the largely suburban Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba municipalities. In 1963 the Tokyo Precinct had 10 million people and now there is 13.29 million. In 1963 the Precinct's residents had, on average, 15sqm of residential space per person and now they have about 32sqm. This means the residential built environment has grown from 150m sqm to 425m sqm -an increase of 284% over the last 55 years.
If Tokyo can find the space to nearly triple the built environment across the middle of the biggest city in the world, then I think it is hard to claim that land supply for cities really is fixed.
Cities can grow out too, I am sure that Tokyo's outer municipalities grew significantly in the last 55 years too. In New Zealand less than 1% of the country's land area is taken up by towns and cities -so there is space for the expansion of cities if they are allowed to use it.
The political economy in places like London, Auckland and San Francisco might be such that new housing space is inelastically supplied, because it is hard to remove overly restrictive land use rules, provide the necessary infrastructure and change the culture that makes it acceptable for more people to live closer together. Practically in these cities it is true that land supply is fixed. But lacking the political will to make housing supply elastic is a separate issue to claiming a fixed land supply is a fundamental unchangeable economic state for cities.
It is the fixed versus flexible land supply issue which pushes me cautiously towards being a housing optimist. But it is not something I am absolute on. Because of factors like the difficulty purchasing the desired shape and number of urban land parcels for some types of intensification, urban land markets will always, depending on prevailing planning rules, have a greater or lesser amount of supply monopolistic pricing power.
An Auckland economist is studying the pricing power of intensifiable urban land given Auckland's prevailing planning system -the Unitary Plan -his empirical work and economic literature review indicates there is pricing power.
For New Zealand as a whole, it is a small country, with limited access to bigger construction supply chains for housing and infrastructure. It is possible that demand for housing from a high immigration rate or foreign capital chasing property speculation capital gains or even a safe haven for storing capital could be so great that elastic new residential space is overwhelmed.
This seems to be the experience of Ireland's property booms and busts. Being free to build in the countryside (often in places with poor access to cities) was not the silver bullet for Ireland achieving affordable housing. During the height of the Celtic Tiger more houses were built than at any other time in the history of Ireland. Yet house prices, housing need and rent supplement dependence kept rising.
Overall I believe that people can be optimistic about cities. In the long run the true nature of cities being a force for good will prevail.
As smartwatches become more popular with users, Juniper Research expects them to become more popular with another group as well: advertisers.
According to the resarch firm, spending on smartwatch ads is expected to rise in the coming years, although even if it does hit the forecast of nearly $70 million by 2019, that's kind of a tiny drop in the bucket compared with the amount of money spent on advertising for other forms of media.
Still, it raises the question of whether there's room for any kind of advertising on a 1.6 inch display you wear on your wrist.
Part of the point of wearables like smartwatches is that they offer information-at-a-glance to save you the time it would take to pull your phone out of your pocket, unlock the screen, and look something up.
Not only can you tell the time by glancing at your smartwatch, but you can also see caller ID for incoming phone calls, details about your latest chat or social media messages, or other notifications.
Sure, you might want to spend a little more time with your watch screen if you're using it to search the web, order a pizza or even play a game. But generally speaking smartwatches aren't designed to be used the same way as phones or tablets… and that means that ads which you need to dismiss or wait through before you can use an app could be a lot more annoying on a watch than on a phone.
But maybe advertisers will rise to the challenge and come up with some form of way to communicate messages in novel ways that seem appealing rather than annoying.
Yeah, yeah, I know… why start now? But if I had a nickel for every time I've heard someone say they watched the Super Bowl just for the ads, I'd have, well, at least a few nickels. Not everyone hates advertising all the time.

'The archbishop of Canterbury wrote to tell me he could no longer recognise my marriage of 23 years'
I married Jack in 1991 and we have five children. When our eldest son was 16, we decided to up sticks and emigrate to Australia, where we had enjoyed lots of holidays.
As part of the process, we had to send off our birth certificates. Wary of posting original copies, I visited the registrar's office with Jack to get duplicates. After a few moments in the waiting room, the registrar called out, "Miss Kim Walmsley?"
"Over here," I said. "But it's Mrs Kim Walmsley." She looked me up and down. There was a pause, then she said, "I'll just be a few minutes."
Five minutes later she returned. "Will you come with me, please?" I stood up and so did Jack. "No, just Miss Walmsley. We need to talk to her alone."
"It's Mrs Walmsley and anything you need to say to me you can say in front of my husband," I said.
The registrar turned and looked at me. "Are you sure?" she said.
I was bewildered, but when she took us into her office and told us the problem, my first response was incredulous laughter. "We can't issue you with an identical birth certificate," she said, "because you're registered as a boy."
It emerged that in 1965, when my original birth certificate had been filled in, the registrar had written "female" on it, but marked me down as a boy in the book of registration – we'll never know why. I said, "Obviously I am a girl. I've had five natural births. Just change it for me."
"I can't do that," she said. "We have a corrections procedure, but the book itself can't ever be changed." The correction would be a marginal entry next to the original one, dated on the day the correction was made. I'd need to provide medical records.
I left the town hall with a new birth certificate with "male" marked on it. It was surreal, but I remained confident that everything could be sorted out. I had used my original "female" birth certificate for the emigration process. We left the reregistration problem in the hands of our solicitor and left the country in good faith, on a temporary visa, uprooting ourselves from Liverpool and starting a new life in Queensland. Our children started at Australian schools and made friends; we set up a new business and were doing well.
Meanwhile, our solicitor received a letter from births, deaths and marriages saying my original birth certificate, because it wasn't a true copy of the original registration, was considered an illegal document.
We hadn't acted illegally when we'd applied for our visa, because we hadn't known of the mistake, but my passport would soon have to be renewed. I'd have to fill in the form asking if anything had changed since my last application. What would happen then? Would I be arrested? Would we be unable to leave? There were no clear answers. In the end, after a lot of heartache and rows, we decided to return to Liverpool.
People didn't know what to make of it when we reappeared – we'd held a big farewell party only a year before. Our kids told friends what had happened and Chinese whispers were soon going round – I was really a man, our children were adopted. One day we left the house to find homophobic graffiti on our gate and garden wall – someone had written "Queers" and "Roy and Hayley". We felt intimidated and under siege, but determined to rectify the ridiculous situation we'd found ourselves in.
Since then we have had a decade of false starts and dashed hopes, of solicitors taking on our case, only to give up months later. My passport expired and, unable to renew it, I effectively became a prisoner in the UK. It was only when someone asked if we were still legally married that we thought to question that. The archbishop of Canterbury wrote to tell us he could no longer recognise our marriage of 23 years.
I mourn the new life we'd planned. Over the years, the solicitor's fees, lost business and cost of moving to the other side of the world and back have cost us £150,000. Births, deaths and marriages did offer to reregister my birth, which would allow me to have a passport with "female" on it again, but I would be registered as female only from when the correction was made: the original – and legal – entry would still say "Boy".
I imagine a descendant 100 years from now researching the family tree, drawing their own conclusions. Perhaps I'm stubborn, but I just want to be represented as I really am … a female.
