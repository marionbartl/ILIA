Charleston Southern rallied from a 14-point second half deficit to force a tie but Gardner-Webb's Patrick Zeck scored on a tip-in with 11 seconds remaining to lift the Runnin' Bulldogs to a 63-61 win Saturday at Paul Porter Arena.
CSU (9-14, 4-8 Big South) trailed 45-31 at the 15:02 mark before methodically chipping away to nearly hand Gardner-Webb (12-13, 7-5 Big South) its first home loss. Down five with less than a minute to play, Christian Keeling hit a three-pointer and the Bucs forced a turnover shortly after the ensuing in-bound pass to knot the score at 61 apiece on Cortez Mitchell's steal and layup with 40 seconds left. On GWU's last possession, though, Zeck followed up an errant runner from David Efianayi to provide the difference. Keeling's shot in the lane at the buzzer fell short on CSU's final trip, allowing GWU to improve to 10-0 at home.
CSU head coach Barclay Radebaugh was proud with the resolve his team showed to nearly overcome a tough shooting night that saw the Bucs connect on just 39 percent overall and 5-of-18 attempts from downtown.
“It was an incredible effort by our guys and they showed tremendous tenacity,” Radebaugh said. “We did a great job in the second half to carry out our game plan defensively and hold them to 33 percent from the floor. We had tremendous desire and want-to to win this game but came up just short against a good team on their home court.”

The Philadelphia trio Lithuania play a fizzy, tuneful, emo-influenced kind of pop-punk, just barely skirting the edges of power pop. Bassist and singer Eric Slick also plays in Dr. Dog, but that doesn't really tell you what kind of band they are. Hop Along singer Frances Quinlan guested on the band's last album, 2015's Hardcore Friends, and that should give you a better idea. Lithuania just released a new album called White Reindeer, and you can hear it below.

The Seattle Mariners have reportedly been eyeing Minnesota Twins right-hander Ervin Santana for some time, but the possibility of a deal has become less likely because of changes in the standings.
According to Ryan Divish of the Seattle Times, talks between the two clubs are "on hold" now that the Twins have surpassed the Mariners in the American League wild-card race -- essentially transforming Minnesota into a buyer rather than a seller.
Seattle is in desperate need of starting pitching with James Paxton recently joining Felix Hernandez on the disabled list. Santana, 34, owns a 3.28 ERA across 24 starts for the Twins this season. He's due $13.5 million in 2018 with a club option for 2019 and a vesting option for 2020.
It's unclear if Minnesota has placed the 13-year veteran on revocable waivers this month, a necessary action for any trade to be consummated.

Nearly half of humans believe that intelligent extra-terrestrial life exists elsewhere in the universe, according to a study that asked 26,000 people across 24 countries.
When they were asked if they believed in the "existence of intelligent alien civilisations in the universe," 47% of the survey respondents said yes.
However, when those taking the survey were asked if they believed in "some form of life on other planets," 61% said yes.
Among those who reckon we aren't alone, 60% said we should try and communicate with aliens - something that is actually being attempted at the non profit Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) Institute.

Martijn Lampert, research director at Glocalities , which carried out the survey, commented: "People who believe in the existence of intelligent alien civilizations are not a marginal minority, but constitute a large (47%) and distinct segment of unconventional and anti-authoritarian thinkers with a passion for science, technology, culture, politics and the arts."
Only a quarter of respondents said they didn't believe that alien life exists beyond Earth's borders.

"The recent discovery of exoplanets is likely to fuel the interest of people in learning about the mysteries of the universe and possible life forms on other planets," Lampert said.
"If and when the discovery of life on other planets is confirmed by the scientific community in the coming years, it is likely that this group will become more and more engaged in the debate about the future of humanity and the place of planet Earth in the universe."

Interestingly, NASA believes there may be bacterial life in our own solar system - hidden in subsurface oceans on Saturn's moon Enceladus .
"This is the closest we've come, so far, to identifying a place with some of the ingredients needed for a habitable environment," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington.
"These results demonstrate the interconnected nature of NASA's science missions that are getting us closer to answering whether we are indeed alone or not."
On 1 April last year, important changes to New Zealand employment law came into effect.
The changes help promote fairer and more productive workplaces by providing enhanced protection and benefits for employers and employees alike. For instance, they strengthen minimum employment standards, such as wage and holiday entitlements.
At HRtoolkit, we are still receiving requests for information about these changes, so we produced this blog to make sure you are aware of them. Please share it with anyone else who you think needs to know.
Overview
Key changes to the legislation include amendments to zero-hour (otherwise known as no guaranteed hours) contracts, a new infringement notice regime, requirements for clearer record keeping, plus tougher sanctions and penalties for breaches of the legislation. They fall into four categories, as outlined below.
For most businesses there won't be an increase in compliance costs as a result of the changes as their focus is on organisations not currently meeting their obligations. These businesses need to become compliant or risk facing financial penalties.
Employment standards
When hiring, employers must guarantee to give employees agreed hours of work
to give employees agreed hours of work Employers won't be able to expect employees to be available to work with no guarantee of hours without paying reasonable compensation
Employers won't be able to cancel a shift without giving employees “reasonable notice” or compensation, both of which must be set out in an employment agreement
Employers won't be able to make unreasonable deductions from wages
Employers won't be able to unreasonably restrict an employee's secondary employment
Record keeping
Clearer record keeping requirements are now required for wages, time, holidays and leave and these have been made consistent across all employment legislation.
Previously, minimum entitlements were inconsistent, which led to difficulties in assessing whether low-salaried and pieceworkers were receiving adequate pay.
The key requirement is that employers can produce a record of the number of hours worked each day, and the pay for those hours, in an easily accessible form
of the number of hours worked each day, and the pay for those hours, in an easily accessible form Additional hours worked by employees on salaries doesn't generally need to be recorded, but minimum employment entitlements still need to be met
There is flexibility around the format for records, so long as they are legally compliant
Information sharing
Information can now be shared between regulators (Immigration NZ, IRD and the Companies Office) to improve the ability of Labour Inspectors to identify and investigate alleged breaches of employment standards
between regulators (Immigration NZ, IRD and the Companies Office) to improve the ability of Labour Inspectors to identify and investigate alleged breaches of employment standards Labour Inspectors can now request documents or records from employers including financial or bank statements, but all information shared (both business and personal) will be protected by the Privacy Act
Infringement fees and sanctions
Labour Inspectors will use infringement fees for clear-cut breaches of obligations to keep records, but serious breaches, such as exploitation, will now be heard at the Employment Court and carry heavier penalties.
Employees are also able to seek penalties at the Employment Relations Authority for any entitlement breach.
Businesses found guilty of moderate breaches will be fined $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a company
breaches will be fined $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a company Businesses found guilty of serious breaches will be fined up to $50,000 for an individual and more than $100,000 for a company
breaches will be fined up to $50,000 for an individual and more than $100,000 for a company Employers will be publicly named if the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court finds they have breached minimum standards
Individuals can be banned as a manager if they commit serious or persistent breaches of employment standards
Directors, senior managers and legal advisors can also be held accountable for breaches of employment standards

Former Indian captain Kapil Dev praised Pakistan's performance in Champions Trophy 2017, particularly their win against England in the first semi-final of the tournament.
"Despite there being hardly any local cricket matches in the country, Pakistan has managed to produce extremely competitive cricketers," he said.
"The situation in Pakistan is not very good at the moment," he continued. "This win might unite the country."
"Cricket can become a motivation for the young people of Pakistan, who are growing up in a divided country," he added.

He commended Pakistan for producing exceptional fast-bowlers, giving examples of former captain Imran Khan, batsman Sarfraz Ahmed, late cricketer Fazal Mahmood, Wasim Akram, and Waqar Younis.
He said that just like the Indian cricket team is full of spinners, the Pakistan cricket team is full of fast-bowlers.
In a brilliant victory, Pakistan defeated England by 8 wickets in the first semi-final of Champions Trophy 2017 against England yesterday.
ISTANBUL - Istanbul's police chief on Monday hailed as a hero a 24-year-old officer stabbed to death by a suspected member of the Islamic State (IS) group, who had been arrested for allegedly planning a suicide attack.
Sinan Acar was attacked with a knife by the suspect, who has not been named, after the man was brought by car for questioning to the headquarters of Istanbul police late Sunday. Acar later died of his wounds while the suspected IS member was shot dead on the spot by other police officers.
Speaking at a funeral ceremony for the slain officer, police chief Mustafa Caliskan said Acar and his colleagues had prevented a potentially significant attack by arresting the suspect.
“The man arrested was someone who was the subject of an international search,” said Caliskan. “We think that a very serious attack was prevented.”
“It must be known that in this country people like Sinan will live on,” he said at the ceremony also attended by Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin.
It was not immediately clear how the suspect managed to keep a knife while being taken into custody.
At the funeral, Acar's mother, overcome by emotion, was supported by a female police officer, an AFP correspondent said. He will later be buried in his native Bursa region.
Turkey was hit in 2016 by a succession of attacks that left hundreds dead in the bloodiest year of terror strikes in its history.
The attacks were blamed on IS jihadists as well as the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who have battled the Turkish state in an insurgency lasting more than three decades.
Last month anti-terror officers in Istanbul detained dozens of alleged IS members, several of whom were said to be preparing a “sensational attack” in Turkey, police said.
An attack by a jihadist gunman on an elite nightclub in Istanbul just 75 minutes into New Year's Day in 2017 left 39 people dead, mainly foreigners.
There has since been a lull in similar attacks, but tensions and high security remain in big cities.
Turkey was in the last years criticised by NATO allies for not doing more against the rise of IS but recent months have seen near daily raids on the group's cells inside the country.
'O Monstro' Thiago Silva back to his best in Russia
Associated Press FOLLOW NEWS News 71 // 04 Jul 2018, 21:17 IST SHARE Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Four years after Brazil's humiliation at its home World Cup, Thiago Silva is back to his best in Russia, a country where his then-burgeoning career was almost tragically cut short years ago.
The 33-year-old Brazil center back — who is nicknamed "O Monstro" for his exceptional physical abilities — is probably playing in his final World Cup, and he has been enjoying a perfect tournament so far.
While forward Neymar attracted negative comments for his antics on the field, Silva has been irreproachable. The captain arguably has been the best center back of the tournament, alongside Uruguay captain Diego Godin.
Like Uruguay, Brazil has conceded only one goal in Russia so far, from a set piece in its opening 1-1 draw with Switzerland . And the Selecao's rivals have managed only five shots on target in their four matches against the five-time champions.
Silva has been playing a key role in helping Brazil achieve those impressive statistics, anchoring the defense with authority and class. During the 2-0 win against Mexico that guaranteed Brazil advanced to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive time, Silva was decisive both in the air and on the ground, blocked several shots and made two clearances.
"It's a huge joy to be doing an excellent cup and to be growing with every game," Silva said. "I'm happy about my performance, and the performance of the team."
Happiness and joy have been hard to come by during some stretches of Silva's career.
The native of Rio de Janeiro went through hard times after Brazil's 7-1 loss to Germany at the last World Cup. Silva did not play in that game because he was suspended, but he was harshly criticized and branded a cry baby for his emotional outbursts as he was pictured in tears before a penalty shootout against Chile in the round of 16.
After the tournament, he was stripped of the team's captaincy by new coach Dunga, then left off the regular roster after the 2015 Copa America. He returned from exile in September 2016 for World Cup qualifiers after being called up by Dunga's successor, Tite.
Those professional ups and downs are nothing compared to the ordeal Silva went through back in 2005, when he spent about six months in a Moscow hospital after he contracted tuberculosis. Regarded at the time as one of the world's most promising defenders, Silva had been sent on loan from Porto to Dynamo Moscow alongside several teammates.
"It was probably the worst episode of my life," Silva said.
It was during a training camp in Portugal that doctor Yuri Vassilkov, who had traveled along with the team, noticed that Silva had a persistent cough.
"He had temperature and we thought it was a simple cold," Vassilkov said in an interview with L'Equipe newspaper this week. "I gave him some medication but he did not improve. I was a bit worried and I sent him for exams at the British hospital in Lisbon. The diagnosis was terrible: tuberculosis. It was a shock."
Vassilkov believes that the diagnosis was so late that Silva was weeks away from dying.
Silva was brought back to Moscow, where he was hospitalized in a center specializing in tuberculosis treatment. At the time, Silva did not speak English or Russian and went through a bout of depression.
"The cold, the lack of natural light, the fact that I could not speak to anybody ... All this was very difficult to handle," Silva remembered in an interview with Belgian Sport/Foot magazine.
After Russian doctors at one point considered removing part of his lungs, Silva survived and fully recovered. He never played a game for Dynamo, and these painful events are just bad memories now.
"That would have ended my career. I needed guardian angels to take me away," Silva said. "I was a bit overwhelmed in a friendly we played against Russia this year. It is different for me to play there. I hope I can erase that by lifting the World Cup trophy."

Further Reading Accuracy takes power: one man's 3GHz quest to build a perfect SNES emulator At this point, we're used to modern computers being able to perform near-perfect emulation of older gaming hardware via software trickery. The latest project from Tom "Tom7" Murphy, though, seems poised to coin its own definition for "reverse emulation" by running a playable Super NES game on actual unmodified NES hardware.
Murphy breaks down this wizardry in a pair of detailed videos laying out his tinkering process. Though the NES hardware itself is untouched, the cartridge running this reverse emulation is a heavily customized circuit board (ordered from China for about $10), with a compact, multi-core Raspberry Pi 3 attached to handle the actual Super NES emulation.
The Pi essentially replaces the PPU portion of the cartridge, connecting to the NES via a custom-coded EEPROM chip that tells the system how to process and display what would normally be an overwhelming stream of graphical data coming from the miniature computer. Only the CIC "copyright" chip from the original cartridge remains unmodified to get around the hardware's lockout chip.
Murphy—you may remember him from previous efforts to teach an AI how to play NES games—says that the Raspberry Pi actually has too much latency to effectively "stream" tile-by-tile graphical instructions to the NES' cartridge CPU. By the time the Pi manages to "discharge" a set of instruction bits (only 180ns after they were generated), the NES itself has already moved on to the next part of its read-write cycle.
Murphy used a one-cycle delay to compensate for this latency, essentially guessing where the fairly predictable PPU would be writing to next and just sending data to that location ahead of time. That process works pretty well but results in the persistent flickering and graphical noise you see throughout his video demonstrations.
Supercharging the NES
Further Reading One-upping the NES Classic Edition with the Raspberry Pi 3 and RetroPie Despite the latency issue, using the power of a Raspberry Pi lets Murphy do a lot of things a standard NES cartridge could never do. On a standard NES game, for instance, any 16×16 pixel block has to use a single palette of three colors (plus one background color). The NES hardware itself, though, actually generates each scanline as a set of discrete 8×1 pixel strips. By switching the palette in between each strip, the system can actually display many more colors in each tile (though each frame is still limited to four distinct palettes).
The Pi's "streaming" PPU also lets Murphy update every tile on the screen as often as he wants, getting around the PPU-to-CPU bandwidth limitations that constrained scrolling speeds in standard NES games. That allows for effects such as full-motion video and other complex animations that wouldn't be possible using the usual sprite-and-background model.
Even with these advantages, there are obvious inherent limitations to reverse-emulating the Super NES on older hardware. The NES can't handle all of the 56,000+ colors possible on a Super NES, for instance, so the Raspberry Pi has to essentially round to the nearest available NES-safe color using a lookup table. The NES controller doesn't have enough buttons to simulate all Super NES inputs, either, though apparently the same basic electrical signals from an NES controller d-pad work unmodified when controlling a Super NES ROM.
The reverse emulation also doesn't currently support Super NES audio, which would sound rather transformed on the NES' limited four-channel audio output anyway. Murphy theorizes, though, that it might be possible to send high-quality pulse-code modulated audio waves to the NES through a reverse-emulated cartridge CPU. In that case, the cartridge would essentially act as a bus that simply reads data from the Pi and writes it to the NES' audio memory as quickly as possible.
While super-charging classic video game hardware is fun, Murphy is already doing some sci-fi speculation about how the human brain could reverse emulate a much more advanced computer. Maybe one day we'll all be "outputting" computer-derived answers to complex questions, all fed through our limited brains by a super-brain running in our pockets.

(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O), whose social media platform is blocked in China, authorized a local company to launch a photo-sharing application in the country in May, the New York Times reported, citing a person with knowledge of the company's plans.
The app, called Colorful Balloons, is similar to Facebook's Moments application in function and feel, but does not carry the Facebook name, the Times said on Friday. (nyti.ms/2wBedsB)
The app was released in China by a company called Youge Internet Technology and without any hint that Facebook is affiliated with the company, the Times said, citing a post in Apple's app store.
"We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways," a Facebook spokesperson said by email.
"Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform."
It was unclear if China's various internet regulators were aware of the app's existence, the Times said.
Western social media websites like Facebook and Twitter (TWTR.N) are blocked by China's censors, which has helped drive up the popularity of home-grown messaging app WeChat, owned by Tencent (0700.HK) and microblogging service Weibo (WB.O).

DUBAI - Armed men on Sunday attacked a prison in Bahrain where Shiites convicted over anti-government protests are held, killing one policeman and allowing inmates to escape, the interior ministry said. The security forces launched a manhunt for the attackers and the escaped prisoners, the ministry said on Twitter. The attack took place at Jaw prison south of the capital Manama, it said, but did not give more details on the number of attackers or escapees.
The tiny but strategic Gulf state has been rocked by unrest since its Sunni authorities crushed Shiite-led protests in 2011 demanding a constitutional monarchy and an elected prime minister. Hundreds of Shiites have been arrested and many have faced trials over their role in the demonstrations. Police on Sunday set up or reinforced roadblocks near Shiite villages outside the capital, witnesses said. Despite the crackdown, Shiite protesters have frequently clashed with security forces in these villages. In June, 17 prisoners broke out of Al-Hadd jail east of Manama, but the authorities recaptured 11 of them the next day.
Bahrain, which is connected to Saudi Arabia by a causeway, lies across the Gulf from Shiite Iran and is home to the US Fifth Fleet.

ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) on Wednesday organized Muzakra on “The Sufi Route in 21st Century” here at its media center.
Speakers including Dr Tanvir Anjum and Mussarrat Youssuf discussed in the “The Sufi Route in 21st Century”. They said that “We live in an age when science and technology have brought mankind not only great material advances, but also a deep cynicism towards the religious and spiritual aspects of life”.
“On the one hand, the success of the “scientific method” has set limitations on what are considered to be useful and practical fields of study” the speakers added.
They further said that “We are taught to believe that only that which the outer senses can perceive and which the rational mind can analyze, are worthy of being called ‘the truth”.
They said that Sufism is a path of spiritual advancement. “By a process of purification, Sufi practices allow light to enter our hearts and our faculties of perception” they said, adding that this may lead to the development of our innate spiritual and intuitive abilities, in the same way that when you open a window to a dark room light floods in and you can suddenly see more.
The discussion was also followed by Mehfil-E-Samaa. Awais Niazi and party will mesmerize the audience with their renditions of famous Kalaam.
“Muzakra” is a bi-monthly programme in which guest speakers bring their literary, intellectual, cultural and social works before the audience and the audience engages with them to explore, elaborate and also to critique it.
Four of the provincial candidates running in Kingston and The Islands took part in a sometimes lively debate at CKWS TV on Wednesday. The PC, Liberal, NDP and Green Party candidates locked horns over a number of provincial and local riding issues during the hour-long televised debate.
Liberal incumbent Sophie Kiwala spent much of the hour on the defence, but most notably when Green Party candidate Robert Kiley called her party's “mismanagement” of the green bill.
READ MORE: EXCLUSIVE: Liberals ignored green energy advice that could've saved Ontarians billions, lead engineer says
Kiley spent much of the green-bill portion of the debate focusing on ways to cut down hydro costs, by suggesting that Ontario buy “low-cost clean hydro” from Quebec and by not investing in refurbishing Darlington and Pickering nuclear plants, which were set to be expired this year.
According to IESO, the Crown corporation responsible for operating the electricity market in Ontario, over 60 per cent of Ontario's hydro supply relies on nuclear power.
Kiwala called Kiley's strategy unrealistic, and said that the Liberals were dealing with an energy file already sunk by their predecessors.
“We inherited an energy file that was a grossly depleted system from the Conservatives,” said Kiwala.
PC Party candidate Gary Bennett shot back.
“When somebody has to go back to the last century to find someone to blame, it's really important in government that you accept responsibility for the situation that exists.”
But Wynne wasn't the only party leader discussed at the debate. Both Kiwala and NDP candidate Ian Arthur took aim at Ontario PC Leader Doug Ford, via Bennett.
“Across Ontario, this is turning into a race against the New Democrats and Doug Ford's Conservatives,” said Arthur.
READ MORE: Kingston and the Islands candidates play numbers game before provincial election
When it came to a question about Ontario's financial promises, Arthur jumped on Bennett, calling Ford's plans “scary and unaffordable.”
Arthur claimed that Ford's proposed tax cut plans would equal job losses of 28,000 nurses across Ontario. Arthur then turned to Bennett asking, “What nurses are going to get fired in Kingston?” to which Bennett answered, “None.”
Kiwala took shots at the PC leader as well.
“Kingston is not interested in Doug Ford as a leader,” said Kiwala. “There is a fear out there.”
While Bennett rebutted by saying that he sees the same type of fear being expressed about Kathleen Wynne.
Unexpectedly, common ground was found more than once between Bennett and Kiley.
“I find hanging around with Robert Kiley, I start agreeing with him with a lot of issues — not all issues, but some,” said Bennett.

Adam Schefter and Louis Riddick explore what could be next for Philip Rivers as he gets into the later stages of his career. (1:31)
Philip Rivers says he believes he has several years left as an NFL quarterback, but that when he does retire, he'd like to become a high school football coach for his sons when they are older.
The 35-year-old Rivers, who is under contract with the Chargers for three more seasons, told ESPN's Adam Schefter on his Know Them From Adam podcast that he feels good physically and still enjoys the preparation needed to be an NFL quarterback.
Editor's Picks Know Them From Adam Chargers QB Philip Rivers discusses how good Keenan Allen has looked in OTA's, the importance of getting Mike Williams healthy, how close they are to competing for a Super Bowl and his desire to become a high school football coach.
"I don't want to hang on at the end and just be a guy that's hanging on. But if I still feel like I can help a team and I enjoy it the way I do and more importantly, if the team feels that I can help them. ... I don't see myself shutting it down any time real soon," he said.
He said the team's move to Los Angeles doesn't affect that view of his future.
"I'm thankful to be a part of this organization and while it's hard for so many people, I'm excited about the challenge and the newness and the unknown that's going to come with being in a new community and playing in a new stadium," he said. "But we're going to still have that bolt on my helmet and I'm excited about what's ahead."
Rivers was selected to his sixth Pro Bowl last season after throwing for 4,386 yards with 33 touchdowns and an NFL-worst 21 interceptions. He has tied or led the league in interceptions in two of the past three seasons, but he also has thrown for more than 4,000 yards in four straight seasons. With 45,833 career passing yards, he ranks 12th on the all-time list.
Rivers, a father of eight children, has two sons, Gunner (age 9) and Peter (5). Rivers said he's "almost certain" that he wants "to be a head high school football coach," just like his own father, Steve. Rivers said he "doesn't want to put a number" on how many years he has left in the NFL, but he hopes "it's going to time up just right" so he can coach his sons and impact the lives of other young people.
"I want to coach my boys and coach those boys that are 15 to 18 years old," Rivers said.
"There's something about that 15- to 18-year-old boy, the time of their life that you can really impact them, not only on the field but off the field and still get the competitiveness that I love." Philip Rivers on why he wants to be a high school coach
"There's something about that 15- to 18-year-old boy, the time of their life that you can really impact them, not only on the field but off the field and still get the competitiveness that I love," he said. "I can't imagine ever not having a team, being a part of a team trying to win a game. Hopefully a handful of years down the road that's where I'll be."
Rivers came into the NFL in 2004, along with fellow star quarterbacks Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger. Rivers is the only one of the trio not to win a Super Bowl, but he said his peers' success doesn't add extra motivation to win a title.
"I can honestly say, Ben and Eli winning championships in no way adds more motivation to wanting to win one. Am I aware of that? Honestly. Do I know that we're always going to be linked as those three guys in that draft class? Absolutely, as we should. And that's the one thing that will always come up thus far, is that I'm the one of those three that hasn't been able to lead their championship," he said.
"I want to do it for our team, do it for the Spanos family, do it for the organization and just find a way to get to the mountaintop with our teammates," he said.
The Chargers are coming off 5-11 (2016) and 4-12 (2015) seasons, but Rivers said he believes his team is not "that far away from actually saying, 'We have a chance'" to win a title.
LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester United's new signing Alexis Sanchez scored on his home debut in a 2-0 win over Huddersfield Town as they took advantage of a slip by cross-town rivals and Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday.
After City had been held 1-1 at Burnley, their daunting lead over United was reduced to 13 points when Jose Mourinho's side eventually overcame a defensive Huddersfield side.
It took 55 minutes before Romelu Lukaku broke the deadlock after which Sanchez won a penalty, had it saved by Jonas Lossl, but tucked away the rebound in the 68th.
City paid the price for missed chances as they drew at Turf Moor with Johann Berg Gudmundsson's 82nd minute equaliser earning Burnley a point.
City had dominated possession but, after taking the lead with a fine strike from Brazilian Danilo in the 22nd minute, the visitors failed to press home their advantage.
Raheem Sterling produced one of the misses of the season from two metres out and Burnley made the most of that let-off.
“We are frustrated in terms of the result but the performance was outstanding against a Burnley side who are the most British of teams in terms of long balls and the way they play,” said City manager Pep Guardiola.

City have 69 points from 26 games, ahead of United on 56 with third-placed Liverpool (50) at home to Tottenham Hotspur (48), who are fifth, on Sunday, while Chelsea (50), in fourth, visit mid-table Watford on Monday.
RELEGATION BATTLE
Huddersfield's defeat at Old Trafford dropped them into the bottom three for the first time since being promoted as Southampton and Swansea City both moved above them.

Bottom club West Bromwich Albion lost 3-2 at home to Southampton on an emotional day at the Hawthorns, where there was a minute's applause for the home side's former striker Cyrille Regis, who recently died aged 59.
Albion led early on through Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi but were rocked by three goals in a quarter of an hour either side of halftime.
Southampton held on after Salomon Rondon's goal to secure a first win in 13 league games, leaving Albion four points adrift at the bottom with 20 points.
Improving Swansea earned a valuable point with Federico Fernandez's equaliser at Leicester City, for whom Jamie Vardy scored his 13th goal of the season in all competitions.
Bournemouth consolidated their place in the top 10 by coming from behind to beat Stoke City 2-1 and, on a good day for the south-coast sides Brighton & Hove Albion beat West Ham United 3-1 to draw level with them on 27 points.

LAHORE - Provincial Finance Minister Dr Ayesha Ghaus Pasha has said the Punjab will prepare the budged based on old National Finance Commission (NFC), as Islamabad is not holding any further inter-provincial meeting for next NFC award before the budget. She expressed these remarks while addressing a pre-budget seminar on Monday. The seminar was organised by Lahore Economic Journalists Association (LEJA). LEJA President Zahid Abid, Vice President Ashraf Mehtab, General Secretary Shahram Haq and other members were also present at the occasion.
Dr Ayesha said that the Punjab has a loins share, as it has around 57 percent share in national GDP; however, lack of coordination between provincial and federal departments is affecting provincial tax to GDP ratio. She said that recent property taxes in federal budget 2016-17 have also affected provincial revenues as people tend to find alternate measures.
She said that unfortunately tax culture is missing in Pakistan. Despite an increase in the country tax net and 42pc increase in Punjab Revenue Authority's tax collections, a lot of ground has yet to be covered by federal as well as provincial tax collecting agencies. She said that the impression that bureaucracy alone prepares the budget is not right, as the government conveys priorities and directions of budget which reflects almost all parts of life. She said that Punjab's debt is not at an alarming point. Normally 5-6pc of Provincial GRP is not as alarming as predicted, however currently Punjab's total debt is in-between 3-3.5pc of its revenues.
She said that the Punjab government will announce a people-friendly budget this year, in which social sectors will be the top priority in terms of resource allocations. She said the government is focusing more on provision of health and education for the last few years, and it will continue to allocate more on social sector in upcoming provisional budget thereby providing access to education, teachers' trainings and converting government schools on solar energy.

Dunbeg
Dunbeg Primary School was the first of only three schools in Argyll and Bute to be given a gold award recognising the achievement of pupils and staff in PE.
The School Sports Awards, run by Sport Scotland, encourages children to live an active life.
Lorna Jackson, from Sports Scotland, said: ‘You are now part of a really special bunch of schools in Scotland. You are the first to get your flag.'
The school won silver last year and was delighted to finally take gold, thanks to the year-long efforts of a pupil-led sports committee, teachers, parent coaches and Active Schools in Argyll.
Principal teacher Nicola Bichard, addressing the assembly room last week, added: ‘We have waited a long time for this. It is all down to your hard work.'
The other primary schools achieving gold status this year is Salen on Mull and Dalintober in Campbeltown.
Loch Lomond
The Home on the Loch restaurant in Arrochar has been taken over by new owners.
The premises, which is surrounded by Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, were on the market for £275,000.
Christie and Co said: ‘The Home on the Loch was sold in excess of the asking price.'
The new owners are Mario Gizzi, Paul Sloan, Tony Conetta and Calum MacLachlainn.
Mario and Tony own the Di Maggio's chain, which includes the Glasgow-based bar and and restaurant the Anchor Line, among other businesses.
Paul and Calum founded the Diversity Leisure Group in 2006, a pubs and hotels operator based in Oban, which owned the Ranald Hotel, as well as the Waterfront Fishouse.
Rothesay
The multi-million-pound restoration of Rothesay Pavilion is moving forward with the £10.6 million contract for the works being awarded to the main contractor, CBC.
Work on renovating the iconic international modernist building started at the end of November.
Councillor Gary Mulvaney said: ‘As a council, we are determined to make a real difference to the area by bringing both tourists and new jobs to the area and, with our partners, have invested millions of pounds to bring our pavilion back to life.
‘We will be working closely with the main contractor, CBC, to ensure that wherever possible there are opportunities to provide jobs, apprenticeships and support to the local community.'
The grade A-listed building will be transformed into a hub for cultural and community use and is expected to employ more than 30 people and attract over 70,000 visitors per year.
Western Isles
Young people on the Isle of Lewis will have more of a say in decision-making.
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's education, sport and children's services committee is aiming to increase young people's participation by establishing an Area Youth Forum.
The committee has agreed to launch the forum in order to cater to the community's needs.
Chairman of the committee, Angus McCormack, said: ‘I am very pleased that we are moving forward with a view to increasing young people's participation in the decision-making processes.
‘After all many of the decisions we make will affect them. Young people have an important contribution to make to our communities and by increasing their participation I think we will all benefit.
‘It is particularly fitting that we are undertaking this as we approach 2018, which has been designated as the Year of Young People.'
Ardfern and Ormsary
O2 has started work to bring 4G to Ardfern and Ormsary as well as improving 2G and 3G services.
O2 currently offers 4G in more than 16,000 cities, towns and villages across the UK and spends the equivalent of £2 million a day on strengthening its network and increasing its reach.
This comes as the telecommunications company has launched 4G in more than 80 locations across the Highlands and Islands this year, and has plans to add more locations in the coming months.
Connel
A retirement party was held in the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel earlier this year with all proceeds going towards testicular cancer awareness and battling the disease in Oban.
Peter Barr, Gordon Cowan and Davie MacPherson retired from SSE on June 30 of this year, with a combined 107 (and-a-half) years of service.
Instead of asking for leaving gifts, the three men asked colleagues to donate to testicular cancer awareness and the cancer ward in Oban, raising a total of £1,300 between them.
‘The reason we have picked these two causes for our donations,' Peter said, ‘is that we are all local to the Oban and Inverarary area, and there are not many families that have not been affected by cancer in one way or another.
‘As three men, testicular cancer is very prominent in all our minds and is also very close to our hearts as Davie's son has experienced the downside of this illness.
‘We hope that contributing to this cause will in turn help raise awareness of testicular cancer.'
Lerags
Around 70 people gathered at historic Kilbride Kirk, Lerags, on Saturday for the switch on of the Christmas star.
The open day was run by Friends of Kilbride, who asked people to fill out a survey on the day – ‘What does Kilbride mean to you?'
Those who couldn't make it for the switch-on can fill out the questionnaire online via www.friendsofkilbride.scot
Benderloch-based architect Shauna Cameron has developed a preservation plan which will ensure Kilbride can be safely accessed by coming generations of visitors.
Friends of Kilbride trustees expressed their gratitude for the input of
all those who made it such a happy occasion, and look forward to the
next time.
Grimsay
Ceann na h-Àirigh and Grimsay Post Office will be closed for the Christmas holidays, from Friday December 22 until Monday January 8.

Each fortnight local cooks will prepare a hearty and delicious soup and pudding lunch. Everyone is welcome.
Helensburgh
Charles Rennie Mackintosh's renowned Hill House in Helenburgh is set to be covered in a ‘colossal' cage.
The National Trust for Scotland plans to build the structure around the building to protect it from the elements.
The home was built between 1902 and 1904 as a ‘home for the future' by Mackintosh.
He built the dwelling for publisher Walter Blackie. However, the material used allowed water to soak into the building since the day it was built.
The aim of the cage-like structure will be to shelter the house from the West Coast weather and allow a long-term solution to be found.
Simon Skinner, the National Trust for Scotland's chief executive, said: ‘Not only will the structure allow us to keep the Hill House open to the public while our conservation teams are at work restoring the building to its original condition, it will become accessible to them like never before.
‘Within the enclosure, visitors will be able to climb stairs and gangways for a bird's eye view of Mackintosh's masterpiece and to get up close and personal to the genius of his design.
‘As a bonus, visitors can watch the restoration work as it progresses and then turn around to enjoy stunning views out over the Firth of Clyde.'
Islay
The Mactaggart Community Cybercafe's latest addition – Castaways – Port Ellen's nearly new and craft shop, opened to popular acclaim last month and proved a great alternative to the Black Friday chaos, offering an opportunity to spend for community benefit, according to The Ileach.
Now a survey, designed to solicit the views of the community, is seeking to establish support for future developments, and asking which potential improvements should be considered for the cybercafe, which celebrates its 20th birthday next year.
Ideas for improvements to the community space so far include: a community cinema, a birthday party space complete with bouncy castle, digital film-making and increasing the regularity of afternoon teas for older people.
Jim Trotter explains why it is prime time for Russell Wilson to return to performing at a high level. (1:08)
Defensive end Michael Bennett defended his quarterback Wednesday, saying the Seattle Seahawks can't win without Russell Wilson under center.
"On a team with competitive people, there are going to be issues that are going to happen," Bennett said during an interview on 710 ESPN Seattle's "Brock and Salk" show. "There are just a lot of alpha males running around, but everybody supports Russell Wilson. We can't win a game without Russell Wilson. Russell Wilson is a top-five quarterback in the NFL. We cannot win a game without a guy like that."

Bennett's comments come weeks after an ESPN The Magazine article about cornerback Richard Sherman, Super Bowl XLIX and division in the Seahawks' locker room.
Last week, Wilson called Sherman "one of the best teammates" he could ever ask for.
Bennett was asked how Wilson relates to the defensive players on the team.
"Russell relates best to me by just being himself," Bennett said Wednesday. "I think as a human being, you accept the person for who they are. You don't try to change them. You don't make them who you want to make them, who you want them to be. A person that reveals themselves for who they are is who you accept them to be. Russell has revealed himself to me as a great person of great character, a person that gives back and a great leader. Also a great player."
Sherman has not yet been made available to the media during Seahawks practices.
The team wraps up its mandatory minicamp Wednesday and Thursday before a break until training camp in late July.
Lahore - Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar, who is also known as Rawalpindi Express, has joined the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars as the team mentor.
“I am honoured to announce that Shoaib Akhtar has joined Qalandars family and he will mentor our players,” said Lahore Qalandars chairman Fawad Rana during a press conference held here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday, where Shoaib Akhtar, former pacer Aqib Javed, Atif Rana and young pacer Haris Rauf were also present.
Shoaib Akhtar, who has represented Pakistan in 46 Tests and 163 ODIs, said that he is excited to be part of Lahore Qalandars and keen to train young fast bowlers, spotted by the franchise during the players development program Jazz Rising Stars.
“I am honored and privileged to be a part of this, extremely excited and thrilled,” he said. “I want fast bowlers to perform aggressively and will mentor these bowlers to become what a fast bowler should be,” said the former bowler, who was once the fastest bowler in the cricketing world.
The Rawalpindi Express also praised Qalandars' talent hunt programme, saying that it would promote new talent and serve Pakistan in the longer run. “I have never seen a talent hunt program of such huge scale in my career,” he said.
Shoaib's first task with Qalandar family, as it seems, will be to mentor newly-found fast bowler Haris Rauf who – according to Aqib Javed – is one of the fastest bowlers in the present era. Haris was spotted during open trials in Gujranwala last month. The young bowler has also signed a contract with Lahore Qalandars franchise and will be part of team's development squad for the tour of Australia.

That, you may remember, was the title of a hit 1985 pop song. But 33 years later, pop has become prophecy.
What other conclusion can one draw from the tsunami of woman power now bearing down on us? As chronicled by the New York Times, CNN, NBC News, Time and others, 2018 has brought a record number of women  over 500  running for major state and federal offices.
Time reports that almost 80 women are considering gubernatorial runs, twice as many as the next highest year. And The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University tells us 396 women are running for the House, shredding the previous record, set in 2012 when 298 women ran. Though both parties are represented, the overwhelming majority of these upstart candidates are Democrats.

Woman power is also making itself felt behind the scenes. According to Time, veteran female political operatives are forming new support organizations designed to provide novice women candidates assistance with everything from fundraising to childcare.
Seen against the backdrop of our present dire political condition, there is something electrifying about all this. At a time when many of us are seriously pondering the viability of the nation, this burst of feminine political activity functions as a much-needed vote of confidence. One is glad for it.
One also wonders what took them so long.
The observation is made advisedly and with a healthy respect for the dangers of, um, man-complaining. Still, the question is unavoidable in an era wherein sexism more blatant than a Mad Men marathon has too often been met with a figurative shrug as if to say, What are you going to do?
That isnt to say women dont speak up. When Rush Limbaugh slimed Sandra Fluke, when then-Rep. Todd Akin seemed to suggest that a vaginal force field protects rape victims from pregnancy, when the rapist Brock Turner was let off with a six-month sentence, when the gender pay gap robbed both secretaries and movie stars, women in positions of authority and visibility certainly cried out.
But the point is, one heard no answering roar from the womens movement per se, sensed no critical mass of women blending their bodies, voices, time, talents and treasure into a sustained campaign to address such outrages. To one raised on the ERA, Shirley Chisholm and herstory, it felt disorienting. It felt ... quiet.
But the quiet just got loud. Actually, it began getting loud with last years massive post-inaugural demonstrations. Now, women have cranked the volume to 11 and broken off the knob. Impelled by the lout in the White House, the accused child molester who came thisclose to the Senate and the daily drumbeat of powerful men outed for sexual misconduct, they seem to have finally crossed some psychic Rubicon between anger and action.
And why not? Its absurd that 51 percent of the country has less than 20 percent of the seats in its legislature. Women are thus denied power to act on issues critical to them while the country as a whole is denied their wisdom, experiences and sensibilities.
Apparently, theyve had enough. Good for them. And for all of us.
At a time when our system feels faded and used, these women offer a timely reminder that a democracy always has the power to regenerate itself. All that is required is the will  and work  of the people. So this wave of woman power is an inspiration larger than gender. One hopes little boys are taking note, every bit as much as little girls.
Sisters are doin it for us all.

Now, maybe, the proverbial rocking chair on the porch is closer to reality for surfing legend Kelly Slater.
The 46-year-old 11-time world champion from Cocoa Beach has announced he will step away from the world tour after the 2019 season.
“My basic plan is to get myself really healthy, get ready for April next year, and make next year be my last year on tour and just be done with it,” he told World Surf League reporters in what seemed like a spontaneous statement at the time.
The announcement came on the heels of Tuesday's rare second-round elimination at the Corona Open in Jeffreys Bay, South Africa, where he lost to Jordy Smith 14.33-11.74. During his career, Slater has won 80 percent of his Round 2 matchups, according to statistics compiled by Surfagram.com.

Slater's retirement plans have been reinforced by Father Time, a couple of shattered bones in his right foot from a year ago and, more recently, a "turf toe" on that same foot in which ligaments are stretched in his big toe. His major broken foot injury occurred last July while free-surfing between heats at this same event in South Africa.
Despite an array of injuries throughout his career, such as broken toes and a well-worn back, surfing's "Superman" may have finally found his Kryptonite.
In his opening round Monday - his first tour appearance of the year - he finished third in a three-man heat with a score of 8.73 against Japan's Kanoa Igarashi (13.50) and Brazil's Italo Ferreira (11.94). Slater blamed being “rusty” for his performance and wave selection.

"I thought he looked amazing," said Melbourne Beach's Matt Kechele, a former touring pro who used to "bum fries" off a really young Slater in exchange for driving him to Sebastian Inlet. "He was only a couple of tenths out (at one point) and made one mistake. Overall, I think he surfed some of the best so far in that contest."
Kechele said he's familiar with the condition known as "turf toe."
"I've had that myself; you don't realize how much you use your toes until you're actually using them," he said. "It seemed like it was hindering him. The (broken) foot's healed but maybe he put too much emphasis on healing the foot and maybe the toes weren't strong enough and he hyperextended (the big toe). Through good nutrition, he might be able to get it better (soon), but it can take up to a year sometimes.

"(But) he said he's going to Tahiti. He feels his chances are a little better; he knows what his body is capable of doing. He fells comfortable and confident enough surfing on his backhand off his heel. On the Tahiti wave, you can be completely on your heels the whole time, through the tube, if conditions are right. Maybe he can find a brace for his toe."

It's not the first time the retirement word has been associated with the superstar, who has compiled 55 career Championship Tour victories (Tom Curren is second at 33). After winning his sixth world title, he took a three-year full-time break from 1999-2001 but came back stronger than ever.
There was also speculation that once Quiksilver was no longer his sponsor in 2014, he'd never come back.
And two years ago, he said he was going to give it one more good shot at a 12th world title in 2017. But a broken foot last July shelved him, except for a daring comeback at the Pipeline Masters in December, where he made it all the way to Round 5 on a foot he felt was only “65 percent” healed. He lost to Gabriel Medina on what many felt was a controversial no-interference call against the Brazilian.

Up next for Slater - should his foot allow him - is the Tahiti Pro Teahupoo event Aug. 10-21, followed by the inaugural event at his own Surf Ranch in Lemoore, Calif., Sept. 6-9. Slater surfed in that wave pool earlier this year during a Futures event that was nationally televised and looked impressive.

Next season, the WSL reportedly is proposing a major shift in the schedule, trimming the season to about eight months, including a championship playoff in Indonesia and and ending the schedule in Tahiti. A playoff, say among the tour's top six or eight surfers, could favor Slater. Overall, according to Surfagram.com, he has won 74 percent of his career heats.
This year's famed Pipeline Masters in December - an event Slater has won a record seven times - might be his last there because, as of now, Pipeline is not on the 2019 proposed schedule.

Also in the mix is the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, where surfing will be introduced as a medal sport. Slater, who recently said that would be a perfect way to end his career, would have to be ranked as one of the top two Americans after the 2019 world tour ends in order to qualify. Hawaii's John John Florence, Kolohe Andino and Sebastian Zietz; California's Patrick Gudauskas; and New Smyrna Beach's rising star, Evan Geiselman - should he qualify next season - would be among the contenders along with Slater for those two spots.

Pro surfing, like NASCAR in recent years, has lost much of its veteran star power. Just this Monday, Joel Parkinson, 37, the 2012 world champion, announced he would be retiring this season, following on the heels of last year's farewell tour by fellow Australian and three-time world champ Mick Fanning.
Two years ago, Satellite Beach's C.J. Hobgood, the 2001 world champion, stepped aside.
There was also 1999 world champion Mark Occhilupo retiring in 2009 and the untimely passing at age 32 in 2010 of Hawaii's Andy Irons, a three-time world champion who had created a “super rivalry” with Slater.

Now the tour's focus has swayed to the young guns such as Florence, 25, the two-time defending world champion, and Brazil's trio of Adriano DeSouza, 31, (2015 champion); Medina, 24, (2014 champion); and Felipe Toledo, 22, a former World Qualifying Series champion.
During his illustrious career, Slater has earned over $4 million on the circuit, became the youngest (age 20 in 1992) and the oldest (39 in 2011) to win world titles, and compiled an amazing 820 heat victories in 257 major contests.

WILMINGTON — Being a positive voice on and off the field is the goal of the Wilmington High School cheerleaders.
Over the summer they are volunteering weekly at the Clinton County Humane Society in Wilmington. Squad members are helping with basic care and providing socialization to the animals. The cheerleaders are enjoying their time with the dogs and cats.
Cheerleaders have also donated paper towels to the shelter, currently a much-needed supply, along with cat litter.
Following their assistance at the Clinton County Humane Society, WHS squad members with their parents will volunteer at the Little Miami Half Marathon, helping at aid stations and distributing water to the runners.
In the fall, the girls will be assisting at a special needs soccer game. They also help with Wilmington's Volley for the Cure event.
In past years, the cheerleaders have spent time caroling to the residents of Ohio Living Cape May during the holidays.
“Part of being a leader is representing one's team and community well,” said WHS Head Cheer Coach Sheena Henry. “By giving back to our community through volunteer work, the cheerleaders are making a positive impact on others.
“Community service is about helping those around us and putting others before yourself; this is an important lesson for every teammate to learn.”
Ilayna Busch serves as assistant coach, Ashley Davis assists with the squad's technique and strength training and Jaime Polston contributes to the success of the team as well.
Varsity squad members include Keeley Allen, Abigail Bowman, Mahqgany Collins, Leah Deck, Hannah Gaines, Kylnn Jordan, Olivia Lewis, Erica Preston, Kylie Price, Haley Reynolds and Adysen Watson.
The JV squad consists of Vanessa Addison, Bre Barnett, Elizabeth Custis, Elizabeth Grimes, Lani Mayer, Courtney Parker, Baylee Sedam and Makenzie Sweetman.
Squad members chose their 2018-19 motto, “Stay positive, work together, make it happen.”
In an effort to make the school year successful, WHS cheerleaders will hold several fundraisers, including camps for middle and elementary school cheerleaders, a car wash, their third annual cornhole tournament at Buffalo Wild Wings, and several others.
The cheerleaders are hoping to raise funds for upcoming camps they wish to attend, to buy tumbling mats, along with other needs.
If you would like to make a donation to the WHS cheerleaders, please contact Coach Henry at the high school.
Upcoming for the WHS cheerleaders will be their home UCA cheer camp July 27-30.

Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) donated Rs12.72 million to Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) for setting up a 10-bed Dialysis Unit at its satellite centre, Mehrunnisa Hospital (MH) here on Monday.
MD/CEO Syed Wamiq Bokhari presented the donation cheque to Professor and Director SIUT Dr. Syed Adibul Hasan Rizvi at their main premises on December 4 in the presence of officials from both organizations.
Speaking on the occasion, Bokhari reiterated PPL's resolve for the well-being of deserving communities through its diverse, need-based Corporate Social Responsibility Programme implemented in partnership with creditable organizations such as SIUT. PPL has been supporting SIUT for treatment of patients and provision of equipment.
Established in 1972 as an 8-bed ward within Civil Hospital, SIUT has now become a leader in providing free-of-cost, quality healthcare services for renal and gastroenterological diseases through a state-of-the-art facility in Ka-rachi. Besides, SIUT runs several satellite centres in remote areas of Karachi as well as Sindh to facilitate a large number of incoming patients.
MH was established in 2013 to provide in-and out-patient diagnostic, dialysis and lithotripsy services.
With the increase of urban development in Halifax and tourism season right around the bend, some residents say the city needs to better inform people of what parking options are available in the city's busiest districts.

Karachi-Pakistan's top-notch designers took the runway to showcase their latest collections at Pakistan Women Fashion by celebrating 70 years of independence at a local marquee on Sunday night.
The first day of PWF featured fashion presentation by Fahad Hussayn, Ahmed Bilal, FnkAsia, Lajwanti by Ana Ali, Adnan Pardesy, Nida Azwer, Sobia Nazir and Mehdi.
The fashion week left its audience stunned with his majestic stage, uniquely set for one of kind show. The red carpet that seems always crowed with celebrities was dull this time.
The aim of Pakistan Women Fashion was to represent the core values of traditional fashion shows in a modern new style reflecting the development of Pakistani designers and their creativity on the ramp.
Fahad Hussayn gave an edgy start to the fashion week and expressed his excitement with his collection. He showcased the true colours of summers which were wearable yet very stylish. It was a perfect blend of tradition and modernity that added sparkle in women's beauty. The acclaimed actor Mansha Pasha looked ethereal as she walked the ramp for the designer.
Followed by Huma Adnan of FnkAsia, the entire collection of her was an ode to Independence Day with modern day progressive men's clothing and women's wear. It was all about being forward thinking positive. Monochromes fused with denim were the key combination from menswear featuring loose fitted pants, long fitted pants, long collar shirts and vests. The women's wear stood out for its funky and stylish appeal. Embroidered jackets, silk printed kaftans, printed and embellished pants and organza sleeves were the key highlights. Black silk top with embroidered pants looked wonderful.
Ahmed Bilal was third to present his fall/winter collection on the runway which was a tribute to royalty. Each piece was a mélange of hues of gold, goti work and fine textures, which depicts nobility and supremacy. The luxurious collection colour palette was inspired by the Jaipur culture with a blend of modern cuts. Next collection was presented by Lajwanti, which gave patronage to the rich culture and heritage to the east, which depicts a Pakistani bride in all the grandeur of the golden era.
With work highlighting traditional ghagra choli lengha, khulli shalwar, antique style dupatta and lehenga among other iconic pieces.
Yousaf Bashir Qureshi known as YBQ took the stage and delivered a soulful song paying tribute to the country on 70th Independence Day.

One final aloha Sunday night for President Obama as he and his family leave Hawaii, wrapping up their last holiday vacation here while he's in office.
The First Family is now at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam where Air Force One is expected to take off soon.
As the president got out of his motorcade vehicle he was greeted with a round of cheers from a nearby crowd. Hawaii's dignitaries were also there to bid the family farewell.
Earlier in the evening, the First Family dined at Buzz's in Kailua, a tradition before the Obamas leave the islands.
The Hawaii departure marks the president's last before President-Elect Trump takes office.
Earlier in the day, President Obama spent his New Year's holiday out and about. He headed over the Koolau from Kailua, on this first day of 2017.
He skipped his morning workout on base and instead he and his family visited the East-West Center on the University of Hawaii Manoa campus.
He was joined by sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng as well as a big crowd of fans waiting outside the center to get a glimpse of the commander-in-chief.
Barcelona coach Luis Enrique floundered in the firing line on Wednesday after what he called a "disastrous" 4-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain left the Spanish champions on the brink of their earliest Champions League exit in a decade.
Enrique confronted a television reporter working for Catalan station TV3 after the match, while his tactics were criticised by Barça midfielder Sergio Busquets.
Barcelona sports daily Sport's front cover said "this is not Barça," while Madrid-based AS's headline ran "total disaster."
A former Real Madrid foe came back to haunt Barça as Angel di Maria scored twice. Further goals from Julian Draxler and Edison Cavani handed PSG the glorious European night they have craved since a takeover from Qatar Sports Investments six years ago.
The joint heaviest defeat in Enrique's three seasons in charge means they face missing out on the quarter-finals for the first time since losing on away goals to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2006/07.
"It was a disastrous night for us in which we were clearly inferior," Enrique acknowledged after the game.
"I accept responsiblity, but I would also like the same respect and personal treatment in the interviews when we win," Enrique said in a fiery interview with TV3.
Enrique's future at the Camp Nou beyond the current campaign was already in doubt as his contract expires at the end of the season. Barcelona also trail Real Madrid in the race for the Spanish title.
And Busquets's reaction in praising Enrique's counterpart Unai Emery for the tactical set up that caught the Catalans cold was telling.
"It wasn't an attitude problem, but a football one. They pressed more and were better tactically. They had a plan and carried it out as they wanted."
Sport described Barça as a "shipwreck without a coach".
"Barça fell in Paris without grandeur and without excuses," continued Sport's editorial.
"It was a tumultuous fall, from the first minute to the last...more than an accident, it manifested itself as an aggravation of many problems, some latent and others evident, that had already been shown up throughout the season."
Ageing core
Enrique's preference for Portuguese international Andre Gomes in midfield has been a particular bugbear for the press.
Gomes missed a huge chance to level with the score a 1-0 midway through the first-half.
Yet, humiliation in Paris laid bare broader failings in Barça's season on and off the field from the president down to the players.
Gomes was the most expensive of six summer recruits costing over 120 million euros ($127 million) designed to add greater depth and more youth to the squad.
Yet, none of them have made a significant impression with Barça still reliant on an ageing core of Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Busquets alongside the start front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar.
Meanwhile, suitable replacements for the departed Dani Alves and Xavi Hernandez from the Barça sides that won trebles under Pep Guardiola in 2009 and in Enrique's first season in 2015 have yet to be found.
The most immediate order of business for president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his board is to tie down Messi with the five-time World Player of the Year just over a year away from becoming a free agent.
Yet, worryingly for Barça's future, Messi and Suarez also turn 30 this year.
The punishment dished out to Enrique was only further evidenced by the praise lavished on Emery in his homeland.
Emery guided Sevilla to Europa League glory in each of the past three seasons and once again proved his worth on the European stage despite having managed just one win over Barça in his previous 23 attempts with Sevilla and Valencia.
"The Sheikh signed him for this," said Madrid sports daily Marca.
"What Carlo Ancelotti and Laurent Blanc couldn't do, Unai has within his grasp - eliminating Messi's Barça from the European Cup."
(Reuters) - Grammy-winner Dennis Edwards, who performed lead vocals for some of the chart-topping Motown singles recorded by The Temptations in the 1960s and 1970s, has died at age 74, his manager said on Friday.
Edwards died at a hospital in Chicago on Thursday night or Friday morning of complications from an unspecified illness, his manager Toby Ludwig said by phone.
The singer, who lived outside St. Louis, would have celebrated his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The Alabama-born Edwards replaced David Ruffin as lead singer of The Temptations in 1968.
Edwards sang lead on some of the vocal group's most memorable hits, including “Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,” a 1972 release that earned Edwards and the group two Grammy Awards, and “I Can't Get Next To You,” which topped the pop charts in 1969.
Edwards left The Temptations around the time the group left Motown to sign with Atlantic Records in 1977. He rejoined and left multiple times in the 1980s, when the group enjoyed far less success on the pop charts than in the previous two decades.
Edwards was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 as a member of The Temptations.

LOS ANGELES-Emma Watson has reportedly ended her romance with Chord Overstreet.
The 28-year-old actress reportedly began dating the former ‘Glee' star earlier this year, but according to sources, the new couple have already decided to call time on their budding romance.
An insider told The Sun's Bizarre column: ‘'Emma and Chord kept quiet about their relationship at first but they really hit it off.
‘'They spent a lot of time together in Los Angeles and were photographed quite a bit just a couple of months ago. ‘'But things just haven't worked out between them and they are both now single again.'' The ‘Harry Potter' star has since unfollowed Chord on social media.
Emma and the 29-year-old actor were believed to have struck up a romance after they were spotted leaving the Vanity Fair Oscars party together in March, but sources later claimed their relationship had actually been going on for longer than first thought. A source said at the time: ‘'They have been dating for a little bit now, but it's still pretty new. They met through friends. They might seem like an odd match but they actually have very similar personalities. ‘'It's crazy but, yes, they are seeing each other, although Emma wants to keep things quiet and private.''
Emma split from Silicon Valley tech company manager William ‘'Mack'' Knight last year after dating for almost two years. The actress likes to keep her romances private, however, so it's unlikely she will confirm the split any time soon.
She said previously: ‘'I want to be consistent: I can't talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can't have it both ways.
‘'I've noticed, in Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.''
DUBLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Ryanair has asked pilots in its home base in Dublin to bypass their trade union and directly accept a pay rise - even as it holds talks with unions across Europe to formalise its shock decision to recognise them.
Europe's biggest budget airline was forced last year to recognise unions for the first time in its 32-year history in order to avoid a Christmas strike, after it had to cancel 20,000 flights earlier in the year due to a shortage of standby pilots.
It made a breakthrough earlier this week when it secured a formal recognition agreement with British union BALPA, but unions in other countries, including Ireland, have said they are not happy with how the negotiations are proceeding.
Now, in the latest sign of discord, the airline has accused Irish union FORSA/IALPA of misleading pilots.
Ryanair says that the 65 percent of pilots in Dublin not represented by a union have accepted the pay increase, but that the 35 percent represented by FORSA/IALPA were refusing to do so.
“Ryanair has written to this 35 percent to allow them to individually accept these pay increases in February ... due to IALPA's refusal to hold a vote that they know they will lose,” Ryanair said in a statement.
“We will not stand idly by while they (FORSA/IALPA) delay and mislead our Dublin pilots,” the statement said.
In a letter to pilots making the offer, Ryanair management said that FORSA/IALPA had not responded since it sent a formal recognition agreement on Jan. 3. The union denies this, saying it has sent letters to management on three occasions since then.
In a letter sent on Wednesday seen by Reuters, FORSA/IALPA told Ryanair that pilots at meetings had unanimously agreed to reject Ryanair's pay offer unless Ryanair confirmed that the acceptance would not prejudice future pay talks.
The pilots are also demanding that Ryanair agree that FORSA/IALPA be recognised as the exclusive body for collective bargaining with Ryanair pilots based in Ireland and that the airline's system of agreements with individual bases be terminated, the letter said.
Unions from across Europe last week sent a letter to Ryanair demanding a joint meeting with management, a demand the airline has refused. (Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Alison Williams)
MADRID: Real Madrid will be without Gareth Bale in its Champions League quarterfinal against Bayern Munich on Tuesday.
Coach Zinedine Zidane said the forward has not fully recovered from a muscle injury in his right leg and will miss the second leg match at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Defending champion Madrid defeated Bayern 2-1 last week in Munich.
"He will not play because we don't want to take any risks," Zidane said on Monday. "He wants to come back, he has been working hard. Hopefully he will be back for the 'clasico' (against Barcelona) but it's not certain yet. We will see how he progresses day by day."
Madrid hosts Barcelona in the Spanish league on Sunday in a key game for the title race. Madrid, seeking its first league title since 2012, has a three-point lead and a game in hand.
Bale had to be substituted in the second half of the match against Bayern and missed the team's Spanish league match at Sporting Gijon on Saturday.
The Wales forward was out for nearly three months earlier this season after a right ankle injury.
Zidane did not say who will replace Bale, but Francisco "Isco" Alarcon — who scored twice to lead Madrid to a late 3-2 win over Sporting — is expected to start. Among Zidane's other options are Marco Asensio and Alvaro Morata.
"We'll see how we will play, if we will change our scheme or not," Zidane said. "I'm glad that everyone is prepared to play."
Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored both first-leg goals for Madrid in Munich, is set to start on Tuesday along with Karim Benzema.
If Isco or Asensio play, Ronaldo and Benzema would be more isolated up front, while Morata would allow Zidane to keep three true forwards in the attack.
Robert Lewandowski, who hasn't played since injuring his right shoulder against Borussia Dortmund on April 8, is expected to start for Bayern.
"Without a doubt he is a great player," Madrid defensive midfielder Casemiro said of the Poland striker. But he added: "Bayern has a lot of quality players and a great squad, we can't worry only about Lewandowski."

SHANGHAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks fell in early trade on Friday, with small-cap firms struggling and trading suspended in a slew of companies, amid concerns about a pending wave of margin calls and as some announced share purchase schemes to bolster fading confidence.
The CSI300 index fell 0.3 percent to 4,235.33 points at 0209 GMT, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.8 percent to 3,420.85 points.
ChiNext, China's Nasdaq-style start-up board, opened roughly 0.8 percent lower, but erased losses within 15 minutes of trading. Still, the gauge is heading toward its worst weekly loss in 21 months, and threatens to plumb three-year lows.
ChiNext volatility appears to have dampened sentiment in the broader market.
Trading in at least 20 companies was suspended on Friday in an apparent effort to avoid margin calls.
Meanwhile, major shareholders of a growing list of companies have announced plans to buy shares in their firms, stirring memories of the 2015 stock market crash that sent shockwaves across global financial markets. (Samuel Shen and John Ruwtich; Editing by Sam Holmes)
Legislatively Speaking

Remembering the Legislative Legacy of Vel Phillips
This weekend, like many from our community, I paid my respects to Velvalea Rodgers “Vel” Phillips. As I sat and listened to the many descriptions, stories and accomplishments that described the pint-sized warrior that lay beneath a spray of flowers, I couldn't help but feel a profound sense of loss. Vel represented our connection to battles fought, wars won, and the fierceness that helped African Americans secure many of the civil rights gains of our past.
I've often heard my contemporaries talk about what they would have done if they had lived during slavery, reconstruction, or the Jim Crow era of the 19th century. Strongly and boastfully, they often say what they wouldn't have tolerated or endured. Sometimes, I remind them that there were many people of that period, who did just that. Whether in uprisings, marches, boycotts, or a push for a change in the laws, people did fight back. Vel Phillips was one of those fighters. When put in perspective, you appreciate the courage of her actions, because death was a price paid by many who took up similar battles of the day.
Yet this tiny woman, who weighed less than 100 pounds, challenged historic institutional racism on a monumental scale. First arming herself with the needed education to wage battle, Vel Phillips was able to attend college via a scholarship she won in an oratorical contest at North Division High School. It was interesting to learn at her funeral, that school administrators didn't want her to win. The predominantly white student body protested to insure she was awarded her prize. That victory took her to Howard University and culminated with her becoming the first Black woman to graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School in 1951.
In the years that followed, Vel Phillips ran unsuccessfully for the school board in 1953 and later in 1956 became the first woman and the first African-American elected to serve on the Milwaukee Common Council. Vel participated in civil rights protests and proposed her first ordinance in 1962 to outlaw housing discrimination. Ironically, Milwaukee remains one of the most segregated cities in the nation today.
She would go on to become the first woman judge in Milwaukee County and the first African-American judge in state history. In winning her election for Secretary of State, Vel Phillips remains the only black person ever elected to statewide office in Wisconsin. For this remarkable woman, there were many more “firsts”. However, you knew that these accomplishments couldn't have been easy. I am thankful for the support that she had in her equally impressive husband, Dale Phillips. I am heartened to know that many in the community had her back. I appreciate her legislative legacy and the fact that she shouldered a heavy load so that modern day black legislators and women could serve. I value that she brought so many of us into the political fold. And therefore, the words “Rest In Peace” Vel Phillips, are more meaningful than ever.
A Kelowna man rolled out a unique Valentine's Day surprise Tuesday for his wife of almost 55 years.
Bill Nahirney surprised his wife with a giant snowman holding up signs bearing words of affection.
“I feel like I got the biggest valentine this year,” Denise Nahirney said.
Bill says the opportunity to do something out of the box presented itself this year because of the unusual amount of snow that's fallen in the Okanagan over the past couple of weeks.
“I bought my wife roses,” Bill said. “This was the card.”
AMMAN (Reuters) - Thousands of Jordanians heeded a strike call by unions on Wednesday to protest at major, IMF-guided tax rises they say will worsen an erosion in living standards.

Unions declared the walkout earlier this week, warning the government that sweeping tax amendments sent to parliament this month would impoverish employees already hit by unprecedented tax hikes implemented earlier this year.
Unions representing tens of thousands of public and private sector employees accused the government of caving in to International Monetary Fund (IMF) demands and squeezing a middle class hit by high prices while widening disparities between poor and rich.
Protesters at the headquarters of the Professional Associations Union in the capital Amman carried placards criticising the government and accusing politicians of corruption and squandering public funds.
“I can hardly afford anything with my salary. We are taxed for the air we breathe and now they are also looking to rip off our salaries. Everyone knows the law is unjust and it has to be withdrawn,” said Hatem Samara, an engineer.
The amendments, which would double the income tax base, are a key condition of a three-year IMF economic programme that aims to generate more state revenue to gradually bring down public debt to 77 percent of GDP in 2021.

The government has echoed IMF arguments that Jordan could be losing hundreds of millions of dollars through tax evasion and that only about four percent of citizens pay taxes.
The amendments lower significantly the income tax threshold and slap higher levies on banks and industrial firms at a time when economic growth has been stagnant amid regional turmoil and businesses have complained of shrinking consumer demand.
Jordan earlier this year raised taxes on hundreds of food and consumer items by unifying rates of sales tax at 16 percent and removing exemptions on many basic goods.
In January the government scrapped subsidies on bread, which doubled some prices in a country whose eight million people are suffering increasing unemployment and poverty rates.

The government argues the reforms will reduce social disparities by progressively taxing high earners while leaving low-paid public sector employees largely untouched.

… Over $600 per ounce Silver…$20,000 DOW
This work and the publications known as the ALTA reports began in 1997 with the first data gathering operations.
From that time, until this very day, the data sets have always had a ‘DOW (over) $20,000′ values set in place.
This set was discussed in radio interviews in the early 2000s as there were other elements within these sets including my infamous ‘silver (to be) over $600 an ounce' statements made through these decades. One needs grasp how rare it is for actual numbers to make it through the processing in order to appreciate the nature of the ‘$600 per ounce of silver' statement within the data that has held stable for over 14 years of these reports. These sets may not have had any growth for months at a time, yet when next resumed, the data sets would still reinforce the link between $600 silver and $20,000 DOW. Both of these numbers were beyond ‘strange', and completely into the world of ‘lunacy' in the early 2000′s. As was evidenced by all the hilarity and abuse i received over the subsequent years for those statements.

Clif's Interview with Greg Hunter:
2017 Predictions on Trump, Gold, Silver, Housing, Stocks, Bonds & Antarctica-Clif High
January 1, 2017
By Greg Hunter's USAWatchdog.com (Early Sunday Release)
Internet data mining expert Clif High says forget about the rumors and predictions of Donald Trump being blocked from taking office. High says Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President and explains, “I don't have any data that says, hard stop, Trump is assassinated. I don't have that . . . . I am willing to back my data with real money, an ounce of silver, and I have an ounce of silver, and I would be willing to bet the inauguration part goes through smoothly given the emotional data sets we have now.”
High, who calls what he does “Predictive Linguistics,” mines the internet and collects billions of data points to produce forecasts of the future. On the financial markets, High simply says, “We're screwed. . . . The equity markets in our data sets are highly manipulated. So, if you ask will there be a crash? I say there already is a crash. Everybody that is not part of the financial system at the top end is currently living in a depression, and the media does not acknowledge this.”
On the U.S. dollar and its purchasing power, High predicts, “The purchasing power is going to be eroded away fairly quickly. I suspect the erosion (of the U.S. dollar) is going to start in March or so. . . . The turning point for the Trump euphoria will hit at the end of February and carry on through March and April. There will probably be people that will define this as a crash. . . . In our data sets, around March and April, the erosion of the dollar continues . . . The Fed, in a laggardly way, starts to chase interest rates. . . . We may jump to 9% or 10% interest rates as quickly as March or April.”

District magistrate cum adjudicating officer, North Goa, Nila Mohanan has imposed a penalty of Rs 25,000 each on Durgaprasad Kukalkar, owner and Bahdur B K, of a fast food centre, Sankhali, under the provisions of the Food Safety and Standard Act, 2006, for selling ‘chicken pakoda' that contained non-permitted synthetic food colour.
Both admitted to the violation and also stopped the activity of operating the centre. The said sample of ‘chicken pakoda' was drawn by senior food safety officer Rajiv Korde of the Directorate of Food and Drugs Administration, Bambolim.
The said penal order was passed on September 20 and the case on behalf of state was represented by Purushottam Karpe.
About half of people may "remember" experiences that never happened, British research suggests.
Researchers analyzed "memory implantation" experiments with more than 400 people. The participants were told a fictitious event about their lives -- such as taking a hot air balloon ride during childhood, pranking a teacher or causing a major disturbance at a family wedding -- and asked to repeatedly imagine the event.
About 50 percent of the participants came to believe, to some extent, that they had actually experienced those false events, according to the researchers at the University of Warwick.
The findings could prove significant in many areas, such as raising questions about the validity of people's memories in forensic investigations, court proceedings and therapy sessions, the researchers said.
The results also suggest that the memories of large groups of people could be wrong due to influences such as false news reports, the researchers added.
"We know that many factors affect the creation of false beliefs and memories -- such as asking a person to repeatedly imagine a fake event or to view photos to 'jog' their memory," said study author Kimberley Wade, an associate professor of psychology.
"But we don't fully understand how all these factors interact. Large-scale studies like our mega-analysis move us a little bit closer," Wade said in a Warwick news release.
"The finding that a large portion of people are prone to developing false beliefs is important. We know from other research that distorted beliefs can influence people's behaviors, intentions and attitudes," she explained.
(Reuters) - Outgoing Federal Reserve Bank Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday that solid economic growth, faster wage increases, and a tightening labour market mean the U.S. central bank is likely to need to continue to raise interest rates gradually, as it has signalled it will.
“The economy is growing at a healthy, solid pace,” Yellen said in an interview with PBS NewsHour on the last day of her four-year term. “The job market is strong and inflation is low ... The Federal Reserve has been on a path of gradual rate increases, and if conditions continue as they have been, that process is likely to continue, and as it do we would expect long rates to move up.”
On Saturday she hands the reins to President Donald Trump's pick to replace her, Governor Jerome Powell. She will stay in Washington as a fellow at the Brookings Institution, the think tank where former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke also works.
Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings is exploring investing in Saudi Arabia in the wake of the kingdom lifting its 35-year-old ban on cinemas.
AMC announced Monday that it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. “In line with the Fund's mandate to help unlock promising new sectors within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, PIF and AMC Entertainment will explore a range of commercial opportunities for collaboration that will support the growth of the Kingdom's entertainment sector,” the company said.
AMC said the agreement builds on Monday's announcement of the General Commission for Audiovisual Media's decision to grant domestic licenses to cinema providers, and supports the Vision 2030 objective of growing household spending on entertainment from 2.9% to 6.0% of gross domestic product.
“PIF sees huge potential in the Kingdom's entertainment sector,” the PIF said. “We look forward to working with AMC Entertainment Holdings to explore opportunities in developing an industry that is expected to be around USD 1Bn in size.”

Cinemas were banned in the 1980s as they were considered a threat to religious and cultural identity. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been driving a program of social and economic reforms under the Vision 2030 banner, and rescinding the cinema ban is part of that drive.
“This announcement is an historic moment for the theatrical exhibition industry and a tremendous opportunity to connect AMC's movie products with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's more than 30 million citizens, many of whom we know are movie fans based on their regular visits to cinemas in neighboring countries,” said AMC CEO and President, Adam Aron. “Saudi Arabia represents a lucrative business opportunity for AMC Entertainment, and no one does the cinema experience on a global scale better than AMC.
“As such we believe AMC is in a unique position to put the industry's best foot forward in expanding the magic of the movies to an important country that is in the process of opening up entertainment opportunities for its citizens.”
AMC has approximately 1,000 theatres and 11,000 screens. It's been owned by China's Dalian Wanda Group for the past five years.

BEIJING, Aug 12 (Reuters) - A peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue is needed, Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Saturday, and called on the "relevant side" to exercise restraint, state television said.
It is in the joint interests of China and the United States to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and to achieve its denuclearisation, Xi said, it added.
Trump issued a new threat to North Korea on Friday, saying the U.S. military was "locked and loaded", as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war and world powers expressed alarm. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)
It's taken nine months, but the Vancouver housing market may have finally shaken off the foreign buyers tax, data from a home price index suggested on Wednesday.
The Teranet-National Bank of Canada House Price Index showed that Vancouver home prices grew by 8.2 per cent year-over-year in May, and 1.46 per cent month-over-month.
Coverage of Vancouver real estate on Globalnews.ca:
At 252.30, the index reached its highest level since September 2016, which was one month after a 15 per cent property transfer tax on foreign buyers came into effect in Metro Vancouver.
The index has fluctuated since then, hitting as low as 242.64 in December.
Meanwhile, data provided by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) showed the composite home price for Vancouver hitting $941,100 in April, the highest it's ever been.
The composite had dropped from $933,100 in August 2016, when the tax first came into effect, to $896,000 in January, but now it appears to have recovered.
House prices largely remained unchanged in the eight months following the tax's introduction, as noted in a chart released by BMO economist Douglas Porter on Tuesday — a marked contrast with growth of 20 per cent in the months before it came into effect.
But the ninth month appears to have bucked the trend.
At 8.2 per cent, Teranet said Vancouver house price growth was strong, but it was still below the national average.
READ MORE: Vancouver real estate could experience ‘market whiplash' as home sales jump: report
Toronto's housing market saw the strongest price growth, jumping 3.6 per cent month over month and setting a “record for any month,” Teranet said.
Home prices there jumped by 28.73 per cent year over year, a rate that also topped all other cities.
Toronto's home price growth is expected to take a breather with the implementation of the Fair Housing Plan, which includes a 15 per cent tax on non-resident speculators in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area, which includes Toronto, Niagara and Peterborough.
Like in Vancouver, experts expect the effects of the plan to be short-lived.
Up to 16 units in a Barrhaven townhouse complex have been affected by a three-alarm fire that broke out Wednesday morning, Ottawa fire officials say.
The stacked units are located at 601 Chapman Mills Dr., between Longfields Drive and Woodroffe Avenue.
Investigators are trying to determine what caused the blaze.
The fire department said on social media they received a 911 call reporting a fire on the exterior of the building just before 8:30 a.m.
Shortly after 10 a.m., Ottawa Fire Services spokesperson Danielle Cardinal tweeted that flames were still present in the roof and attic space but that crews were in the process of extinguishing and monitoring the fire closely.
Officials said paramedics were assisting people with reportedly minor injuries.
The Salvation Army and Ottawa Red Cross are reportedly also providing food and support to residents displaced by the blaze.
Fire officials have asked commuters to avoid the area.

The WGA and Hollywood's major studios have ended contract negotiations for a week while the guild conducts its strike authorization vote. The sides have agreed to resume talks on April 25, the day after the guild concludes the voting to authorize a work stoppage.
The decision will leave negotiators just four business days to hammer out an agreement before the May 1 expiration of the current contract.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers put a new offer on the table last Thursday, after four days of talks. The new deal was said to include proposals addressing one of the WGA's key concerns, the compensation structure for lower-rung writers working on short order series. A source close to the situation described the offer as a small improvement from the WGA's perspective but cautioned that the sides are still far apart on other points.
The guild's strike authorization vote will begin on Wednesday and conclude April 24. The conflicts at the bargaining table this time around are the closest that the industry has come to a broad-based strike threat in a decade, since the last WGA work stoppage that ran Nov. 5, 2007 to Feb. 12, 2008.
The WGA and AMPTP have been operating in a news blackout while negotiations are ongoing. It's unclear if the sides will meet again on Tuesday. The WGA is hosting membership meetings in Los Angeles and New York on Tuesday and Wednesday evening to discuss the state of contract negotiations and rally scribes behind the strike authorization vote. The WGA and major studios held two weeks of talks that began March 13.
The sides resumed talks on April 10, after the WGA initiated the strike authorization vote. The WGA rejected the first offer made by the studios on March 23, saying it was inadequate to address the economic pressures that writers face amid the massive shifts in the entertainment business, particularly in television.
Last week multiple sources reported that the sides had made some headway on one key issue involving the way writers are paid when working on so-called short order series (running less than 22 episodes per season) with long production timetables.
The guild is pushing to bring fees for shows produced for cable and streaming platforms up to parity with broadcast series, and higher compensation for writers on shows where the work schedule for scribes runs more than two weeks per episode — a growing problem for writers on cable and streaming shows. The so-called “span” issue was the subject of much discussion in the negotiating room earlier this week, sources said.
The AMPTP's new proposal is believed to basically accept the WGA's proposed formula for boosting writer income on short-order shows but would limit those gains to the lower-rung writers on a show, and would exclude writers working under overall deals and highly paid showrunners and exec producers. It's not clear if that targeting is structured by job classification or salary level.
The TV compensation issues are a direct result of the massive growth in series production and the evolution of the business from long-established norms of what constituted a TV season. The TV components of the WGA's 600-page Minimum Basic Agreement are largely rooted in an industry defined by the traditional September-May, 22-episode season, but those shows are no longer the norm in TV.
Eyelids are a Portland-based psych pop outfit featuring current and former members of The Decemberists, Guided by Voices, Drive-By Truckers, and The Jicks. Along with their internal star power, they also count such acts as Robert Pollard, Elliott Smith, Stephen Malkmus, and Grandaddy's Jason Lytle as past collaborators.
Following their 2015 debut album, 854, Eyelids are gearing up to release a follow-up titled or next month. For assistance on the 12-track collection, the band has called on one of its famous friends in Peter Buck.
The R.E.M. co-founder and lead guitarist not only produced the entirety of the LP, but he also stars in the music video for its latest single, “Falling Eyes”. Directed by Chris Slusarenko & John Clark, it finds Eyelids rescuing Buck from what might otherwise have been a catastrophic birthday shindig.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Comparisons aren't Nick Saban's thing.
They're not fair, Alabama's 65-year-old head coach will say with some degree of annoyance in his voice, noting how they don't take into account the different circumstances from one season to another. It doesn't matter if he's comparing one set of star linebackers to another, like the duo of Dont'a Hightower and Rolando McClain or C.J. Mosley and Reggie Ragland, he's not willing to play the game. He just doesn't like it.
“Look, I don't compare anything to anything,” Saban told reporters a month ago.
But Saban's hard-and-fast rule doesn't always extend to his players. Case in point: Jerry Jeudy. The freshman receiver has been on campus less than four months and already he's being hailed as the next Calvin Ridley. Keep in mind that Ridley, a junior, is still on the team.
“He's similar to Calvin,” said cornerback Anthony Averett, “they're very similar. That's who I compare him to.”
Even Calvin Ridley sees the similarities between himself and freshman receiver Jerry Jeudy. Phelan M. Ebenhack for ESPN
“The only thing different is probably Jerry Jeudy is little bit taller than Calvin. That's it,” said fellow receiver Cam Sims. “They're both nightmares for a DB.”
Even Ridley sees the similarities.
In fact, he was one of the first players to make the comparison, and that was after one day of practice.
“I think Jerry is like me when I first got here,” Ridley said, knowing full well that he was referring to his freshman year in which is racked up 89 catches, 1,045 yards and seven touchdowns. “He's really good.”
Ridley not only wants Jeudy to put up similar numbers this season, but he also wants him to surpass them.
“That's my boy,” Ridley said.
With good reason. Ridley and Jeudy grew up in the same area of South Florida, played in the same youth football leagues and hung out with many of the same people.
Even when Ridley would play street ball with Jeudy's older brother, he was always there.
“I already knew he was going to be good,” Ridley said.
Calvin Ridley good? That would be something.
Remember that as a freshman Ridley was compared to Amari Cooper, who again was from the same part of South Florida, played in the same leagues and they knew one another. They were both roughly 6-foot-1, too.
Thanks to an injury, Ridley entered the starting lineup early as a true freshman in 2015 and quickly became one of the SEC's best young receivers.
Now, less than three years later, Jeudy could make it three South Florida receivers in a row to make it big at Alabama. He's one inch taller than Ridley, but they both have a similar game based on elusiveness. They get out of their breaks with such ease and fluidity. Like Cooper, there's a certain effortlessness to their games.
When Saban spoke about his receivers early this spring, he mentioned only one rookie.
“Jerry Jeudy has really done well,” he said.
With a deep group of receivers, including Ridley, Sims, Robert Foster and Trevon Diggs, it won't be easy for Jeudy to crack the starting lineup. Given Alabama's move to the spread in recent years, it's not unlikely that he could find himself playing in meaningful situations.
What's more, Diggs is experimenting on defense this spring, and Foster is a wild card with tremendous upside but very little in the way of production after three years on campus.
Like with Ridley, an injury or permanent position change could open up the door for Jeudy.
If that happens, don't be surprised if you see a familiar receiver catching passes on the outside for Alabama. It's not Ridley or Cooper. It's Jerry Jeudy, the next in line.

Ford Arts, Beats & Eats organizers are promising big things for the 20th anniversary of the festival this year.
This festival will be off the charts and rival any event in the United States, said Jon Witz, producer of the event which drew more that 400,000 people to Royal Oak last year over the Labor Day weekend.
Though names of performers wont be released until later this summer, Witz said the event will have the most amazing and expensive music lineup the festival has ever hosted since it began, with 200 bands on 10 stages.
Witz and sponsors Wednesday announced new and expanded features for the four-day festival from Sept. 1- 4, including a gaming competition, yoga classes to replace the 5K and 10K runs, a veggie cafe and new culinary treats.

Its hard to imaging this is our eighth year in Royal Oak, said Michael Gingell, chairman of the Oakland County Board of Commissioners. County Executive L. Brooks Patterson initiated the festival back in the 1990s and it was held in Pontiac until moving to Royal Oak in 2010.
With sponsors and charity group tie-ins, Gingell said the festival this year will exceed $5 million in charitable contributions to service and charity groups since its inception.
The economic impact from the music, foot and arts event is expected to be about $10 million in Royal Oak and $25 million in the region. Gingell said. Arts, Beats & Eats has been good for Royal Oak and many city non-profit organizations, stated Mayor Michael Fournier.
It has really become one of the key elements in the tapestry that we call Royal Oak, he said.
New sponsor Flagstar Bank this year is hosting Flagstar Culture on Fourth, with visual and performing arts that will include highlighting the diverse culture in southwest Detroit.
The culture stop on Fourth between Washington and Lafayette avenues will include an exhibit by the community arts education collective Garage Culture that is led by musician Ismael Duran. He will perform with his band on the Flagstar International Music stage along with other global musical performers.
Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort is set to offer a gaming competition on Sixth Street where festival goers can play blackjack, roulette and other games in an air-conditioned, tent to win the most chips. The chips pay off with prizes such as stays at Soaring Eage Resort in Mount Pleasant and VIP tickets to concerts.
Artists from the Zibiwing Center for Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe will also display their work at the Soaring Eagle exhibit.
The ABE Vegan Cafe is featuring food from GreenSpace Cafe and the Nosh Pit Detroit food truck as part of health at Sixth and Washington for those who enjoy plant-based food choices.
New indulgent foods at this years festival include steaks from Troys Sedona Taphouse, Bonefish Grill seafood, Italian food and grilled cuisine from Carrabbas, and smoked barbecue from Lazy Bones Smokehouse in Roseville.
Thrive Hot Yoga, based in Farmington Hills, and Citizen Yoga in Royal Oak are scheduled to offer large group classes at 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m Sunday, Sept. 3 with the $10 and $15 fees benefiting non-profit groups such as the Spina Bifida Association of Michigan and Humble Design, which helps people moving out of homeless or abuse shelters.

IPL 2018: 3 players Mumbai Indians could have used RTM on instead of Kieron Pollard
Mumbai Indians committed a huge blunder by buying Pollard and that cost them a spot in the playoffs.
Prathik R CONTRIBUTOR Top 5 / Top 10 30 May 2018, 16:53 IST 9.38K Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Jos Buttler
Mumbai Indians had an extremely disappointing IPL season, failing to qualify for the playoffs despite possessing one of the strongest squads on paper.
In the auction, they bought the likes of Evin Lewis, Ben Cutting etc to strengthen the squad, but they made a huge mistake by using one of their 2 RTM cards - they had already retained Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya prior to the auctions - on Kieron Pollard.
It came as a surprise to many as Pollard wasn't in the greatest of form leading up to the tournament. Also, the fact that he doesn't bowl any more made the decision to buy him all the more perplexing.
There were many other players in the Mumbai ranks from the previous season whom they could have bought back instead of the West Indian all-rounder, who scored a meagre 133 runs from 9 matches this season.
Here, in this slider, we look at 3 players Mumbai should have used their RTM card on instead of Pollard - three players who could have helped them make the top 4.
#1 Jos Buttler
Buttler is arguably the best limited-overs batsman in world cricket today and the fact that he went to Rajasthan Royals for just INR 4.4 crore is astonishing. Buttler started off the season poorly but after being promoted up the order, found a new lease of life.
Buttler struck five consecutive half-centuries - including two 90s - singlehandedly carrying his side to the playoffs. He finished with 548 runs at a strike rate of over 150 this season and could very well have gotten a lot more had he not flown off to England for national duty just before the playoffs.
Mumbai had Evin Lewis at the top but he misfired more often than not, meaning they often got off to slow starts and could never make up the run rate thereafter. With Buttler at the top, that would not have been a problem.
Rawalpindi-The law enforcement agencies have arrested three persons on charges of keeping narcotics and illegal weapons during a search operation in Dhoke Khaba in precinct of Police Station Waris Khan, sources informed on Monday.
The LEAs also recovered arms and ammunition, narcotics, liquor and telephone sets being used for match fixing by the bookies, they said. The detainees were shifted to police station for further investigation, sources said.
According to sources, police, Rangers, Pakistan Army and personnel of other intelligence agencies, under Operation Raddul Fassad, carried out search operation in Dhoke Khaba (controlled by PS Waris Khan) and checked 225 houses and 35 shops besides grilling a large number of people. The LEAs held three people for keeping illegal weapons and narcotics and moved them to police station where cases were registered against them, they said.
The LEAs also recovered 4 pistols of 30 bore with 6 magazines and 75 bullets, 10 cartridges of 12 bore rifles, 80 litre pack bottles of liquor, 23 tins of alcohol, 69 tins of bear, 10 V Wireless phones, 1 laptop, 2 internet Wingles, cash Rs95000 and 2500 grams of Charas from their possession.
SP Rawal Division Behram Khan, in a separate move, suspended Station House Officer (SHO) Police Station Ratta Amral for poor performance.
According to details, SP showed SHO the door for not taking effective action against drug peddlers in his precinct.
Meanwhile, fire broke out in third floor of a house located in Ward 6 of PP-9 while reducing the house-holds into ashes. However, no causality or injury was reported. Rescue 1122 firefighters rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire.
Dozens of Winnipeg transit users took to City Hall on Monday to speak out against the city's proposed 25 cent fare increase.
Riders, businesses and community groups gathered to voice their displeasure with the hike the day before city councilors vote on the proposed 2018 budget.
User Annie Beach said that while it's only a quarter per bus ride, it can add up quickly.
“25 cents per ride can make a huge difference,” Beach said. “It would mean picking up a few extra hours at work if I can squeeze it into my schedule and trying to make sacrifices in parts of my life so I can afford to ride the bus.
“Transit is already difficult to try and afford as is, so a 25 cent increase will make a huge difference.”
Beach has been riding the bus since she was a baby with her mother.
READ MORE: Winnipeg Transit rates on the rise, routes possibly cut: City of Winnipeg budget
“I ride transit and my family has relied on transit heavily throughout my lifetime,” Beach said. “It's really important to me that it remains affordable and accessible to everyone. With Winnipeg being as sparse and laid out like it is you really need transit.”
Beach was just one of dozens outside of City Hall Monday, many holding signs and chanting. The MGEU, ATU and Functional Transit Winnipeg were all present.
Organizer Basia Sokal said she was happy with the vocal turnout.
“25 cents is a huge increase for people who are living on a fixed income and people who are already living with the effects of wage freezes because of the province,” Sokal said. “[This is] an attack on workers and our most vulnerable citizens.”
The city already annually raises bus fare five cents.
READ MORE: City of Winnipeg releases list of 22 routes that could face cuts, service reductions
Inside City Hall, Councillor Russ Wyatt told Global News he is against the fare hike — pointing instead to other places the city can make up needed money.
“We should find funds in the existing budget to ensure that the city can operate a transit system that doesn't increase the fares,” Wyatt said. “[The money can come] from six-figure salaries and from capital projects that are not fully funded at this point and out of touch with what citizens want to see. We don't need changes to Portage and Main.
“Don't wreck it. Don't mess up the transit system.”
Wyatt is just one of the councillors that will cast a vote on the tabled budget Tuesday morning.

2017 Debt Crisis Looms: Congress Will Have 4 Days To Avoid A Government Shutdown On April 29
April 11, 2017
April 2017 could turn out to be one of the most important months in U.S. history that we have seen in a very long time. On April 6th, Donald Trump attacked Syria on the 100th anniversary of the day that the U.S. officially entered World War I, and now at the end of this month we could be facing an unprecedented political crisis in Washington. On Friday, members of Congress left town for their two week “Easter vacation”, and they won't resume work until April 25th. What this means is that Congress will have precisely four days when they get back to pass a bill to fund government operations or there will be a government shutdown starting on April 29th.
Up to this point, there has been very little urgency by either party to move a spending bill forward. It is almost as if everyone is already resigned to the fact that a government shutdown will happen. The Democrats will greatly benefit from a government shutdown because they can just blame the entire mess on the Republicans. But for the GOP, this is essentially the equivalent of political malpractice.
To me, there is simply no way that Congress is going to be able to agree on a bill that funds the entire government in just four days. And it turns out that this upcoming deadline comes exactly on the 100th day of Trump's presidency…

THE Saint Lucia National Trust (SLNT) will host its 4th Annual Trust Pioneers Lecture on Wednesday, April 19, themed “None would go…but Vagabonds: British Supremacy in the Caribbean – Story of the 2nd Duke of Montagu”.
Over the years, these lectures have aimed to raise the level of awareness of the Trust's role in heritage conservation by providing a platform for individuals from all sectors of society to engage in stimulating and comprehensive discussion on heritage related issues. This year, the event forms part of the Trust's celebration of World Heritage Day observed annually on April 18 and will take place at the Bougainvillea Conference Room at the Bay Gardens Hotel in Rodney Bay from 6:15 p.m.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday reported a profit near $2 billion, the largest in its history, as the online retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime fast-shipping club for the holiday season and as changes to U.S. tax law added to its bottom line.
Shares rose more than 6 percent in extended trading, after previously closing down 4 percent on the Nasdaq.
Seattle-based Amazon is using fast shipping, television shows exclusive to its website and forays into new technology, such as its voice-controlled Alexa devices, to attract high-spending Prime members. Amazon said price cuts at Whole Foods Market, which it acquired for $13.7 billion last year, are helping it win grocery sales, too.
The world's largest online retailer said net income more than doubled to $1.86 billion, or $3.75 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Its profit received a provisional $789 million boost from the U.S. Republican tax bill passed in December. Analysts on average were expecting just $1.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (tmsnrt.rs/24gibla)
“This was another blow-out quarter for Amazon,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives. “The retail strength was eye-popping as the company had a banner holiday season and looked to capture roughly 50 percent of all e-commerce holiday season sales.”
As expected, the period running from before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Years was Amazon's biggest-ever by revenue. Sales rose 38 percent to $60.5 billion in the quarter, beating estimates.
The company's fast delivery, like its two-hour Prime Now service, has helped win over holiday shoppers eager to avoid the crowds of big box retailers. Prime saw more than 4 million sign-ups in one week alone last quarter, and revenue from subscription fees grew 49 percent to $3.2 billion, Amazon said.
That figure is expected to rise this quarter in part because the company recently raised the fee for month-to-month Prime plans, affecting some 30 percent of subscribers, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. Some 60 million, or close to half of all U.S. households, are estimated to have Prime subscriptions.
Advertising and other revenue rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts that advertising was “a key contributor” to the company's growing profit margin. Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday reported ad revenue of $27.2 billion by comparison.
Perhaps the surprise star of the past quarter was Amazon's voice aide Alexa, embedded in the company's Echo speakers and Fire TV players, as well as some cars and house gadgets. Millions of Amazon customers ordered goods by voice with Alexa in the past year, said Olsavsky on a separate call with reporters.
“Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,” added Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, in a statement. “We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.”

HEAVY SPENDING
Amazon's stock has outperformed the S&P 500, rising almost 50 percent since the start of the fourth quarter to Thursday's close, compared with the S&P's 12 percent rise.
Its shares trade at a premium to those of many peers. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 12 times that of cloud computing rival Microsoft Corp, for instance.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises, saw its profit margin expand from the third quarter.
This was a “sign of platform strength despite increasing competition,” said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian in a research note.
AWS posted a 45 percent rise in sales to $5.1 billion.
Amazon said it expects operating profit in the current quarter of between $300 million and $1 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.5 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.
Olsavsky, Amazon's CFO, told reporters, “We're still in heavy investment mode.”

The company has become notorious for running on a low profit margin. Yet its big bets on new services and entry into new industries have reaped shareholders rewards over the past decade, including its founder Bezos, now the richest man in the world.
Amazon continues to spend on a wide array of areas. It is expanding its retail footprint outside the United States, particularly in India, and almost doubled its international operating loss to $919 million in the fourth quarter. Amazon's global headcount is up 66 percent from a year ago at 566,000 full-time and part-time employees, thanks to a hiring spree and an influx of workers from Whole Foods Market.
And earlier this week, it announced a partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Berkshire Hathaway Inc to determine how to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.
The company said it plans to spend more on video content this year as well, with a prequel television series to “The Lord of the Rings” in the works. Analysts estimate Amazon spent $4.5 billion or more in 2017.
“Revenue and margins vastly exceeded expectations, and cost control was impressive, so that's what people are focused on,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, adding, “It's clear that they will spend a lot more in 2018.”
KARACHI - Like other parts of the country, the 70th Independence Day was celebrated in financial hub of the country on Monday with great zeal and fervour.
The day dawned with 21 guns salute in the provincial capital. Special prayers were offered in mosques for the integrity and solidarity of the country. Various colourful ceremonies were organised in this connection.
Youth in large number celebrated the Day in the city with traditional zeal, many of them raced their bikes on the city streets.
Almost every road of the city witnessed young people dressed in the national flag colours with decorated bikes chanting slogans and singing national songs. Thousands of people including women and children came to the Mazar-e-Quaid to pay homage to the Father of the Nation. Massive traffic jam was witnessed across the city as number of families came on the roads to mark the Day.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah along with Governor Zubair Ahmed and cabinet members performed flag hoisting ceremony and laid wreath on the grave of founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. They offered fateha for him.
Talking to media, Governor Zubair Ahmed said that the country is moving forward on the path of development and prosperity. He added that investment was necessary in Karachi for fast-track development of the port city. He pledged that the government would work on improvement of infrastructure in the city.
“Quaid-e-Azam came to this house after partition; he lived here and also made decisions that changed the fate of our nation,” he informed.
Zubair paid tribute to Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his colleagues in the Muslim League who strived for Pakistan's independence.
“Those were difficult times. We should work hard and take Pakistan further,” he said, adding that looking back to 1947, we have achieved a lot. “We recognise our mistakes but also need to tell the youth we are in a much better place than before,” said the governor.
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said that Sindh Assembly was the first legislature to pass a resolution for Pakistan. He said that all the martyrs should be remembered on Independence Day. He said that 1973's constitution was a consensus document.
Chief Minister said “the independence was achieved with great sacrifices of our elders and now it becomes our responsibility to protect the sovereignty of the country.” He added that the terrorists were trying to undermine the country but “our people are united against them and they (terrorists) would never succeed in their nefarious designs.
He strongly condemned Quetta blast and expressed solidarity with the bereaved families.
“Today, we should remember all those who lost their lives in the struggle for separate homeland and fighting against terrorists,” he said.
Talking about current political situation, Sindh Chief Minister further said that PML-N opposed the amendment in cluases-62 (1)(f) of the constitution when 18th amendment was being passed and now it is being proposed.
He said that when the constitution of 1973 was being restored in its original shape by making 18th amendment they [PML-N] opposed amendment in clauses 62(1)(f) strongly. Therefore, both the clauses were left in the constitution unabated. “Now they (PML-N leadership) has shown its inclination and intention to repeal both the clauses, 62 (1)(f), let us see what political leadership of PPP decides would be followed accordingly. Had it been amended or repealed in those days things would have been different, he said.
Earlier, an impressive change of guard ceremony was held at mausoleum of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Naval Academy cadets, clad in ceremonial dresses, assumed ceremonial guard duties at Mazar-e-Quaid.
Commandant Pakistan Naval Academy, Commodore Adnan Ahmad graced the occasion as chief guest and reviewed the guard. The chief guest and cadets of Pakistan Navy presented Qaumi Salam to the Father of the Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The ceremonial guard mounting was followed by laying of floral wreath at the Mazar-e-Quaid by the chief guest on behalf of Chief of the Naval Staff, officers and men of Pakistan Navy.
Later on, the chief guest offered fateha and recorded his remarks in the visitor book and paid rich tribute to our beloved Quaid.
Pakistan Navy Ships and Establishments were illuminated in Navy's traditional manner. Flag hoisting ceremony was also held at designated unit of Pakistan Navy.
Various other activities including singing of national anthem at naval units in the morning, PN Band Display at Frere Hall Karachi, flag hoisting ceremony at Pakistan Maritime Museum as well as various sports fixtures were also a part of day-long celebrations. Independence Day celebrations at Pakistan Navy educational institutions were also held where schoolchildren presented tableaus on national songs and declamation contests were held highlighting the importance of Independence Day.
On the other side, spectacular air show of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) held at the Sea View beach was the attraction of the day and this event was attended by a large number of citizens. On the occasion, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah while addressing the Air Show said that this day (August 14) reminds us the sacrifices made by millions of Muslims of the subcontinent to have a separate homeland.
He said it was August 14th when Muslims of subcontinent were able to get a land of their own, where they could live a life according to their religion. “On 14 August 1974, we gained independence after remarkable efforts made by our father of nation Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah who was a man of great calibre and had the conviction that Muslims of this land could live happily when they would own a country led by their own people and a country where they could shape up their life in accordance with Islam,” he said.
The chief minister said that the dream of Pakistan was conceived by our beloved poet Allama Iqbal but realisation was achieved under the visionary guidance of Quaid-e-Azam. “The able leadership was even acknowledged by his worst enemies,” he said and added “it was Jinnah who fought the case of Muslim nationhood.
Murad Ali Shah said “this day demands from us to make a pledge today that we will make efforts to build Pakistan into a more prosper and strong country even if we may have to sacrifices our lives”.
He said that he wants to extend his heartfelt felicitation to Pakistan Air Force for arranging an excellent celebration. “In fact, this mega activity reflects the love and affection for our motherland. I am sure that this jubilant event would enhance the prestige of our armed forces in the eyes of our civilian brothers”.
He added “our armed forces have time and again demonstrated their capabilities and have rendered great humanitarian services during war and peace time”.
Pakistan People's Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto visited the mausoleum of Quaid-e-Azam and laid wreath and paid homage to him.
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Senior Minister and President PPP Nisar Khuhro, Speaker Sindh Assembly Agha Siraj Durrani, Home Minister Suhail Anwar Sial, Manzoor Wassan, Mumtaz Jakhrani, Sardar Shah, MPA Saeed Ghani and other Senators, MNAs and MPAs were also present on the occasion.
Meanwhile, Mayor Karachi while speaking in the flag-hoisting ceremony held in KMC building, said that the large scale participation of citizens of Karachi in Independence Day programmes provided proof of their immense love for our homeland. Deputy Mayor Dr Arshad Vohra, Municipal Commissioner Dr Asghar Abbas, City Council Parliamentary leaders Aslam Shah Afridi, Aman Khan Afridi, Firdous Naqvi with other staff in large number were also present on this occasion.
The mayor congratulated citizens on 70th Independence Day and called this a good omen that people of Karachi participated in large number with traditional vigour and enthusiasm in programmes held in connection with the Independence Day celebrations.
He praises efforts of KMC officers and elected representatives to make these programmes successful by their hard work and commitment.
The ceremony was also addressed by the deputy mayor Dr Arshad Vohra who said the elected representatives of Karachi have this responsibility on their shoulders and they have to deliver.
A flag-hoisting ceremony was organised at DHA SKBZ College and DHA Model High School Phase-IV on 14 Aug 2017. The Administrator DHA Brig Shahid Hassan Ali hoisted the national flag followed by the national anthem sung by the students of DHA Education Institutions.
The administrator during his remarks went over the history of the creation of Pakistan, the contribution of youth for the creation of Pakistan and sacrifices of the people of Pakistan. The administrator emphasised the need for students to remain patriotic, committed and cognizant of their role as Pakistanis in their respective areas of responsibility. He accentuated the need to live by the national guiding principles of ‘Unity, Faith and Discipline' in every walk of life.
Administration of Asia's largest makeshift Cattle Market celebrated Independence Day. Administrator of the market Syed Irshad presided over a flag-hoisting ceremony.
The NCAA's board of governors will discuss esports at its scheduled meeting in October after holding a preliminary conversation last week.
University administrators want to better understand what role the NCAA can or should play in the video gaming sports world.
The Next Level, an organization dedicated to covering the business of esports, estimated in May that 40 schools were devoting more than $4 million in scholarship money to 655 players.
A number of universities offer scholarships to esports players that can cover the full cost of tuition, room and board.
The National Association of Collegiate Esports is the governing body for more than 20 schools that offer scholarships. The group's executive director, Michael Brooks, said he would want to see major changes in the NCAA structure.
"The majority of varsity programs have been built intentionally to stay separate of the NCAA's oversight, mostly due to the restrictions of operating under the NCAA's bylaws," Brooks said. "Unless there are some pretty dramatic exceptions being considered specifically for esports, the NCAA would be unlikely to be able to absorb esports under its banner."

After a daylong meeting, federal finance minister Bill Morneau and his provincial counterparts have agreed to a 75/25 per cent split of marijuana tax revenue, with a majority going to the provinces. Ottawa originally pitched a 50/50 split with the provinces, but that idea was rejected.
“We believe, especially in the startup years, that most of the cost is going to be incurred by the provinces,” Saskatchewan finance minister Donna Harpauer said.
The federal share of tax revenue will be capped at $100 million annually. Estimates for marijuana tax revenue reach up to $400 million according to Morneau.
This deal will be in place for the next two years. After that, it will be renegotiated.
“We're going to come back together in December 2018 to look at how the market's working and how the federal government, the provinces, municipalities, are dealing with this change, and of course we'll stay very much on top of this,” Morneau said.
“But after two years, it's time to rethink the approach to make sure we're getting everything right.”
READ MORE: Ottawa agrees to give provinces 75% of marijuana tax revenue
As for what this split means for Saskatchewan, Harpauer said the potential impact of the balance sheet is unknown.
“It's uncharted territory, so that becomes part of the challenges that the provinces are having. We don't know what our revenues will be nor do we know our total costs,” she explained.
The various provincial ministries are still tabulating associated costs of marijuana legalization. Harpauer added that it remains to be seen how much of the federal government's legalization budget will go to help with costs in areas like public health education.
Ottawa has budgeted $1 billion over five years for legalization costs.
Additionally, the finance ministers agreed to keep taxation relatively consistent. Ottawa has already announced a 10 per cent tax on marijuana, or one dollar per gram.
Economics associate professor at the University of Regina, Jason Childs said this doesn't leave much room for additional taxation outside of basic sales tax.
“The further the price gets above the black market price or the illegal price, the less activity we're going to see in the legal market and it's self-defeating,” he said.
“Remember the objective here is to keep this out of the hands of youths.”
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): President Mamnoon Hussain has
said as the nation happily hoists the national flag today, it
needs to reiterate the strong resolve to always uphold the
values of determination and dedication for the objective of
development of Pakistan.
“Today let us make a firm commitment that we will adhere
to our national objectives and goals. This will pave the way
for better governance. It will lead to maturity of democratic
traditions and will also strengthen the process of national
progress,” he said in a message on the Independence Day.
“Let us join hands for development and prosperity of the
motherland by keeping aside our differences. Let us promote
love and harmony by overcoming hatred and misgivings and
secure the future of our nation by turning despondency into
hope in order to celebrate freedom in its true sense,” he
added.
Seventy years ago while struggling for freedom, the
elders had resolved that this nation through constant
endeavors would make this country a cradle of peace,
brotherhood and a welfare society which would be an example
for the world to follow, he noted.
The president said in the wake of challenges confronted
by the country today, it was imperative to promote moderation
and rationality while availing the available opportunities.
He said in such a situation, it is necessary to unite
under the Constitution in the national interest by setting
aside differences and ensure its supremacy.
“The Constitution is a document which will show us the
path to realize national objectives by rising above our
personal interests.It will also guarantee progress and
stability of the motherland as a manifestation of national
aspirations, God Willing,” he added.
The military is busy conducting operations against militants for quite a long time now; the menace of terrorism is yet to be solved.
Boasting about military's gains against terrorists, Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR), Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, in his latest press conference denied the existence of any terrorist group's operation cells inside the country.
However, the blast in Jhal Magsi district of Balochistan on the very same day suggests that we not take his words seriously.
Despite crackdowns and comb operations, organizations as diverse as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), Thereek Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and Islamic State (IS) have targeted different cities this year.
While it is true that terrorist attacks have declined because of military's successful operations, by no streach of the imagination can it be said that the terrorists have been expelled from the country.
That fact was on full display after the suicide attack on the shrine of Pir Rakhel Shah in Fatehpur, a town of Jhal Magsi district this Thursday.
While the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations, Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, (DG ISPR), is in the state of denial regarding the presence of Islamic State for some time now, others are not.
Various people have expressed their fears about IS gaining sympathy and recruitment from different parts of the country.
ISIS has claimed responsibility for the latest blast that has claimed the lives of 20 innocents including one security official and three children.
Only recently, individuals have reported instances where the flags, and pamphlets replete with the myopic worldview of the organization.
It is important to consider the fact that in the result of military operations against religious extremism, these extremist organizations are continually evolving.
In this, they are one step ahead of security establishment of the country.
It is important to recall here that the activities of IS were reported for the first time in the year 2014 against the backdrop of operations against TTP in two agencies of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), i.
e.
, North Waziristan and Khyber Agency.
What is needed is to acknowledge the presence of the organization and stop deluding ourselves about the efficacy of our operations.
It is about time that military gives up the fiction of “no IS in Pakistan”.
It needs to get its head out of the sand and act swiftly in nipping the evil in the bud
WASHINGTON – Two minor tremors were detected on Saturday from near North Korea‘s nuclear test site and were probably aftershocks from the country's massive nuclear test in early September, a U.S. Geological Survey official said.
The aftershocks, of magnitude 2.9 and 2.4, were detected at 1:13 a.m. and 1:40 a.m. EST respectively, said the USGS and Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.
A tweet from Zerbo said analysts had confirmed that the activity was “tectonic” in origin.
READ MORE: North Korea earthquake a sign of instability at nuclear test site, say experts
The USGS official said the tremors had been in the vicinity of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where North Korea conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear test on Sept. 3.
“They're probably relaxation events from the sixth nuclear test,” the official said. “When you have a large nuclear test, it moves the earth's crust around the area, and it takes a while for it to fully subside. We've had a few of them since the sixth nuclear test.”
Pyongyang said the September test was of an H-bomb, and experts have estimated it was 10 times more powerful than the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
A series of quakes since then has prompted experts and observers to suspect the test might have damaged the mountainous location of its site in the northwest tip of North Korea, where all of the country's nuclear tests have been conducted.
South Korea's spy agency told South Korean lawmakers in October that North Korea might be readying two more tunnels at the site.
READ MORE: North Korea says nuclear war is inevitable as U.S., South Korean military exercise continues
North Korea hinted its next nuclear test could be above ground after U.S. President Donald Trump warned in September that the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened America.
Another possible obstacle to North Korea's use of Punggye-ri for tests is the nearby active volcano of Mount Paektu, which North Koreans consider a sacred site. Its last eruption was in 1903, and experts have debated whether nuclear testing could trigger another.
North Korea's official media reported on Saturday that national leader Kim Jong-un had scaled Mount Paektu with senior military officials to “emphasize his military vision” after completion of the country's nuclear force.
Kim declared the nuclear force complete after the test of North Korea's largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile last month, which experts said puts all of America within range.

The present NDA Government has completed four years in office. This is as good a time as any to review the economy in terms of what has been achieved. However, a non-partisan review should also look at what could have been achieved. With cricket heavily in the air, it is tempting to use some of it's terminology. Has the Modi Government reached the slog overs in a limited over match? Or is it the fourth day of a five test series with both sides evenly poised? Did to make the best use of the pitch batting/bowling first?
It must be pointed out that the economic performance in the four years has been quite good, with GDP growth clocking an average of 7.3% per annum. This of course, is assuming that the CSO's estimate of 2017-18 growth rate is correct. Going just by the numbers, this is a tad lower than the average growth of UPA 2 in the previous five years which was 7.5%. But considering the two massive disruptions caused by demonetisation and GST and their prolonged effect on the economy, it should still rate as good performance. Going forward, economy shall not be held back due to these two reasons. Economy apart, polity is a mixed bag. While the NDA has added state after to its tally, taking the count now to 21, yet there is a perception that it finds itself on slippery ground now.
During these four years, two reforms-resolving large NPA's through the route of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and GST will be cherished as game changers. IBC is a reflection of the strong political will to back up RBI in it's attempt to cleanse the banking system. It is chugging on nicely. It is a remarkable reform because it draws curtains on crony capitalism; at least a section of our industry chieftains were brazenly defaulting on their loans without the fear of losing their companies. Most of the implementation issues of GST, too, seem to have been resolved and monthly collections have now crossed the one lakh crore mark! Just look at how much time we took, first, to make up our minds to usher in GST and then to implement it. It was first announced by Manmohan Singh as finance Minister in 1991; it took all of 26 years to see the light of the day. Demonetisation, though was not an absolute disaster, it still did cause unnecessary disruption that took a much longer than expected time for return of normalcy.
The Government has achieved reasonable success in macro-economic management in terms of curtailing fiscal deficit to 3.5% in 2017-18 from over 5% in 2012-13. Of course, it did benefit from windfall gains that accrued due to fall in international oil prices, almost magically, as soon as new NDA Government assumed office. It must however, be said to it's credit that it did not squander away the opportunity, choosing not to pass on the entire benefit to consumers. Instead, it used the gain to reign in deficit, spend heavily in infrastructure, especially roads and railways, and also hike outlays for social and rural sector. For example, it increased the spending on employment guarantee (which is actually a proxy for rural unemployment insurance) besides several other welfare initiatives such as Ujwal Yojana. As per an estimate, the Government must have made a windfall gain of around 8% of GDP due to oil prices sliding in it's initial years. Whether a better use of this huge chunk could have been made is a moot question. The US and China built big ‘war chests' of reservoirs of oil during these lean years which we too embarked upon, but did not do solid progress. If we had saved for a rainy day, wouldn't that have now helped when the oil prices have sky rocketed?
While the Government did well in social sectors, there were disappointments in disinvestment, tax terrorism (Vodafone and Cairns still are unresolved, while Nokia required direct PM's intervention), stagnating private investment, lack of reforms in education, agriculture and manufacturing are lagging behind because the hurdles are not addressed. Farm distress, distressingly, has become a recurring theme. Job creation has become all the more challenging due to a host of factors like increasing use of artificial intelligence like robots, global developments and slowdown and manufacturing operating on an average at three-fourth of it's capacity.
Yes, in case of India, historically, it is about incremental improvements and changes, not just as a nation but also as a civilization. But it can also cope up with a ‘big push' at times as was successfully proved by PM Narsimha Rao in 1991.

MILAN, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Italian private equity fund Investindustrial is set to gain a controlling stake in British carmaker Aston Martin by the end of the year and aims to list the company next summer, Il Messaggero newspaper reported on Sunday.
Investindustrial is in advanced negotiations to raise its stake in the maker of the famous sports car driven by fictional secret agent James Bond to 50 percent from 37.5 percent, the Italian newspaper reported, citing legal sources.
The fund, which is led by founder Andrea Bonomi, would buy shares from other stakeholders, including a consortium of Kuwaiti investors, which currently holds 54.5 percent, Daimler and the group's management, the report said.
Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer has repeatedly said that the decision and the timing of an IPO were matters for the shareholders but that it made sense for them to consider the option before the end of the company's turnaround plan, which is due to complete in 2022.
Based on the recent financial results achieved by Aston Martin, the banks that would be involved in the initial public offering (IPO) are aiming for a listing of 5 billion euros, five times the value of the company when Investindustrial bought into it five years ago, the report said.
Aston Martin is on course to post its first annual pre-tax profit since 2010 helped by strong demand for the luxury automaker's DB11 sports car.

A Kaneohe man accused of killing his childhood friend six years ago has pleaded guilty.
Joel Botelho was shot and killed in January 2011 outside his parent's home following a fight at a Kaneohe bar.
Makuola Collins was convicted of his murder in December 2011, but the conviction was later overturned.
On Monday, Collins pleaded guilty to manslaughter, a lesser charge that carries a lighter sentence, as well as a firearms charge.
In court, he came face-to-face with the victim's family. The experience provided some much-needed closure.
“Speaking with Maka and hearing him admit what was done and that he wants to move forward and he wants to make things right, I think that's what we needed to hear as parents,” said the victim's father, Chris Botelho.
“We're done. We're good,” said mother Nonohe Botelho. “We will now have to find that healing and it's so important, like I said, to see Maka's eyes finally, and I did that.”
Collins faces up to 20 years in prison for the manslaughter count. Sentencing is scheduled for September.
Botelho's death inspired a change in law that broadens the offense of first-degree murder.
Known as “Joel's Law,” the offense includes circumstances in which the defendant intentionally or knowingly causes the death of a person by restraining and using that person as a shield, holding that person hostage, or for ransom or reward.

“We do know that there were multiple shooters in this case,” Sgt. Lee said. “We are still looking for information from people in the community.”
Lee said the department interviewed a number of persons of interest but weren't able to pinpoint a “real” suspect. He said cases like this one, where people will not come forward with substantial information, are very frustrating.
“We know that somebody out there has information regarding this,” he explained. “We've been begging and pleading with the community to come forward with information for us.”
For Shemiko Means, Antonio Means' widow, not knowing who killed her husband is the hardest part.
“I could be walking past them on the street,” Means said. “We're just dealing, you know. Just getting by.”
Means said raising her two sons through this tragedy has been difficult.
“I'm bringing my 13-year-old to the vigil tomorrow,” Means said. “He looked at me before he left for school today and said, “Mom, it's just going to be one of those days.” That's hard.”
Antonio Means' friends will hold a balloon release and prayer vigil for Means and Hill at the housing project where they were killed on Saturday at 4:45 p.m.
“I went back there on his birthday to remember him,” Means said. “I know tomorrow is going to be hard.”
Means and Sgt. Lee are asking the community to please come forward if they have information, including the people responsible.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's has increased the reward to $13,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the people responsible for the crime.

MADRID (Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo has received an offer to leave Real Madrid and join Italian champions Juventus, a source close to the player told Reuters on Wednesday.
Soccer Football - Champions League Final - Real Madrid v Liverpool - NSC Olympic Stadium, Kiev, Ukraine - May 26, 2018 Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo gestures as he celebrates winning the Champions League with the trophy REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Files
Ronaldo, who joined Real from Manchester United in 2008 for a then world record 80 million pounds ($105.65 million), is the Spanish club's all-time top scorer with 451 goals in all competitions and has won two La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies with them.
Despite the glut of silverware, however, the five-times world player of the year has had frequent fallouts with Real and has declared on several occasions that he wants to leave the club.
Moments after lifting a third consecutive Champions League trophy by beating Liverpool 3-1 in the final on May 26, Ronaldo appeared to suggest he had already decided to leave Real, telling a television reporter on the pitch at Kiev's NSC Olympic Stadium: “It was beautiful to play for Real Madrid.”
Ronaldo, 33, appeared to backtrack on that statement during Real's celebration parade through the Spanish capital the next day, when he told a mass of supporters: “See you next season.”
The Portugal forward was reported to be on the verge of leaving last June after a news story appeared in Portuguese newspaper Record declaring he was unhappy with the club.
He also caused a stir in 2012 when he declared in a post-match interview after a game with Granada: “I'm sad and the club know why.”
Spanish newspaper Marca suggested on Wednesday that Ronaldo is unhappy at Real because they are searching for a successor to him and president Florentino Perez has publicly courted Paris St Germain forward Neymar, urging the Brazilian last year to come to Madrid if he wants to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award.
Ronaldo scored two goals against Juventus in Real's 4-1 win in the 2017 Champions League and struck a jaw-dropping bicycle kick against the Italians in a 3-0 win in a quarter-final first leg game in Turin which prompted Juve supporters to give him a standing ovation.
The Portuguese converted a stoppage-time penalty in the second leg to knock the Italians out 4-3 on aggregate.
Ronaldo had an explosive start to the 2018 World Cup by scoring a hat-trick in his side's 3-3 draw with Spain and he hit the winning goal in a 1-0 win over Morocco. He missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Iran and failed to score in his side's 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in the last 16.

A 21-year-old woman is in critical condition after crashing her ATV on Saturday.
Officers say the crash happened in a field off Provincial Road 27 East just after 4 p.m. in the RM of Hanover, just east of Kleefeld.
When police arrived on scene the woman was suffering from life threatening injuries and was transported to hospital.
A passenger of the ATV, a 20-year-old woman, did not sustain any injuries.
Alcohol is not believed to be a factor and the driver was not wearing a seat belt or helmet.
RCMP continues to investigate.
Police have charged a man in connection with an alleged sexual assault Friday in the southwest Calgary community of Parkhill.
Officers were called to a home in the 200 block of 42 Avenue S.W. shortly after 5:30 a.m., after two women contacted police, reporting they had been held against their will.

Police said the two women arrived at the home in the early morning hours on Friday to “meet an acquaintance.” They said during that time one of the occupants of the home sexually assaulted one of the women.
Investigators said Monday the tactical unit was called in and at about 11 a.m., three people were removed from the home.
James Etienne, 22, of Quebec, is facing one charge of sexual assault.
Police said the two others were taken in for questioning but were released without charges.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Calgary Police Service at 403-266-1234 or contact Crime Stoppers.
Kareem Hunt will remember a lot of things about his rookie season. He rushed for a league-high 1,327 yards, his Chiefs won the AFC West and he beat the Patriots.
He'll also remember playing with Alex Smith. The Chiefs' starting quarterback for the past five seasons is reportedly being traded to the Washington Redskins.
"He was a great leader," Hunt says. "He knew a lot about life, he taught me a lot, he's been around for a long time, so I was just happy to get to meet a guy like that. Alex was a great guy and he always was there for me if I had any questions about anything. I actually had Thanksgiving at his house."
Smith even cooked for his teammates that day. His food -- and his league-high 104.7 passer rating -- were not enough to retain his starting spot in Kansas City. Instead, the Chiefs are going with Patrick Mahomes, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.
"Like a day after the draft, Pat messaged me on Twitter, just saying, 'It's go time, we're going to be in KC together for a long time, so here's my number,'" Hunt says. "After that, we just started texting and became really good friends."
As for Mahomes' actual game -- he only played once in the regular season -- Hunt has seen more than outsiders have. He's had a front row seat for Chiefs practice for the past year.
"He's just a competitor," Hunt says. "He always wants to be successful and no matter what, he was always giving the defense a good look and just going out there and trying to make plays against the starting defense the whole time, and you know, he's a guy who has a very strong arm. He's putting passes in places that I don't think he should be putting them there. Also, he's got a very strong arm. He's a strong kid. He's able to break tackles and still make throws, and he always keeps his eyes down the field."
The Alex Smith/Kareem Hunt Era was high-powered, but short-lived. Let the Patrick Mahomes/Kareem Hunt Era begin.
Hunt spoke to ThePostGame on behalf of Pepsi Rookie of the Year, which went Alvin Kamara. Hunt, Christian McCaffrey, Leonard Fournette and Marshon Lattimore were the other finalists.

LOS ANGELES-James Corden has been thinking about returning to the UK to do some acting again.
James Corden wants to return to acting.
The ‘Gavin & Stacey' star has spent the past three years hosting ‘The Late Late Show' over in America but he has admitted he doesn't want to do presenting ‘'forever'' and would like to live out the rest of his career performing and writing.
Speaking to The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column, he said: ‘'I don't want to do ‘The Late Late Show' forever. I feel in my bones I'm a performer, a writer or an actor. ‘'I adore this show - every single day I love it. What I don't want this to do is to become just another job.''
The 39-year-old actor - who has three children; Max, seven, Carey, three, and Charlotte, six months, with his wife Julia - is also desperate to get back to the UK because he wants to be around for his parents as they get older and frailer.
He explained: ‘'We're a really long way from home, a really long way away from people who are getting older. That plays on my mind a lot.''
James' concerns about the future may play a part in whether he decides to extend his contract with the ‘Late Late Show' as they're keen to have him for another two years.
His five-year contract with CBS - thought to be around £10 million - will expire in 2020 but bosses are desperate to keep him at the helm following his global success and have offered him a new two-year deal worth £8 million.
A source said recently: ‘'The feeling is that James deserves a significant pay hike.''
And, although his presenting skills have been heavily praised by fans across the world, James admitted at the time that he was anxious about how the US audience would perceive him because not many people over there had heard of him until then.
He also introduced the segment Carpool Karaoke - in which he drives around Los Angeles alongside music stars including Adele and Jennifer Lopez as they sing their biggest hits - and decided to have more than one celebrity sitting on the famous sofa.
He said at the time: ‘'What I wanted to bring to the show is unpredictability, so you're never really sure what's going to happen.''
The Camanachd Association and Highland Print Studio have announced that four shinty clubs have been selected to take part in a joint project which will see an artist working with each club over the next 18 months to create a series of prints celebrating the contemporary culture and heritage of Scotland's iconic indigenous sport of shinty.
The successful clubs are Beauly, Fort William, Newtonmore and Skye Camanachd. Each artist will work with their selected shinty club and with the help of players, fans and volunteers, will learn about the club, past and present, and produce artworks that will become a visual legacy for the club.
Skye Camanachd, President, Douglas MacDougall said “This year is a significant milestone in the history of Skye Camanachd as, we celebrate our 125th anniversary. To be involved in this innovative visual project with the Highland Print Studio which further promotes shinty whilst recognising our island culture and heritage, is quite appropriate and welcomed by the club and our supporters.'
Camanachd Association President Jim Barr added: ‘Sport and Culture are part of the glue that keeps communities strong and vibrant. We are delighted to be working in partnership with the Highland Print Studio on this project which is destined to deliver memorable results for the clubs involved and shinty in general.”
The work produced will form an exciting touring exhibition and a vehicle for promoting the sport to a wider audience. As there have been very few visual documentations of the sport, this is a great opportunity to create something ground-breaking.
Highland Print Studio is a visual arts organisation based in Inverness and has a history of commissioning artists to work on innovative projects. After linking with the Camanachd Association, the Studio has been successful in gaining an award from the Highland Culture – Take Pride, Take Part Investment Fund to commission artists to create a series of prints celebrating the contemporary culture and heritage of Scotland's iconic indigenous sport of shinty!

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne has been fishing for a potential merger partner or buyer for the past couple of years.
His goal is to find someone willing to share the burden of steep capital costs the auto industry demands. Now it seems that one party has finally bitten.
Automotive News (subscription required) has learned from a source that a major Chinese automaker made a bid for all or part of FCA, though the offer was deemed too low. The identity of the automaker is unknown but rumors point to either Dongfeng, Geely, Great Wall or Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC).
Other sources revealed that several Chinese automakers have been conducting due diligence on a potential purchase of FCA, and that FCA executives met with at least one Chinese automaker, in this case Great Wall. Chinese delegations were also seen recently at FCA's headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
This isn't the first time FCA has been linked with a Chinese automaker regarding a merger or buyout. In May 2016, it was reported that GAC was interested in a stake in FCA, though GAC later denied the report.

Marchionne has also in recent years approached Ford, General Motors, Toyota and the Volkswagen Group about a potential merger, but has been rebuffed on every occasion. However, VW Group CEO Matthias Müller in March said he would be open to talking with Marchionne once more.
According to Automotive News, one of the main drivers of Chinese interest in FCA is government pressure to expand outside of China by acquiring foreign companies. Geely, which successfully turned around Volvo over the past decade, earlier this year bought major stakes in Lotus and Proton. Tire manufacturer Pirelli was also sold to a Chinese chemical company in 2015.
Acquiring FCA would provide a Chinese automaker with immediate access to the United States market as well as some well-known and highly profitable brands, namely Jeep and Ram. It's not certain if all FCA brands would be included in any potential sale, however. One of Automotive News' sources claimed Italian brands Alfa Romeo and Maserati would be spun off, just like Ferrari was in 2015.
FCA's controlling shareholder is investment firm Exor which in turn is controlled by Italy's Agnelli family.
Stay tuned for an update.
(Reuters) - Sensex, Nifty rose on Tuesday, led by financial and IT stocks, but the gains were capped as material stocks such as Vedanta Ltd stumbled on losses in Chinese iron ore prices.

The broader NSE Nifty was up 0.48 percent at 10,142.75 as of 0620 GMT, while the benchmark BSE Sensex rose 0.45 percent to 33,070.36.
“The rise in the market after 4-5 sessions of declines is a clear-cut case of short-covering,” said R.K. Gupta, managing director of Taurus Asset Management, adding the market would remain under pressure for the next couple of days.
Investors are also watching out for the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meet this week.
IT stocks rose after three sessions of falls, with the Nifty IT index up over 1 percent. Infosys advanced 0.9 percent, while Tech Mahindra Ltd rose 2.2 percent.
Financial stocks Housing Development Finance Corp inched up 0.9 percent, while State Bank of India rose 1.3 percent.
Aviation stocks also gained after data released by India's civil aviation authority showed domestic passengers numbers rose 24.1 percent on-year in February.
Shares in Jet Airways Ltd rose 1.6 percent, while Spicejet Ltd was 1.2 percent higher.
Meanwhile, metal stocks slipped as Chinese iron ore prices fell further, a day after posting their biggest daily drop in almost 10 months. The Nifty metal index fell as much as 2.5 percent, with Vedanta plunging 5.2 percent.
Shares in pharmaceutical company Cipla Ltd fell to their lowest since June 6 on reports that the U.S. regulator had found deficiencies in Cipla's batch production and control records after inspecting the company's Goa unit.
Among the decliners, state-run Canara Bank tumbled over 5 percent after India's federal police charged a former chairman of the bank and others over allegations of fraud.

One of the most common questions I get as a wine writer isn't about wine at all — it's about the packaging.
People want to know what I think of things like synthetic corks, boxed wine, twist-top closures or Tetrapak “juice box” wine containers.
Some people expect me to turn my nose up at such things, or want some clearance to deride a certain product. Sometimes they want license to enjoy them. I think these innovations expand the opportunity to drink wine while helping de-dramatize wines. In some cases, they preserve wine quality better than conventional packaging — the bottles and corks that date from the Middle Ages. I barely give a thought to closures — Stelvin “twist offs” or synthetic corks.
Another innovation popped off a recent wine is the “glass cork,” actually a T-stopper known in the trade as the Vino Seal. The glass stopper has some perceived advantages over other closures. It allows very little chance of cork taint, and glass may have a bit more class than twist caps in presentation at a restaurant, if that matters. Also, the glass stopper is recyclable. Natural corks, I have to add, have gotten much better and less likely to impart cork taint — a wet-cardboard mustiness.
I'm a huge fan of nero d'Avola, the inexpensive, high-quality red wine from Sicily that provides an easy match with pizza, burgers and just about any red wine dish.
Cusumano 2015 Nero d'Avola appeared like any other wine in a 750 ml bottle until I removed the foil and found the T-shaped glass stopper, which came off with a wiggle and a twist. A silicone seal keeps the bottle tight.
Cusumano 2015 Nero d'Avola shows a bit more panache than other nero d'Avola that tends to angle for simple fruit character. The wine smells of violets, and is light-bodied with raspberry flavors followed by pepper, cocoa and a brush of tannins. $13. ★★★★
I remember when an Australian group released Iron Wine — wine in a can. At the time, it was a knee-slapper. But canned wine is a good idea. If you ask beer people, they'll tell you the can is the perfect packaging for preserving beer. It should be OK to use for wine, right?
Underwood Oregon Pinot Gris is a wine in a can. Pinot Gris is a pink/gray grape, and when this wine comes from the can, it appears pinkish. Also, I think all canned wine is packaged with some carbonation, but it bubbles off quickly. The wine is lean and dry with some white peach flavor plus minerally with a bitter edge. A can is $8, which translates to a $16 bottle. For the price, I wanted it to be a bit better. ★★★1/2
Bota Box cultivated a reputation for better 3-liter box wine. A smaller one- to two-serving Tetrapak Bota Mini RedVolution tastes as though it is zinfandel-based and would be enjoyed by fans of Apothic Red, 19 Crimes and that class of intensely flavored, ripe and sweet reds. The wine smells like wild berry and cedar and is spicy with flavors of chocolate and over-ripe berries. This is a flavorful, not-too-demanding wine, the sort that works in a Tetrapak. At $5.50 for 500 ml, it translates to less than $10 a bottle. ★★★1/2
A word on box wine and Tetrapak wine: they are not forever wines, and they will age and get past their prime pretty quickly. If you buy them in these formats, drink them promptly.
Don't worry too much about the packaging of a wine. You may not find the best wines in the world in a box or a can, but you can find a quality wine that meets your expectations.

Last year, Sharon Van Etten shared a new track called “Not Myself” that was written for the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, which happened one year ago yesterday. Today, Van Etten has put out a remix of the track by Hercules & Love Affair alongside a note explaining the reasoning for its release: “During the journey of making this song and finding the best way to share it with the world, a fellow musician recommended I reach out to someone to remix the song to share with the club community,” she writes. “In this way, a version can exist where even more people can connect to this song in a more positive and healing light.” Proceeds from the track go towards the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. Listen to the remix below.

EATON — One in two Americans have at least one chronic disease – those conditions that are treated and managed, but not often cured. Chronic disease takes an enormous toll on peoples' lives, but fortunately there are ways to manage symptoms and maintain active and fulfilling lives. The Area Agency on Aging and Preble County Council on Aging urge you to start down your own path to better health by attending Healthy U, where you will learn skills and coping strategies needed to manage your symptoms and live a healthier life.
Healthy U is an interactive, small group workshop that has been proven to improve quality of life and reduce health care expenses by increasing self-confidence and providing new skills so that participants can better manage their symptoms and feel healthier. Instead of focusing on any one disease, participants explore new ways to address challenges common to anyone with a long-term health problem.
The program focuses on common problems like chronic pain, nutrition, exercise, medication use, emotions, and communicating with doctors and family about your illness. Participants develop skills and coping strategies to manage their symptoms through action planning, interactive learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and social support.
The series of six weekly workshops will be held at the Preble County Council on Aging, 800 East St. Clair Street in Eaton, on Tuesdays, March 6 through April 10, from 9:30 a.m. to noon. Space is limited and advance registration is required by calling Holly Steele or Stacey Copes at 937-456-4947, or send an email to hsteele@prebleseniorcenter.org or scopes@prebleseniorcenter.org.
ZAGREB, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Croatians who owe debts denominated in Swiss francs hope the loans will be nullified after a Slovenian court threw out a similar loan there, a debtor representative and a parliamentary deputy said on Friday.
The Slovenian court said the borrower was not informed of the risks that a loan in Swiss francs entailed. Croatian activists say the same applies to franc loans in Croatia.
“We strongly believe that the loan contracts were lacking appropriate and essential information about the currency and variable interest rate risks,” Goran Aleksic from the Franak association, which provides help to people who took out Swiss franc loans, told Reuters.
Many households and companies in Croatia, Slovenia and elsewhere in eastern Europe took out loans, largely mortgages, between 2003 and 2008, to benefit from low interest rates for Swiss franc debt. But their payments soared when the franc surged in value, particularly after January 2015, when Switzerland scrapped a cap on its currency.
The High Commercial Court is now set to reassess whether eight local banks, owned by the parent banks in other European Union states like Italy or Austria, were offering Swiss franc loans unfairly and whether such loans had to be nullified.
“In the last 10 years, the banks have earned some 50 billion kunas ($8.40 billion) and potential costs for them, as the loans have been excessively repaid, could be up to 25 billion kunas, which would still leave them a fair profit,” Aleksic said.
Before an election in late 2015, Croatia's government pushed through a law ordering banks to convert franc loans into euros, at the banks' expense.
But the Constitutional Court ordered a retrial in a debtors' lawsuit against banks after the Supreme Court ruled in their favour. The higher court said the Supreme Court did not properly explain its ruling.
Four banks have sued Croatia for enforced conversion at an arbitration court in Washington, citing violations of international obligations and investors' expectations. The banks insist that the Swiss franc loans were fully in line with legal framework at the time.
“The clients have been provided the information that the (Swiss) currency is exposed to fluctuations,” said a banking source who asked not to be named. Variable interest rates were also explained, the source said. ($1 = 5.9500 kuna) (Reporting by Igor Ilic, editing by Larry King)
RENO, Nev. (AP)  The Latest on the flooding in northern Nevada with another series of storms in the forecast (all times local):
1:40 p.m.
Elko County officials have opened a single lane of a highway to the rural town of Montello where dozens of residents have been cut off by flooding after a dam burst last Wednesday.
Sheriff Jim Pitts told The Associated Press on Tuesday things are calming down in the city of Elko thanks to freezing temperatures that eased flooding along the Humboldt River.

He says there still have been no reports of deaths of injuries after as many as 100 homes and businesses evacuated over the weekend due to rising water.
Pitts says at least one thoroughfare has reopened to two of the hardest hit housing subdivisions in Ryndon and Osino. He says they hope to have power and gas service restored to those areas by Wednesday ahead of the next round of wet storms expected by the end of the week.
_____
Still cleaning up after the latest round of flooding, much of northern Nevada is bracing for another series of wet storms that could swamp the state again into next week.
Gov. Brian Sandoval says multiple storms since Jan. 1 already have caused $15 million damage and the costs continue to rise.
Douglas County estimates $1. 6 million in damages at county parks alone. The state approved an emergency contract Monday for $7 million to repair washed out roads to the Pyramid Lake Paiute reservation north of Reno, where overall damage exceeds $10 million.
The next round of storms is expected to move on Thursday. The National Weather Service says even small amounts of precipitation could cause more flooding due to saturated soils.
It warned Tuesday on its web site in Reno: "Wednesday is your last quiet weather day."
HOUSTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Weatherford International Plc on Friday reported a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss on $1.6 billion in charges, casting doubt among Wall Street analysts that the oilfield firm is turning around after years of losses.
The quarterly loss widened from a year earlier, despite a general upturn in demand for oilfield services that has benefited rivals. The weaker results could accelerate planned asset sales to pare its $7.5 billion debt pile.
Weatherford reported a fourth-quarter loss of 33 cents per share, excluding items, exceeding analysts' expectations for a 21 cents per share loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenues for the quarter were $1.49 billion, up 6 percent from the same quarter last year but slightly below Wall Street forecasts.
Shares were off 9 percent at $3.68 in pre-market trade on Friday.
Debt-laden Weatherford has restructured and sold businesses in an effort to raise cash and revamp. The company last year appointed Mark McCollum, formerly chief financial officer for rival Halliburton Co, as its chief executive. In late December Weatherford sold off an U.S. oil well business to Schlumberger for $430 million.
“Our fourth quarter results reflect a period of adjustment as we hit the reset button,” McCollum said in a conference call. The company expects “significant improvements” in earnings in the first quarter of 2018.
Still, analysts called Weatherford's fourth quarter disappointing.
“These results are bereft of redeeming qualities,” investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt wrote in a research note. Researchers from Capital One Securities said “it will likely be hard for investors to believe in the operational improvement story.”
Global oil prices have rebounded to three-year highs, prompting a broad uptick in drilling activity and demand for oilfield services and equipment. That helped boost results at rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton last quarter and prompted those firms to offer an optimistic outlook for 2018.
In late January, U.S. crude futures touched a high of $66.66 per barrel, a level not seen since December of 2014.
Charges included some $934 million in asset impairments, $434 million in inventory writedown and a $230 million write-down on its Venezuelan receivables. (Reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by David Gregorio)
British startup Made.com says that “a new tier 1 global institutional investor” has made an important investment commitment in the furniture company. This mysterious investor is willing to lead a new $56 million round (£40 million) with existing investors Partech Ventures, Level Equity and Eight Roads Ventures also participating.
It sounds like the funding round isn't finished just yet, so Made.com could end up raising more than that.
More interestingly, the company has shared some details about its balance sheet. In 2017, the company has been profitable in the U.K., France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. And if you take into account the entire company in all countries where it operates, Made.com is currently cashflow positive.
In 2017, the company has generated a net revenue of $178 million (£127 million), which represents a 40 percent increase compared to 2016. So it sounds like Made.com is on the right path to profitability.
And that's why the company also announced that Adrian Evans is joining the company as CFO. He previously worked at Yoox Net-A-Porter. This release sounds like Made.com is now optimizing the company for a potential IPO.
The company sells quality furniture at an affordable price. Made.com wants to disrupt high-end furniture stores by controlling everything from manufacturing to the e-commerce platform. This way, the company doesn't have to pay as many middle players and can offer cheaper prices.
As e-commerce is also becoming the norm, it fosters competition with furniture giants, such as IKEA. Going to Made.com's website is as easy as going to IKEA's website after all.
TOKYO - Japan has posted its longest economic expansion in over a decade on the back of a pickup in household and company spending, data showed Monday.
The country's Gross Domestic Product grew by 1.0 percent in the April-June period, marking the sixth straight winning quarter in the longest string of gains since 2006.
The world's number three economy has been picking up steam, mainly on the back of a surging exports including smartphones parts and memory chips, with investments linked to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics also giving growth a boost. But the latest GDP figures -- which translate into a whopping 4.0 percent annualised growth rate -- were driven by robust domestic demand and capital spending, which offset a quarterly decline in exports.
Private consumption picked up 0.9 percent in the second quarter. Individual spending accounts for more than a half of Japan's GDP.
The second quarter growth blew past market expectations for a 0.6 percent rise, according to figures from the Cabinet Office. It was well up from a 0.4 percent expansion in January-March GDP.
The labour market is tight and business confidence is high but efforts to lift inflation have fallen flat despite years of aggressive monetary easing by Japan's central bank. The latest reading nonetheless means Japan's economy has had its best string of gains since the tenure of popular former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. Monday's figures are good news for the current prime minister Shinzo Abe -- whose brief and underwhelming first term as Japan's premier came directly after Koizumi.
A string of short-term leaders followed Abe's first term before he swept back to power in late 2012 on a pledge to reignite Japan's once-booming economy with a plan dubbed Abenomics.
The scheme -- a mix of huge monetary easing, government spending and reforms to the economy -- stoked a stock market rally and fattened corporate profits. Some critics have cast doubt on the plan, as heavily indebted Japan grapples with low birthrates and a shrinking labour force.
Abe has seen his public support ratings plummet in the past few months over an array of political troubles, including allegations of favouritism to a friend in a business deal.
"This is a good result and tailwind for Abenomics," Shinke Yoshiki, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said of Monday's data release.
"Consumption and corporate investment are particularly strong, a result of brisk corporate earnings and improved business confidence."
In a commentary, Barclays said: "The strength of private consumption reflects an improvement in employment and income conditions (eg, drop in unemployment, four consecutive years of increasing base pay), but likely also such factors as favourable weather during that period."
Still, wages have not been rising enough to kickstart tepid inflation, and few analysts expect the same kind of growth next quarter.
"Japan's structural problems have not changed: ageing population, decreasing working age population, deteriorating fiscal conditions," said Junko Nishioka, chief economist of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
Japan has been struggling to defeat years of deflation and slow growth that followed the collapse of an equity and property market bubble in the early nineties. The Bank of Japan, aiming to create two-percent inflation as a key part of Tokyo's growth bid, now expects to reach that goal by sometime in the year to March 2020 -- four years later than planned.
Falling prices can discourage spending by consumers, who will postpone purchases until prices drop more or look to save money instead.
That puts pressure on businesses, creating a cycle in which firms then cut back on expanding production, hiring new workers or boosting wages.
After playing with Cheltenham Civil Service for 42 years, 67-year-old Stephen Yiend has no intention of retiring from rugby just yet.
The flanker has been named the oldest person playing rugby in Gloucestershire at the moment with his about to turn 68 in December.
He has been playing with the Cheltenham club since 1975 and has spent his entire career with just one club.
Yiend said: “For me, it is an absolute privilege to still be running around with the youngsters.
“They see me before the game and think I'm just an old man.
“But when you play against them on the field they have a completely different idea of you.
“There is a certain respect that you gain my competition against fellow players.”
The 67-year-old retired from his job as an engineer three years ago but has kept up his fitness ever since.
He said: “My work kept me quite fit by just doing my job every day.
“Since then I have been going to the gym a couple of days a week and playing with the club.
“I've never really stopped playing so my body doesn't know any different.
“Sometimes it hurts until Wednesday and sometimes I come back with a black eye.
“My wife and family shake their heads at me but I absolutely love it regardless.”
The Service flanker has no plans of retiring just yet despite being more than the double the age of Gloucester Rugby's oldest player, the 33-year-old John Afoa.
“I always thought I would retire at 40,” said Yiend.
“Then I thought I would go until 67 because that was the Civil Service team record.
“I'll be 68 this December and I don't want to stop just yet.
“I just take it year by year now, it would be nice to be able to get to 70 and still be playing but I am just taking it day by day.”
Yiend began his career on the wing, before switching to openside-flanker and players most of his rugby at blindside-flanker.
He added: “I know my limitations as a player.
“I'm not as quick as I used to be but I have the experience to be able to make good decisions and not run around like a chicken that has had its head cut off.
“A lot of the younger players look at an older guy like me and think they'll run over me.
“I actually prefer that, it is if they run a yard either side of me that I struggle.”
Yiend admits that he doesn't have the physicality to play in the second row but remains a reliable source of lineout ball.
His first game for the Service came for the fourth team at the time in an away game against Cainscross.
“It was on a pitch down by a canal in Cainscross,” said Yiend.
“I chased back and made a tackle on a big second row.
“I just remember getting back up and seeing little dickie birds flying around me head.”
The flanker will play in a veteran's game between Mike Crisps Vets and Cheltenham Civil Service Vets at Newlands Park on Saturday.
Yiend said: “The vets games are great, they are a little bit slower than the games I usually play.
“But it is great to run out with players that I used to play with.
“They have been a bit more sensible than me and gave up years ago.”
LOWER MERION, Pa. (Reuters) - In Pennsylvania state Senator Daylin Leach's bid to win a seat vital to the Democratic Party's chances in 2018 elections of taking control of the U.S. Congress, his opponents may not be his biggest obstacle.
Leach is running in one of the country's most gerrymandered congressional districts, one with such a twisting, winding shape that it has earned the derisive nickname “Goofy Kicking Donald Duck.”
The 7th congressional district has become a national poster child for critics of gerrymandering, the process by which one party draws district boundaries to ensure an advantage among voters. Democrats say the lines have helped Republicans like U.S. Representative Patrick Meehan, the four-term incumbent Leach seeks to unseat, to stay in office.
That could soon change, however. On Monday in state court in Harrisburg, one of three lawsuits challenging those boundaries heads to trial. The outcome could shift several battleground districts in Pennsylvania and in turn boost the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, where they last held the majority from January 2007 to January 2011.
The 7th district is so precisely engineered that at one point it narrows to the width of a single seafood restaurant, snaking past two other congressional districts so it can link two far flung Republican-leaning areas.
“Three congressional districts all converge on this spot,” Leach said from the parking lot at Creed's Seafood and Steaks last week, as cars whizzed overhead on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
“This is the sixth; over there is the seventh; and down that road is the 13th,” he said, pointing in several directions. “This is what gerrymandering looks like on the ground.”
Leach has at least four opponents to defeat in the Democratic primary before he would run against Meehan. A spokesman for the Republican did not respond to requests for comment on the trial over gerrymandering.
Critics of gerrymandering say it helps explain why Pennsylvania has sent 13 Republicans and only five Democrats to the U.S. House since the 2011 redistricting, despite being a closely divided swing state.
Republican legislators counter that the lines were drawn in accordance with the law and that their candidates have prevailed in elections thanks to superior policy ideas.
The Democrats have targeted six Republican-held districts in the state as part of their quest to pick up the 24 House seats they need to overturn the Republicans, who also have a Senate majority and President Donald Trump in the White House.
Democrats need to win the nationwide popular vote by at least 10 points in 2018 to do so, in part because of gerrymandered lines, according to Michael Li, a redistricting expert and lawyer at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice.
“Pennsylvania is probably the most aggressive of the gerrymanders,” he said. “You look at some of the maps in the Philadelphia suburbs, and it looks like a 4-year-old just slapped paint around.”

DISTRICT LINES ON TRIAL
The non-partisan League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania sued the state in June, arguing the maps violate the state constitution by depriving residents of a meaningful vote.
The litigation is part of a growing set of legal challenges to partisan redistricting, including a U.S. Supreme Court case out of Wisconsin that could for the first time establish a constitutional standard to measure the legality of such map-making. The high court is scheduled to decide that case by June 2018, five months before the midterm elections.
“The politicians are not supposed to pick their voters; the voters are supposed to elect their leaders,” said Mimi McKenzie, an attorney with the Public Interest Law Center who represents the League of Women Voters and other Pennsylvania voters.

Spokesmen for the state's Republican legislative leaders, defendants in the case, said the redistricting followed the process laid out in the state constitution and that the U.S. Supreme Court has said political considerations can play a role.
“They just can't understand how Republicans can actually beat their candidates,” Stephen Miskin, a spokesman for Pennsylvania House Speaker Mike Turzai, said of the legal challengers.
In addition to the state case, two pending federal lawsuits also challenge the district lines as unconstitutional. Legal observers consider the state lawsuit the most likely to succeed in time for the voting next November.
The Democratic-majority state Supreme Court has ordered the presiding judge to render his decision by Dec. 31. The high court will then determine whether to accept his ruling or issue its own conclusions.
The state lawsuit asserts the redistricting included numerous examples of blatantly partisan lines.
Democrat-dominated Reading, one of the most economically depressed cities in the state, was carved out of the 6th district and placed into the reliably Democratic 13th, a move the plaintiffs said was intended to render the city's votes meaningless.
Montgomery County, where state senator Leach lives, has approximately 820,000 residents, slightly more than the 711,000 needed for a single congressional district, but has been sliced into five separate districts.
Leach said he would make gerrymandering a campaign issue.
“It's theft of democracy,” Leach said. “This is horribly destructive.”

ISLAMABAD - The government Friday made it clear that it had no intention to bring the judiciary and army under the umbrella of accountability through a newly proposed accountability law that will replace the previous NAB law.
The government also once again clarified that the Election Act 2017 that had changed the provision of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat — the finality of the prophethood of Hazrat Muhammad (Peace B Upon Him) – declaration for election candidates was cleared by a sub-committee and the parliamentary committee having representation of all parliamentary parties.
Law Minister Zahid Hamid along with Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal and State Minister Barrister Zafarullah Khan while addressing a press conference at the Press Information Department (PID) made it clear twice that the government was not going to introduce any accountability law to bring the judiciary and the army under the ambit of civilian accountability process.
Clarifying the government's position, he said, PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar had proposed to the Parliamentary Committee on National Accountability Law to introduce a broad-based accountability law. “This is mere a proposal and there was no consensus on it,” he said.
Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that Election Act 2017 that changed the provision of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat declaration was cleared by the sub-committee and then Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reforms having representation of all parliamentary parties.
He said that the impression being given in the social media and other platforms was wrong that perhaps government silently made changes in it. He said that report of the Election Bill 2017 was placed on the table of the National Assembly weeks before its passage from the lower house and then Senate and it was also shared with all the parliamentary parties. “Only text was altered just to simplify the declaration form of election candidates,” he said.
The interior minister said that the report of the electoral reforms remained in the public domain for many months but no one objected to the declaration form until JUI-F Senator Hafiz Hamdullah pointed out that nomination form should be restored to its original form. “However, the amendment could not be passed by the Senate,” he said. He said that the whole process of the parliamentary committee was transparent and recorded.
Ahsan stressed the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat was part of the faith of every Muslim and no one could even think about compromising on it. “So very soon all the political parties decided to restore the declaration to its original form to remove any ambiguity in the declaration form regarding the finality of prohethood of Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH),” he said.
The minister warned those elements for trying under the Cyber Crime Law who were exploiting this issue on the social media and spreading hatred and issuing decrees of infidels for others. “Some have started a campaign against the cabinet members and even the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on the social media in this regard,” he said. He said that some lawyers had said that the change had no legal implications but even then the government had restored the original declaration form.
The interior minister said that no one had the right to declare anyone infidel. Pakistan is an Islamic democratic country and the state has only monopoly to declare who is Muslim and who in non-Muslin. “Secondly, it is the exclusive domain of the state to punish anyone,” he said. He said that thirdly, the state had to decide about the initiation of Jehad, when and against whom. “The state had exclusive domain on these three things,” he said and added: “If the permit of Jehad would be given in street, then we will become our own enemies.” He said that hate mongers were the actual enemies of Pakistan but unfortunately some people had become “blind in politics”.
Law Minister Zahid Hamid also said that there was no bad intention of the government when the Election Act 2017 was in the draft stage and the whole process was transparent. There were 13 members of sub-committee and the main committee had 34 members. He said that all the members had consensus when the declaration form was simplified. “I cannot even dare to think to abolish the declaration regarding provision of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat,” he said while clarifying his own position. The minister added that he was the firm believer of the finality of prophethood of Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH).
Barrister Zafarull Khan said that PML-N was basically a religious party and its major vote bank comprised those people who were associated with Islam.
Regarding the clause 203 of Election Act that allowed the disqualified prime minister Nawaz Sharif to again become the party head, Zahid Hamid said the parliamentary committee with consensus had omitted this clause in November 2014 when there was no noise of Panama scandal. “This is on the record,” he said.
Ahsan Iqbal responding to a question avoided speaking on action of the Rangers regarding taking over the security of accountability court this week. He said that he would be in a position to speak when the inquiry on the matter would be completed. The inquiry would be completed after the reply of DG Rangers. He however said that a disinformation campaign against the PML-N government was underway and some elements wanted to have confrontation between the army and the civilian government and are talking about introduction of technocratic set-up.
Talking about the Awami Muslim League Chief Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, he said that sometime Rasheed used to become the spokesperson of army and sometime of the judiciary. He said that continuity of the democratic process and the constitutional governance was the only way forward for Pakistan.
Responding to another question, the interior minister said the children of ousted prime minister would only appear before the accountability court when Begum Kalsoom Nawaz would recover from her illness. He indicated that children of Sharif would not appear in the next hearing of the accountability references against them.
IMRAN MUKHTAR
LONDON (Reuters) - Greece's economy is growing, its credit ratings are on the up, the government has returned to bond markets and hopes to leave the 86 billion euros bailout that kept it from default.
But it will still be a challenge to lure long-term investors to an imminent sale of seven-year bonds.
Greece returned to the bond markets last year for the first time since 2014. The 3 billion euros sale of five-year bonds was deemed a success with a yield of 4.625 percent.
That sale was heavily supported by hedge funds. It would be a sign of confidence if Greece can attract a higher proportion of conservative funds, in it for the longer haul, at the new debt issue which could come as early as next week.
Two big bond investors told Reuters they were unlikely to take part in upcoming Greek bond sales because they were still concerned about the sustainability of Greece's debt. Another said he would approach it with caution.
Greece has had three bailouts in the last decade and a debt-to-gross domestic product(GDP) ratio approaching 200 percent, the highest in the 28 member European Union.
“Greece is a controversial story because on one hand, the economic picture is better and reforms asked for by the European Commission were voted through, whereas on the other hand, the total amount of debt is still there,” said Patrick Barbe, head of European bonds at BNP Paribas Asset Management.
His European sovereign and aggregate bond team has no exposure to Greece as its low credit rating puts the country below the threshold that would allow the firm to invest there.
He said he was cautious about buying upcoming Greek bond issues.
“HEADWIND”
S&P last month lifted Greece's rating for the first time in two years but at ‘B,' Greece remains five notches below the “investment grade” threshold that would open it up to a much wider pool of investors.
Its rating also puts Greece on par with Nigeria, Rwanda, Cape Verde and a notch below serial defaulter Argentina.
Other numbers are pointing in the right direction. Economic growth is running at 1.3 percent on an annual basis and data on Thursday showed factory activity expanding at decade-highs and a record pace of job creation.
Seamus Mac Gorain, senior fixed income portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages assets of $1.6 trillion, said although the strong growth environment means more confidence in high-yield borrowers such as Greece, debt levels would be a “headwind” for a move to lower borrowing costs.
Greece's relatively small and illiquid bond market also makes it hard for big investors to trade. The vast majority of its outstanding 316 billion-euro debt is held by official lenders, with only about 40 billion euros trading in the market.
That is a fraction of the 2 trillion euros or so in debt that trades in markets such as Germany and France.
TEMPTING
For other investors, Greece has offered exciting returns and the upcoming auction will present them with a new opportunity, particularly given the generally bullish mood towards “risk assets”, including emerging markets and high-yield debt.
Those who stuck with Greece reaped returns of more than 40 percent in U.S. dollar terms last year - the best in Europe - as two and five-year Greek bond yields fell, touching record lows recently.
Among those looking at the new debt sale is Mark Dowding, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management.
“The only Grexit we think we're going to see is a Greek exit from the bailout,” he said. He was referring to speculation during Greece's financial troubles that it would be forced to leave the euro.
“We would certainly consider adding to our holdings on an attractive new issue,” he added
A banker who has worked closely with the Greek debt agency on recent debt sales was confident Athens would attract more mainstream funds this time.
“A portion of real money focused, buy-and-hold investors have returned to this market now,” the banker said, citing for instance strong demand at a recent covered bond sale from Greek lender Alpha Bank.
The money raised from the government debt sales will be part of a pot of up to 19 billion-euros together with other bond issues and unused bailout funds.
This is designed as a safety net as Greece eases itself out of the bailout. Greece is hoping to make a clean break with official lenders when the rescue package expires in August.
Jeffrey Franks, the director of the IMF's Europe office sounded a note of caution.
He told Reuters Greece had impressed with the speed of its reforms and recent over-performance with fiscal targets and the IMF did not see the need for more austerity measures this year.
However, he said longer-term improvements to the economy are still required.
“There shouldn't be a sense of complacency that even if the programme completes this year that all will be good forever,” he said.

Apple and IBM may seem like an odd couple, but the two companies have been working closely together for several years now. That has involved IBM sharing its enterprise expertise with Apple and Apple sharing its design sense with IBM. The companies have actually built hundreds of enterprise apps running on iOS devices. Today, they took that friendship a step further when they announced they were providing a way to combine IBM Watson machine learning with Apple Core ML to make the business apps running on Apple devices all the more intelligent.
The way it works is a customer builds a machine learning model using Watson, taking advantage of data in an enterprise repository to train the model. For instance, a company may want to help field service techs point their iPhone camera at a machine and identify the make and model to order the correct parts. You could potentially train a model to recognize all the different machines using Watson's image recognition capability.
The next step is to convert that model into Core ML and include it in your custom app. Apple introduced Core ML at the Worldwide Developers Conference last June as a way to make it easy for developers to move machine learning models from popular model building tools like TensorFlow, Caffe or IBM Watson to apps running on iOS devices.
After creating the model, you run it through the Core ML converter tools and insert it in your Apple app. The agreement with IBM makes it easier to do this using IBM Watson as the model building part of the equation. This allows the two partners to make the apps created under the partnership even smarter with machine learning.
“Apple developers need a way to quickly and easily build these apps and leverage the cloud where it's delivered. [The partnership] lets developers take advantage of the Core ML integration,” Mahmoud Naghshineh, general manager for IBM Partnerships and Alliances explained.
To make it even easier, IBM also announced a cloud console to simplify the connection between the Watson model building process and inserting that model in the application running on the Apple device.
Over time, the app can share data back with Watson and improve the machine learning algorithm running on the edge device in a classic device-cloud partnership. “That's the beauty of this combination. As you run the application, it's real time and you don't need to be connected to Watson, but as you classify different parts [on the device], that data gets collected and when you're connected to Watson on a lower [bandwidth] interaction basis, you can feed it back to train your machine learning model and make it even better,” Naghshineh said.
The point of the partnership has always been to use data and analytics to build new business processes, by taking existing approaches and reengineering them for a touch screen.
“This adds a level of machine learning to that original goal moving it forward to take advantage of the latest tech. “We are taking this to the next level through machine learning. We are very much on that path and bringing improved accelerated capabilities and providing better insight to [give users] a much greater experience,” Naghshineh said.
A long-time member of the Everett Silvertips organization will take over as head coach of the Saskatoon Blades.
The Blades announced Wednesday afternoon that Mitch Love has been hired as the team's 21st head coach in franchise history.

“We're thrilled to have Mitch commit long term to the Blades. We believe he is one of the top young coaches in the country and will bring a great deal of experience in the WHL to our players,” Blades general manager Colin Priestner said in a statement
“His teams have been extremely hardworking, disciplined and accountable and we believe he will bring a ton of passion to our team as we look to take the next step as a club.”
Love, 33, has been on the coaching staff of the Silvertips since 2011, most recently as assistant coach and assistant to the general manager.
The Silvertips reached the WHL finals this season for the first time since 2004, when Love patrolled the blue line as a player on the team.
He spent six years playing in the AHL, ECHL and CHL before retiring and joining Everett's coaching staff.

Labourers work at the construction site of a commercial complex in New Delhi November 20, 2013.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India called on Friday for more monetary easing as it flagged risks to economic growth and budget targets, citing a series of disinflationary impulses weighing on Asia's third-largest economy.
In its mid-year economic survey, the finance ministry said "tighter" monetary policy meant real interest rates in India were substantially higher than in comparable emerging economies, further clouding the economic outlook.
Faster monetary easing, the ministry argued, would help deleverage corporate balance sheets and restore banks' profits, helping the economy realise its full potential.
While it retained an official growth forecast of 6.75 percent to 7.5 percent for the fiscal year to March 2018, the report highlighted a stronger rupee, deepening farm distress and a disruption in business activity following the launch of a new sales tax, as headwinds.
"There has been an across-the-board deceleration," said Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, the survey's author. "It is less likely than before that we will reach the upper end of the range."
Growth slowed to 6.1 percent in the March quarter, its lowest in more than two years, following monetary reform ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last November to purge high-value banknotes from circulation.
The subsequent launch of a national Goods and Services Tax (GST) has caused chaos on the ground as ambiguous rules have left firms confused on how to price their products.
In a sign of things to come, business surveys showed both services and manufacturing contracting at their fastest rate in years in July, the month that the GST was launched.
SCOPE FOR MONETARY EASING
Disinflationary pressures allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week to cut its main policy rate - the first easing by an Asian central bank this year - by 25 basis points to 6 percent, the lowest since November 2010.
Yet Subramanian, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's top economic adviser, said the policy repo rate was still 25-75 basis above the neutral rate.
Although he didn't fault the RBI's new inflation-targeting framework, he did question the approach of its Monetary Policy Committee.
"Both expected inflation and GDP are subdued relative to their equilibrium levels," the survey said. "The conclusion is inescapable that the scope for monetary easing is considerable."
Even as the RBI resumed cutting rates, it warned inflation could accelerate to as high as 4.5 percent in October-December. The economic survey, however, took the view that India's inflation, which cooled to a record low of 1.54 percent in June, is undergoing a "structural shift".
It expects headline inflation to remain below the RBI's medium-term target of 4 percent through to the end of March 2018 on the back of normal summer rains and the deflationary impact of farm loan waivers.
Four Indian states including Uttar Pradesh, which has a population bigger than Brazil's, have agreed to waive billions of dollars in farm loans to offer relief to farmers reeling from losses caused by bad weather.
Subramanian said the loan waivers were likely to be deflationary as the states would have to either raise taxes or cut spending to keep their budget deficits in check.
The seventh annual Ride on the Rez fundraiser took place on the Cahuilla Indian Reservation Saturday, Sept. 23. It included a trail ride, raffle prizes, barbecue lunch, dessert auction and live music by country western performer Michael Thomas. The group of cowboys and cowgirls left the staging area at the Costo Ranch off Terwilliger Road. The ride lasted approximately four hours, followed by a barbecue lunch at 4 p.m. Twenty-nine horse and mule riders participated in the equestrian outing this year.
From mules and purebred horses to real ropers and working cow horses, all the animals seemed excited to get going. The morning air was crisp, and the day was just beautiful. Old friends made new ones in the large group that rode into the scenic hills and sagebrush.
“It was such a lovely day for a trail ride, and the horses did great,” participant Ashley Titel said. “And for such a great cause.”
The raffle prizes included three wooden coat racks imprinted with the brands of local ranches handmade by Tom Parr; five bales of hay from the Anza True Value Hardware store and a $25 gas gift card from Texaco.
“The yearly Rez ride was awesome and had a good group of people and a lot of good animals and of course Stoney's great tri-tip dinner was the best, and Michael Thomas provided the best music,” Bobbi Harris said.
The fundraiser benefits Anza Valley Christian School. This year's event was sponsored in part by Anza Electric Cooperative, Valley Auto, Costo Ranch and Anza True Value Hardware.
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that he needed to make gestures to the Palestinians to enable to break the impasse between the two sides.

Netanyayu was in Paris ahead of a meeting with EU foreign ministers on Monday when they will try present a unified front after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
While condemning all acts of terrorism against Israel, Macron said that he told Netanyahu that he was against Trump's decision, which was a “dangerous threat to peace.”
“I asked Prime Minister Netanyuhu to make some courageous gestures towards the Palestinians to get out of the current impasse,” he said, suggesting that a freeze of settlement construction could be s first step.
He reaffirmed that France believed that a two-state solution was the only viable option to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
European countries, like most nations, have criticised the Trump administration's decision last week which reversed decades of U.S. policy. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as capital of a future independent state.
Most countries have maintained the position that decisions about Jerusalem's status should be left to future negotiations. The Trump administration argues that any future peace deal is likely to place Israel's capital in Jerusalem, and old policies need to be abandoned to revive the moribund peace process.
Netanyahu responded to Macron by saying that once the Palestinians recognised the “reality” that Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, it would enable peace efforts sooner.
”The most important thing about peace is first of all to recognise that the other side has a right to exist,“ he said. ”One of the manifestations of this refusal is the mere refusal to sit down with Israel.

“Here is the gesture I offer .. to Mr Abbas to sit down and negotiate peace. That's a gesture for peace. Nothing could be simpler,” he said, referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
Macron said that he did not expect any breakthrough in the short-term, but it was important to see what a proposed U.S. peace initiative expected early next year would look like before writing Washington off as a mediator in the conflict.
“I don't think we need more initiatives,” Macron said, ruling out a new French mediation effort after holding a peace conference in Paris last January.

When asked about discontent across the region over Trump's decision, including harsh criticism from Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan, Netanyahu said he would not be given morality lectures by the Turkish leader.
He said that many Arab nations were increasingly aligned with Israel to tackle Iran's regional threat.
“Many Arab countries recognise that Israel is not their enemy but their indispensable ally,” he said.
“Countries in the region who do not have formal relations with us yet. Those can grow, but it doesn't mean there will be a formal peace without some progress with the Palestinians.”
Netanyahu said he sought to use closer ties with Arab countries to isolate extremists and counter Iran.
“What Iran is trying to do is to entrench itself militarily with land, air and naval forces in Syria with the express purpose of fighting and destroying Israel. We will not tolerate that and we back up our words with actions,” he said.
Proclaimed the most influential American punk pop band of their generation, Blink-182 have had an eventful history over the course of the last 25 years.
Their most recent album, California, sees Matt Skiba step to the fore as the group's guitarist and co-vocalist following the departure founding member Tom DeLonge.
For the 41-year-old Chicagoan, who is also continuing to front his own long-running band Alkaline Trio, the record marks a new chapter for Blink-182.
“It definitely solidified my position in this band,” he says of an album which has just been re-released in a deluxe edition to coincide with their UK tour.
“I would say that the three of with John Feldmann [who produced the album] everyone was fully invested and fully present, including myself, and I'm very proud of my contributions to the record and my place in Blink. It's my first record with Blink so it's really huge.”
Skiba's arrival indeed seems to have sparked a creative renaissance for a band famed for the multi-million selling turn of the Millennium albums Enema of the State and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. So much so that Skiba and his band mates Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker produced more than 25 songs that now form a double-disc deluxe edition.
Blink-182
“We call it mojo and it's like once you write your first song the s*** starts cracking and they kind of write themselves. I was talking to my friend Alisa [Xayalith] from The Naked and Famous last night and we were talking about our neuroses and how we have nervous energy and crazy mood swings and we're all a bit nuts, maybe moreso than the usual person, but it makes you able to write songs quite easily once you get that mojo. Once we hooked up with Feldmann we were off to the races, we were writing two songs a day. It was like they were gifted to us from the gods, it was amazing.”
Working on this record, Skiba says the trio had different interests. “I can say for Travis drums, drums, drums and drums – but the interesting thing about playing with Travis a lot of the time his drum patterns become the hook and that's something I've always loved about Blink-182 before I was even in the band. Travis also has very left of centre vocal ideas oftentimes that always work. I look over and think, ‘OK, that's interesting' and then we try it and I'm like ‘What? That makes perfect sense but no one but you would think of it'.
“Then for me and Mark – I think I can speak for both of us – we were reading a lot together. We read Dead Wake about the sinking of the Lusitania, we read Blood Meridian in tandem, we read The Revenant in tandem before the movie came out, so there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary. While we were making the record we were reading this incredible, beautifully written prose and I don't want to sound cocky but I think we nailed it, it represents a lot of the things we were reading and some of the things that I was going through and likening them to that sort of description and having it be a little less ‘poor me' and a little bit more empowered and coming across the fact that you aren't drowning and you need to fight your way out, that was the theme of the record and I think for me and Mark that was influenced by literature.”
As well as topping the US chart, California became Blink-182's first Number One in the UK. Its significance is not lost on Skiba. “It feels really good to be a part of something is a first for the band,” he says. “I know full well that I didn't do it on my own and that I walked into something bigger than myself, but to become a part of that team and to help that team elevates to a Number One position is great.
I'm proud to be playing alongside guys that are so committed to music and so committed to the fans, as am I. Matt Skiba
“Music is art; I don't think art should be about competition, I don't think it should be about accolades, but getting them certainly is rewarding. But it's more about what that represents and how close we are to this record and how many people identify so closely with it. That means the world to an artist to have that connection with people.”
This year marks Blink-182's silver anniversary. Skiba is also celebrating 20 years with Alkaline Trio. “Twenty-five years that is a lifetime of playing music and that is something definitely to behold,” he says. “I'm proud to be playing alongside guys that are so committed to music and so committed to the fans, as am I. I can't celebrate the 25 with them but I'm certainly grateful to be alongside it.”
Regarding the future of Blink-182, Skiba reveals that after their UK tour the trio plan to go back into the studio “and doing it all over again, making another record”. “I'm going to be doing Blink-182 and Blink-182 alone for quite some time, I hope. I'm really blessed that I have Alkaline Trio that is more of a cult punk band with my friends I grew up with. Blink is a band I joined. One's not better than the other, they're just different.”

Residents of B.C.'s South Coast are enjoying a stretch of warm sunny weather, and the best few days are yet to come.
Global B.C. meteorologist Mark Madryga says aside from the cloudiness Tuesday, especially in the B.C. Interior, a predominantly sunny stretch of weather will hold through Friday.
“Temperatures on the South Coast will rise into the low 20s [Tuesday], and into the mid-20s on Wednesday and Thursday as warmer air aloft slides in from southern latitudes,” says Madryga.
By Friday it will be slightly cooler and by Saturday temperatures will fall several degrees and there will be a chance of showers.
READ MORE: Flood fears: B.C.'s hardest hit areas are most vulnerable as weather warms
In the B.C. Interior, temperatures will continue to rise through the week.
Madryga says the hottest days in the Interior will be Thursday and Friday, with maximum temperatures into the mid to upper 20s in most areas.
There is concern about the melting snowpack, however.
Ongoing snowpack accumulation in the southern part of the province means regions like the Similkameen, Okanagan, Boundary area and the Kootenays are at risk of flooding, according to Dave Campbell, head of the B.C. River Forecast Centre.
The snowpacks are near or above 150 per cent their normal height in the Upper Fraser West, Okanagan, Skagit, Boundary and Similkameen regions.
READ MORE: Snowpack in Okanagan still 150 per cent of normal
“Areas that would normally be melting [in] early April are just starting to now and we really haven't seen any melt in the upper elevations now, so we are expecting that to turn the corner as we get into the warmer weather later this week,” Campbell said.
WATCH: The forecast for hot, sunny weather for much of this week is raising more concerns about flooding across B.C. Geoff Hastings explains why, and who's most vulnerable.
“This high-pressure ridge is the strongest we've had in a long time, so [expect] an extended period of warm weather,” Madryga said.
“If there is a silver lining to sort of slow the snow melt during the week across the B.C. Interior it's that the nights will still be cool and in the single digits for lows, especially in the mountains where the snow is. So while we have very warm afternoons, it cools at night.”

If you're a fan of Arrow, you likely already know, this many seasons into the show, that the glue that holds everything together is Stephen Amell. Amell was one of the first people involved with the series to acknowledge the weaknesses of Season 4, and how the show needed to go back to its grittier, vigilante roots in Season 5. It worked, and Amell has proven again and again that when it comes to knowing what's best for the show, he is the best source.
The actor recently spoke with TV Line about the success of Season 5, and teased a little bit about where things are headed in Season 6. But Amell also talked about a dinner he had with (super)producer Greg Berlanti about the show's direction last year, aptly stating:
“We've built out a really interesting universe on The CW, and I think that there are things that we [on Arrow] do better than everybody else. Supergirl has a bigger budget for VFX, I think, and it has aliens all the time, and The Flash is super power-laden, and Legends travels through time. We are best when we stay within the limits of Star City […] I said, “You know, I think that there are a lot of things that we do well,” and Greg goes, “I would agree,” and I go, “Can we do those things?” Doing a show is like a relationship, right? You get in. It's hot and heavy. Things are going great. You move in together. And then one partner turns to the other and says, “You know, you haven't been to the gym in a bit….” That to me was us. If we're going to do this show, let's really do it. Let's be morally ambiguous with the characters and make it more three-dimensional and put killing back on the table, let's move away from trying to be like everyone else. Let's focus on being Arrow.”
Preach, Amell, preach! He also addressed the death of the flashbacks, and Oliver's relationship with his son William in the new season, including this interesting nugget:
“I remember when I read the [premiere] and it was just a bunch of Oliver calling William “Sport.” Like, “Hey, Sport!” And I got [co-showrunner] Wendy Mericle on the phone and she goes, “I know what you're going to say. I know what you're going to say. Oliver's never going to call him Sport. You find what you're comfortable calling him. It can be what you call your [own] kid, it can be ‘Buddy,' it doesn't matter.””
You have to be a certain calibre of star on a series, and have the right relationship with the producers, to be able to call audibles like that. But thank God he did on that one. I think it really speaks to how much Amell gets what works for this show and his character and what doesn't, maybe more so than anyone at this point. And while some fans are really cautious about the William storyline and where it may take the show, Amell also said he was proud of what they've done with it. If you think that's all fluff, though, consider how honest he's been in criticizing some of what the show hasn't done so well, such as when he commented that,
“I think that there's a way to fill Oliver with a little more contentment without domesticating him in the way that we did a bit in Season 4.”
That, of course, will make fans start thinking about Olicity's role on Arrow and its influence on the storyline, something that Season 5 actually handled pretty well after the missteps of Season 4. But while Season 5 did do a lot of things right, other parts didn't work as well, like the new recruits (almost without exception — that was, honestly, about when I was ready to quit the show, until Prometheus showed up). The Adrian Chase storyline and how he interacted with Oliver, and the consequences of Oliver's past, really gave the season some interesting stakes. Hopefully, Season 6 can do more of the same.
Big changes could be in the works for a popular trail in windward Oahu.
The state Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) is asking residents and hikers for feedback on the Kaiwa Ridge trail, also known as the Lanikai Pillbox trail.
Its popularity has soared so much over the last few years that it's causing erosion and frustrations among residents who live nearby.
The state is hoping to reduce those two concerns by developing a master plan for the trail.
From tourists to residents, hundreds of people hike the trail daily.
“You get up to the top of the hill and you get an amazing view,” hiker and Oahu resident Russel Fisher said.
DLNR is in the process of developing a master plan for the trail with three goals in mind: educing erosion, improving hiker experience and continuing access to the trail while reducing community conflict.
“I think it's a trail that should be accessed by everyone but again we do need to address the concerns with traffic, with overuse, and erosion so it's good that something is being done,” Al Smith, Chair for the Kailua Neighborhood Parks and Rec Committee, said.
The state is conducting a survey to find out what the public wants for the trail.
The survey includes questions about parking, rest areas, trash bins, trail fees and permits.
Hikers we spoke with said they'd like more parking while residents who live nearby told us they'd like to see hours established for trail use.
“A lot of people are here before sunrise,” Mike Garvey, a Lanikai resident, said. “People don't realize they're in a neighborhood and they wake me up often, yelling and loud music and having fun and I know they're having fun but it's also a neighborhood.”
Another concern is safety along the trail.
“The first 100 feet or so is steep and some people out up ropes and it can be slippery when it's wet,” Garvey said.
Others we spoke with said something is better than nothing but most everyone agrees, it starts within the community.
“The people of Hawaii, we just got to take it upon ourselves to continue to respect this trail and take care of it because even if the state comes out and does what they can to maintain it, we need to take care of it ourselves because if we're not taking care of it, we don't deserve it,” Fisher said.
The trail will be closed sometime this year for renovations to the pillboxes.

Fields Jr is a domestic terrorist who was radicalised by a far right group and used a car as weapon to indiscriminately attack a group he did not agree with. It was reasonable to foresee that multiple injuries and death would occur from his actions and therefore there was an intent to commit harm up to and including death.
Recently in Westminster a chap called Adrian from Kent (Khalid Masood)) came to the worlds attention when as a domestic terrorist, who was radicalised by a far right group, used a car as a weapon to indiscriminately attack passersby, injuring 50 and killing 4. Quite rightly this was condemned as an act of terrorism and I have no doubt that if this terrorist had not died that day he would have been charged with first degree murder and various terrorist offences. It was reasonable to foresee that multiple injuries and death would occur from his actions.
How is what happened in Charlottesville yesterday any different? How is that not premeditated first degree murder? Why has it not yet be classified as a terrorist attack?
I think we all know the answer to that!
2nd degree murder my arse.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Former Borussia Dortmund star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang revealed he made the decision to sign for Arsenal after making a phone call to check Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan was ready to make the same career move.
The prolific Gabon international's arrival at the Emirates Stadium was confirmed on deadline day after the Gunners agreed a club-record £56million fee with BVB. Aubameyang will be reunited with his former teammate in north London after the Armenia international ended an unhappy spell at Manchester United and was included in a swap deal which saw Alexis Sanchez move in the opposite direction.
During the 2015-16 season, their final campaign together in Germany, the pair registered a combined 59 goals and 31 assists between them and Aubameyang is confident they can thrive together again under the management of Arsene Wenger.
"I'm really happy [to be at the same club as Micki again]," Aubameyang told Arsenal Player.
"He's really like a brother, a good friend, and we've played together in the past. I'm really happy to see him again. ‘He called me a few times and he asked me, ‘Will you come or not?' and I said, ‘First you have to tell me if you sign or not!' Then he told me it was all done, and of course it was a big factor in coming here. ‘I think we understand each other on and off the pitch. I think that's why it's a little bit easier on the pitch.'

A controversial development proposal in downtown Edmonton has left people divided. Vinesh Pratap has the latest on the debate over a proposed 80-storey tower.
Digital currency bitcoin kicked off the new year by jumping above $1,000 for the first time in three years late on Sunday, having outperformed all central-bank-issued currencies with a 125 percent climb in 2016.
Bitcoin – a web-based “cryptocurrency” that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system – jumped 2.5 percent to $1,022 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013.

Though the digital currency has historically been highly volatile – a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1,100, before a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks – it has in the past two years been more stable.
Its biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 percent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 percent.
Bitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 percent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency's weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.

Bitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China's.
It is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high-denomination banknotes from circulation in November.
“The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,” said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges.
Though bitcoin is still some way off the all-time high of $1,163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation – 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record-high above $16 billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.
WINNIPEG – The Winnipeg Goldeyes have said good-bye to injured first baseman David Bergin.
The Goldeyes placed Bergin on waivers on Wednesday for the purpose of granting his release.

Bergin, 28, was just diagnosed with a broken hamate bone in his right hand. He last played on May 28. He also played as the Goldeyes' designated hitter.
He was batting .250 with one home run and five RBIs in nine games this season. He joined the Goldeyes in 2017 and helped the club win their second straight American Association championship.
Bergin was named the league's Post-Season All-Star Designated Hitter after hitting .300 with three home runs in nine playoff games.

Rawalpindi - The Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) expertise have visited the crime scene in Jorian Village, where a woman was reportedly burnt to ashes after being killed by unknown assailants, informed sources on Tuesday.
Local police were also assisting the PFSA officials to detect the crime, they said.
According to unconfirmed reports, a woman was murdered by unknown killers who threw her dead body at a deserted place in Jorian Village, within limits of Police Station (PS) Chontra. Later on, the assailants torched the dead body of woman in a bid to remove evidences. Some locals alerted police about the crime on which SSP (Operations) Muhammad Bin Ashraf ordered SP Saddar Circle Behram Khan to holding inquiry into reports of murder.
Sources said that officials of PFSA along with Chontra police visited the crime scene and collected evidences for lab examination.
They said that PFSA officials collected soil samples, some ashes and burnt pieces of clothes from the crime scene.
Evidences were dispatched to Punjab Forensic Laboratory, Thokar Niaz Baig for final report, sources said.
Station House Officer (SHO) Police Station (PS) Chontra Zaheer Babar, when contacted, confirmed the visit of PFSA to the crime scene.
He said the officials of PFSA found no solid evidence from the crime scene that led police to ascertain the murder of woman.
He said the experts told him the crime did not occur here. “It is commonly known that the fat of a burnt human being melts and mixes into the soil. But in this case officials found no such evidence,” he said. SHO said he questioned scores of people living around the crime scene but none of them gave any clue to police.
He added he submitted initial report with SP Saddar Circle mentioning no woman was killed in Jorian. He said PFSA officials would also issue their detailed report and wound hand over it to police.

Officers were called to the 200-block of Avenue C North early Sunday evening for a report of the two unconscious people.

In a hypothetical bar, over hypothetical drinks between hypothetical friends, Porsche's director for its GT model line, Andreas Preuninger, imagines a hypothetical conversation about hypothetical numbers.
“People are discussing lap times that they can never achieve themselves over a beer,” Preuninger said. His tone reflected less interest than a checking account.
The 2018 Porsche 911 GT3 lives in reality—not lap times—and it's a good thing, he insisted.
MORE: 2018 Porsche 911 GT3 RS spy shots and video
“We're chasing a feel. We want to address the car's driver's attributes. Our experience is to have the best lap times—to be very competitive—with certain models. But we shouldn't forget the driver's side of everything,” Preuninger said.
That approach adds context to the 6-speed manual making its return to the 2018 Porsche 911 GT3. It also adds subtext to the car's refresh, which made its local debut at the 2017 New York auto show on last week.

“The car has to give confidence to the driver to push his own limit safely. To set up a car that way, you will get a rewarding car. There are some cars that can only be driven in a special way that mostly only professionals can do and this not what we're looking for in GT3,” he said.
Despite sitting atop the 911 range—for now—the new GT3 was designed to be more approachable and progressive than some may be expecting, Preuninger admitted. That's not to say that a car with 500 horsepower, 339 pound-feet of torque, and sub-4 second 0-to-60 mph times is slow—but those numbers live in a place left for bar bets between friends, he said.
“The car will never bite you. You can lean hard on the car without it making any unwanted moves. It's not a boring car—there's no understeer—but it's also forgiving,” he said.
To get the qualitative feeling, Preuninger admitted that there was a quantitative effort to nail the small details.
MUST SEE: What's new for Porsche in 2017
The engine's iron-based cylinder coating was patented by Porsche for its extreme low-friction qualities and efficiency. Preuninger won't discuss many details—other than it's not a ceramic compound—because it's a direct link to Porsche's race program.
“It's very effective, let's put it like that,” he said.
He stops at that because he doesn't want the GT3 to be about cylinder coating.
“A coating of a cylinder wall is maybe not the primary reason that someone buys the car. So it's a small fragment of a huge modification program—and this is just part of it. Just a fragment in a big puzzle,” he said.
One Cool Pictures, the Hong Kong sales and production company controlled by Louis Koo, is making a massive step up in scale, launching four movies with a combined budget of over $130 million (HK$1.01 billion).
Koo will star in both “Back to the Past” and “Warriors of the Future,” which the company launched at FilMart on Monday. At the Hong Kong market, the company is also showing teasers of “The Trough,” which was written and directed by Nick Cheung. Cheung also stars alongside Chinese actress Xu Jinglei.
To be directed by Ng Yuen-fai, “Back to the Past” is a period action film in which the richest man in Hong Kong attempts to go back in time to rescue his son, whose earlier trip into the past went disastrously wrong. Production on a $45 million budget is set to begin in the third quarter of this year. Raymond Lam and Jessica Hsuan co-star.
Already in post-production, “Warriors of the Future” is a sci-fi actioner also directed by Ng, on a budget of $56 million. The story follows a race of unusual people who have the ability to suck up human pollution, and who arrive on earth after a meteorite crash. Hong Kong veterans Sean Lau and Carina Lau also star. A major release is anticipated in early 2019.

Koo is one of Hong Kong's best loved stars, known for his good looks and high work rate – and, despite a 20-year career, he appears to be growing as an actor. This weekend he won the best acting prize at the Asian Film Awards for “Paradox,” a Hong Kong picture which was also named as Asian best action movie at the same event. Koo said it was the first time he had won an acting prize in over 200 movie appearances.
Crime actioner, “The Trough” featuring Cheung as a cop who has gone undercover among the Triad gangs, and who accidentally kills another policeman. His dilemma is further increased when, having returned to the right side of the law, he discovers collusion between gangsters and government officials. The film, which also stars Chinese actress Yu Nan, is currently in post production.
Selected buyers are also getting a glimpse at “Storm Cloud,” another movie at development stage, and tagged to have a $32 million production cost.
One Cool Pictures was launched only a few years ago with a slate of smaller Hong Kong-centric titles. But times have changed. “Talent costs have risen. This is the cost of doing business in China these days,” says Christy Choi, distribution director at One Cool Pictures.
The move up in scale reflects the expansion of the mainland Chinese film market to unprecedented level. In the past six months three Chinese-made films have each achieved over $500 million at the mainland box office. That is encouraging Chinese producers and investors to believe that they should be working on budgets increasingly comparable to those of Hollywood's mini-studios and studio-affiliated production houses.

(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc missed quarterly profit forecasts as steady ad sales growth was offset by increased spending to promote its consumer gadgets, YouTube video app and cloud computing services, the U.S. technology company said on Thursday.
Shares of Alphabet dipped more than 5 percent after-hours, before steadying with a 2.7 percent loss at $1,149.93.
Though growing demand for pricey ads on mobile apps has kept Google's core ad business surging, the company has moved aggressively to maintain dominance and diversify sales. Expenses jumped 27 percent to $24.7 billion in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period.
Google bought ads during major sports events to market its new Pixel 2 smartphone and YouTube television service. It slashed prices on other hardware in the race to get online search and media streaming devices into people's homes. Google continued to quickly add staff to its enterprise sales unit.
A growing portion of revenue has been spent on having the Google search engine set as the default option on products and services such as Apple Inc's iPhone and Mozilla's Firefox browser.
Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts in a post-earnings conference call that higher marketing costs coincided with holidays and that payments to partners such as Apple and Mozilla would steady in coming quarters.
Investments are paying off, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said, noting that cloud computing is generating $1 billion in quarterly sales. He said Google's G Suite workplace software package had doubled its customers to 4 million in two years, as Reuters first reported earlier on Thursday.
Financial analysts looked past the spending.
“Overall, it was a good quarter. Advertising revenue is still up significantly,” Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said in an email.
Fourth-quarter sales increased 24 percent to $32.3 billion, above the average analysts' estimate of $31.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted quarterly profit of $6.8 billion, or $9.70 per share, missed estimates of $7 billion, or $10 per share.
The profit figure excludes a $9.9 billion tax charge as Alphabet joined much of corporate America in reporting large one-time expenses in the fourth quarter due to U.S. legislation enacted in December that lowers corporate rates.

The tax law has given companies more affordable access to overseas profits, and Porat said Alphabet would make a “modest increase” in share buybacks with an additional allocation of $8.6 billion.
The growing use of smartphones worldwide has been a bonanza for social media company Facebook Inc and Google, which research firm EMarketer estimates together account for nearly 60 percent of mobile ad sales.
Google sells ad space on its search engine, its fast-growing YouTube video streaming service and a network of third-party websites and apps.
The company's computer algorithms have become more effective at delivering mobile ads likely to make customers sit through commercials, install an app or visit a website.
Led by such ads, Alphabet generated $110.9 billion in full-year revenue, up 23 percent from 2016 and topping $100 billion for the first time. Profit fell 35 percent to $12.6 billion because of the tax bill and a separate charge last summer for a $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine, which is under appeal.
“The company's continued strong top-line growth and myriad new opportunities to drive future growth remain the keys to the stock,” MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said in an email.
Alphabet is attempting to maintain sales growth through new businesses, experimenting with operating a fleet of self-driving taxis through Waymo and licensing medical technology at Verily.

Non-advertising revenue from Google combined with revenue from Verily and the other Alphabet companies was $15.5 billion in 2017, accounting for about 14 percent of total revenue, compared to $10.9 billion, or 12 percent, in 2016.
Alphabet also said on Thursday that veteran board member John Hennessy took over as chairman the day before from Eric Schmidt, a long-time Google executive who will remain a board member and technical adviser.
The potential for further regulation on privacy, monopolistic business practices or content vetting is among investors' top concerns about tech companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc that are tapping their unrivaled consumer behavior data to branch beyond their core businesses.
MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson said in a note to clients last month that Google had “the most unrecognized value” of big publicly traded tech companies despite some concerns about regulatory issues.

The impact of Justice Kennedy's Retirement Announcement
The latest round of Supreme Court rulings and a pending retirement is enough to raise the anxiety level of most folks. Whether pro or con, the nation's top court is about to change. The swing votes of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely a thing of the past as the Trump administration will look for an appointment that is much more reliable to the conservative base. Kennedy, a lifelong Republican, took pivotal votes on the issues of affirmative action, a woman's right to an abortion, same-sex marriage, challenging the notion of sentencing intellectually disabled defendants to death, and a host of other issues that gave many conservatives heartburn. Now more than ever, we are going to appreciate the ability of a justice to be impartial, show growth on an issue, or be open to another point of view. The laws are a guide, but we can never underestimate the role that politics, ideology, faith and several social determinants can play in influencing a justice's interpretation of the law. Just look at what happened this week.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote, handed organized labor a major setback. Ruling that government workers who don't want to join a union can't be forced to help pay for collective bargaining, the decision broke along partisan lines. Public unions, who have been a major player in helping to shape political leadership, legislative policy, and workplace governance, are going to lose millions of dollars.
Earlier in the week, the U.S. Supreme Court uphold Donald Trump's travel ban, which restricts entry, in some form, from Somalia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Venezuela. Again, the decision was along partisan lines, with a 5-4 vote. In a historic turn, in deciding this constitutionality of the ban, a 1944 court case, Korematsu v. United States, was determined by the Chief Justice John Roberts to have been “wrongly decided”. This case centered around the courts approving the placement of Japanese-Americans in internment camps during World War II.
This was the first time the Supreme Court ever said this publicly. Whether you agree or not, the action opens the door to public criticism and perhaps reversals of past Supreme Court decisions, which has typically not been done. Rowe v. Wade, the landmark case that decided a woman's decision to have an abortion, certainly comes to mind.
This feels like just the tip of the iceberg though. As the courts become more like a political actor, rather than an impartial referee that uses the rule of the law to guide their decisions, the threats to American democracy deepen. Could we see major decisions of the courts shifting or changing every 30–40 years?
There are folks who are depending on it and that's why they were willing to steal a U.S. Supreme Court appointment from then President Barack Obama. On the day of the announcement of the travel ban, Kentucky's U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, couldn't resist tweeting a photo of him and Justice Neil Gorsuch. Remember, McConnell blocked Obama from appointing Merrick Garland to the court. So now, we wait to see the impact of Trump's next appointment.
NASHVILLE—The man accused of fatally shooting a woman and wounding six people at a Tennessee church in September faces a 43-count indictment, including charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and felony civil rights intimidation. The grand jury indictment in Davidson County against 26-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson comes several months after the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ shooting in Nashville. He has been held without bond since September. His arraignment is March 28. He hasn't appeared in court yet. An arrest affidavit from September says Samson waived his rights and told police he arrived armed and fired at the church. The Sunday shooting rampage killed 38-year-old Melanie L. Crow of Smyrna, Tennessee. She was shot in the church parking lot. All of the victims in the church shooting were white, but authorities have not definitively said whether they believe Samson, who is Black, specifically targeted them based on their race or not. The indictment doesn't specify which civil rights were infringed upon. In October, Nashville Police Detective Steve Jolley testified that a note in Samson's car referred to a white supremacist's 2015 massacre at a South Carolina Black church.

The note found on the dashboard read something like, “Dylann Roof was less than nothing,” Jolley said. “It was really kind of just vague,” Jolley said. But Jolley said Samson downplayed the role of race to detectives.
“I asked him specifically and he said that he didn't give much thought to race,” Jolley said. “I think he also said the same thing about religion. So he didn't indicate to me any particular thing for motivation.” Jolley said Samson also told him he heard voices and had visions. Samson wouldn't elaborate on a vision of the church when pressed by police during an interview, Jolley said. Authorities have said Samson came to the U.S. from Sudan as a child in 1996 and is a U.S. citizen. The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Nashville quickly opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting. Churchgoer Robert Caleb Engle has testified that during the rampage, he twice confronted the gunman, who was wearing a tactical vest and a motorcycle-style mask with a clown smile on it. Engle said he was pistol-whipped three times in the head. At one point, he pushed the gun back on the shooter and a shot fired, striking the gunman and sending him to the ground. Engle said his father kicked the gun away, stood on the shooter's hand and told Engle to go get his gun out of his truck. Engle came back with his weapon, put his foot on the shooter's back and stood guard until first responders arrived. According to police records, Samson struggled to hold a job, had a volatile relationship with a woman that twice involved police this year, and also had expressed suicidal thoughts in June.

With absolutely no fanfare at all, Apple has just announced a new iPad simply called ‘iPad' or ‘iPad 9.7'. It's taking the place of the iPad Air 2 in Apple's tablet line-up, so don't think of this as an iPad Pro successor so much as a more affordable, mid-range offering.
But the iPad Air 2 was once a flagship tablet and still impresses, so just how does this new iPad 9.7 compare?
We've got all the answers here, as we put the two slates head-to-head, looking at their design, screen, power, price and more.
Design
Not much has changed here, with both the new iPad 9.7 and the iPad Air 2 sporting a slim metal unibody in gold, silver or space gray.
There are differences to the size and weight though, with the new iPad coming in at 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm and 469g (or 478g for the cellular model), while the iPad Air 2 is 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm and 437g, or 444g for the cellular version.
So they're the same length and width, but the iPad Air 2 is actually significantly slimmer and a little bit lighter, despite being an older model.
That, perhaps, is why Apple has ditched the Air moniker this year, but at 7.5mm thick the new iPad 9.7 is still far from fat.
Both models also have a home button on the front with Touch ID built in, so from a design perspective it's really only the weight and thickness that differs – and those things work out in the older slate's favor.
Screen
Nothing seems to have changed here, with the new iPad 9.7 and the iPad Air 2 both sporting a 9.7-inch 2048 x 1536 display with a pixel density of 264 pixels per inch.
The lack of a change here is no surprise though, given that even the pricier iPad Pro 9.7 has a screen of that size and spec.
OS and power
The new iPad 9.7 runs iOS 10.2, and while the iPad Air 2 shipped with iOS 8.1 it's upgradeable to iOS 10.2, so there's no difference in operating system, though it's worth noting that the new iPad is likely to be supported with updates for longer.
Power has been given a boost with the new slate sporting an A9 chipset, along with an M9 coprocessor. The iPad Air 2 meanwhile uses the older Apple A8X chip – that's a generation behind, so the new iPad 9.7 should be a little snappier, though notably it's not using Apple's latest A10 Fusion chip.
Camera
Apple hasn't upgraded the new iPad's camera to match the iPad Pro 9.7. Instead it's stuck with the same snapper as the iPad Air 2, namely an 8MP rear one and a 1.2MP FaceTime one.
Neither camera on either slate has a flash either, and video recording tops out at 1080p at 30 frames per second, so don't expect to be able to shoot anything brilliant on either tablet – though why you'd want to use a 9.7-inch slate for photography is beyond us anyway.
Battery
Apple doesn't reveal the exact sizes of the batteries in its devices, so we don't know yet exactly how the new iPad 9.7 stacks up, but Apple claims it can last for up to 10 hours of video watching or web browsing on Wi-Fi, which is a match for the 7,340mAh iPad Air 2, so it's likely that they're the same size.
Price
Apple's listing the new iPad 9.7 with a starting price of $329/£339/AU$469 for a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and it tops out at $559/£559/AU$799 for a 128GB Wi-Fi and cellular version. There are only 32GB and 128GB versions available.
The iPad Air 2, while no longer available from Apple itself, was recently available starting at $399/£379/AU$569 for a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and rising to $629/£589/AU$879 for a 128GB Wi-Fi and cellular version.
So the new iPad 9.7 is actually cheaper than the iPad Air 2 was (and that's following price drops – the iPad Air 2 launched at a higher price), though don't be surprised if other retailers now drop the price of the iPad Air 2 below that of the new iPad.
Takeaway
The new iPad 9.7 doesn't appear much different to the iPad Air 2 and in some ways – notably the thickness and weight – it's arguably worse.
But with a faster chipset it could be slightly better and slightly more future-proofed overall.
It's also cheaper, which is perhaps the single biggest reason to buy it – that and the fact that the iPad Air 2 could become increasingly hard to get hold of.
It's definitely not the slate to replace your aging iPad Air 2 with – check out the iPad Pro 9.7 or wait for the iPad Pro 2 if you're interested in doing that. But if you're after an Apple slate that won't break the bank, the new iPad could be a strong option.
Ah, it's finally time again to put on our "theory hats" and analyse every tiny thing pertaining to Game of Thrones. Considering how many tiny details have amounted to major revelations on the show, it's a pretty solid strategy; and when the HBO series dangles sneaky hints right in front of our faces as season seven approaches, they're too good to pass up. Granted, only mega fans would even pick up on the massive implications of the latest subtle Game of Thrones clues . . . but that's what we're here for, right?
Mere weeks from the seventh season premiere, the official GOT YouTube channel uploaded two clips from past seasons without any explanation. Naturally, fans speculated wildly about the potential meanings of each video pertaining to the next season. Read on for explanations about these clues and how they could drastically affect the plot of season seven.
Hint #1: Bran's Role Beyond the Wall
The first video clip uploaded to the channel hearkens all the way back to season one and features an exchange between Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and his elderly caretaker, Old Nan (Margaret John). At Bran's behest, Nan begins to tell the crippled young lord a story about a Winter unlike anything he's ever experienced as a "sweet Summer child." The woman begins her tale with a grave reminder: "Fear is for the Winter." Proving why the harsh season is worthy of fear, she goes on to describe "the Long Night" thousands of years beforehand, when White Walkers and their hordes of giant, pale spiders came for the first time. Old Nan speaks of kings freezing in their castles and mothers smothering their babies to spare them from freezing or starving. Understandably, Bran appears terrified but morbidly fascinated by the tale.
"Fear is for the Winter."
Of course, fans now know that this story is more relevant to Bran's life than ever; he has experienced the horror of the undead White Walkers and their leader, the Night's King, firsthand. Now that his first Winter has arrived, Bran is desperate to use his own powers as a greenseer to prevent the White Walkers from wreaking the same type of havoc on the Seven Kingdoms that they've already brought into his life by killing loyal Hodor, Jojen Reed, and the sage Three Eyed Raven.
So, what does this video clip mean for Bran's future on Game of Thrones? The most reasonable explanation is that the moment between Old Nan and Bran was intended to foreshadow his current predicament, facing horrors unlike he's ever imagined in the throes of Winter. But some fans also believe that this cryptic hint may have deeper implications for Bran's role beyond the Wall; namely, that Bran may be the key to preventing another Long Night.
We know that Bran is capable of changing the course of history by travelling back in time, where his own actions have unforeseeable consequences; an outburst from Bran is what causes Hodor to mentally unravel, and another outburst gives young Ned Stark pause outside the Tower of Joy. Could it be that Bran decides to travel back in time in order to change the future, stopping the Night's King from ever gaining a foothold or even existing?
Hint #2: Sansa's Next Move at Winterfell
The second clip uploaded to the GOT channel is from season six and features an emotional exchange between Sansa Stark and Jon Snow. In the snippet, Jon tells Sansa that he's having the lord's chambers prepared for her, and that she should stay there as the Lady of Winterfell. She urges him to take the room, but he refuses, insisting: "I'm not a Stark." "You are to me," Sansa replies. The pair go on to discuss Littlefinger, whom Sansa declares "only a fool would trust." They share an embrace, and Jon tells Sansa that they need to have one another's backs, because they have enough enemies trying to tear their family apart. The conversation ends when they note that Winter is officially upon them, just as Ned Stark always promised.
"I'm not a Stark." "You are to me."
One of the heaviest questions about season seven is whether Sansa will be able to withstand Littlefinger's manipulation, especially as he encourages her to betray Jon and vie for the throne herself. Several fans took this video as an indicator that Sansa has learned from Littlefinger and will do some manipulation of her own in the coming season.
"Her whole character arc is about her learning to play her hand as a courtly lady, and take advantage of the (very narrow) feminine powers she has a woman in Westeros . . . If Sansa doesn't get to turn the tables on Littlefinger at some point and have her 'student has become the master' moment, it'd be a disservice to her narrative arc," wrote one Redditor. Sansa's insistence that Jon is a Stark to her seems to further cement the idea that she'll betray Littlefinger, not Jon. It was her own betrayal of Arya in season one that led to her direwolf, Lady, being executed, and brought Joffrey's years of torment upon her; Sansa has learned never to trust outside of her family, and she's very unlikely to turn her back on Jon now that they're reunited.
Of course, we'll have to wait and see how Littlefinger's fate plays out once the show returns. The only thing we know for sure is that it feels like we have a Long Night (and then some) until the season premieres.
By Martha B. Jacob –
Principal Chris Smith at the Ripley-Union-Lewis-Huntington Middle School recently issued a ban on all personal electronic devices including cell phones.
The ban is now in place at the middle school until further notice, according to Principal Smith.
“We implemented this social media ban to eliminate texting during school time and stop the posting of videos being recorded during lunch, recess and transition times,” Smith said. “As a result, it has increased face to face interaction, which we believe to be a plus in regard to social skills for their future.
“Technology is still a high priority in the classroom. Every student in the RULH School District has a personal chromebook to use for learning purposes. This was made possible through the community of RULH Local Schools by the passing of a school levy in the fall of 2014.”
A notice of the ban was sent to the parents or guardian of every student in the school.
Smith explained that although the students are allowed to bring the electronic devices to the middle school, they must be powered off upon entering the building. Once the student exits the building they are free to power the electronic device back up.
Regarding extracurricular activities such as play practice, athletic practice and/or music or athletic events, students may power their devices back up under the supervision of a teacher and or parent.
Students may power devices back up at the end of dances in order to text or call parents for pick-up.
“If a student gets caught on their cell phones,” Smith said. “And it's their first offense, the teacher has been directed to confiscate/ask for a student's phone if powered up and turn it into the office. The device will be returned to the student at the end of the day.”
Smith said that with the second offense the teacher will confiscate/ask for the device then turn it into the office and a parent/guardian will need to come to the school to pick it up. That student will lose all personal electronic device privileges for the rest of the school year.
After the third offense, the consequences beyond use of electronic device will be administered and the student will no longer be allowed to bring the device to school for the rest of the current school year.
“Our students will be allowed to work on their chromebook and/or a classroom computer,” Smith said. “Anyone who has any questions about this ban, please contact me at (937) 795-8001.”
Nine parishioners of Mother Emanuel AME Church were killed after a Bible study on June 17, 2015. (Source: Family/Facebook)
June 17 marks two years since the Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting in which nine parishioners were shot and killed after a Bible study.
Some 20 several commemorative events to remember the victims and also honor the three survivors of the massacre have been planned.
Rev. Eric Manning says two years later, people are still calling, visiting and sending letters of support for the church.
On Friday, a couple visiting from Greenville placed a fresh bouquet of flowers at the church's front gate.
"It is our most sincere prayer is that as people come they will be able to reflect upon the tragic event of June 17, 2015 but not stay in that period but begin to reflect how they have become better, how they have become stronger," Manning said.
Manning says the two-year anniversary events of the church shooting should be more than just a time of healing and reflection.
"We've been talking about racism, we've been talking about racial relations," he said. "We've been talking about all of these other dynamics and now it's time to begin to put our words into action."
The scheduled events include a unity walk, Bible study on forgiveness, church services, kid-friendly events, church tours and more. This year's theme is "The Light of Hope."
"My prayer is that as the congregation continues to write their next chapter that everyone understands where we are and that we're still trying to heal, we're sill trying to grow, we're sill trying to recover," Manning said.
The commemoration events will conclude with a concert featuring artists from across the community at the church.
"Singing praises unto God and thanking God for continuing to give us the strength to move forward," Manning said.
Manning said the church has an empowerment center next door where clinicians provide support to the families and first responders connected to this shooting throughout the year.
Nine people were killed, including State Sen. and the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. Several of the victims were also ministers at the church, including Rev. Sharonda Singleton, retired pastor Dr. Daniel Simmons, and Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor. The other victims were Ethel Lance, Cynthia Graham Hurd, Susie Jackson, Myra Thompson, and Tywanza Sanders.
Polly Sheppard, Felicia Sanders and Sanders' 11-year-old granddaughter survived the shootings. Both Sanders and Sheppard spoke of forgiving the gunman, Dylann Roof, for the crime.
"Forgiveness is a relief," Sanders said in a February 2016 interview. "Dylann Roof doesn't care if I forgive him or not, forgiveness is for me it's not for him.
"I forgave him also," Sheppard says. "I believe God will forgive him too. I believe in repentance I believe God will forgive him too."
Roof was convicted in December of 33 federal charges connected to the shootings on June 17, 2015. In January, he was sentenced to death and is now in a maximum security prison in Indiana awaiting the death penalty.
The “Light of Hope” commemorative events planned are for June 15 through 30. They are listed in order by date.

This article was originally published on January 19, 2015.
It is one of the most well-known and stirring folk songs in the history of America, perhaps rivaled only by “This Land Is Your Land” in terms of significance and impact. As is the case with so many folk songs, however, it's hard to pin down just where “We Shall Overcome” originated.
An early twentieth-century gospel song entitled “I'll Overcome Someday” written by Charles Albert Tindley likely provided the source for the memorable refrain, while the melody strikingly resembles the spiritual “No More Auction Block” (which also inspired the tune for Bob Dylan's “Blowin' In The Wind.”)
The key impetus for the song's widespread popularization came when a music director from Tennessee named Zilphia Horton learned it from striking tobacco workers in Charleston, SC in 1945. She subsequently taught the song to Pete Seeger, who, along with several other performers, began to spread the song across the U.S. in the 40's and 50's. In 1957, Seeger performed at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee for an audience that included Martin Luther King, Jr.
By the 1960's, the song served as the unofficial anthem of the Civil Rights movement. Joan Baez performed it at the March on Washington in 1963, the setting for King's famous “I Have A Dream” speech. President Lyndon B. Johnson quoted the refrain in a 1965 speech to Congress emphasizing the import of Civil Rights legislation. “It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life,” Johnson said. “Their cause must be our cause, too, because it's not just Negroes, but really, it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.”
Martin Luther King, Jr. certainly never forgot the song. In a sermon in Memphis just days before his death in 1968, King said, “There's a little song that we sing in our movement down in the South. I don't know if you've heard it. You know, I've joined hands so often with students and others behind jail bars singing it: ‘We shall overcome.' Sometimes we've had tears in our eyes when we joined together to sing it, but we still decided to sing it: ‘We shall overcome.' Oh, before this victory's won, some will have to get thrown in jail some more, but we shall overcome.”
So what is it about the song that so moves people? Maybe it's the way that the message is so undiluted and potent, a statement of determination and resilience that no amount of wrongheadedness could possibly deny. And yet “We Shall Overcome” carries with it an undeniable hint of melancholy via the sober melody and the qualification of the title phrase with the word “someday,” which tacitly acknowledges that the battle the song details is far from won.
Some extra-added poignancy hangs heavy on the song this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, as it's the first time America is celebrating the holiday since the death of Pete Seeger on January 27, 2014 at the age of 94. We may not be able to pinpoint its exact origins, but, on this day more than any other, we can celebrate “We Shall Overcome” as a shining example of the power of song.

Facebook is making good on Mark Zuckerberg's promise to prioritize user safety and data privacy over its developer platform. Today Facebook and Instagram announced a slew of API shutdowns and changes designed to stop developers from being able to pull your data or your friends' data without express permission, drag in public content or trick you into sharing. Some changes go into effect today, and others roll out on August 1 so developers have more than 90 days to fix their apps. They follow the big changes announced two weeks ago.
Most notably, app developers will have to start using the standardized Facebook sharing dialog to request the ability to publish to the News Feed on a user's behalf. They'll no longer be able to use the publish_actions API that let them design a custom sharing prompt. A Facebook spokesperson says this change was planned for the future because the consistency helps users feel in control, but the company moved the deadline up to August 1 as part of today's updates because it didn't want to have to make multiple separate announcements of app-breaking changes.
One significant Instagram Graph API change is going into effect today, which removes the ability to pull the name and bio of users who leave comments on your content, though commenters' usernames and comment text is still available.
Facebook's willingness to put user safety over platform utility indicates a maturation of the company's “Hacker Way” that played fast-and-loose with people's data in order to attract developers to its platform who would in turn create functionality that soaked up more attention.
For more on Facebook's API changes, check out our breakdown of the major updates:
It's been more than two years since a brazen daylight shootout took place in Vernon's Polson Park. The trial of a man accused of taking part in that exchange of gunfire began in Vernon Supreme Court on Tuesday.
Jacob Lowes is facing five charges including attempted murder.
Tuesday morning, crown counsel laid out its case. The crown alleges that two people were trying to rob Lowes in Unit 109 at the Green Valley Motel across the highway from Polson Park.
“The robbery did not go as planned. The shotgun the robbers took with them was fired into the ceiling of Unit 109. The robbers ran away into or near Polson Park,” said crown counsel Jeremy Guild.
Crown counsel alleges that just before 8:00 a.m. on August 12, 1014 Lowes chased the alleged robbers into Polson Park and ended up in a shootout in which five or six shots were fired.

“The crown's theory is that Mr. Lowes was part of the business of the sale of illicit drugs from Unit 109 and that after the attempted robbery of his drug business he chased after and shot the robbers…in Polson Park to show he would stand up to intimidation and protect his business,” said Guild.
No one was hurt in the shooting. Lowes has pleaded not guilty to all five charges, none of which relate to drugs. His lawyers said the case against Lowes is circumstantial.
“It is up to the crown to prove all the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and our client obviously has the right to remain silent. It is up to us to determine at the end of the crown's case whether or not there is any reason for him to take the stand or if there is any case for him to answer,” said defence counsel Glenn Verdurmen.
The trial is scheduled to last two weeks.

St Petersburg-Mikel John Obi was told that his father had been kidnapped and would be killed if he reported anything – just hours before he led Nigeria into their final World Cup group phase tie against Argentina.
The Nigeria captain received the shocking news as he travelled on the team bus to the stadium in St Petersburg last Tuesday. A family member called him and told him that he had to call the kidnappers on a designated number. When Mikel did so, he was ordered to pay a ransom.
Mikel has told the Guardian that he could not confide in anyone at the Nigerian Football Federation – partly because he did not want to be a distraction before the game – and how he asked himself whether he had the strength to play.
Pa Michael Obi was abducted in south-east Nigeria as he travelled to a funeral along the Makurdi-Enugu expressway from Jos. The police in Nigeria were able to secure his release but Mikel said his father was tortured during a week-long ordeal and is currently receiving emergency treatment in hospital. It is the second time that he has been kidnapped, with the first one being in August 2011.
Mikel tried to put the trauma to one side and he played the 90 minutes against Argentina. Nigeria lost 2-1 to a late Marcus Rojo goal to exit the tournament. A 1-1 draw would have seen them qualify for the last 16.
“I played while my father was in the hands of bandits,” Mikel said. “I had to suppress the trauma. I took a call four hours before kick-off to tell me what had happened. I was emotionally distraught and I had to make the decision about whether I was mentally ready to play. I was confused. I did not know what to do but, in the end, I knew that I could not let 180 million Nigerians down. I had to shut it out of my head and go and represent my country first. I could not even inform the coaches or NFF staff and only a very tight circle of my friends knew.
“I was told that they would shoot my dad instantly if I reported to the authorities or told anybody. I also did not want to discuss it with the coach [Gernot Rohr] because I did not want my issue to become a distraction to him or the rest of the team on the day of such an important game. As much as I wanted to discuss it with the coach, I could not. Thankfully, my father was safely released on Monday afternoon. I thank the police authorities for their rescue efforts and the support I've received from friends and family members. Unfortunately, my dad is now in hospital receiving emergency treatment as a result of the torture he received during his capture.”
Johnny Kaw, Bigger Than Bunyan
Manhattan, Kansas
On the family tree of American folklore characters, Johnny Kaw is a youthful twig. He was birthed in 1955 -- not the pioneer days of yore -- by George Filinger, a horticulture professor at Kansas State University. Filinger was upset that Kansas newspapers were ignoring Kansas history, particularly Manhattan's 100th birthday. He felt that a larger-than-life state hero would spur pride in Kansas's past.
According to Filinger, Johnny Kaw was the color of golden wheat, and could bring rain by lopping off tornado spouts with his supersize scythe. He helped Pecos Bill dig the Grand Canyon, then used the dirt to smooth out Kansas for farming. Paul Bunyan once trampled Johnny's crops, so Johnny grabbed the lumberjack and plowed the bed of the Mississippi River with Bunyan's face.
A character of such mythic proportions deserved an epic statue.
It took 11 years before funds could be raised to build one, with Filinger himself contributing much of the money. Newspapers at the time wrote that Johnny was purposely scaled to be bigger than the 27-foot-tall Paul Bunyan in Brainerd, Minnesota. Built of cement and steel, like other 1960s civic symbols such as Albert the Bull and The Golden Driller, Johnny Kaw was designed to last.
Less than a month after his dedication on May 15, 1966, a tornado ravaged much of Manhattan, but Johnny survived without a scratch.
Filinger died in 1978, unfortunately unsuccessful in his effort to make Johnny Kaw a household name. The folklore giant of Kansas remains unknown to most of the world. But he's a perennial favorite in Manhattan, where his statue is well-maintained in the city park.
Johnny Kaw, with his harvester shoulders and brawny arms, looks ready to whup old plow-face Bunyan if he shows up again.

The Atom Tickets app is reporting that “Avengers: Infinity War” has set a record for the highest pre-sale volume ever.
The company said Tuesday that pre-sales are 7% higher than the previous record holder, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” and 250% higher than “Black Panther” at the same point in their pre-sales.
It also said that pre-sales for tickets to “Avengers: Infinity Wars” are doubling day over day. This is the fastest rate of increase Atom has seen for any Marvel title during release week. The movie begins opening in previews on Thursday night in North America.
The pre-sale average ticket price for “Avengers: Infinity War” on Atom Tickets is $15.45. This is the highest pre-sale average ticket price Atom has seen on any Marvel or “Star Wars” title. The pre-sale average ticket price for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was $14.51.
The movie is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who helmed “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” and “Captain America: Civil War.” “Infinity War” will combine Avengers stars like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson with newcomers, including “Spider-Man: Homecoming's” Tom Holland, “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman, “Thor: Ragnarok” breakout Tessa Thompson. The Guardians of the Galaxy, lead by Chris Pratt's Star-Lord, will also be in the tentpole.
Atom Tickets was founded in 2014 by Matthew Bakal, Ameesh Paleja, and Geoff Shaevitz.

TORONTO – Ontario is putting $1.8 million toward 15 pilot projects aimed at improving police response to sexual violence.
The projects and funding will span two years and are part of the Liberal government's action plan to end sexual violence and harassment.

The government says the projects will provide “a more compassionate, sensitive response when survivors of sexual violence come forward and report their experiences” and will enhance police investigative practices.
The projects include a child- and youth-focused sexual assault advocacy centre in Barrie, Ont., a private and secure location for victim interviews with provincial police in two northern communities outside of the area detachments, and several police training programs.

Police in Windsor, Ont., will set up an online tool allowing complainants to make a report online, which they hope will reduce barriers to reporting, but will also provide victims with resources if they indicate they don't want police involvement.
Police services will be asked for the next round of proposals in the spring of 2018.
Much like baseball , hot dogs, and the Fourth of July , the Ford Mustang has come to define American culture. Indeed, ever since the car was first unveiled on April 17, 1964 at the World's Fair in New York, crowds have been enamored with one of the world's most recognizable muscle cars. As such, it comes as no surprise that many were elated of the recent announcement that Ford plans to continue production for the Mustang Shelby GT350 and GT350R models through 2018.
Ford's new Mustang Shelby won't be receiving any sort of upgrade to its body or engine. But that shouldn't really deter potential buyers, as the latest Shelby already boasts a 5.2-liter, 525-horsepowered V8 engine, and an aggressively designed exterior that turns nearly every head on the road.
But that doesn't mean the car won't include any new features. In fact, Ford indicated that they will be realeasing the 2018 model in three new colors: Orange Fury, Kona Blue and Lead Foot Gray.
While no prices have been released, the new vehicles are expected to hit showrooms this fall.
A Nova Scotia judge has allowed a Halifax-area father unsupervised parenting time with his child, despite a mother's objections over his “unorthodox beliefs” on white pride and other racial matters.
In her decision, Justice Carole Beaton of the provincial supreme court's Family Division says it's in the six-year-old's best interest to have contact with the father.
READ MORE: Parents can't be faulted for their poverty, judge rules in N.S. toddler-custody case
But she says the father is not to engage in discussions in the child's presence that would expose his controversial political, historical and world views.
Beaton says that father clarified on cross-examination that he is not a white supremacist but rather an Asian supremacist with unorthodox views on “white European pride.”
The judge found the mother's concerns about the father's world views and his criminal past were only raised after the breakdown of their relationship.

She says many parents with criminal records and unconventional views enjoy time with their children, and to sever the relationship between the father and the child would confuse the six-year-old.
A five-run lead wasn't enough for the Yankees as they squander it all away and allow the Indians to take Game 2 in a dramatic 9-8 win in 13 innings. (1:25)
CLEVELAND -- The Indians are one win away from a chance to play for the American League pennant, but it has become abundantly clear that life is about to get more challenging than it was during the 33-4 funfest that marked the end of their regular season.
The Indians' cleanup man and resident slugger is suddenly questionable with an ankle injury. Their seemingly untouchable ace is fresh off his biggest clunker this season. And even if they win one of the next three games to eliminate the New York Yankees -- a very likely scenario -- the Houston Astros are crushing the Boston Red Sox in a way that would make them a colossal challenge in the next round.
When the Indians arrive at the visiting clubhouse at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, hit the trainers' room for treatment and settle in at the cribbage board with manager Terry Francona before Game 3 of the AL Division Series, they won't be paying much attention to the October white noise. What outsiders might regard as a diminished state, they view as an opportunity to make a statement.

It took the Indians 13 innings and 5 hours, 8 minutes to beat the Yankees on Friday, and their resilience spoke volumes. When Yan Gomes' capped a 10-pitch at-bat against Dellin Betances and stroked a single down the third-base line to give Cleveland a 9-8 victory, Progressive Field shook just the way it had when Rajai Davis took Aroldis Chapman deep in Game 7 of the World Series last October.
And the Indians players who were around a year ago could be excused for having flashbacks: With an ability to overcome obstacles and gut punches, this 2017 Tribe team has a lot in common with the 2016 version.
The Indians could have crumbled when designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion rolled his ankle on a baserunning mishap in the first inning and lay writhing on the ground in agony. They could have felt discombobulated when sure-thing starter Corey Kluber logged his worst outing of the season at precisely the wrong time. After allowing a total of four earned runs in six starts during a 5-0, 0.84 September, Kluber got torched for six runs in 2⅔ innings by Gary Sanchez, Aaron Hicks and the Yankees.
But the Indians dug deep and won a game they seemingly had no right to win. They won a bunch of games like this last October, when they survived a decimating run of injuries to the pitching staff and exhibited what closer Cody Allen referred to as "true belief -- not that fake stuff that guys talk about."
At least one of the principals on Friday considered it the best game he has ever taken part in:
"No. 1. Absolutely. No doubt," said outfielder Jay Bruce. "That was an amazing game. There are no words, honestly. To be down to a team like that and put the at-bats together and push the runs across? Honestly, I'm speechless."
Not quite speechless enough, though, to be unable to describe what it felt like when he launched an opposite-field, solo homer off David Robertson in the eighth inning to finally pull the Indians even at 8-8.
"I'm pretty boring when I'm running the bases most of the time," Bruce said. "But emotion kind of overtook me when I rounded second base and saw the guys in the dugout, because you understood at that moment what it took to get back in the game and have an opportunity to win.
"I said from that time, 'We've done too much. We've come too far to win the game against a team like [the Yankees] that has so much talent and firepower in the pen. We were supposed to win. I think that's the bottom line."
The first two days of this series were a testament to the emotional swings that mark the postseason. Trevor Bauer, a seemingly risky choice to start Game 1, dominated the Yankees from the first pitch. And Kluber, who barely gave opponents a sniff while seizing the Cy Young Award from Chris Sale's grip in September, looked out of sorts from the first inning. Of Kluber's 76 pitches, an uncharacteristically low 45 were strikes.
"There are days when you don't feel good but you go out there and kind of manage it and find a way to get through it," Kluber said. "I just didn't have good command tonight. Didn't execute pitches. I threw way too many balls, and it seemed like when I did throw strikes, they were right over the heart of the plate."
If Kluber's cameo was confounding, Encarnacion's injury could have been emotionally devastating. Beyond his team-high 38 homers, 107 RBIs and .377 on base percentage, he's a popular presence in the clubhouse and a particular favorite of the team's young double-play combo, Francisco Lindor and Jose Ramirez. There were some anxious and disquieting moments after Encarnacion jammed his ankle and bent it in an unnatural way to try to avoid being doubled off second.
Francona, whose uncanny sense of crisis management stems from his intimate knowledge of his players' strengths, sought out Lindor to bolster his teammates' spirits after Encarnacion's injury threatened to suck the life out of the dugout.
"I told him, 'Hey, we can't act like we got hit in the stomach and got the wind knocked out of us,'" Francona said. "I said, 'Keep them going.' And he certainly does that. He's wise beyond his years."
A series of pivotal moments added up to one gargantuan comeback. Lindor provided the biggest moment when he drove a Chad Green slider off the right-field foul pole to join Jim Thome, Albert Belle and Elmer Smith -- of the 1920 Tribe -- as the only Cleveland players with postseason grand slams.
"As soon as I hit it, I knew it had a chance of going out," Lindor said. "After a couple of steps, I was like, 'No, don't go foul, please. Just stay fair.' I started blowing on it a little bit."
Bryan Shaw, Andrew Miller, Joe Smith, Allen and Josh Tomlin combined for 8⅔ innings of shutout relief to give the Indians a chance to come back. And Gomes was a two-way hero. After third baseman Erik Gonzalez made a potentially crucial throwing error, Gomes erased the mistake by picking pinch runner Ronald Torreyes off second base. And Gomes' game-winning at-bat against Betances was a monument to focus and tenacity.
As the ball rattled around the left-field corner and Austin Jackson touched home plate to make it 9-8, the Indians streamed onto the field and celebrated something greater than the final score. If they're able to break their 69-year drought and go on the finish the job and win the World Series, they might reflect upon this game as a signature achievement in their season.
"I'm not good at ranking," Francona said. "But it was an honor to be a part of that game."
And as the 37,681 fans at Progressive Field on Friday will attest, it was a joy to watch.

Since scooping the Camera d'Or in Cannes with her directorial debut “Divines,” Houda Benyamina, the ambitious 36 year-old French-Moroccan – one of France's rare jobbing Arab female filmmakers of North African origin — has become one of the country's hottest emerging directors.
“Divines,” which was picked up by Netflix rolling off Cannes' Directors Fortnight, will vie for a Golden Globe later this month, alongside Paul Verhoeven's “Elle,” and Benyamina just got signed by WME agent Jerome Duboz, whose client list ranges from South Korean film master Park Chan-wook (“The Handmaiden”) to up-and-coming Indian helmer Ritesh Batra (“The Lunchbox”) and multi-hyphenate film vet Wim Wenders (“Submergence”).
Benyamina, whose acceptance speech in Cannes gave us a taste of her acerbic, bold personality and ruffled feathers among high-profile French industry figures in the process, hasn't yet been blinded by the spotlights.
“Since Cannes, I have been approached by many American agents but I immediately clicked with Jerome Duboz who happens to have grown up in the same suburb as me in Evry Courcouronnes! From the first email he sent me. I sensed that he got me right away; I totally trust him,” said Benyamina.
“I came from nowhere. Me and producer, Marc-Benoît Créancier (at Easy Tiger) we found each other, the Ch'tis [a nickname for natives of Northern France] and the chick from the ghettos; and because we were both outsiders it was tough to break into the French film community — It's like entering a members-only golf club,” said Benyamina, who was poised to become a hairstylist before taking acting classes and venturing into filmmaking with the shorts “Ma poubelle geante” (“My Giant Trash”) and “Sur la route du paradis” which won two prizes at Dubai.
Benyamina also said “Divines” proved difficult to finance because it was perceived as ‘yet another film about the banlieue (underprivileged French suburb), especially after Celine Sciamma's “Girlhood,” even though the two movies don't have much in common except for the fact that they showcase minority female protagonists from underprivileged suburbs.
But Benyamina claims she and her producer were resourceful and tenacious enough to make the film happen and find the necessary backers in France, including the acquisition exec at French pubcaster France 2 who had initially declined to pre-buy the film and changed her mind after hearing Benyamina speak about it with passion. Like many Arab directors, Benyamina also received support from Doha Film Institute and Dubai Film Connection.
An eminently political film weaved into a friendship tale, “Divines,” which stars her sister Oulaya Amamra and Deborah Lukumuena as two friends determined to make money fast and escape their project for a better life, was conceived by Beyamina following the 2005 riots which erupted after the deaths of two boys who had been running from police in a high-rise ghetto near Paris.
“What's extraordinary with Divines is how universal it is — it sparks enthusiasm and empathy among young female audiences across different ethnic origins and social backgrounds; it captures the complexity of womanhood and the subtleties of a friendship between two women,” said Edouard Waintrop who selected the film for Directors' Fortnight and recently showed it during the rerun screenings of Directors' Fortnight in Geneva where he was surprised to see how well the film clicked with local female auds.
Benyamina, who said she was brought up watching popular, mainstream movies on TV, has a penchant for colorful characters and spunky dialogue filled with punchlines. Besides Martin Scorsese's movies (in particular “Mean Streets”), Benyamina cited films by Bertrand Blier, Henri Verneuil, Ettore Scola and Paolo Pasolini which made her love cinema and inspired in many ways “Divines.”
Rejecting any kind of typecasting, Benyamina is looking to broaden her canvas and tackle different genres going forward.
Although she aspires to make films as freely as possible, Benyamina is not the kind of European “auteur” who only wants to direct movies she's written. In fact, she said she's already found interest in scripts Duboz sent her.
“Alejandro González Iñárritu is a role model for the way he's been leading his career, tackling both personal movies and much bigger films in terms of scope, budget and cast, with the same artistic ambition, the same verve,” said Benyamina.
“Houda is interested in many things beyond the banlieue and her inner world is much bigger than the story of ‘Divines;' For instance in Cannes, she was mesmerized by Alejandro Jodorowsky's ‘Endless Poetry,'” noted Waintrop.
One of her passion projects is “a ‘Cosmos' movie, somewhere between ‘Tree of Life' and ‘Gravity,” said Benyamina with her eyes wide open and a child-like smile.
Another project, which is high up in Beyamina's slate, tells a lifelong love story between a French woman and an American man, and is inspired by a true story. Although Beyamina acknowledged that she recently met James Franco and Robert Pattinson to chat, she said neither had read her script at that time. While she would love to work with either of these actors, she said she could also choose to cast unknown actors who fit the parts, like she did with “Divines.”
“I like to create the atmosphere of an artistic bootcamp where actors really dive deep into their roles and merge with their onscreen characters like Robert de Niro did in ‘Taxi Driver' or Gerard Depardieu in ‘Les valseuses,' Benyamina comented, adding that she's a fan of Konstantin Stanislavski's ‘Method,' the acting technique which is more prominently used in the U.S. than in France.
“If Divines hadn't been acquired by Neflix it would have been seen by 200,000 people max outside of France and thanks to Netflix it's going to be available to 86 million subscribers across 190 countries,” argued Benyamina, adding out that “Netflix democratizes culture around the world and in a way is giving a universal dimension to ‘Divines.'”
Sold by Berlin-based Films Boutique, which is partly owned by the French outfit Films Distribution, “Divines” was released by Diaphana on Aug. 31 and made over 2 million Euros ($2.1 million) from an estimated 324,000 tickets sold — a healthy performance for this type of film. Although “Divines” bowed on Netflix worldwide on Nov. 18, promoted like an “original,” the movie will only be available on France's Netflix service in 2018, as per the country's strict regulation for subscription-based VOD services.
Interestingly, in France, the only movies depicting, to some extent, the struggle of minorities in suburban French ghettoes which made a significant critical and/or commercial impact in the last 10 years – Jacques Audiard's “A Prophet,””Dheepan,” Philippe Faucon's “The Disintegration,””Fatima” and Celine Sciamma's “Boyhood,” among others — weren't directed by minorities.
“French arabs of North-African origins are well represented in French society, but unfortunately they remain for the most part confined – culturally and socially — to ‘zoolands' and minority French filmmakers still have a long way to go to be fairly acknowledged in mainstream culture,” said Waintrop.
Benyamina, who founded the non-profit org 1,000 Visages in 2006 to train and create opportunities for aspiring minority filmmakers and actors in France, hopes to break the glass ceiling with “Divines” at home and abroad, notably at the Golden Globes.
In spite of its rising profile, “Divines” was not considered by France's Oscar committee to represent the country in the foreign-language race and it was not either nominated for the prestigious Louis Delluc prize for first film. It nevertheless earned two nominations – first film and female newcomer (for Oulaya Amamra and Déborah Lukumuena) — at the Lumiere Awards, which is voted on by members of the foreign press.
It remains to be seen how “Divines” will fare at the Cesar Awards (France's equivalent to the Oscars). Last year's edition, Philippe Faucon's “Fatima,” which had also premiered at Directors' Fortnight, won the Cesar awards for best film, female newcomer and adaptation out of four nominations.
SHANGHAI-China and India accounted for more than half of the total number of global deaths attributable to air pollution in 2015, researchers said in a study published on Tuesday.
The U.S.-based Health Effects Institute (HEI) found that air pollution caused more than 4.2 million early deaths worldwide in 2015, making it the fifth highest cause of death, with about 2.2 million deaths in China and India.
The institute's study, the first of its kind, was based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project, a database backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that tracks the role that behavioural, dietary and environmental factors play in deaths across 195 countries.
New evidence and methodologies mean that the estimate is significantly higher than the figure published by the World Health Organization last year, which put the number of global air pollution-related deaths in 2012 at 3 million, HEI said. The institute, which has also launched an online database showing the global impact of pollution on health (https://www.stateofglobalair.org), said 92 percent of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air.
Air pollution has been linked to higher rates of cancer, stroke and heart disease, as well as chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma.
China and India, the world's two most populous countries, each accounted for 1.1 million deaths, the findings showed, but China is pushing ahead when it comes to taking action, HEI president Dan Greenbaum told Reuters.
“(India) has got a longer way to go, and they still appear to have some ministers who say there is not a strong connection between air pollution and mortality in spite of quite a lot of evidence,” he said.
A spokesman for India's environment ministry could not be reached for comment, but minister Anil Madhav Dave said last week that “there is no conclusive data available” on the link between pollution and mortality, media reported.
China's environment ministry did not respond to a request to comment on whether the estimate of 1.1 million deaths was accurate.
Though China has launched a campaign to improve air quality, authorities have been reluctant to draw direct links between air pollution and mortality, with the health ministry saying it had “no data” linking smog to higher incidences of cancer. “It is currently too early to draw conclusions about the extent of the impact of smog on health, especially its long-term impact on the body,” a ministry spokesman told media during a press briefing in January.
In a long-term national healthcare plan published last October, the government acknowledged the link between health and pollution, and pledged to assess the precise impacts as well as boost environmental monitoring capabilities.
During Executive Council budget estimates May 29, Opposition Leader Ryan Meili and Premier Scott Moe entered into an exchange on Koch's current position.
It was revealed she had been on paid leave since April 6, 2018.
Koch was on an unpaid leave from her job as deputy minister to the premier during her unsuccessful Saskatchewan Party leadership bid.
Meili raised the issue again during Question Period on May 30. Moe confirmed that Koch had been paid $38,000 since her paid leave which began on April 6. However, that pay will be part of her eventual severance package.
READ MORE: Scott Moe new Saskatchewan Party leader, premier-designate
Moe confirmed that cabinet signed an order in council the morning of May 30 to officially end Koch's employment with the province on June 1.
“These discussions have been ongoing throughout the time that we have been in sessions here and going through our transition. As I said, the time that she has – from April 6 to June 1 where that's paid will be part of the severance,” Moe said.
The premier added that the timing of this order being signed has nothing to do with Meili's line of questioning the day prior.
“Again, a real red flag for us was the idea that someone was on a paid leave and that up until us pursuing that, didn't seem to have a definite end point,” Meili said.
Once a severance package has been established, Meili said the opposition will watch it closely to ensure it matches the formula established for these kinds of payments.

Moe said discussions with Koch have been amicable. These discussions did include the possibility of a different position in government, but ultimately severance was decided.
Koch lost the Saskatchewan Party leadership campaign to Moe on the fifth and final ballot at the party's January 27 leadership convention.
Between the convention and April 6, Moe said Koch had been using accumulated vacation days to account for the gap in the end of her unpaid leave and start of her paid leave.
Koch became the first female deputy minister to the premier in July, 2016. Prior to that, she had a nine year term as deputy agriculture minister. She also worked in the Grant Devine government.
Kent Campbell has served as interim deputy minister to the premier since Moe took office.
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The European Union's overall system of clearing houses for securities remained resilient for extreme, simulated market shocks, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Friday.
The results of the second EU-wide stress test showed the system could cope with several users of clearing houses defaulting at the same time coupled with extreme market shocks, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a statement.
On an individual basis, Spain's BME Clearing showed a minor shortfall of required pre-funded resources under one aspect of the test, ESMA said.
ICE Clear Europe's pre-funded resources would be enough, but these would only marginally cover the simulated stress losses, ESMA added.
Clearing houses are backed by pre-funded default funds and stand between two sides of a stock, bond or derivatives trade, ensuring its completion even if one side of the transaction goes bust. (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri)

AdvancED presented its accreditation review report to the Montgomery County Board of Education Wednesday afternoon, during which time it announced the system's accreditation status has been changed to "under review." (Source: WSFA 12 News)
AdvancED presented its accreditation review report to the Montgomery County Board of Education Wednesday afternoon, during which time it announced the system's accreditation status has been changed to "under review."
MPS is still accredited, but AdvancED said "we need to see progress." To be clear, the under review status is not the same as probation. However, Harrison said he learned in the last few days that AdvancED has made the decision to change its accreditation process by eliminating the probation status. He said under the new procedure, AdvancED will deem a system to either be fully accredited or accredited under review ahead of a monitoring review to check progress. Depending on the results of the monitoring review, a system will either receive full accreditation, remain accredited under review or lose accreditation, so accredited under review is the middle ground between being fully accredited and losing accreditation.
Montgomery Public Schools was rated in 31 areas on a scale ranging from needs improvement to exceeds expectations. The 31 performance standards fell into three categories: leadership capacity, learning capacity and resource capacity. MPS ranked 'needs improvement' in 19 areas, 'emerging' in 11 area and 'meets expectations' in just one area. MPS was not ranked 'exceeds expectations' in any area. The only standard where MPS ranked 'meets expectations' fell under learning capacity.
Harrison said a six-member team from AdvancED gathered this data from a number of interviews, reviewing board meeting footage, visiting MPS schools to observe students and requesting documents from the system. This is the full report, complete with all of the rankings and all of the clear directive improvements suggested by AdvancED.
Harrison on leadership improvements: MPS needs to work on board policies, conduct and communication as well as community-wide communication based on interviews with board members and review of recorded board meetings. — Morgan Young (@MorganYoungWSFA) May 30, 2018
A team from AdvancEd came to Montgomery for four days in late March to assess MPS for what's called a special review. Over the past two months, the team has been using the information it gathered to create a detailed report of deficiencies and suggested corrections that cover three areas: leadership capacity, resource capacity and learning capacity.
[MORE: Special Report: Does MPS run the risk of losing its accreditation?]
According to Alabama's State Director for AdvancED Dr. Andre Harrison, a team from the accrediting body will return in December for a monitoring review of how MPS has responded to the directives given. He said the system is looking for progress and that the system's accreditation status depends on it.

Orlando, Fla. — Tigers general manager Al Avila was asked Monday if he thought he would be able to work a trade for second baseman Ian Kinsler during the Winter Meetings, which commenced in earnest Monday.
“I think we will, yes,” he said.
Manager Ron Gardenhire, sitting to Avila's right, dropped his head and said, “You don't have to though.”
Well, as much as Gardenhire would love to go into his first season with the Tigers with Kinsler's Gold-Glove presence and veteran leadership in place, he knows that's not likely to happen.
“We talked to a few clubs when we got here and we've fielded a few calls last night and today,” Avila said. “But it's nothing that's moving anywhere right now.”
According to Avila, no new teams have entered the discussions. It's still the same four or five teams who have stayed in the loop for Kinsler — the Mets, Angels, Brewers and Blue Jays are believed to be among those teams.
“In our situation right now, it behooves us to do it,” Avila said. “It behooves us to move Kinsler — a veteran player for a prospect. It would give us a chance to play Dixon Machado on a more regular basis, for one thing.”
It would also trim $11 million off the payroll and add a presumably upper-level prospect to the system.
An indication that Avila thinks a deal could be done soon: He had assistant general manager David Chadd reach out to Kinsler's agent.
“David reached out to say that we've had conversations and something could happen,” Avila said. “But right now there is nothing to grasp onto.”
The second base market is a bit clogged, too, which could be impacting the timing of any deal. Starlin Castro, just traded to the Marlins from the Yankees, could be on the trade block, along with Josh Harrison, Cesar Hernandez, Brian Dozier and Jason Kipnis.
What about Fulmer?
Avila said he is not actively seeking trade partners for right-hander Michael Fulmer.
“It's not really our desire to trade him at this point,” he said. “It's just something where you explore all your avenues, just in case. We are not trying to trade him, but if there are teams that are interested, then, OK. But we're not trying to trade him.”
He said he has gotten a couple of calls asking about Fulmer, he called them “mild inquiries,” that weren't pursued.
“There are no offers on the table,” he said. “But we do know there are some teams that have a more desirable farm system who could make it happen if they were aggressive. But to be clear, we haven't come close to those kinds of conversations.”
Those types of conversations are more likely to occur before the trade deadline.
What about Castellanos?
Interesting. Before the end of last season, Avila made a pitch to right fielder Nick Castellanos' agent about signing him to a contract extension.
“Don't overplay that,” Avila said. “It's just that all options are open.”
Castellanos is still arbitration-eligible for two more years. Avila said the extension offer was for longer than those two years. They made a similar offer to J.D. Martinez before eventually signing him to a two-year deal prior to the 2016 season.
Martinez didn't take the longer extension and so far, Castellanos' camp hasn't jumped at it.
“Based on the fact we've had no conversation since the end of the year, the interest isn't really there,” Avila said.
Like with Fulmer, Avila will listen to trade offers on Castellanos, though none have come.
Avila did say, though, that Castellanos is slated to open the season as the club's starting right fielder.
“I talked to him before Thanksgiving,” Avila said. “He was starting to work on his outfield play and he asked if he should also take ground balls at third base. I said, ‘Absolutely. The more versatility you bring the better for you, and the better for the organization.' ”
Around the horn
The Tigers have cleared a spot on their 40-man roster to make room for the Rule 5 draft on Thursday. They have the first pick. Right-handed pitcher Victor Alcantara, who was acquired from the Angels for Cameron Maybin, cleared waivers and was outrighted to Triple-A Toledo.
… Avila said the Tigers scouts attended the showcase events for the Braves prospects who were declared free agents by the league. They came away with mixed reviews. “The workout they had, not all of them showed up and not all were ready to be showcased,” Avila said. “You had to go on past history and what happened last season, performance-wise.”

A Donald Trump supporter had every right to brandish a profane protest sign in a busy public park on a summer's day at Niagara Falls, Ontario's top court ruled on Monday.
In quashing a trespass notice issued to Fredrick Bracken, the Court of Appeal said the ability to protest publicly — even using vulgar language — is an essential part of the democratic process.
“In a free society, individuals are permitted to use open public spaces to address the people assembled there, to challenge each other, and to call government to account,” the Appeal Court said. “The idea that the parks are somehow different — that they are categorically a ‘safe space' where people are to be protected from exposure to political messages — is antithetical to a free and democratic society and would set a dangerous precedent.”
At the same time, the court upheld the constitutionality of a rule barring park users from abusive behaviour that could interfere with the enjoyment of other users. The provision, the court found, was a reasonable restriction on free speech.
The case arose in August 2016 in the run-up to the presidential election in the United States. Bracken, of Fort Erie, Ont., was in a park near the falls holding up a sign reading: “Trump is right. F—k China. F—k Mexico.”
Niagara Parks police decided the sign was offensive and disturbing visitors. Officers told Bracken he could not display the sign and told him to leave.
A couple of days later, Bracken went to the Parks police headquarters, where he was told that if he returned to the park with the sign, he would be removed under trespassing laws.
He turned to the courts, seeking a declaration that parks rules prohibiting “abusive or insulting language” that interferes with other park users was unconstitutional, and that the oral trespass notice police gave him had violated his free speech rights.
In September 2016, Superior Court Justice James Ramsay ruled that constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression does not apply to shouting insulting or abusive language in parks. However, Ramsay declined to rule on the validity of the oral trespass notice because he was not satisfied police had actually issued such a notice.
Bracken turned to the Court of Appeal, which decided Ramsay was mistaken to conclude that park rules did not infringe on free speech. The judge was also wrong in deciding police had not issued a trespass notice so there was nothing to quash, the Appeal Court found.
For their part, Niagara Parks police and Niagara Parks Commission tried to argue that the parks are intended to be a place of refuge where users can experience natural beauty without the distraction of potentially divisive expression. However, the higher court found the plaza where Bracken was protesting was a busy, partly commercial area where neither quiet nor an absence of distraction was possible.
At the same time, the court upheld the law itself on the grounds that it aims to prevent individuals and groups from using public spaces in a way that makes them unfit for others to use. When the line is crossed must be decided on a case-by-case basis and, the Appeal Court said, Bracken in no way went too far.
“The public is not required to endure personalized invective, but nothing in the sign's message could be characterized in this way,” the Appeal Court said. “The display of the sign, despite its profanity, did not constitute the use of insulting or abusive language.”
In November 2016, Niagara police arrested Bracken, then 39, during a similar protest at Brock University, according to the student paper Brock News. He was charged with assaulting a student and making offensive racial comments.

ISLAMABAD: A five-member larger bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa resumed hearing the Panama Leaks case, today. The hearing had been deferred for a short period due to Justice Azmat Saeed's health condition who is part of the Supreme Court bench hearing the Panama Leaks case.
Salman Akram Raja, the counsel for Sharif family, continued with the arguments during the proceedings, today. He said that the case had three aspects; the Prime Minister's speech, official records and steps taken by the Prime Minister.
He emphasised that after post-1999, when the Sharif family was in exile, it faced trauma and lost several official records. He stressed his point that, "It is not possible to present 45-year-old record."
He said that there was no admissible charge against the Prime Minister and ensuing action against his children was not possible. He suggested that the issue could be sent to agencies for investigation.
During the previous hearing on January 31, Hassan and Hussain Nawaz's counsel were inquired regarding the London flats. Who owned the properties from 1993 to 1996? Where did the investment for the London flats come from? How did the Sharif family children maintain residence at the property ?
Answering questions over money trail for the London flats, he argued that his client Hussain Nawaz had purchased them through money obtained from his grandfather's business. Salman Akram Raja added that the plaintiff had accused the Prime Minister of acquiring the flat through illegal money.
He said that the Sharif family did not own the London flats in 1999. Between 1993 and 1996 they were owned by the Al-Thani family, and in January 2006 they were transferred to Hussain Nawaz. In July the certificates were transferred to the Minerva firm.
Referring to an investigation report by former interior minister Rehman Malik over the flats, he said, that it was conducted in his personal capacity while he had been suspended from his office. "Rehman Malik had sent a copy of the report to the President and revealed it to media. But the report has no legal standing," he said, adding that it had earlier been rejected by the Lahore High Court.
The hearing has been adjourned till February 16 (Thursday).
ISLAMABAD - Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif has said that his meeting with Secretary Tillerson was an important interaction after President Trump announced US South Asia strategy on August 21.
At his interaction with US and foreign media at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington late Thursday night, he told the media that after the announcement of this South Asia strategy, the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and the US has taken a new turn.
"If on one hand the US has its concerns about the future of Afghanistan, Pakistan seeks recognition of its legitimate security concerns in the region. We are genuinely concerned with regard to the role accorded in the strategy to India in general and its efforts, geared to destabilisation in Balochistan, in particular."
He informed that he was visiting Washington DC at the invitation of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with whom he had a most cordial and useful meeting. "My visit is essentially in follow-up to Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's meeting with Vice President Mike Pence on the sidelines of UNGA on September 19, 2017."
Pakistan greatly values its relationship with the US in seven-decade long history of result-oriented cooperation, he said in his opening remarks. "We want to build a relationship founded on mutual respect. We firmly believe that through consistent, structured and constructive engagement, at political and diplomatic levels, both the countries can continue to work together for the common goal of peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia."
"We also see enormous investment and business opportunities in Pakistan for corporate America, particularly after Pakistan's remarkable successes in war against terror and significant reduction in terrorist incidents in the country, he said.
However, he added, "Pakistan believes that unless there is stability in Afghanistan, the dividends of peace in the region would continue to elude us." To achieve that goal both the US and Pakistan need to work closely, he stressed.
"On our part, we have completely wiped out all the hideouts used by terrorists and anti-state elements. However, this is an ongoing process with continuing intelligence-based operations by law enforcement agencies across the country," he added.
"We have offered candid cooperation to Afghanistan during the recent visit of the army chief and the foreign secretary to Kabul where they had successful and productive meetings with President Ashraf Ghani, the CEO Abdullah and others in the Afghan hierarchy," he said.
Pakistan is extremely concerned about safe havens of terrorists who are mostly operating from ungoverned spaces in Afghanistan which are more than 40 percent of the total area of the country, he added.
Substantiating his plea, he said a number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan in recent months have been traced back to these elements operating from these bases in Afghanistan.
"I would like to reiterate that Pakistan will continue to play its positive role in bringing peace to the region through measures agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders. We believe that a political approach characterised by an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process will yield durable peace in the interest of Afghanistan and the broader region."
He said, "In our renewed efforts towards establishing regional peace, we hope that the international media, particularly the US media will play a positive role and reflect Pakistan's changing realities in its reporting."
He also invited the media luminaries gathered there to visit Pakistan with a view to acquiring a first-hand experience of the fast changing reality in the country.
Asif meets US NSA HR McMaster
The Pakistani foreign minister also met US Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Lt General McMaster at the White House.
According to a message received here Friday from Washington DC, the two leaders discussed the bilateral relationship as well as ways in which the two countries could promote mutually beneficial cooperation.
They also discussed regional situation particularly Afghanistan. The Foreign Minister briefed NSA about Pakistan's perspective on the US strategy.
Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif stressed the importance that Pakistan attaches to peace in Afghanistan and emphasized the need to work together for regional peace and stability.

The ABC comic book series Marvel's Inhumans explores the Royal Family of the Inhumans, led by enigmatic king Black Bolt (Anson Mount) and his wife Medusa (Serinda Swan), who have to escape to Hawaii after a military coup in their home of Attilan. Once they are in the world surrounded by humanity, they must find a way to reunite with each other and return to their home before their way of life is destroyed forever.
During this 1-on-1 interview with Collider, actress Ellen Woglom (who plays Louise, one of the show's human characters) talked about how she ended up part of the Marvel universe, the secretive audition process, developing an original character for the series, why she didn't read any of the comics, what Louise thinks of the Inhumans, which superpower both she and her character think is the coolest, how being a part of a Marvel TV series is different from other TV series, and working with all of the effects.
Collider: How did you come to Marvel's Inhumans and end up a part of this whole crazy world?
ELLEN WOGLOM: I'm still trying to figure that out! I auditioned, like I do for any other job that I hope to get. When I originally got the material, you don't know what you're auditioning for. Even the names are changed in the sides, or sometimes they'll give you mock sides that aren't from the script. You have no backstory for the characters, so you don't even know what you're supposed to go in there and play. I knew it was Marvel, but other than that, I knew nothing. There was no character breakdown, so you just try to make a choice. I went in and had the audition, and then I went back to test. During the test process, instead of just doing the audition, Jeph Loeb asked me to talk about myself, where I'm from and what my passions are, just to give them an idea of who you are, which I thought was a really smart thing to do. Then, I got a call from Jeph and he said, “Welcome to the Marvel universe!,” and here I am. And I was like, “Tell me who I'm playing!” I don't think I got an actual script until a couple days before we started shooting. It's all so secretive.
Do you have a sense of who Louise is, or do you feel like you're still figuring that out?
WOGLOM: Both. Because she's an original character, I think that I was able to have more leeway and decide who I want her to be, to some degree, to create this person. After doing eight episodes, I feel like I have a good idea about her. Having her be in different situations, you get an idea, but there's still a lot, if we get a Season 2, that I feel like I can figure out and develop more. With the first two episodes, I was like, “I don't know who I am yet,” but by Episode 8, I had a better idea.
Is it extra fun to get to play a character that's unique to the series and who's not in the comics, or were you disappointed that you couldn't turn to the comics for her?
WOGLOM: When I first called him to tell him, my dad was like, “You're not a superhero?!” I was like, “Thanks, dad!” There's less pressure on me because I'm not someone from the comics. The fans don't have an expectation or a standard that they're holding me to, so hopefully, they won't pick me apart. But obviously, it would be awesome to have superpowers, too. Everyone wants to be a superhero!
Did you still read the comics, even though your character isn't in them, or did you primarily just focus on the scripts?
WOGLOM: I focused more on the scripts, themselves. It's not that they discouraged us from reading the comics, but the scripts and the series don't follow the comics. They're creating their own narrative and world, so I didn't read any of the comics. My brother is really into comics and the whole Marvel world, so he put together this whole thing and sent it to me. He's really into it. It's probably the one job that he's the most excited about. Any other job I've had, he's like, “Yeah, cool!,” but this one, he's pretty excited about.
Is your brother the one in your family that's the most excited about you being a part of this show?
WOGLOM: It's his world. My parents are just happy that I have a job and I'm employed. No, they're really proud. Everyone is happy.
What can you say about who Louise is and the journey that she'll be taking?
WOGLOM: Louise is incredibly focused, driven and bright. She works for an aerospace company and has been obsessed with all things space, for her entire life. Her dad was in the world too, so it's a long lineage. That ties into the Inhumans, with the moon and all of that. On Earth, I'm the eyes and ears for the audience. Creating an original character who's a human, and having a human as a way to ground the show, is an in for the audience to be able to discover this whole world and find out about it. As Louise is finding out about it, so is the audience. Her social skills are a little bit lacking, which lends itself to comedy. There's a levity with her. Because she's a little bit socially awkward and unaware, it lends itself to some funny moments, especially between her and Medusa.
The Inhumans figure that the humans won't notice a hoof, but Louise is clearly very smart, observant and sharp.
It is the day that so many have been waiting for and it is the time for Nick Viall's quest for love to officially begin. The 2017 season premiere of The Bachelor airs tonight on ABC and it will begin with Nick having to choose from 30 different women hoping to win his heart. While it will be a rather common and expected first episode, there will be a lot of women who won't even get the chance to enjoy a second cocktail party or more than one night on the show. Please let it be known that there are possible spoilers ahead for the new and upcoming season of The Bachelor starring Nick Viall. If you don't want to know them, stop reading now. This is a big day for so many fans of The Bachelor franchise as the new season is ready to begin and it is one of the most fun nights each year.

All of the women will be introduced to the world, there will be some background on Viall, and then the cocktail party will begin as they calculate their rose chances. Chris Harrison will make his announcements and assessments as the night goes on, and there will even be a few stolen and willfully given kisses. Rachel Lindsay is one of those who ends up receiving some kisses from the new lead on The Bachelor, and she also receives the “First Impression” rose to boot. After our leading man meets all of the women and has very little time to know exactly who the leading guyu wants to keep around or send home, it becomes time for the first rose ceremony of 2017. At the end of it all, there will be a shocking eight women sent home without a rose and they are: Olivia Burnette Susannah Milan Ida Marie Jasmine Brown Angela Amezcua Lauren Hussey Michelle Ramkissoon Briana Guertler So, as confirmed by Reality Steve, that will leave 22 women heading to the second episode of The Bachelor, and chasing Viall's love. These women will get a rose and move on. He listed them in alphabetical order for easy reference: Alexis Waters Astrid Loch Brittany Farrar Christen Whitney Corinne Olympios Danielle Lombard Danielle Maltby Dominique Alexis Elizabeth Whitelaw Hailey Merkt Jaimi King Jasmine Goode Josephine Tutman Kristina Schulman Lacey Mark Liz Sandoz Rachel Lindsay Raven Gates Sarah Vendal Taylor Nolan Vanessa Grimaldi Whitney Fransway On Sunday night, ABC aired the “Countdown to Nick” special which allowed some of the women to have their introduction videos shown and to get fans excited for tonight. There wasn't much revealed, but it did build-up the anticipation for the new bachelor, the women, and the first eliminations of 2017. YESSSSS!!! So far 2017 is my favorite year ever! Thank you @BachelorABC for making my dreams come true. #wyatr pic.twitter.com/jdOuH7N4BB — Arden Myrin (@ArdenMyrin) January 2, 2017 The season premiere of The Bachelor for Viall's season will take place on ABC at 8 p.m. ET on Monday, January 2, 2017. Stay tuned all the next few months as he is going to find the love or “loves” of his life in 2017 as reported by People. Keep your eyes peeled for some interesting things happening on tonight's episode of The Bachelor as the drama is already building. Not only will there will be multiple makeout sessions and eliminations, but there will also be a villain introduced and a shark. Yes, a shark. Yes, Nick Viall is hoping to finally end up with a love of his very own, but there is a long path to take toward his heart being won. 30 women start out on tonight's The Bachelor, but there are eight of them who simply aren't going to make it past the first cut. Someone always has to go home and tonight, it will be a lot of them who aren't given a rose. At the end of the first rose ceremony elimination of the season, Viall will say goodbye to some who never even had a chance. [Featured Image by ABC Television Network]

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  A bright light with a glowing tail spotted in the San Francisco Bay Area sky Tuesday was a Navy missile test that had been in the works for years.
U.S. Navy spokesman John Daniels told the East Bay Times (http://bayareane.ws/2kGPsoA ) that a submarine off the coast of California launched a Trident II D-5 missile at 3:30 a.m. and another at 6:20 a.m.
Daniels said the routine test was "not in response to any ongoing world activities" and that tests are conducted for training and maintenance of the missile system. He said the missiles fly over water, and not over inhabited areas.
The Trident II is a three-stage missile with a 4,000-mile range. Daniels said residents likely saw stage one, which lasts about a minute, and possibly part of stage two.

RAWALPINDI, Feb 15 (APP): Three Khasadars and two civilians
embraced Shahadat when a suicide bomber, out of two, blew himself
up, after being spotted and challenged by the personnel at the
office gate of Political Agent in Mohmand Agency on Wednesday.
“Three Khasadars and two civilians embraced Shahadat when
a suicider blew himself up when challenged by sentry while other
suicider was shot by the security forces in Mohmand agency,”
according to an ISPR press release.
The security agencies had the intelligence about intrusion of suicide bombers from Afghanistan into the Mohmand Agency.
Following the incident, the security agencies were carrying out a combing operation in the area.

The power station will generate 4.2 megawatts electricity which will be provided to seventy villages of Chitral district.–APP
The Baltimore Ravens have used the franchise tag once in the previous four offseasons. The expectation is that trend will continue for the near future.
It's considered unlikely that the Ravens will place the tag on anyone this offseason and it's extremely doubtful that Baltimore will do so in 2018.
The first day to designate franchise players this offseason is Wednesday, and it would be a hefty price to place a tag on one of the Ravens' top three unrestricted free agents. It would require a one-year tender of at least $12 million to put the tag on nose tackle Brandon Williams, offensive tackle Rick Wagner or fullback Kyle Juszczyk.
The most viable candidate is Williams, one of the top interior defensive linemen in the league. But the one-year investment of $13 million would become the second-biggest cap figure on the team in 2017 behind quarterback Joe Flacco. That's very expensive for a defensive tackle.
There are fewer prospects for the tag in 2018. As of right now, Baltimore's scheduled free agents after the upcoming season are wide receiver Mike Wallace, linebacker Elvis Dumervil, safety Lardarius Webb, tight ends Ben Watson and Crockett Gillmore and defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan.
Wallace, Dumervil, Webb and Watson all could be salary-cap cuts this offseason. Even if they remain with the Ravens this season, the team wouldn't pay a premium price to keep any of them beyond 2017.
As for those with rookie contracts expiring, Jernigan has been too inconsistent and Gillmore has struggled to stay healthy. Neither should be in the conversation for a franchise tag next offseason.
The Ravens have used the franchise tag eight times in their 21-year existence: offensive lineman Wally Williams (1998), cornerback Chris McAlister (2003-04), linebacker Terrell Suggs (2008-09), defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (2011), running back Ray Rice (2012) and kicker Justin Tucker (2016).
In all but one situation -- Williams in 1998 -- every player who received the tag by the Ravens eventually signed a long-term deal with them and became among the highest-paid players at his position.
Attorney Jeff Sessions reportedly opted against recusing himself from the investigation into President Donald Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen.
It's a shift from his move to recuse himself from the Russia probe.
Both investigations appear to be in connection to the 2016 presidential campaign, which he offered a blanket recusal from.
Some experts said he made the right call here.
The latest major development out of the ongoing criminal investigation involving President Donald Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen is Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly deciding against recusing himself from overseeing the proceedings.
Sessions, of course, earned the ire of Trump for more than a year for recusing himself from the investigation into Russian election interference, which in turn led to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointing special counsel Robert Mueller after Trump fired James Comey, the FBI director at the time.
Sessions's original recusal covered all matters related to the 2016 presidential campaign, where he was a top surrogate and supporter of the president.
Bloomberg first reported that Sessions would not recuse himself from all involvement in the case, though he will consider not handling specific elements of it. Experts noted that this seems to indicate that Mueller has faith in Sessions to do his job at the Department of Justice — and Sessions could avoid further poisoning his relationship with Trump, who has railed against his attorney general for recusing himself from the Russia probe.
Of note, the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, did recuse himself from the investigation, which is being handled by his office and is now under the purview of his deputy, Robert Khuzami. Berman was personally interviewed for the interim US attorney role by Trump, which experts characterized as odd at the time.

Without a recusal, Sessions now maintains the ability to be briefed on the status of the case and could partake in decisions related to it.
Trump has publicly blasted the Cohen probe, which exploded onto the scene after the FBI raided Cohen's home, hotel room, and office earlier this month. Rosenstein was a part of the approval process for the raid, which began after a referral was sent from Mueller's team to the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. Investigators are exploring whether Cohen violated campaign finance laws or committed bank fraud, as has been previously reported.
Cohen has handled sensitive matters related to Trump, including paying the adult-film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election to ensure her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. Since the raid, the White House has sought to distance Trump from Cohen.
Cohen has not been charged with a crime.
Sessions made 'the right decision'
Alan Dershowitz, the prestigious Harvard University law professor whose commentary on Trump's legal proceedings has been met with appreciation from the president, told Business Insider that Sessions's choice not to recuse himself was "the right decision."
"It means that Rosenstein is largely out of supervising [the SDNY] case," he said in an email.
One expert told Business Insider that Sessions's decision not to recuse himself further goes to show that Mueller has faith in the Department of Justice (DOJ) to handle the investigation properly. Knowing that Sessions could well oversee the case, Mueller, who has been under threat of firing by the president, made the determination that his involvement would not prevent law enforcement from fairly carrying out the investigation.
"So, the bottom line is, it felt like it was important for him to spread that work out as a hedge against [Mueller's] firing," Jed Shugerman, a Fordham University law professor, told Business Insider. "But it also indicated a certain degree of trust in the leadership of the DOJ to manage the case. If he really didn't trust Rosenstein and Sessions, that probably would've cut against him making that move."
Shugerman mentioned the recent report that Sessions had told Trump he would resign if the president ousted Rosenstein as evidence that Sessions was someone who could be entrusted to defend the rule of law.
"I'm not a huge fan of Sessions, but it suggests to me that Sessions is not doing Trump's bidding but is trying to do his job," he said. "Mueller has some faith that the DOJ would manage this appropriately, and that included Sessions."

Sessions knew another recusal could further put his job in jeopardy, another expert said.
Mitchell Epner, a former assistant US attorney for the District of New Jersey who is now an attorney at Rottenberg Lipman Rich, told Business Insider in an email that another recusal would have "further enflamed" Trump and may "have even led to" Sessions's ouster.
A key area Sessions could involve himself in is the indictment process, Epner said. He noted that the US attorney's manual instructs US attorneys to seek approval from the DOJ when seeking an indictment in a highly sensitive case. Cohen's case may constitute such an instant, and although that determination is typically made by the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, Sessions may choose to get involved since he is not recused.
Sessions also has the ability to request updates from Khuzami and the SDNY team.
"In turn, he could be asked to provide updates to POTUS," Epner said. "Providing updates to POTUS would be highly unusual, and highly troubling given the fact that POTUS is potentially a subject of the SDNY grand jury investigation."
Andrew Wright, a Savannah Law School professor who served as associate counsel to former President Barack Obama and assistant counsel to former Vice President Al Gore, told Business Insider that if 2016 campaign finance violations really are a part of the Cohen prove, then Sessions would be violating the recusal he made early in 2017, which covered anything related to the 2016 presidential campaign.
"It may be that Sessions is factually removed enough from the Cohen allegations — unlike he Russia investigation or Clinton email investigation — that his recusal is not required by law," Wright said in an email. "Most important, though: Is Jeff Sessions going to act as the nation's chief law enforcement officer or a Trump crony defender? He has an obligation to support the [Justice Department's] mission, the Constitution, and the rule of law, not to run political interference for the president."

Municipalities are concerned with fatberg – caused by dumping fats, oils and grease that clog your pipes.
As many sit down this weekend for the Thanksgiving feast, they may not realize they are contributing to a costly problem.
The average 14 pound turkey produced about 250 millilitres or 1 cup of fat.
Image that multiplied by thousands of homes in this community alone and it can create a problem down the line.
Many municipalities are encouraging people to not pour fats, oils and grease (or FOG) down the drains. They mix with other items such as wipes and dental floss to create what's called a fatberg.
As soon as the FOGs go a short distance, they start to harden and end up clogging the sewage system.
Metro Vancouver spends about $2 million to repair the damage caused by these products and homeowners can also face costly bills when their pipes get blocked. That's why it created the Wipe It, Green Bin It campaigns to educate residents, but these tips can be used in homes throughout British Columbia.
Disposal:
• For small amounts of grease, wipe or scrape out the pot or pan and put the grease into your green bin.
• Larger amounts of grease, like deep fryer oil, can be dropped off at an approved recycling depot.
Kitchen cloggers:
• Fats – dairy produts, salad dressings, margarine, butter, shortening.
• Oils – cooking oils such as olive, canola, vegetable, corn, peanut, coconut) as well as oil-based sauces.
• Grease – pan drippings, trimmings from meat, lard.

More and more doctors are writing social prescriptions, such as hiking in a park, to encourage their patients to get out and exercise. RUSS CARMACK THE NEWS TRIBUNE (Tacoma, Wash.) file
JUPITER, Fla. -- Beards are back for the Miami Marlins.
Manager Don Mattingly said he and owner Jeffrey Loria decided lift their prohibition on facial hair after one season.
"It was a constant fight last year, honestly, with guys," said Mattingly, speaking Tuesday before the first spring training workout for pitchers and catchers. "Through the course of the season and watching the playoffs and the World Series, for me it just didn't seem like that big of a thing. The most important thing is our guys prepare and play the game right."

The Marlins will continue to require players be well-groomed. The ban was adopted after Mattingly was hired as manager before the 2016 season.
"A little bit last year for me was being in a new situation and wanting to make sure the team was put first, and it wasn't going to be about personal things," he said.
A handful of players took advantage of the new policy, including All-Star closer A.J. Ramos and starting pitchers Edinson Volquez and Dan Straily.
Ramos acknowledged players complained last year about the ban.
"Now you feel like you're not so under control," he said. "You can fend for yourself. You can do what you want, and we can stop hearing the crying."
Among those still without a beard is outfielder Christian Yelich.
"I can't grow one, bro," Yelich said. "It doesn't affect me."
Last year's beard ban was new for Mattingly. The Dodgers allowed facial hair when he was their manager for five seasons, and he wore a mustache when he was an All-Star first baseman for the Yankees.
It is the most influential elected position at Queen's Park still up for grabs, and comes with a spacious apartment and immortality in the form of an official portrait on the first floor of the legislature. The next speaker of the Legislative Assembly will be chosen by 124 MPPs using a secret ballot next Wednesday.

Five Progressive Conservative MPPs have so far expressed interest in the key post that includes a $152,914 salary, a $36,364 boost in members' base pay. Burlington MPP Jane McKenna, elected on June 7 and returning to Queen's Park following a four-year hiatus after losing in the 2014 election, hopes to shatter a glass ceiling in Ontario politics. McKenna wants to make history by being the first woman to hold the post of speaker.

“As a mother of five, I decided to run for MPP in Burlington because I wanted to make a difference. As an MPP, we have the opportunity to make a positive difference in the lives of Ontarians,” she said in a letter to other members. “In the months ahead, we will consider and debate many challenging issues that will have life-changing implications for the people we represent. Throughout these debates, I believe that we all have a role toplay to ensure order and decorum in the House.” MPP Randy Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston), who has crusaded for backbenchers to have more of a role at Queen's Park since his election in 2007, said he would like to improve transparency in the Legislature. “I look forward to having the opportunity to ensure the richness of our representative democracy by acting as a vigilant safeguard of this cherished institution,” said Hillier, who has stood up to his own party's leadership in the past. “My motivations to seek the speaker's chair are rooted in my desire to see an elevation of the standard of discourse both in the legislature and our wider society,” he wrote in a pitch to MPPs.
MPP Ted Arnott (Wellington-Halton Hills), a 28-year veteran, said that as a former deputy speaker, government member, opposition member, and third-party member, he has “seen it from all sides.” “I have sought to be fair and impartial, and demonstrate appropriate respect for all members while seeking to maintain decorum in the chamber,” Arnott said in a letter to MPPs.

“Many MPPs from all sides of the House have encouraged me to consider seeking the speaker's position,” he wrote. MPP Rick Nicholls (Chatham-Kent-Leamington), who was first elected in 2011, notes his experience as a deputy speaker and as a sports referee would help him moderate legislative debates. “I know what it means to enforce the rules of debate impartiality, to avoid favouritism, to censure respectfully, and to allow the procedures of the House to run smoothly,” Nicholls said in a written appeal to his colleagues. “I have a strong sense of fair play developed over many years as an official in provincial basketball, hockey and baseball (both fastball and slo-pitch),” he added. Also reportedly considering a run for the speaker's post is MPP Bill Walker (Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound), although he has yet to formally declare his intentions. If there are five candidates, it will likely take several ballots to determine the successor to former speaker Dave Levac, who did not seek re-election in the June 7 campaign. The plum position includes a large apartment on the third floor of the Ontario Legislature. There are 76 Tories, 40 New Democrats, seven Liberals and one Green eligible to vote.

THEY'RE all over; buses, trains, cabs, and now, an all woman police station in Mumbai! Ladies Specials they're called! Buses, on which only ladies can board, so also trains, designated cabs and a police station with only women police personal! And each time we create a new ‘special', we men smile, look at each other with pride, and think we've done something special for our women!
What we're actually doing is putting them in cages. “We are caging you to protect you!” “We are taking away your mobile phones to keep you pure!” “We aren't sending you to school, to safeguard you!”
A few years ago, my daughter became an anchor for a TV channel, a much sought after post. “Dad!” she asked, “Any words of advice?” “Yes!” I told her, “Be a man in a man's world!” “A man?” she'd asked, “Why?”
“Because to compete,” I'd said looking into her eager eyes, “Don't get pushed into a lady special where you are expected to shed tears when upset, scream when angry, show vulnerability when you want something! Be tough just like the men around you and compete on an even keel!”
She did. I hear about Love Jihad groups roaming the country, out to protect women from one faith against so-called wily men of another! Do they really think their women so stupid, they would fall in love so easily? Or, are they actually unsure of themselves and insecure about keeping and holding their woman's love? So, what do they do? Put them in a Ladies Special with barbed wired windows!
Ssshhh! I hear the sound of a Ladies Special coming and see a few heads looking out at me, saying, “Stop congratulating us for being the secret behind a successful man, instead start saluting us for being successful ourselves!” ‘Stop telling us we look beautiful! Start telling us it's our inner beauty you admire!”
“Stop praising us for our stereotype roles in your films as mother, wife, daughter, daughter-in-law, sister, instead celebrate us as individuals, independent of relationships!' I look inside the Ladies Special and someone inside looks me in the eye and says, “Stop looking at me from a convenient male viewpoint. Let me be imperfect, whimsical, irresponsible, lazy, fierce, opinionated, loud, flabby, ungroomed, adventurous, unpredictable, unprepared and impractical like you Bob, are happy at being!”
There are others around me, and suddenly someone unlocks the cage and asks the ladies to come out. I hear the sound of drums, of music, and as the ladies stream out on the roads and on the platforms, men and the once caged women dance in happy abandon together, the men, respectful in their behavior and women confident in handling anything untoward. And then together they tow the Ladies Special coach into the backyard of Indian history..!

SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of – North Korea said Tuesday that leader Kim Jong-un was briefed on his military's plans to launch missiles into waters near Guam as part of an effort to create “enveloping fire” near the U.S. military hub in the Pacific.
The comments, while typically belligerent, are significant because they appeared to signal a path to defuse a deepening crisis with Washington over a weapons program that is seen as having the ability to be able to send a nuclear missile to the U.S. mainland.
During an inspection of the army's Strategic Forces, Kim praised the military for drawing up a “close and careful plan” and said he would watch the “foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees” a little more before deciding whether to give an order for the missile test, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
READ MORE: Jim Mattis warns if North Korea fires at U.S. it could ‘escalate into war'
Kim said North Korea will conduct the planned missile launches if the “Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity” and that the United States should “think reasonably and judge property” to avoid shame, the news agency said.
WATCH: ‘Let me hear Kim Jong-un say it – he hasn't been saying much', Trump says on threat from North Korea
Lobbing missiles toward Guam would be a deeply provocative act from the U.S. perspective. U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said the United Sates would take out any such missile seen to be heading for American soil and declared any such North Korean attack could lead to war.
Kim's comments, however, with their conditional tone, seemed to hold out the possibility that friction could ease if the United States made some sort of gesture that Pyongyang considered a move to back away from previous “extremely dangerous reckless actions.” The United States and South Korea plan next week, however, to start annual defensive military drills that the North claims are preparation for invasion.
On Monday, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford held a series of meetings with senior South Korean military and political officials and the local media. He also made comments that appeared to be an attempt to ease anxiety over tit-for-tat threats between President Donald Trump and North Korea while also showing a willingness to back up Trump's warnings if need be.
Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States wants to peacefully resolve tensions with North Korea. But Washington is also ready to use the “full range” of its military capabilities in case of provocation, Dunford said.

Dunford is visiting South Korea, Japan and China after a week in which Trump declared the U.S. military “locked and loaded” and said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.
The Korean People's Army's Strategic Forces said last week that it would finalize by mid-August a plan to fire four intermediate ballistic missiles near Guam, which is about 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles) from Pyongyang, and send it to Kim for his approval.
WATCH: China's President is calling for restraint between U.S., North Korea
The North Korean plans to fire near Guam are based on the Hwasong-12, a new intermediate range missile the country successfully flight-tested for the first time in May. The liquid-fuel missile is designed to be fired from road mobile launchers and has been previously described by North Korea as built for attacking Alaska and Hawaii.
The North followed the May launch with two flight tests of its Hwasong-14 ICBM last month. Analysts said that a wide swath of the continental United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, could be within reach of those missiles, once perfected.

The latest Korea Central News Agency report said Kim ordered his military to be prepared to launch the missiles toward Guam at any time. If the “planned fire of power demonstration” is carried out because of U.S. recklessness, Kim said it will be “the most delightful historic moment when the Hwasong artillerymen will wring the windpipes of the Yankees and point daggers at their necks,” the news agency reported.
North Korea is angry about new United Nations sanctions over its expanding nuclear weapons and missile program and annual military drills between Washington and Seoul beginning later this month that Pyongyang condemns as invasion rehearsals.
Kim said that the United States must “make a proper option first and show it through action, as it committed provocations after introducing huge nuclear strategic equipment into the vicinity of the peninsula” and that it “should stop at once arrogant provocations” against North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency said.
Trump has declared the U.S. military “locked and loaded” and said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.
South Korean President Moon on Monday called for a peaceful solution to the nuclear standoff, saying that “there must not be another war on the Korean Peninsula,” according to his office.
In a meeting with top aides at the presidential Blue House, Moon said South Korea would work to safeguard peace on the peninsula in co-operation with the United States and other countries. Moon said North Korea must stop issuing menacing statements and provocations.
Toronto police say a 19-year-old man has been charged after several women were allegedly sexually assaulted and robbed on a street in the east end on Saturday evening.
Police said they responded to a call just before 7 p.m. on Saturday at Victoria Park and Danforth Avenues.
Investigators say a suspect approached multiple women as they were walking down the sidewalk, sexually assaulted them and in some cases stole their personal belongings.

BALTIMORE (AP)  An unusual smell prompted an evacuation and a hazardous materials response at a Baltimore high school. But after five people were taken to the hospital complaining of upset stomachs, fire officials discovered the source of the smell: a pumpkin spice air freshener.
Cristo Rey Jesuit High School was evacuated Thursday afternoon after students and teachers detected a strong smell on the third floor. Several people reported difficulty breathing.
The fire department and a hazardous materials team were called. Fire spokesman Roman Clark said two students and three adults were taken to the hospital for stomach ailments.
Then, firefighters located a pumpkin spice air aerosol plugged into an outlet in a classroom.

Less than two weeks away from the University of Hawaii football team's kickoff to the season at UMass, the Rainbow Warriors revealed new helmets for 2017.
The ‘Bows debuted the matte green helmets during a team meeting Sunday night with members of the Na Koa Football Club in attendance.
The helmet, which is a shade of green similar to the team's home jersey, has a black face-mask and the traditional tapa print helmet stripe that UH has donned since 2000 when the tapa-trimmed H logo was introduced.
In April the Na Koa Booster Club announced that a fundraiser was being held to fund new helmets for the team for the upcoming season. At $450.00 a helmet fans could sponsor their favorite position (O-Line, D-Line,running back, quarterback, etc) or “side of the ball” (offense, defense, special teams). A player would then be randomly chosen from that classification and a sticker with the sponsors name on it would be placed in the helmet for the season.
Check out the new #HawaiiFB helmets for 2017, debuted tonight for the Rainbow Warriors and @NaKoaFootball!#LiveAlohaPlayWarrior pic.twitter.com/PWDhtp44db — Hawaii Football (@HawaiiFootball) August 14, 2017
The matte green helmet is the fourth different primary helmet option for UH since 2000, not counting retro or military nights.
From 2000 to 2015, UH used metalic green as the color of their primary helmets, with a silver version available from 2005 to 2007.
In 2016, Rolo's first season as head coach, the team wore white helmets exclusively.
Andrea Horwath‘s surging support in the latest polls is bringing scrutiny to her New Democrats‘ election promises, including a pledge to re-nationalize Hydro One, the province's giant utility partially privatized by the governing Liberals to raise money for infrastructure projects.
The Ontario NDP leader has said the move would help cut electricity bills, which have more than doubled in the past decade.
READ MORE: Kathleen Wynne positions herself as seasoned leader amid U.S. tariff threat
But some experts say moving the utility into the public sector's hands could be costly and it wouldn't automatically reduce electricity rates by a significant amount.
“This seems more like a knee-jerk reaction to something that a lot of people didn't like when it happened,” said Warren Mabee, director of the Queen's University Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy.
The benefit of regaining complete ownership of Hydro One is not as simple as putting the privatization genie back in the bottle, he said.
Under Horwath's plan, an NDP government would buy back 313 million publicly traded shares of Hydro One not held by the government for between $3.3 billion and $4.4 billion using the annual dividend of less than $300 million.
READ MORE: How big is Ontario's hydro problem? And can the Liberals, NDP or PCs fix it?
Experts say the party could be underestimating the real cost by several billions given the shares' current trading price of about $19.50 and a possible 30 per cent takeover premium shareholders would likely expect.
For decades, the utility formerly known as Ontario Hydro, was publicly owned until Conservative and Liberal governments took steps towards privatization.
READ MORE: COMMENTARY: An election powered by electricity
Returning to public ownership doesn't make sense amid a paradigm shift that has seen power generation become more local and consumers increasingly use rooftop solar and other means to generate more of their electricity needs, said Mabee.
“I think that trying to put back together those old big, basically government-controlled entities and expecting them to provide innovative new solutions when the landscape is changing so dramatically is probably not the right way forward,” he said.
“I'm not saying that they're wrong to do this but I don't understand their broader strategy and how this ultimately is going to deliver value back to the taxpayers above and beyond what we're already getting because we still own a chunk of it.”
Hydro One was partially privatized in November 2015, and by December 2017, the province had sold off 53 per cent of its stake.
READ MORE: Andrea Horwath unveils healthcare and hydro commitments during campaign stop in London
The government said the privatization would raise $9 billion to fund transit and infrastructure projects, but the decision was met with harsh criticism not only from the opposition parties, but also the province's financial watchdog, who said funding those projects through traditional debt would have saved the province $1.8 billion.
Faced with growing public anger, the Liberals offered province-wide rebates of 25 per cent on all electricity bills by extending the time to amortize the increases, which in the long run will end up costing more.
The Liberals, who polls suggest are stuck in third place — way behind the NDP and the Tories — have said Horwath's hydro plan would use over $6.5 billion in money earmarked for health care, education, and transit investments, being used to buy back shares of Hydro One.

University of Waterloo professor Jatin Nathwani described the NDP proposal as putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.
“To argue that somehow bringing it back under government control magically everything will be fine is an open question,” he said in an interview.
The Liberals made a number of poor decisions over the past decade but the $50 billion in investments made under its watch have refurbished a system in need of repair, Nathwani added.
READ MORE: Ontario election 2018: Ridings list
Partially privatizing Hydro One has generated lots of private capital required to upgrade the electrical system that the provincial economy relies upon, added Adam Fremeth, associate professor of business, economics and public policy at Western University.
There's a lot of managerial discipline that often comes from privately held, publicly traded corporations needing to respond to shareholders, he added. Customer service and reliability has improved with improper billing decreased since the utility was partially privatized, said Fremeth.
A smarter move by the NDP would be just buying another four per cent of shares to gain majority control, which would require the renegotiation of the shareholder agreement, said Nathwani.
“That's probably a cheaper way and the optics may be right to say we are in control and allow the company to be run on semi-private principles to attract capital.”
Delta Mayor Lois Jackson is heading to Ottawa in hopes of finding federal money to build a bridge to replace the George Massey Tunnel.
The former B.C. Liberal government started preparatory construction on the proposed $3.5-billion 10-lane bridge for the crossing, which is considered one of Metro Vancouver's worst traffic bottlenecks in 2016
READ MORE: B.C. government orders independent review of George Massey Tunnel replacement
The NDP government paused the project last September to conduct an independent technical review, arguing that “not all the options were thoroughly examined.”
Jackson said even with the project apparently on the back burner, she's not giving up.
“I really feel that the George Massey, with its 100,000 vehicles a day and everything that goes with that, impacts upon that national trade corridor, so if we're looking at the national economy, I think the feds should have a part in this,” she said.
“The feds own bridges in Ontario and Quebec… [they] should be interested in this perhaps even if others aren't.”
WATCH: New reports suggests bridge replacement for Massey Tunnel could cost less than initial estimates
READ MORE: City of Delta report says province could shave $1B from bridge to replace Massey Tunnel
Jackson is alone among the region's mayors in supporting a bridge to replace the aging tunnel. Richmond has been particularly outspoken about the project, arguing a large bridge will simply move the traffic bottleneck into its jurisdiction.
The NDP has previously suggested that twinning the tunnel could be a better option than the new bridge. But Jackson said she opposes that option for environmental reasons.
A report from the independent technical review is expected by spring 2018.
Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba in response to recent measures taken by the Trump administration following incidents involving U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana
On September 29, 2017, the US Secretary of State Rex Tillersonannounced the decision to significantly downscale the diplomatic staff of the US embassy in Havana and withdraw all their relatives, claiming that there had been “attacks” perpetrated against US Government officials in Cuba which have harmed their health.
Once again, on October 3, the US Government, in an unwarranted act, decided that 15 officials of the Cuban Embassy in Washington should depart from the United States, claiming that the US had reduced their diplomatic staffing levels in Havana and that the Cuban Government had failed to take all appropriate steps to prevent “attacks” against them.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests and condemns this unfounded and unacceptable decision as well as the pretext used to justify it, for it has been asserted that the Cuban Government did not take the appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of the alleged incidents.
In the meeting that, at the proposal of the Cuban side, was held with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, warned him against the adoption of hasty decisions that were not supported by evidence; urged him not to politicize a matter of this nature and once again required the effective cooperation from the US authorities to clarify facts and conclude the investigation.
It is the second time, after May 23, 2017, that the State Department orders two Cuban diplomats in Washington to abandon the country; that the US Government reacts in a hasty, inappropriate and unthinking way, without having evidence of the occurrence of the adduced facts, for which Cuba has no responsibility whatsoever and before the conclusion of the investigation that is still in progress.
Just as was expressed by the Cuban Foreign Minister to Secretary of State Tillerson on September 26, 2017, Cuba, whose diplomatic staff members have been victims in the past of attempts perpetrated against their lives, who have been murdered, disappeared, kidnapped or attacked during the performance of their duty, has seriously and strictly observed its obligations under the Geneva Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 referring to the protection and integrity of diplomatic agents accredited in the country, in which it has an impeccable record.
As was informed by the Ministry on August 9 last, since February 17, 2017, when the US embassy and State Department notified the alleged occurrence of incidents against some officials of that diplomatic mission and their relatives as from November 2016, arguing that these had caused them injuries and other disorders, the Cuban authorities have acted with utmost seriousness, professionalism and immediacy to clarify this situation and opened an exhaustive and priority investigation following instructions from the top level of the Government. The measures adopted to protect the US diplomatic staff, their relatives and residences were reinforced; new expeditious communication channels were established between the US embassy and the Diplomatic Security Department and a committee of experts was created to make a comprehensive analysis of facts, which was made up by law enforcement officials, physicians and scientists.
In the face of the belated, fragmented and insufficient information supplied by the US, the Cuban authorities requested further information and clarifications from the US embassy in order to carry out a serious and profound investigation.
The US embassy only delivered some data of interest on the alleged incidents after February 21, whenPresident Raúl Castro Ruz personally reiterated to the Chargé d'Affairs of the US diplomatic mission how important it was for the competent authorities from both countries to cooperate and exchange more information. Nevertheless, the data supplied later on continued to be lacking in the descriptions or details that would facilitate the characterization of facts or the identification of potential perpetrators, in case there were any.
In the weeks that followed, in view of new reports on the alleged incidents and the scarce information that had been delivered, the Cuban authorities reiterated the need to establish an effective cooperation and asked the US authorities for more information and insisted that the occurrence of any new incident should be notified in real time, which would provide for a timely action.
Besides all of the above and in the interest of contributing to the investigation and legal process established by virtue of the Cuban Criminal Procedural Law, the US received from Cuba some requests for information as part of the inquiry procedure.
The information delivered by the US authorities led the committee of Cuban experts conclude that this was insufficient and that the main obstacle to clarify the incidents had been the impossibility to have direct access to the injured people and the physicians who examined them; the belated delivery of evidence and their deficient value; the absence of reliable first-hand and verifiable information and the inability to exchange with US experts who are knowledgeable about this kind of events and the technology that could have been used, despite having repeatedly stating this as a requirement to be able to move forward in the investigation.
Only after repeated requests were conveyed to the US Government, some representatives of specialized agencies of that country finally traveled to Havana on June last, met with their Cuban counterparts and expressed their intention to cooperate in a more substantive way in the investigation of the alleged incidents. They again visited Cuba in August and September, and for the first time in more than 50 years they were allowed to work on the ground, for which they were granted all facilities, including the possibility of importing equipment, as a gesture of good will that evidenced the great interest of the Cuban government in concluding the investigation.
The Cuban authorities highly assessed the three visits made by the US specialized agencies, which have recognized the high professional level of the investigation started by Cuba and its high technical and scientific component, and which, as a preliminary result, concluded that, so far, according to the information available and the data supplied by the United States, there were no evidence of the occurrence of the alleged incidents or the causes and the origin of the health disorders reported by the US diplomats and their relatives. Neither has it been possible to identify potential perpetrators or persons with motivations, intentions or means to perpetrate this type of actions; nor was it possible to establish the presence of suspicious persons or means at the locations where such facts have been reported or in their vicinity. The Cuban authorities are not familiar with the equipment or the technology that could be used for that purpose; nor do they have information indicating their presence in the country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs categorically rejects any responsibility of the Cuban Government in the alleged incidents and reiterates once again that Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any sort against diplomatic officials or their relatives, without any exception. Neither has it ever allowed nor will it ever allow its territory to be used by third parties with that purpose.
The Ministry emphasizes that the US Government announced decision to reduce Cuba's diplomatic staff in Washington without the conclusive results from the investigation and without evidence of the incidents that would be affecting their officials in Cuba has an eminently political character.
The Ministry urges the competent authorities of the US Government not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and would rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations, which were already affected by the announcement of a new policy made in June last by President Donald Trump.
The Ministry reiterates Cuba's disposition to continue fostering a serious and objective cooperation between the authorities of both countries with the purpose of clarifying these facts and conclude the investigation, for which it will be essential to count on the most effective cooperation of the US competent agencies.

A memorial match between Bristol Rovers veterans and fans has raised more than £6,000 for charity.
The match, which took place at Mangotsfield United's ground at Cossham Street on Sunday, was organised by Ashley Belsten and took place in memory of his grandfather Martin - a lifelong Gashead who passed away last October.
A total of £6,243 has been raised so far, with all the proceeds going to Deerhurst Care Home in Soundwell who looked after Martin during his final few months.
The match, which ended 6-2 to the veterans saw a number of Gasheads getting the chance to take on some former Rovers players. The veterans side included many names familiar to Rovers fans, including Jo Kuffour, Steve Elliott, Danny Coles and Lewis Hogg.
Current Rovers midfielder Chris Lines also came along to support the event. While Wael Al-Qadi was unable to attend due to being away, the Rovers president did make an extremely generous gesture ahead of the match.
He messaged Ashley and met up with him ahead of the Cambridge match last Tuesday and explained why he couldn't come to the event and also gave a very generous donation to the charity.
Though the Gasheads side were defeated, there was one bright spot as supporter Shane Sims scored a screamer from the halfway line.
The money was raised through ticket sales and an auction and raffle on the day, with more than 700 fans packing into Cossham Street on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
Bristol Rovers fan left overwhelmed by Wael al-Qadi's generosity
Speaking after the event, Ashley said: "For me, the day ran fantastically and it was great to see Gasheads old and young turn up to support something very close to my heart.
"The cash will make a real difference to the residents life," he added.
LOS ANGELES-Taylor Hill was ‘'super awkward'' when she was younger, but she has learnt from her former shyness and has vowed to be more herself.
The 20-year-old supermodel was never very confident when she was at school, and if she could go back in time, she'd learn not to worry about little things and to be herself more.
Asked what she'd tell her younger self, she said: ‘'For sure, just be ourself, no matter how you feel that day, no matter how you think you look or whatever tough things you're going through.
‘'I was super-awkward and really shy and I had glasses. Don't focus on the little things so much - let them go.''
When she began her modelling career, the Victoria's Secret beauty grew more confident because she could see people liked having her walk for them.
She said: ‘'As a girl, I definitely had an awkward phase. I'm the biggest nerd in the world.
‘'Growing up in the fashion industry where you're always around artistic people who appreciate you being there really helped boost my confidence and be OK with it.''
But the brunette beauty is still shocked by her modelling success and insists her career is just an ‘'accident''.
She told Look magazine: ‘'I'm so unaware. I like to feel that I'm still who I was when I was first scouted at 14.
‘'Nothing else really matters to me besides my family and friends and being a genuine person.
‘'There isn't really any pressure in modelling. I'm just enjoying it and having fun.
‘'It was an accident, me getting here. It was thrown at me and I just went with it.''

According to the family, Yousuf, 80, was shifted to DHQ Hospital after he felt pain in stomach. The hospital staff refused to provide him a bed, saying that all the beds were occupied by patients and they had no extra one. Resultantly, the elderly patient was treated being laid on the floor. They said that patients were faced with difficulties in healthcare dispensation at Gujranwala DHQ Hospital despite the government's tall claims. They demanded the authorities concerned take notice of the incident and ensure provision of beds at the hospital.

REUTERS - Stoke City winger Ibrahim Afellay is uncertain where he will ply his trade next season, as there has been no movement in terms of extending his contract beyond the current campaign with the Premier League club.
The injury-prone Dutchman has featured regularly since he returned in December from an eight-month spell on the sidelines for a knee problem, making five of his nine appearances so far from the bench.
"No news at the moment. For this kind of question you have to ask my agent. I only focus on my work on the pitch and I work very hard every day," the 30-year-old Afellay told British media when asked if he would like to remain.
"That's the only answer I can give at the moment. It's a nice club, of course, but for the moment I can say nothing. I am focused on the job on the pitch. The rest is not for me."
Stoke, who are ninth in the table after 25 games, travel to face third-placed Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday February 26.

PHILADELPHIA — Daryl Hall and John Oates can still pack arenas with fans who can sing along to the entire set list. “I'm very appreciative and surprised and thrilled that after all these years this is actually happening and that there's an audience out there for what is predominantly older music we've created,” said Oates, who is on a summer tour with Hall across the United States, with stops in Canada.
Oates has also carved a path as a solo artist, and his latest album "Arkansas," is a tribute to Mississippi John Hurt that includes a dash of Dixieland, bluegrass and ragtime tunes, as well as original songs. ( Rick Scuteri / Rick Scuteri/Invision/AP )
They play Toronto's Air Canada Centre on June 5. They're also still creating new music. They recently put out the single “Philly Forget Me Not” as a tribute to Philadelphia; Oates is from its suburbs (they will also play that city on Saturday). It's the first new music they've made in 16 years. But Oates has also carved a path as a solo artist and his latest album, Arkansas, is a tribute to Mississippi John Hurt that includes a dash of Dixieland, bluegrass and ragtime tunes, as well as original songs. Oates says the music has marked a reawakening for him.
Article Continued Below
Oates recently went one on one with The Associated Press about what keeps Hall & Oates songs fresh; his recent solo album, and why you give the audiences what they want. You've lived in Nashville for a few years now. Why devote a solo album to blues and folk music? I was a folk musician, I was a blues musician. I played a lot of the same music as a kid before I met Daryl and before we started on our career. … I felt like I needed to go back to that in some way. I had the support system in Nashville to do that. Great players who understood the music, knew the music and could play and really make it happen. I thought I had never heard some of these songs performed by a band. Most of them are associated with a solo guitar and voice. I put together this very eclectic band with friends and some amazing musicians, and the songs just took on a life of their own. How do you define if an album is successful now compared with your 1980s heyday? I think it's defined by whether a core group of fans like it, at this point. Making an album at this point is almost like a musical business card. It just proves that you're out there, you're being creative, you're real, you care about music and you're making music. The people who buy it, it's a very small group of people who buy it. The world of streaming has basically taken over and become the commercial norm for music. I don't try to fight it, just try to work within it. I made this record specifically to be made on vinyl.
Do you ever get tired of playing the same Hall & Oates songs? It's a professional technique. I have great respect for being a professional. When you're a professional, you do your job. Luckily for us, and obviously for the fans, the music has stood the test of time. It's not hard to play these songs. It's not a groan, “Here we go again, here's ‘Maneater' again.” The songs sound good and they're actually fun to play. They're not too hard to do, and at the same time I'm fully aware of what it is we're doing.

Which is what? Giving people what they want to hear. I think any artist has a professional responsibility for playing the music that has brought them to wherever it is that they are. You have to give the audience the experience that they are paying a lot of money for and, in a sense, expecting.

Charles Kraeling is the first Island Health employee to receive an International Award of Valour
A protection service officer at Cowichan District Hospital has received another accolade for what his employer is calling “an incredible act of bravery on the job.”
Charles Kraeling has become the first Island Health employee to receive an International Award of Valour by the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety for his efforts in disarming a man with a knife in July 2017.
In November 2017 Kraeling had been honoured with a Provincial Award of Valour by the association's B.C. chapter.
Kraeling responded to a Code White (a violent or volatile individual) at the hospital and found a knife-wielding man who was threatening himself, patients and staff in a four-bedroom ward.
Kraeling said something distracted the man and knife-wielder took his eyes off of Kraeling, which provided Kraeling the opportunity to grab the man's knife arm.
“We had a brief struggle and I managed to get the man onto the ground, and he released the knife,” he said.
“My partner, who was staying back until then, managed to kick the knife further away, and I handcuffed him. The nurses gave him some medication and he started to come to some realization of what was going on. He just wasn't thinking in a right state of mind until then.”
Kraeling said no one was injured in the incident and the man was very apologetic for his actions.
“He really didn't mean to be violent,” he said.
Kraeling was honoured this week in Chicago at the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety's annual conference.
“Our Protection Services Officers must confront many challenges in their work lives and often go above and beyond in the call of duty to protect patients and staff as Charles bravely demonstrated,” said Leah Hollins, Island Health board of directors chair. “It is gratifying for us all to see him recognized and celebrated by his peers and on an international stage.”

(Corrects report from April 21 to show that vote on new CEO Christian Sewing was unanimous, with one abstention)

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Several supervisory board members cast dissenting votes at a meeting that reshuffled top management at Deutsche Bank this month. But Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing was ultimately appointed without any no votes, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.
Board chairman Paul Achleitner called the bank's 20-member board to a hastily arranged telephone conference on April 8 to make three major decisions: to vote out former chief executive John Cryan, to vote in Sewing to replace him, and to name two co-deputy CEOs.
“Mr. Sewing was elected unanimously - with one abstention - as chief executive officer,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement to Reuters.
In the decision on Cryan there were several “no” votes cast, three sources familiar with the matter said. Two of the sources said there was also resistance in the vote on the two co-deputy CEOs. Employee representatives on the board as well as investor representatives on the board cast dissenting votes, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the outcome of the votes on Cryan and the co-deputies.
Sewing was chosen as the bank's new CEO amid frustration over continuing losses at the German lender and a sagging share price.
Some shareholders have criticized Achleitner for the rushed nature of the CEO change, the second under his watch.

Millions of British motorists are driving their cars without any knowledge of the symbols on the dashboard, according to new research.
A study of 2,000 drivers shows nine in 10 have had a symbol pop up on the dashboard which they haven't recognised.
One in three cannot recognise which symbol is the headlamp indicator, while 27 per cent can't identify the ‘check engine' sign.
And when people DO understand what the car is warning them about, very few know how to manage the problem themselves.
Two thirds of those polled have no idea how to check the oil, just under half don't know how to change a tyre and 44 per cent wouldn't have a clue how to change the windscreen wipers.

While 58 per cent have no idea what their tyre thread limit should be, when it becomes illegal, or how to check it.
David Carter, spokesman for Accident Advice Helpline, said: “It's worrying how little drivers know about their own cars.
“Knowing the meaning of a dashboard symbol on your car could be the difference between having an accident or not.”
The study reveals only 16 per cent of drivers would now try to fix a problem with their car themselves.
Just under half of those polled would look online if the dashboard started flashing at them with unrecognisable symbols.

And three per cent of people would continue to drive their car regardless of warnings until it actually felt unsafe.
When it comes to car maintenance, a quarter of motorists admit they have been late in getting their car through the MOT.
Of these, 18 per cent took their car to the garage more than 16 days after the test was due.
Most common reasons for missing the car MOT were forgetting, feeling the car was safe and not being able to afford it.
Recently, Lana Del Rey revealed that Stevie Nicks would be appearing on her upcoming album, Lust For Life, dueting on a song called “Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems”. As we await its release, Nicks has shared her own new composition, “Your Hand I Will Never Let It Go”, which she's contributed to the upcoming film, The Book of Henry.
The stirring song shows off Nicks' distinctive voice and its accompanying lyric video provides a sneak peek into the plot of the film. “They called the game but not for us” she sings. “Drowned in thought and caught in a state/ Talking to ghosts who were not there/ Then you took my hand and transformation began.”
Hear it below.
The Book of Henry stars Naomi Watts as Susan Carpenter, a single mom who works at a diner, and Sarah Silverman as her “feisty friend” Sheila. The title character, played by Jaeden Lieberher, is Susan's precocious 11-year-old older son. He finds out their next-door neighbor Christina Sickleman, played by Maddie Ziegler, is being abused at the hands of her stepfather. Henry comes up with a plan to help, and Susan finds herself caught up in the middle.
Nicks is playing a sprinkling of dates this summer, including two shows with Fleetwood Mac. Find the full schedule below.

CLAIM
A new "super" antenna called Octa Air is a legitimate replacement for cable that can provide customers with 100s of free HDTV channels.
Mixture
RATING
Mixture
WHAT'S TRUE
Octa Air is a television antenna that provides access to local OTA channels.
WHAT'S FALSE
The images that accompany it have been doctored.
ORIGIN
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
In February 2018, an article promoting a new “super” antenna called Octa Air that was reportedly capable of providing more than a hundred HDTV channels for free started making its way around the Internet. The article boasted about how this new product was the most technologically advanced antenna on the market, and that its innovative “mud flap” design allowed it to pick up over-the-air television signals that other antennas could not detect:
A US-based startup company has come up with a new innovative and inexpensive gadget that is changing the way people consume media. It's called Octa Air. It is a new “super” antenna that can pick up over-the-air TV signals no other antenna was able to pick up before. […] Developed by a NASA engineer using military technology, the Octa Air Antenna uses a discrete mud flap modern design which makes it the most reliable and technologically advanced antenna to hit the market today. But there is a main differnce – it allows you to watch almost every channel, movie or show for free. With no subscriptions and completely legal. […] But how can you watch for free? The secret to that is a law that no cable company in the world wants you to know about. It states that every cable company has to provide additionally to the normal signal a over-the-air signal. So in order to not break the law the cable companies distrubute this signal but in a low frequency- so almost no antennas were able to pick it up reliably. Until now – Octa Air changes that.
This article employs several deceptive practices to make the Octa Air appears as if it were a revolutionary new product. For example, several of the promotional images were digitally altered, recycled from similarly misleading advertisements for different products, or both. It features an image purportedly showing the Octa Air on the cover of the May 2017 issue of PC Tech magazine, but that image was doctored, and it actually was created by using an image of the January 2013 issue of the South African magazine.
This is at least the second time that a PC Tech cover has been manipulated to promote a suspicious television antenna product. A nearly identical fake magazine cover was used to promote “TV Fox.” Here's a look at the two fake covers (left and right) with the genuine cover (center). Note how they all feature an advertisement for the Samsung Galaxy Note II, which was released in 2012, not 2017:
Perhaps even more deceptive was Cool-Technology's use of an image that purportedly showed the Octa Air on the side of an RV. That image was photoshopped from a press photograph of a 2015 Ford Motorhome. The “antenna” in the original image appears to be a couple of power outlets.
Here's a look at the real image (left) and the doctored advertisement (right):
Several of the other images used in the Octa Air advertisement have also been used to promote other similar products. In fact, the article promoting Octa Air and an article published by SmarterGadgetz.com promoting “TV Fox” are nearly identical in format:
We are highly skeptical that a company truly selling the most “technologically advanced” antenna in the world would resort to such deceptive practices.
The promises made in this Octa Air advertisement are predicated on the idea that every cable company has to provide an over-the-air signal for their channels. This is a very misleading statement. For one thing, the Octa Air is available in dozens of countries that all have different laws for television broadcasts. In the United States, cable operators are required to provide local channels over the air for free, but not all of their premium channels:
The Communications Act requires cable operators to set aside a specified portion of their channels for local commercial and non-commercial television stations. A cable operator with 12 or fewer channels must set aside up to three channels for local commercial television stations and at least one channel for a local noncommercial educational television broadcast station. Cable operators with more than 12 channels must set aside one third of their channel capacity for local commercial stations. Cable systems with between 13 and 36 channels must carry at least one, but need not carry more than three, local noncommercial educational television stations. Cable systems with more than 36 channels must carry all local noncommercial educational television stations requesting carriage with some exceptions for duplication of signals. Local television stations choosing the must-carry option and those that have negotiated agreements for retransmission with the cable system count towards this quota.
In other words, the Octa Air, like other over-the-air antennas, can provide access to local HDTV channels (from major networks such as ABC, NBC, and FOX). In order to access paid channels, however, viewers will still need a cable subscription, or the appropriate online alternative.

A former Alberta paramedic says Alberta Health Services (AHS) is sacrificing rural health care to ensure a higher standard of care in Calgary and Edmonton. His comments come just days after it was announced that AHS had declared a red alert in Calgary because no ambulances were available to answer calls.
“There's no consideration for code red in rural areas,” George Porter told 770 CHQR's Danielle Smith.

LISTEN: George Porter points to problems dispatching ambulances in rural Alberta
View link »
Porter, who was a paramedic in Alberta for 43 years, has been an outspoken critic of AHS.
He told 770 CHQR that his longest response time when he worked as a paramedic was one hour and 17 minutes.
“It's not a Calgary problem; it's a province-wide problem,” he said when asked about the most recent red alert in Calgary on Thursday.
MLA David Swann echoed those concerns when speaking Monday about ambulance wait times.
“I hear some pretty ridiculous stories about EMS coming all the way across the province, in some cases, for a condition that should have been dealt with more locally, but there was insufficient EMS staff.”
Swann added that triage wait times are also having an impact.
AHS data released Monday by the Alberta Liberals shows paramedics are having to wait a median time of one hour before transferring a patient into a nurse's care. Swann suggests that adds up to about $20 million in lost time.
“Something has to change here and it may be that some heads have to roll in the EMS hierarchy,” he said.
In a statement following the red alert last week, AHS said severe weather, as occurred on Thursday, can put pressure on EMS operations and that it responds by “repositioning units from other communities, deferring non-urgent transfers, deploying supervisors and using single-paramedic response units.”
It said red alerts usually last a short amount of time.
Swann is calling on AHS to release that data. He wants to know how often red alerts are called and how long each red alert remains in effect. He told Global News he is currently waiting on the results of a FOIP request.

But Porter said AHS' practice of “plucking ambulances out of rural areas” puts patients in those communities at risk.
“Let me paint you a picture here,” he said. “A code red is over when you have one ambulance clear off the table to respond for an entire city.”
“You have all these rural units and every ambulance in the city tied up. And so finally you get one ambulance that becomes available at Foothills hospital, and that huge rural area, as well as the city – that one ambulance has to cover that entire thing.”
“Is patient care compromised? Absolutely, it's compromised,” he added.
AHS said in a statement on Monday that the “borderless system” allows it to move regional EMS resources as the system demands to provide the best coverage to all communities.
“This helps all communities because EMS can monitor resources and call volumes and then move vehicles around to areas that need the most support,” the statement said.
Swann agrees that patients are suffering and he says paramedics are also suffering.
“Every indication is that it is affecting not only patients' risks but also the EMS staff risks, who are trying desperately to get to places where they shouldn't perhaps be trying– because of inefficient use of resources,” he said.
Porter said ambulances in rural areas are also frequently tied up on inter-hospital transports that can put them out of commission for hours.
“Here's a real scenario: the ambulance out of Vulcan gets sent to Calgary to take a patient from Vulcan hospital to Calgary to have insoles fitted for their shoes and you're gone for four to six hours for a wait and return,” he said.
“So that's four to six hours where there is no ambulance coverage in that large rural geographical area.”
He suggested AHS should have an alternate service to transport patients who are not in need of emergency help.
“I've said for years, you cannot, cannot be doing that.”
AHS said it is improving the way it uses emergency vehicles for non-urgent patient transfers.
“We now have 24 non-ambulance transfer vehicles across Alberta, including six in the south zone, that are able to transport stable patients instead of using emergency vehicles.”

In a game full of bouncing pucks, excellent scoring chances and strong goaltending from both sides, the Washington Capitals escaped with a 2-1 win over the Ottawa Senators Sunday.
With the victory, Washington moved up to fourth place in the Eastern Conference and secured their hold on the first place Wild Card spot in the Metropolitan Division. Ottawa still sits sixth in the East, but Boston and Philadelphia could both capture victories over the coming days to knock the Senators down to eighth place. In turn, this would lead to them barely holding onto a playoff position to kick off the new year.
First Period
Despite a lack of goal-scoring, the Capitals and Senators exchanged an equal amount of quality chances. Not only that, the goaltenders had to stay sharp in wake of bouncing pucks and drives to the net. Mike Condon juggled the puck a few times, and Braden Holtby found himself not only saved by the crossbar in an instant, but also by lucky bounces off players driving to the net. After 20 minutes, neither team could find twine, and both teams finished tied in shots, 8-8.
Second Period
Nearly halfway through the second period, both teams were still tied, but Ottawa would be first to open the scoring. Ryan Dzingel found Kyle Turris rushing to the crease, right at the doorstep. He fired a quick shot past Holtby, giving the Senators a 1-0 lead.
However, the Capitals wouldn't trail for too long. About seven minutes later, Karl Alzner provided Washington with the equalizer near the end of the second, firing a one-timer past Condon to make it 1-1.
Third Period
The defense would continue to make the difference for the Capitals early in the third period. Brooks Orpik dished a perfect one-time feed to Taylor Chorney, which landed right on the tape. He ripped a hard shot right past Condon, giving the Capitals the lead and Chorney his first goal since March 2016.
Ottawa would push the rest of the period looking for the game-tying goal to force overtime, but Braden Holtby and the Capitals' blueline kept them silent. Condon also had an outstanding performance, keeping his team in the game and stopping 10 of 11 shots he faced in the third.

A councillor arrested after he walked into his local police station to report a crime has queried the police's version of events as the community and fellow councillors expressed their support for him.
Cllr Afzal Shah said he was angered that a police statement issued to Bristol Live said officers had ‘acted in good faith'.
And he also questioned the police's assertion that it was a member of the public – and not a police officer – who initially identified him as a suspect in a crime for which he was then arrested.
Support for Cllr Shah came in from across Bristol and the wider area today, Tuesday, following Bristol Live's revelation that he was arrested and held in a police car outside his local police station for 45 minutes following a case of mistaken identity, after he walked into the station to report a serious crime on behalf of someone else.
A statement from Supt Andy Bennett said officers had acted in ‘good faith' when the arrested Cllr Shah at Trinity Road police station because someone else saw him and said he was involved in the offence they were reporting.
Supt Bennett said: “Officers acted in good faith … after another man who was in the station reporting an offence visually identified him as one of the people involved.
“This identification was later found to be incorrect and Cllr Shah was released without having been taken to a custody unit.
“We are extremely grateful for Cllr Shah's contribution to community policing both as a councillor and as a member of the Police and Crime Panel. We have apologised to him for the distress and embarrassment this incident has clearly caused him and welcome this opportunity to clarify this publicly,” he added.

Cllr Shah was left baffled by this statement – and said he had not seen anyone else in the police station foyer at the time. “I do not know of anybody else being there, certainly nobody I know of or in relation to myself. Nor did I make contact with any member of the public,” he said.
“If they were so concerned, sincerely, why not ask me? I wasn't offered a voluntary interview, just told that I was being arrested,” he added.
Cllr Shah said it was the statement by police claiming that they ‘acted in good faith' that had made him ‘question everything even more'.
Cllr Shah said earlier that he was still waiting for answers on why he was arrested and not just asked about the claim that he was somehow involved in a crime.
“I'm angered that the police feel the officers ‘acted in good faith'. That's a ridiculous assertion, it robs the apology of any value,” he added.
As well as being a local city councillor for Easton, close to Trinity Road police station, Cllr Shah sits on the Avon & Somerset police commissioner Sue Mountstevens' Police and Crime Panel, which is made up of local councillors from the force area.
The panel's chair, Nigel Ashton, who is the leader of North Somerset council, expressed his support for Cllr Shah. “Cllr Afzal Shah is a respected and value member of the Police and Crime Panel,” he said.
Bristol Live has asked Avon and Somerset police for a response to Cllr Shah's queries and to ask for more information about the circumstances of what happened in the foyer of the police station.
A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset police said their statement in response to the initial story still stands.
LAHORE - On the call of Chemists Association and bodies representing manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and pharmacists, medical stores continued shutter-down strike on the second day yesterday to protest against recent amendments in Drug Act, causing huge inconvenience to patients across the province including Lahore.
Like the previous day, patients were the ultimate sufferer of closure of more than 80 per cent of the medical stores.
Model pharmacies inside tertiary care hospitals and medical stores in the close vicinity were the only option for patients in big cities including Lahore.
Extraordinary rush of patients from outside caused severe shortage of many lifesaving drugs at model pharmacies inside the hospitals.
The medical stores continuing business also faced shortage of many essential drugs due to closure of wholesale medicines market at Lohari Gate.
Addressing a Press conference at Lahore Press Club, Chairman Retailers Association Ishaq Meo said that medical stores have been closed in mourning of suicide attack on rally of chemists.
He said that retailers association opposed strike and there was no change in stance even today.
Ishaq Meo said that the government first formed a Committee to remove reservations of chemists and then notified Drug Act in haste. As such, he said, proceedings of Committee would be a big joke.
He said that retailers have reservations on deleting some medicines from dispenser licence in July 2017. He said that some people wanted to make hegemony on drug industry which was not acceptable. He said that retailers would go to courts against illegal act of the government.
LAHORE - Begum Kalsoom Nawaz is fighting her maiden electoral battle on the National Assembly seat that fell vacant following the disqualification of her husband, ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif. This is not the first incident of one entering politics are assuming the driving seat after one's spouse's leaving the political scene for one reason or the other.
Begum Ra'ana Liaqat Ali Khan was the first such incident in the history of Pakistan. She was a prominent activist of Pakistan Movement but she started her career as a stateswoman – spawning more than two decades – only after the assassination of her husband, late prime minister Liaqat Ali Khan.
She served as economic adviser to Jinnah's Pakistan Movement Committee and later became first lady when Liaqat Ali assumed office of prime minister.
As first lady, Ra'ana founded Pakistan Women National Guards (PWNG) and helped establish Pakistan Woman Naval Reserves, and was appointed as the Chief Controller. For her immense services to the military as a civilian, the Pakistan Army appointed her first woman Brigadier-General, and an honorary uniform was issued to her.
She arranged a conference of over 100 active women from all over Pakistan. The conference announced the formation of a voluntary and non-political organisation for the social, educational and cultural uplift of the women, named All Pakistan Women's Association (Apwa). She was nominated its first president and unlike Pakistan Women National Group, Apwa continued to grow as it continuously fought for women's rights in Pakistan. Apwa College Lahore is part of that struggle.
After assassination of her husband, Ra'ana joined active politics. In the 1970s, she joined hands with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She was an economic adviser to Bhutto and played a key role in many major decisions of Bhutto regime.
Begum Ra'ana Liaqat Ali Khan was the first woman governor of Sindh as well as first Chancellor of University of Sindh and Karachi. During Ziaul Haq regime, she dedicated her life for the social and economic uplift of women till her death in 1990.
Nusrat Bhutto served as Pakistan's first lady from 1971 until the 1977 coup, and as a senior member of the federal cabinet between 1988 and 1990.
Nusrat is remembered for her contribution to empowerment of women and as an advocate for democracy in Pakistan, and owing to it she is dubbed as “Madar-e-Jamhooriat” (Mother of Democracy), a title she was honoured with by the parliament following her death.
She became the first lady in 1971 and remained so until her husband's removal from the Prime Minister House in 1977. She immediately succeeded her husband as the leader of the Pakistan People's Party, and, while under house arrest, fought an unsuccessful legal battle to prevent Bhutto's execution.
After Bhutto's execution, she along with her children went into exile in London, from where in 1981 she co-founded the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy – a nonviolent opposition to Zia's regime. As party's central figure, she campaigned for her daughter Benazir's election to the premiership.
After PPP's victory in 1988 elections, she joined Benazir's cabinet as senior federal minister without portfolio. She remained in the cabinet till dismissal of Benazir's government in 1990.
Nusrat Bhutto favoured her son Murtaza in family feud against Benazir. She stopped talking to the media and refrained from political engagements after the assassination of Murtaza in 1996 in a police encounter, during Benazir's second government.
Asif Ali Zardari became the first gentleman after his wife Benazir Bhutto assumed office as first female prime minister in 1988.
When President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Benazir government in 1990, Zardari was accused of massive corruption.
During second tenure of Benazir, he served as federal minister for investment and chairperson of Pakistan Environmental Protection Council.
He was arrested and indicted for Murtaza's murder as well as corruption charges after President Farooq Leghari sent Benazir regime packing.
Zardari was elected senator in 1997. He was released from jail in 2004 and went into self-exile to Dubai. He returned home after assassination of Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007. As the new Co-Chairman of the PPP, he led his party to victory in the 2008 general elections. He spearheaded a coalition that forced Pervaiz Musharraf to resign. He was elected President of Pakistan on September 6, 2008. He was acquitted of various criminal charges the same year.
Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif, the latest addition to the elite club, is a granddaughter of famous wrestler Gama Pehelwan. She remained first lady for three non-consecutive terms – from 1990 to 1993, 1997 to 1999 and June 2013 to July 2017. As first lady and even when her husband led the opposition against the then arch-rival Benazir Bhutto, Kalsoom avoided getting involved in politics herself.
She gained prominence after ouster of her husband Mian Nawaz Sharif by Gen Pervaiz Musharraf on October 12, 1999. She was put under house arrest - unlike her husband who was taken to Adiala Jail. Kalsoom dauntlessly challenged the usurper when a lot of men backed out.
Sharif named Kalsoom as the president of Pakistan Muslim League in 1999, and she remained on that post till 2002. For months before the exile of Nawaz Sharif to Saudi Arabia, Kalsoom built a momentum, leading rallies against the military rule. It paid off in the form of putting to an end the agony of her husband behind the bars and moving of the family to Saudi Arabia.
Now the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif has forced a reluctant Kalsoon to enter political arena and contest elections for the first time in her life from NA-120 in Lahore.

Brock Eurchuk and Rachel Staples, whose son Elliot Eurchuk died from an accidental overdose Friday in his Oak Bay home, call for changes to the laws governing youth health care. (Keri Coles/Oak Bay News)
The parents of a Victoria teen who died from an accidental overdose Friday are calling for changes to the laws governing youth health care.
Elliot Eurchuk, 16, died at his home on Friday. His parents, Rachel Staples and Brock Eurchuk, believe he took street drugs to help him sleep.
Elliot had been battling drug dependency after he was prescribed opioids for four major surgeries in 2017, including two for a fractured jaw and two shoulder reconstructions as a result of sports injuries. When his prescriptions of the highly addictive opioids ran out, he turned to street drugs for relief. He tried to hide the addiction from his parents, and was successful for awhile as he was shielded by the law.
The Infants Act states that children under 19 years of age may consent to a medical treatment on their own as long as the health care provider is sure that the treatment is in the child's best interest, and that the child understands the risks and benefits of the treatment.
“Kids try to make these decisions for themselves. If they don't want the help, there is nothing in our legal system that allows us as parents to get them the help they need,” said Staples.
“That kind of policy basically knocks parents to their knees in their efforts to help their children. In our son's case it ultimately led to his death because we had no control over his medical direction.”
Staples and her husband attempted to get access to Elliot's health records after he had been in and out of hospital with serious infections. They were told that Elliot did not want them to know what was going on. Due to the Infants Act, doctors honoured Elliot's wishes and told the parents nothing. An event in early February changed that.
Elliot was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 31 with a blood infection, which had him in the hospital for 26 days to get multiple rounds of IV antibiotics. On Feb. 9, Elliot was given a day pass. His dad took him to meet some friends for a movie and picked him up right afterwards to take him back to the hospital. At some point between drop off and pick up, Elliot got some opioids.
He was found by the medical team at the hospital early the next morning, not breathing and with blue lips. They administered naloxone and saved Elliot's life. It was at this point that his parents overheard a doctor talking to Elliot about naloxone and they got their first insight into what was happening to him.
“Even then it wasn't a direct conversation about what he had taken,” said Staples. “I'm a health care provider, I know what naloxone is. That was their only way of telling us that Elliot was using opioids from the streets.”
Staples and Eurchuk want to be clear that they are not blaming individuals, it is the system they feel needs to be changed. The Infants Act should be altered to allow parents to play a role in their child's health care. If youth are displaying at-risk behaviour, Staples and Eurchuk think parents should be told about what is happening and have a say in their child's medical treatment.
“When a parent suggests that their child is not capable of making responsible medical decisions I think that needs to override [the child's] desires,” said Staples.
They are also calling for alternatives to opioids in pain management.
“I just don't understand why opiates are the first line of approach for pain and why they are so widely prescribed when they are so addictive. There has got to be something else, particularly when you are dousing a young developing brain in opioids.” said Staples. “After his surgeries, Elliot came home with a prescription, like a bucket full of opioids. Yes, his surgery was extremely painful, and yes it is awful for the short-term but the long-term ramifications of opioids is just too risky.”
The final message that Elliot's parents want to get out, is for kids to make sure that if they are going to experiment, they don't do it alone.
“Elliot was alone,” said Staples.
The family is trying to cope and plan a funeral in an age where word travels instantly – they only had three hours between finding their son's body and getting calls from the school district and media.
“We are putting on a face for these media interviews but when we wake up in the morning, we are broken. Completely broken. We wake up multiple times a night gasping for breath, thinking about our son's heartbeat stopping,” said Eurchuk.

Ten years hence, objective historians will rewrite the chronology of US military blunders.
Top of the list will not be the US defeat against Canada in 1812; or the embarrassing invasion of Mexico at Pancho Villa 1916; nor Bay of Pigs in Cuba 1961; nor Battle of Chosin Reservoir in North Korea 1950 that resulted in 38th Parallel; nor the Gulf of Tonkin Vietnam 1964.
It will be far greater, destructive and tragic.
The new history will comprise the huge theatre of the Southern Front; the pivot of US containment of Eurasia comprising Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Already military historians agree that disbanding of Iraqi Army in 2003 was the biggest strategic and political blunder of modern times.
It plunged most of the Middle East into various forms of irregular warfare and low intensity conflicts.
Destruction of Libyan and Yemeni armies provided no solutions.
Attempts at destroying Syria have so far failed due to effective Russian intervention and resilience of Asaad Regime.
So if Pakistan's armed forces are destroyed with standoff munitions, a scenario manifold worse than Iraq would emerge.
In fact it will be a nightmare.
USA and its new found ally would have found temporary solace in destroying a military it was jealous of, but the revulsion would overflow the brim and ignite the entire region.
Military reactions aside, it would result in unleashing elements that Pakistan has tediously contained and eliminated during the past fifteen years.
It will be an injudicious conflagration of international proportions
On the larger canvas, the operations in the Middle East centered on destruction of armed forces, regime change and proliferation of religiously inspired militias.
Though the policy destabilised many countries, their effect is limited to preparatory or prelude to shaping the environment.
The final objective is Afghanistan-Pakistan to plug a gaping hole in the containment ring against Russia and China.
China's ambitious economic corridors with multiple highways neutralise the APEC Arc and threaten US interests.
Therefore, a cause must be created for international legitimacy.
This is where 39 Nation NATO along with India assume added importance.
The Afghan war is already a failure.
USA, NATO partners and ISAF failed to bring democracy to Afghanistan.
On the flipside they also failed to win hearts and minds of Afghan people.
That is why President Trump said, “We are not nation-building again; we are killing terrorists.
” But the Bush invasion of Afghanistan with ‘shock and awe' was also meant to kill terrorists who still thrive and control more than 60% of Afghanistan.
The scape goat for these failures is Pakistan and a strategic rationale must be created to punish.
Pakistan's international isolation, National Reconciliation Ordinance, a hostage economy, politicians of elastic conscience like collaborators of Clive (East India Company) are part of this plan of democracy that means, ‘of the thieves, by the thieves and for the thieves'.
As regards Pakistan Army, professional pride is also a factor.
Pakistan's accomplishment against terrorism with a support base in Afghanistan and handling by India are stunning.
All this happened from Afghanistan while the USA looked the other way.
The major difference in Pakistani and US led military strategies was that Pakistani operations were ground based through infantry assaults and holding tactical locations.
The US operations were based on a standoff with fire.
This professional rivalry has become contemptuous and as long as US generals lead the policy, it is headed to become the worst military disaster in history.
Many US generals are still wondering why US failed to use an atom bomb against North Korea.
It would never have become what it has.
So they now find a cause and an example to lead the policy against the trans-Atlantic civilian nuclear strategist.
War is no more an instrument of policy.
The policy is slave to military ambitions, a Pied Piper leading the world to mayhem and chaos.
USA wishes to go to war and it will fabricate the reasoning it always does.
So the warnings by Secretary Jim Mattis to Pakistan are real and cannot be relegated to diplomatic jargon.
He said, “President Donald Trump is prepared to take whatever steps necessary against Pakistan if it does not “change its behaviour and continued to support terror groups”.
He warned of global diplomatic isolation and that US has enormously powerful number of options.
The game plan against Pakistan is crystal clear when he went on to reveal, “What we are doing right now is we are aligning what Department of Treasury, Department of Defence, the Intelligence Committee, Department of State, say, this is what we must ask Pakistan to do to change its behaviour.
” This statement reveals that the offensive against Pakistan has already begun.
On the timeline of history, the multi-dimensional conflict began effectively in 2006 and has been the subject of my research since.
This is called Broad Spectrum Warfare encompassing all direct and indirect instruments of policy meaning selective military strikes, subversion of the state through political and economic hit men, diplomacy, cracking the idiosyncratic fabric with societal fault lines, hate against the armed forces and use of India to quarantine Pakistan.
Therefore, India found its relevance to this threat through their army chief in a most stupid manner.
Response by Pakistan's Joint Chief was unnecessary.
USA is cognizant that this plan could fail; therefore Mattis also offers carrots in his policy briefing.
He knows he is not stating the facts but wants to use this threat to compel Pakistan for something it is not guilty of.
Pakistan's response to this war has to be political so as to confront all kinetic and non-kinetic operations against its interests.
Pakistan's best response is not military or defiant.
It must cooperate with the USA if it identifies terrorists inside Pakistan, but this must be mutual.
But if USA's intentions are to eliminate the huge pool of Pakistan's reservists and civil defence volunteers in case Pakistan breaks up, it is impossible.
Pakistan must put its own house in order beyond fighting terrorists.
It must get rid of the cancer in its entire politic body.
Here are a few assumptions that put this plan in place.
A sustainable civil military divide in Pakistan has been created through 18th Amendment, PMLN and its allies and a small but vitriolic liberal segment.
The objective is to provoke a civil war in Pakistan.
This must be checked forthwith.
Like 1971, or to an extent Iraq and Afghanistan, there are enough Pakistani politicians abroad to create a government in exile led by the Sharif family.
With international recognition they could sanction operations against strategic and military targets, giving much needed international legitimacy.
There should be no doubts about US prepositioning of diverse assets inside Pakistan.
This is what contractors and lost containers were all about.
Pakistan's economy can melt in an instant.
Rupee can devalue to above 130 in a click.
This will create the catalyst for civil unrest.
International sanctions will worsen it.
Finally all prongs of this manoeuvre will concentrate on the armed forces and nuclear weapons.
Pakistan's best political response is democratic.
All patriotic legislators must resign from the federal and provincial assemblies forcing a new social contract to rid Pakistan of turncoat politicians, put the economy back on its potential and creating a wave of patriotism.
Pakistan's response should be led by an all-encompassing policy that synergises the true potential of the country.
It should be ably supported by an exterior maneuver creating new allies.

KARACHI - PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was served a show-cause notice on Tuesday for violating the Election Commission of Pakistan's code of conduct during his Lyari visit.
Deputy Commissioner South issued the show-cause notice stating that the PPP chairman had not informed the district or police administration ahead of his rally in Lyari on July 1st.
According to the ECP's code of conduct it is necessary for the politicians to inform concerned authorities three days in advance prior to their rallies.
The PPP chairman has been asked to clarify his position by July 5th. The notice warned that action would be taken as per the law upon failure to submit a reply by the given date.
Meanwhile, police conducted raids to arrest suspects who attacked Bilawal's convoy in Lyari. Some disgruntled protesters and residents of Bihar Colony stopped Bilawal's rally from travelling in Lyari and chanted slogans against him and resorted to vandalism and broke the windows of a car.
Bilawal's motorcade was halted as his car started to heat up and was later forced to change the route of his electoral rally.
An FIR was filed Sunday night against 400-450 unidentified and 13 identified persons. SSP City Samiullah Soomro on Monday said that the location of the suspects had been traced by using their mobile numbers and raids were under way to arrest them.

Mayor Matt Brown is the newest member of the Royal Canadian Legion's Victory Branch, after an official induction ceremony Friday at the Oakland Avenue facility.
After being sworn in by A-6 Zone Commander Caspar Koevoets, Brown was given a membership card, an official legion pin, and a celebratory drink.
“This was a really powerful experience for me personally,” said Brown.

His grandfather, John Brown, served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Queen's Own Rifles during World War II, and fought in the liberation of Holland. Brown's grandmother, Florence Dafoe, was a Canadian Women's Army Corps member at Wolseley Barracks during World War II, while his two great-uncles were RCAF airmen.
“There have been a couple of jokes about poppy routes, that I can deliver poppies in November to areas downtown where there's very little parking. I'd be happy to volunteer for that.”
Taking an active role in the legion's poppy campaign is one of Brown's responsibilities now, as an inducted member. But based on his work for the campaign in the past, Koevoets has no concern Brown will live up to the role.

“We put poppy boxes all through city hall, and the mayor had a rule there that if you came in without a poppy, you put five dollars in the box and get one,” Koevoets laughed.
“Mayor Matt has always been a great supported of the legion's cause, and we're very glad to have him as a member.”
Anyone can join the legion, so long as they're a Canadian citizen or citizen of an allied nation, and 18 years or older. Because Brown has family members who've served in the military, he was given an associate member pin. People without family members in the military can serve as an affiliate member.
Koevoets says he's excited that the Legion's numbers grew last year, as they attract a younger crowd.
The Victory Branch has more than 800 members, and was founded in 1942.

The tables are set to turn in Coronation Street as Bethany Platt finally comes to terms with being groomed and seeks revenge on those who abused her as the dark sex ring storyline comes to a head.
The schoolgirl will target her rage at pervert policeman Neil Clifton, who raped her in earlier shocking scenes.
Viewers were horrified to discover that one of Bethany's attackers was actually a police officer.
Neil, who is a friend of Bethany's groomer Nathan Curtis, first appeared in the soap to rape Bethany - and then returned to screens in a uniform.

Bethany's unsuspecting Mum Sarah called police following an argument, unaware that she was actually welcoming her daughter's abuser into their home.
Now the policeman will finally get the punishment he deserves when Bethany uncovers Nathan's vile plan to sell her abroad.
Speaking about the upcoming scenes Lucy Fallon revealed: " “Even though what Nathan has done to her is horrible.

“I think for Bethany what Neil has done is worse because he raped her and I think for her that was the first time she was experiencing something like that and it's something she will never ever forget.
“I think for her that's so important that she takes him down,” the actress told The Sun .
After what's been a hellish year for the schoolgirl, this week Bethany discovers Nathan's evil plan to sell as a sex slave abroad.
The teen was under the impression they were running a way together, but when she realises the sick truth she finally decides to fight back.
(Photo: ITV)
Speaking to The Sun , Chris Harper, who plays Nathan, said the "clock is ticking" for his character.
"Bethany will show a lot of courage and do something very difficult.
"She is actually very clever. I think it's the moment everyone has been waiting for. Bethany jumps out of the frying pan and into the fire, but the end of Nathan's evil control is in sight."
He added: "Nathan is going to leave Bethany high and dry with a 'friend' of his. He is going to wash his hands of her and move on. She's been a lot of trouble and this is his last chance to cash in on her.

"As ever, Nathan lies to her about his desire to be together and the strength of his love, telling her that they're eloping to the continent. But he doesn't do a very thorough job, and takes her compliance for granted.
"Nathan is trying to control Bethany through both flattery and fear, but now the clock is against him too. He thinks he's clever enough to play this game, but things are starting to get very sticky.
"He thinks if he keeps tightening his grip on Bethany she will comply, but it starts to have the opposite effect. It's his arrogance that leads her to start to question him – he stops listening to her."

The Other Victims: First Responders To Violent Disasters Often Suffer Alone

The night a gunman fired into a crowd of 22,000 people at the country music festival in Las Vegas in 2017, nursing supervisor Antoinette Mullan at University Medical Center was focused on one thing: saving lives.
She recalls dead bodies on gurneys across the triage floor, a trauma bay full of victims. But "in that moment, we're not aware of anything else but taking care of what's in front of us," Mullan says.
She calls that event, "the most horrific evening of my life." But in a career spanning 30 years, Mullan has experienced plenty of other tragic incidents in which she witnessed suffering and death.
She says she has tried to work through these painful memories, mostly on her own.
"I can tell you that after 30 years, I still have emotional breakdowns and I never know when it's going to hit me," she says.
In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings nationwide, including the Las Vegas massacre — one of the deadliest in U.S. history — according to Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks the country's gun-related deaths.
The group, which defines mass shootings as ones in which four or more people are killed or injured, has identified 159 so far this year, through July 3.
Just last week, a gunman burst into the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., killing five journalists and injuring two others.
Many of the men and women who respond to these tragedies have become heroes and victims at once. Some firefighters, EMTs, police and others say the scale, sadness and sometimes sheer gruesomeness of their experiences haunt them.

Many, like Mullan, are stoic, forgoing counseling even when it is offered.
"I don't have this sense that I need to go and speak to someone," says Mullan. "Maybe I do, and I just don't know it."
A growing toll
Research shows that emergency first responders suffer from the accumulation of stress and trauma. First responders report feeling depression, job burnout, substance abuse, troubled relationships — even suicide. Many studies have found elevated rates of post-traumatic stress disorder among nurses, firefighters and paramedics. A 2016 report by the International Association of firefighters found that firefighters and paramedics are exhibiting levels of PTSD similar to that of combat veterans.
Yet there's a dearth of research on treatment, insufficient preparation by employers for traumatic events and significant stigma associated with seeking care for the emotional fallout of those events, says Jeff Dill, a counselor and founder of the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance in Anthem, Ariz.
"When we have these national disasters or have a guy take a truck and run people over ... those are added stressors we aren't prepared for," says Dill, who is a former firefighter.
Dill says the emotional toll of these large-scale horrific events is magnified because everyone is talking about them. They are inescapable and become emotional "trigger points."
But a slow change in culture is also catching on, Dill says.
Dill travels the country teaching mental health awareness workshops for firefighters and other emergency personnel. Some employers are working on developing greater peer support, he says, but it often comes after the fact rather than proactively.
"We met a lot of resistance early on because of the [stoic] culture," says Dill.
Now, he says, emergency workers are starting to talk more openly about their PTSD and depression from the trauma they see at work. More first responders are reaching out to him and attending his workshops, he says.
"When I started in the fire service way back when, we didn't have to worry about those things," Dill says. But now, "out of those horrific incidents comes the conversation. They're talking about it instead of keeping it buried deep inside."

'I was scared'
In 2015, Gary Schuelke, a police watch commander, raced to the scene of a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., where he and his fellow officers faced a fusillade of gunfire from a pair of homegrown terrorists.
He'd seen a lot on the force over the years, but this call was different — and not just because of the numerous casualties. His son, a young police officer, was there with him.
Schuelke and his son, Ryan, chased the assailants' car as the bullets whizzed by. It was the younger Schuelke's first time exchanging fire with suspects.
Afterward, when both were safe, "I asked him, 'You doing OK?' " Gary Schuelke recalls. "If you're not, it's cool. You can talk to me about it. He said, 'I'm good, Dad. I'm very happy to be part of taking down the bad guys.'"
The elder Schuelke says he recognized Ryan's attitude. It reminded him of his own when he was younger. Ryan was "just like I was when I was in my 20s ... chasing bad guys and making arrests," he says.
He recalls how he had decided early in his career to try to "compartmentalize" his work experiences so they wouldn't affect his personal life.
Generally, no one focused on officers' mental health back then, he says, but experience has taught him how important it is to do just that.
Since then, he and some of his older colleagues have become more open to seeking help, he says. But some of the younger officers, like his son, still try to be stoic.
After the 2014 terrorist attack, which left 14 dead, his department quickly set up a "debriefing" meeting for all the officers involved, where they talked about the event as a group.
"I made it a point in that meeting that I was going to talk about the fact that I was scared," says Schuelke. "Not try to be macho in there and act like nothing bothered me about it."

After a confusing and emotionally-charged debate, London city council rejected staff recommendations for the Medway Valley master plan on Tuesday night.
The plan, which proposed a number of paved trails and new bridges to make Medway Valley more accessible to people with disabilities, was highly controversial, with some arguing the plan could upset the ecological balance in the area.
“It appears that we're saying people with disabilities are less deserving of public spaces,” said Coun. Maureen Cassidy, who was in favour of the plan.
“The message they will hear is that disabled people don't have the same value as non-disabled and that the drive to become more accessible, might lead to ecological catastrophe,” she said.

Coun. Phil Squire was highly critical of the plan, going as far as introducing his own motion, which would continue without the added bridges that the master plan entailed.
“If we make a decision today to support the Medway plan, yes we will have a decision, but what we will have in addition to that decision is multiple groups at odds,” said Coun. Squire.
The staff recommendations had two bridges crossing the creek, one near Fanshawe Park Road and Wonderland Road, and one further south near Windermere Road.
“Let's figure out a way that we can enhance the trail system that is currently there, not upsetting the ecological balance, and find a way to make it truly accessible for everyone,” Squire said.

After many councillors — including Michael van Holst and Tanya Park — expressed their concern regarding the master plan, council eventually voted 4-10 to defeat the plan, but not without making things much more confusing.

After nearly two hours of debate, council voted to reconsider multiple components in the plan, as there were elements they wanted to pass. At one point, council voted to overturn portions of its own vote in order to break down Squire's motion, and several new amendments, to allow for separate decisions on each.
The complicated process confused and angered many onlookers in the public gallery.
Eventually, staff was directed to report back on a number of pieces of the master plan, including the need for further public consultation.

With CinemaCon in full swing in Las Vegas right now, just a short time ago Disney held their big presentation and revealed new footage from Brad Bird's Incredibles 2, Ron Howard's Solo: A Star Wars Story, Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and the Wasp, Phil Johnston and Rich Moore's Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It-Ralph 2, Tim Burton's Dumbo, the Russo Brothers' Avengers: Infinity War, Guy Ritchie's Aladdin, Marc Forster's Christopher Robin, Rob Marshall's Mary Poppins Returns, Lasse Hallström's Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and a lot more.
For those who don't know, CinemaCon is a convention where theater owners get a look at what the studios have to offer for the rest of the year, and where vendors can show new products for theaters to buy. It's basically Comic-Con for theater owners. Besides showing off never-before-seen footage, the studios often bring the cast and the filmmakers. Over the course of a few days, Hollywood comes to Las Vegas and world premieres a ton of footage, trailers and even a few movies.
While I normally like to write about all the footage a studio presented and then also offer a video recap so you can pick how you'd like to digest the material, my schedule today is a bit too crazy, so all I can do is share the video I recorded with Peter Sciretta from /Film after the panel ended.
I will say that if you're a Wreck-It-Ralph fan, the scene they shared from Wreck-It-Ralph 2 (which I wish was called Super Wreck-It-Ralph) was absolutely amazing and had me laughing out loud many times. Check out the video below and look for more CinemaCon coverage later today.

A national recall of flour due to E. coli contamination, which was first announced last month, has been expanded yet again.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's recall on March 28 affected Robin Hood flour sold in four provinces in Western Canada and was later expanded across the country.
Last week, more products were added to the recall, including certain flour goods produced by Ardent Mills of Brampton, Ont.
Now Ardent Mills is adding even more items to the list, including various sizes of Robin Hood Best for Blending flour, as well as the brand's bread and roll mix.
A complete list of recalled products can be found on the CFIA website.

The federal agency says all recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store.
The agency said after the initial recall there were 26 cases of people being infected with E. coli in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador.
No deaths have been reported, but at least six people required hospital care.
Two Alberta law firms announced last week they were filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of people who bought or consumed Robin Hood flour and became ill.
22-24 players identified as potential for 2019 World Cup, says MSK Prasad
India has the best bench strength in world cricket.
by Umaima Saeed News 14 Aug 2017, 15:41 IST
Yuvraj Singh has been left out of the ODI squad for Sri Lanka
What's the story?
The ODI squad for the upcoming five ODIs between India and Sri Lanka was announced on Sunday evening. Some of the regular players of the team were rested, while the relatively inexperienced ones were called to the squad.
Addressing the media at a press conference, BCCI's chief selector MSK Prasad explained the reason behind resting the players, saying that trying the younger ones will help them form the core group for the 2019 World Cup.
“Senior players will be rested to give youngsters a chance. (This) will give us a group for 2019 WC. Ashwin playing county cricket is a blessing in disguise. He was rested first but we didn't know they were contacted for county. They were rested but they informed BCCI of intention to play county. So rest becomes player rotation.”
He further revealed that they intend to give 22-24 young players a chance to prove their mettle, for the team to filter out the best for England 2019.
“22-24 players identified as pool for 2019 WC. Will all be given a go in short term. List to be pruned from time to time.”
In case you didn't know
Last week, news had it that Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will be playing in the remainder of the County Championship in England for Worcestershire.
The heart of the matter
India has a very good bench strength, in both the bowling and batting department. In a country which was criticised for not producing enough pacers, they have a surplus of the same today. From Mohammad Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar to Shardul Thakur and Basil Thampi, there is no dearth of quicks.
Similarly, India have additional pace options in players like Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel. As for the batsmen, the waitlist on the fringes is pretty long.
Squad for the ODIS
Virat Kohli (Captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma (vice captain), KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shardul Thakur.
What's next?
India are currently playing the dead rubber at Pallekele, which will be followed by five ODIs beginning on August 20 at Dambulla. The only T20I will be played on September 6.
Author's Take
The Sri Lanka ODI series is an ideal platform to test India's bench strength, given that the opposition are a depleted side. India have quite a few full-fledged series coming up, both at home and away, which will help filter out the players who can be in the World Cup 2019 squad.

WestJet Airlines Ltd. says it has partially resolved a computer system outage and has started to resume regular operations.
The airline says some flights have been delayed and it is experiencing longer lines at check-in because of the issue.
WestJet recommended passengers arrive early at the airport and check their flight status ahead of time because of the problems.
Travellers had reported on Twitter that there were long lines and kiosks off-line at some airports, as well as issues with booking on the company's website.
Last October, the airline said computer problems caused delays for dozens of flights.
MADRID (Reuters) - Valencia kept the pressure on Liga leaders Barcelona by beating Celta Vigo 2-1 on Saturday with a late penalty from Dani Parejo and Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for the first time in a league game this season as Real Madrid thrashed Sevilla 5-0.

Valencia were looking for a first win in three games to revive their unlikely title bid and took the lead through a header from top scorer Simone Zaza in the 28th minute, the Italian's 10th league goal of the season.
Iago Aspas stabbed in from close range in the 46th minute to equalise for Celta, who had held Barça to a 2-2 draw last weekend, but Parejo restored Valencia's lead nine minutes from time with a double stroke of fortune as his disputed penalty went through the hands of goalkeeper Ruben Blanco.
Valencia are second in the standings, moving two points behind Barcelona who have 36 and visit Villarreal on Sunday. Real go third on 31 but Atletico Madrid can go back above Zinedine Zidane's side when they visit Real Betis on Sunday.
Celta's players raged against referee Jose Luis Munuera Montero for awarding Valencia the penalty when Jose Gaya went to ground following a challenge by Pablo Hernandez.
“We didn't drop points today, we had them taken off us by that person (the referee). He robbed us. I hope he doesn't officiate any more of our games,” said Celta captain Hugo Mallo.
Goalscorer Aspas added: “I think he must have something against Celta, in every game of ours which he has taken charge of, something has gone against us.”
Valencia coach Marcelino, who was back in the dugout following a two-game touchline ban, said: “It was a really exciting game. The result is fair because we scored two legal goals but Celta played very well and if they'd drawn we wouldn't have been able to complain.”

EMPHATIC WIN
In Madrid, Real overcame a selection crisis in defence to crush Sevilla with a lethal attacking display, scoring all their goals before halftime.

Real were without Raphael Varane, captain Sergio Ramos, Dani Carvajal and holding midfielder Casemiro but got off to an ideal start when Nacho Fernandez cashed in on a woeful attempted clearance following a corner to score in the third minute.
Ronaldo, who had paraded his joint-record five Ballon d‘Or trophies on the Santiago Bernabeu pitch before kick-off, side-footed home a through ball from Marco Asensio to score the second before thumping in the third from the penalty spot.
Toni Kroos scored the most impressive goal of the game by charging forward from his own half and playing a wall pass with Lucas Vazquez before stroking the ball beyond Rico, while 18-year-old Achraf Hakimi notched his first goal for Real to complete another lethal breakaway.
Real coach Zidane was delighted with his side's performance, especially after last week's goalless draw at Athletic Bilbao.
“It has been a great day for us, above all because we won and scored a lot and we hadn't done that much so far this season. It was a very complete game for us and that means a lot to me,” the Frenchman told a news conference.
“We're growing in every sense and playing better. When you play better you create more chances, we created a lot today and scored five times, for the first time this season (in the league).”
After working for nine seasons on ABC's “Grey's Anatomy” as executive producers and later than showrunners, the husband and wife duo of Tony Phelan and Joan Rater is moving on to another procedural: the new CBS legal drama “Doubt,” which stars Katherine Heigl, Elliott Gould, and Laverne Cox. Phelan and Rater talked to Variety about what they learned from their “Grey's” days, the need for a non-black-and-white depiction of the criminal justice system, and casting a transgender lead on the show after their own son transitioned.
Where did the idea for the show come from?
Phelan: It came time for us to do our own show and so we knew that we wanted to move away from medicine and we are big news junkies and law junkies.
Rater: We wanted to create a show that was as much a procedural as it was a story about the personal life of our characters. What was really nice about “Grey's” was the high stakes. You put this sort of regular people in high stakes situations and it makes really fun storytelling. In criminal defense you have similarly high stakes. People's lives are literally in the hands of our characters. It provides us with so many storylines. At the same time we were having this interesting conversation when we first started just about how the relationship between a client and their attorney. It's really…
Phelan: Intimate. We also were looking around the landscape and noticed that since 9/11 there's been a lot of shows about prosecutors catching bad guys and we were interested in looking at that from the other side of the equation. Who is that person who is going to stand by if, God forbid, you're accused of a crime. The other thing that weighs on us is all this talk about congressmen coming together over the issue of criminal justice reform and how the system that we have now had some very serious flaws, but everybody agrees it doesn't work as well as it should. That felt like interesting, fresh ground to examine.
What were your hopes in bringing up these political issues? How does the show go about doing that and take on some of these touchy, of-the-moment political issues?
Phelan: When we set out to do this show, we were pretty committed to presenting these legal stories in a grey world where there is no absolute right and absolute wrong, and we want the audience, along with our characters, to shift their allegiances back and forth as the stories progress.
Rater: The more you find out about a case, the more complicated and less black and white it becomes. One really helpful thing we did was hiring an ex-homicide prosecutor.
Phelan: A guy who worked a Bronx public defenders office.
Rater: So we had these opposing opinions right in our writers room.
Phelan: Battling it out over these very delicate issues. We tackle the issues of campus rape, attorney-client privilege, vigilantism.
Rater: A hate crime against a trans person. We strive not to be preachy or didactic. We present these cases from all facets and through the lens of our characters and how they struggle to do the right thing under very difficult circumstances.
What was it like to work with Katherine Heigl again? Did you pull her into the project from the start?
Rater: When we heard she was available, we really just jumped at the chance to work with her because, you know, it's one of these things when you've written this character and you're like, “Oh my god, it is Katie Heigl.” Katie has the ability to be so funny and yet so smart and relatable.
Phelan: And vulnerable.
Rater: All at the same time. It's been kind of dreamy.
Phelan: She's been a fantastic leader of the cast. She's number one on the call sheet and she takes that responsibility very seriously, always the first person on the set and the last one to leave. She had a tremendous workload, not to mention the fact that she was pregnant, but she was an incredible trooper and really led by example, and also has a great sense of humor, so we keep marveling at the fact that all of our cast seem to really like and enjoy hanging out with each other.
What do you think you've learned from working on “Grey's”?
Rater: Oh my god, we learned so much from “Grey's.” We were at “Grey's” for nine years so it was basically our schooling on how to write and run a TV show. What “Grey's” does really well is how strong the writing team is. You trust the writers to do their work. It's like a big happy family. We also brought in the idea that we had started on “Grey's” bringing actors in early in the process to ask them what stories they'd be interested in telling.
Phelan: All the actors for the most part were doing their own research about criminal defense and their characters. We found it very helpful to sit down with each of them individually in the writers room and say, “here's kind of what we're thinking of for season-long arcs for all of you. What do you guys think? What would you be interested in doing and based on your research has excited you?” The other thing is trying to create both onscreen and in the shooting process as much as a family atmosphere as you can because in terms of the audience, you're inviting this group of people into your home every week. You want to be invested in and keep coming back to these characters. Also in terms of creating a work environment where everyone feels valued and like they're a contributor to the whole and product. Getting people invested in what we're doing came from our experience on “Grey's.” We certainly wish each other well. When we left there, we just felt like we had done what we could do on that show and it was time to go off and create our own thing.
In many shows, a trans character's gender identity is often used as just a plot device. Why was it important to include a trans character on screen and how did you make sure Laverne Cox's Cameron was completely fleshed out?
Phelan: Right about the time we were writing “Doubt,” our son had come out to us as trans when he was about 16. We were living a sort of learning curve at home, learning about our son and what he was going through and it was fascinating, complicated, and wonderful. Learning that he was trans was a big change in our lives, but also that not so much a change. He was still the same funny, smart, messy, theater-obsessed guy who's also trans. He was a fully fledged human being and we didn't sit around our house talking about his gender so much. We were too busy living our lives. A lot of trans characters on TV, the focus has been — rightly so as it's an important part of the experience — on their transition, coming out and we wanted a character who had come out and who was assertive beyond that point and just living her life. We wanted a fully realized human being whose life we could just drop into.
Rater: While her being trans obviously is a part of her, it's not necessarily the part that she leads with all the time. In conceiving of this character, we had Laverne in mind when we were writing it, but we knew that Laverne was doing “Orange Is the New Black” and was unavailable so we kind of resigned ourselves to doing a nationwide talent search to find a trans actress to play the role. Once CBS announced they were going to move forward and make the pilot, the script then went out to the industry and within a day, Laverne's rep called us up and said, this is Laverne's role and she's flying herself from New York to Los Angeles to audition for you.
Phelan: She's always wanted to play a lawyer and she came into the audition with this giant monologue, a closing argument, and she had it down word for word and she just blew it away. It was clear the role was hers. One of the big arching love stories of the season is Cam's relationship with a cis man. They have all sorts of issues.
Rater: Some of which relate to a prosecutor dating a defense attorney and some of it relates to a cis dude dating a trans woman and discussions and issues that might come up. Really interesting, powerful discussions that I think are going to be new for TV that we're really proud of.
There are a lot of shows on TV right now that are doing social activism by presenting these diverse characters. By including this character, the theme of criminal justice and exploring the nuance of whether someone is innocent or guilty, what do you think that's going to bring to the audience?
Rater: We want our audience to love the characters the way we do. We very purposefully didn't make it a super serious show. We wanted the show to have humor as well as serious aspects. I think by loving our characters, by loving Cam, you go a long way towards showing people that transgender people are, for lack of a better expression, people.
Phelan: And aren't scary and are just like anybody else. Just having something like that in your living room week after week goes a long way to social acceptance, especially for people who don't necessarily have gay or trans people in their lives. Seeing these people as people rather than as issues I think is really important. Similarly, I would say, opening a window on criminal defense and the criminal justice system as it is in America now and trying to tell truthful stories as much as we possibly can–
Rater: Complicated, non-preachy stories that don't show the criminal justice system and the work these people do as black and white but the very fine, complex, nuanced, interesting, difficult work that these people do every day heroically.

Batali is stepping down from daily operations at his restaurant empire following reports of sexual misconduct by the celebrity chef over a period of at least 20 years.

NEW YORK (AP) — Mario Batali is giving up oversight of the daily operations at his restaurant empire following reports of sexual misconduct by the celebrity chef over a period of at least 20 years.
The online site Eater New York reported Monday that the incidents involve at least four women, three whom worked for Batali. In a prepared statement sent to The Associated Press, Batali said that the complaints "match up" with his past behavior.
"I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family," Batali said.
A spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group says an employee reported inappropriate behavior by Batali in October. The company told Eater it was the first formal complaint against Batali and that he was reprimanded and required to attend training.
Batali will also take leave from his ABC cooking show, "The Chew."
"We have asked Mario Batali to step away from The Chew while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention," the network said Monday. "ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct."
Batali was well known in culinary circles, taking jobs early in his career as a sous chef at the Four Seasons in Santa Barbara and San Francisco.
His career took off after opening Po in New York City in the early 1990s, and he skyrocketed to fame with the airing of Molto Mario, a show that ran on the Food Network for eight years, until 2004. It was there that his signature look, a fleece vest, shorts, and orange Crocs, became instantly recognizable to most people.
He co-owns restaurants in a handful of cities.

Iran will remain in its 2015 nuclear deal only if its benefits are guaranteed by other signatories after the U.S. withdrew from the accord, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a news conference on Wednesday.
Rouhani said the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal was “illegal”.
“Not the United States, not any other country would benefit from this decision to withdraw from the accord,” Rouhani said in the news conference, which was broadcast live on Iranian state television.
On May 8, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal and reinstated sanctions on Iran
after he had criticised the accord and said the country did not abide by its conditions.
European nations Germany, the U.K. and France, who brokered the Iranian nuclear deal with China and Russia in 2015, have said they are committed to the deal.
However, European businesses and financial institutions could be punished via so-called secondary sanctions if they do business with Iranian individuals or entities once U.S. restrictions snap back in August and then in November.
The 2015 agreement sealed by Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama, with the support of China, Russia, Germany, France and the UK, eased sanctions on Tehran.
France, Germany and the UK launched a diplomatic offensive in recent weeks attempting to persuade Trump not to scuttle the deal which aims to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Trump said he opposed the agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JPCOA), during
the 2016 presidential campaign.
Since taking office, he has repeatedly threatened to pull the U.S. out of the pact, recently calling it a “horrible deal''.
Iran's state news agency reported Tuesday the foreign ministers of Iran and the countries remaining
in the nuclear accord are to meet in Vienna on Friday.
Get Screened Earlier For Colorectal Cancer, Urges American Cancer Society
Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States, most frequently diagnosed among adults over 65. To catch those typically slow-growing malignancies early, when they can often be cured, most doctors' groups recommend colorectal cancer screening starting at age 50.
But the American Cancer Society this week changed its advice and is recommending that screening start five years earlier.
"There is compelling evidence that the optimum age to start is now 45," says Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer of the society, who cites a sharp increase in deaths from colon and rectal cancers among men and women under age 50.
"People born in the '80s and '90s are at higher risk of developing colon cancer, particularly rectal cancer, than people born when I was born back in the '50s," Wender says.
And the rise is not just because detection is getting better, he says. In fact, the risk of developing colon cancer is twice as high as it was years ago and the risk of developing rectal cancer is four times higher.
"We just have to face reality," says Wender. "We just don't know why it's increasing."
Some of the increase could stem from the increase in obesity in the U.S., a known risk factor for colorectal cancer, he says.
"But we don't think that explains the entire change," he adds. "There is a great deal of interest and a lot of research beginning to try to answer that question."
So far, other groups are maintaining their recommendation that colon cancer screening start at age 50, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent, volunteer panel of national experts in disease prevention and evidence-based medicine.
Stanford University internist Douglas K. Owens, the task force's vice-chairperson, says the group's 2016 recommendations were based on extensive review of the benefits and harms of colorectal screening at the time.
"There was limited data on screening people under age 50," Owens says. The new American Cancer Society guidelines, he adds, should prompt more research into the relative benefits and harms of screening among younger people.
Dr. Robin B. Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, says there's been an "alarming" increase in cancer among younger adults. She's the co-director of the recently established Center for Young Onset Colorectal Cancer there.
Over the last 10 years, Memorial Sloan Kettering has seen 4,000 new colorectal cancer patients under age 50, she says. Many of them did not have traditional risk factors such as obesity, smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity or a diet high in fat or low in fiber.
In fact, Mendelsohn says, they were typically less likely to smoke and less likely to be overweight than their older counterparts.
"Anecdotally, when you talk with these patients, [some] are marathon runners who don't eat red meat, don't smoke, do everything 'right' and say 'why did this happen to me?' " she says.
Often, they tell her they've seen multiple doctors because of rectal bleeding, but have been told, since they're under 50, they "can't have cancer." That's clearly not the case, she says.
Ongoing studies are looking at a multitude of factors that might be contributing to the earlier cancer incidence. Potential culprits include over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and antidepressants, as well as multiple vitamins, probiotics and other dietary supplements.
The new recommendations should bring greater attention to the value of screening, says Mendelsohn, who suggests that future studies investigate whether even younger people — in their early 40s or even 30s — should be screened.
A first colon cancer screening does not have to be a colonoscopy. In its new recommendations, the cancer society recommends choosing from one of six screening tests, which are also currently recommended by other expert groups. The guidelines don't prioritize among screening choices.
The choices include three at-home kits that test stool for blood.
These kits need to be ordered by a doctor; primary-care providers often have them on hand in the office to give to patients, Wender says, or they may be mailed.
"It's done in the privacy of your own home," he says. Patients mail the sample to a research facility which tests for microscopic traces of blood.
If the test is positive, a colonoscopy is recommended, Wender says; but only one in five people test positive for blood in their stool.
Typically, these home tests of feces are repeated every year for good results.
Alternatively, some patients opt for what's called a "virtual" colonoscopy — essentially a CT scan of the colon — which should be done every five years, according to the new recommendations.
Another approved option is a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the colon, and is followed up by a colonoscopy if polyps are found.
A positive result picked up in these screening tests is typically followed up by a colonoscopy, which uses a tiny camera to investigate the entire colon. It is not only a search for early cancer; more often than not, Wender says, it detects pre-malignant, suspicious lesions, or polyps, which are removed during the procedure.
"When we find and remove polyps we actually prevent any future chance of that developing into cancer," he says.
Despite the high cure rate when colon cancer is caught early, only two-thirds of Americans over 50 get screened.
The American Cancer Society says it endorsed the full range of screening tests "without preference" in order to improve the rate of screening. In its latest advice, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says head-to-head comparison studies have shown that no one screening test is more effective than another in early cancer detection.
While they differ on the age of first screening, both groups suggest that screening over age 75 should be a joint decision between patient and doctor. And after age 85, screening is no longer necessary, the doctors' groups agree. That's because the risk of colonoscopy among this elderly population can outweigh any benefit.
MADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has defended the club's decision not to sign anyone in January, saying he has “blind trust” in his squad as they attempt to claw back a 19-point deficit to Barcelona at the top of La Liga.
The Spanish and European champions were linked by Spanish media with a move for Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga during the winter window.
Zidane, however, said throughout January that he did not want any more signings as he had confidence in the group of players that became the first team to win back-to-back Champions League titles last season.
“We're together, even if it's a difficult moment. I've always seen the players are focused when we have hard times,” Zidane told a news conference.
“I have faith in my squad, I have blind trust in them -- nothing else. That's how I live it and I have confidence in them. That's what I want to show; and the squad returns the feeling in terms of work, fight and the attitude that this isn't over.”
There was pressure on Real to enter the transfer market given their domestic slump.

On top of their woeful league form, they were eliminated from the King's Cup at the hands of Leganes and face the daunting prospect of facing in form Paris St Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League.
Zidane's long-term future could hinge on European success, but the Frenchman says he is focused on the immediate tasks at hand.
He went as far as to suggest his side are still in the title race as they prepare to visit Levante on Saturday.
”I don't care about what happens next season. I'm here to think about the here and now, to prepare my team for league matches.
”You (the media) are talking as if La Liga is already won, but I don't believe that. You never know in football and we'll try to win all our games.
“As far as the Champions League is concerned we are really up for it. Madrid have won many and we will do our utmost to win our next match in that competition, too.”

Bob Dorough
Bob Dorough, the composer and jazz musician best known for creating Schoolhouse Rock!, passed away on Monday. The 94-year-old musician died at his home in Mount Bethel, Pennsylvania, his wife, Sally Shanley Dorough, confirmed to NPR.
Dorough's career began in the army, where he served as composer, arranger, and player in the Special Services Army Band in the mid-1940s. After receiving his Bachelor of Music from the University of North Texas, he moved to New York to pursue a jazz career. His debut album, Devil May Care, was released in 1956 on Bethlehem Records. Miles Davis would later record his own cover of the title track, an instrumental interpretation that eventually became a jazz standard. Dorough returned the favor by singing on the holiday song “Blue Xmas (To Whom it May Concern)” and “Nothing Like You”, the closing track to Davis' 1967 album, Sorcerer.
While working at an advertising company in 1971, Dorough was approached by his boss to create a song about the multiplication tables. The idea was that if his kids could remember the lyrics to rock music better than their school lessons, perhaps setting the education to music would do the trick. The song became “Three is a Magic Number”, and the project grew to become Multiplication Rock, the first entry in ABC's Schoolhouse Rock! series.
Schoolhouse Rock! went on to become a staple of '70s and '80s childhood, running from 1973 to 1985. After having penned the entirety of Multiplication Rock, Dorough stayed on as musical director while more contributors were brought on. He wrote memorable tunes for the series such as “Conjunction Junction”, “Verb”, and “The Shot Heard ‘Round the World”, as well as arranging music for other songwriters.
UNITED NATIONS - The UN Security Council (UNSC) has condemned North Korea's recent missile launch, calling on its 15 members to “redouble efforts” to implement the sanctions already slapped on Pyongyang over its missile work.
“The members of the Security Council deplore all the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) ballistic missile activities, including these launches,” the 15-member Council said in a statement on Monday, referring to an earlier such test by Pyongyang last October.
The council “called upon all member states to redouble their efforts to implement fully the measures imposed on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by the Security Council,” according to the statement. The statement was issued following a UNSC emergency meeting, which was held on Monday at the request of the US, South Korea and Japan a day after North Korea launched the missile near the western city of Kusong. The outcome of Tuesday's session pleased Japan, with Tokyo's ambassador to the world body, Koro Bessho, saying “there was unanimity in condemning the launch and an expression of concern about the situation.”
The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, also said in a statement after the Security Council meeting on Monday that “it is time to hold North Korea accountable – not with our words, but with our actions.” Haley's tough statement echoes President Donald Trump's remarks who said on Monday, “Obviously North Korea is a big, big problem and we will deal with that very strongly.”
North Korea's missile flew east about 500 kilometres after the launch before falling into the Sea of Japan, according to South Korea's Defence Ministry. Pyongyang later described the test as successful.
On Tuesday, the South's Yonhap News Agency cited the country's intelligence agency as saying that the new type of ballistic missile put to test by Pyongyang has a range of over 2,000 kilometres.
Pyongyang says it is developing its missile and nuclear programmes as deterrence against the United States, stressing that it will not abandon the programmes unless the US ends hostilities toward the country.
North Korea also regards all such sanctions as a violation of its sovereignty and right to self-defence.
The North's latest missile test came weeks before the start of annual Washington-Seoul war games.
The joint large-scale drills, which are held in South Korea every year, are slammed by Pyongyang as rehearsals for war.
In another development on Tuesday, South Korea's Defence Ministry submitted a report to a parliamentary committee, saying the US had agreed to deploy strategic assets for the upcoming military manoeuvres.
Media quoted the report as saying that the strategic weapons could include F-22 stealth aircraft and a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The two neighbours remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Southern League Division East: Hayes & Yeading United 0 AFC Dunstable 2
An inspired first half performance by goalkeeper Jamie Head laid the foundation for AFC Dunstable's superb 2-0 win over one of their promotion rivals on Saturday.
The visiting stopper was called into action early on, making a one-handed reflex stop, and then a fantastic double save on 16 minutes.
AFC were finding it hard to make any inroads into the Hayes back-line, but slowly they started to force some corners.
From one of these set-pieces, the visitors took the lead after 22 minutes.
The ball was cleared to Bill Morgan, whose overhead kick found BJ Christie and although his first effort was blocked on the line, he made no mistake from the rebound.
This didn't seem to concern Hayes too much though as Head was forced to make another couple of saves to preserve the lead.
The second period looked like it was going to follow in the same vein as the first, Head soon called into action again.
With the wind at their backs though, AFC finally started to settle down, as Christie was denied on the hour mark.
Head was still being kept busy at the other end, earning his star man tag when he pushed away another effort.
With the game on a knife-edge, Christie got his second with 10 minutes remaining, a neat passing interchange between Christian Tavernier and Jermaine Hall saw Hall slip in Christie who held off his marker to slot home.
The result saw Steve Heath's side stay third, seven points clear of Hayes now and this afternoon, they visit leaders AFC Rushden & Diamonds.
Right now, the state of Google's music streaming services is a bit of a mess. Google Play Music is the company's most notable player, but you can also listen to tunes and watch music videos via YouTube Red. If you're on mobile, you can separately download the YouTube Music app that also comes with a Play Music/YouTube Red subscription. This jumble of services isn't the easiest to understand, and to fix this, Google might replace them with YouTube Remix.
This is a rumor that first popped up back in December, but according to a new report from Droid Life, it's said that Google will shut down Play Music following the launch of YouTube Remix. It's unknown how quickly the domino effect will happen, but users will reportedly be forced off of Play Music by the end of the year.
It's unclear at this time if playlists, liked songs, and saved local files will transfer over to YouTube Remix, but I've got to imagine Google's got some sort of system in place for making the transition as seamless as possible.
If YouTube Remix replaces Play Music, what'll happen to YouTube Red?
YouTube began signing deals with record labels for Remix towards the end of 2017, and just before this year's SXSW, a representative from the company confirmed the service was in the works but wouldn't launch in March (which it clearly didn't).
If YouTube Remix will replace Play Music, does that mean YouTube Red will stick around? What about YouTube Music? I personally think Google's best bet would be to kill off the YouTube Music app entirely and just house Play Music and YouTube Red's offerings under the new YouTube Remix branding, but they could also choose to go an entirely different route. This is Google we're talking about after all.
Google I/O is set to begin on Tuesday, May 8, and in my eyes, that's as good a place as any for Google to officially unveil what it's been working on.

Re: Sometimes hockey isn't fair, Arthur, June 13
Sometimes hockey isn't fair, Arthur, June 13
It would have been nice for a relatively new team to win its first Stanley Cup but I had no vested interest in the outcome. I wasn't rooting for either the Preds or the Pens.
I was surprised that Bruce Arthur wore his heart so prominently on his sleeve in his disappointment that Nashville not only lost but in the way they lost: a blown call by the referee. Calls such as this — an early whistle to negate a Nashville goal — may be more significant in a playoff game, but they happen all the time.
For Mr. Arthur to blame this call for the outcome of the game excludes the fact the Predators had a four-minute power play, 90 seconds of which were with a five-on-three advantage. Nashville's failure to capitalize on that opportunity was the turning point in the game, not the garbage goal that eventually won the Cup.

São Paulo (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) took another step on Wednesday in negotiations that could give the Chinese their first refining capacity in the Americas.
FILE PHOTO: Brazil's state-run Petrobras oil company headquarters is pictured in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 14 2017. REUTERS/Sergio Moraes/File photo
The companies announced in a Brazilian securities filing that they had signed a letter of intent advancing talks for a partnership to finish the Comperj refinery near Rio de Janeiro and a “participation” of CNPC in the offshore Marlim oil field.
The joint announcement confirms an April report by Reuters that said the companies were working out a deal involving a CNPC investment at Comperj in exchange for a stake in the offshore Campos Basin and rights to use the refinery.
The talks highlight rising Chinese interest in the Brazilian energy sector, which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocks as the government lowers barriers to foreigners.
The companies did not offer further details and said the implementation of the partnership will depend on the success of final negotiations.
“This strategic partnership will strengthen ties between the companies and will contribute to deepen the global strategic partnership between Brazil and China,” the filing said.
In November, Pedro Parente, then chief executive of the Brazilian oil firm known as Petrobras, touted a 196 meter oil column discovered in the Marlim field, which he described as the best in the Campos basin.
Petrobras and CNPC have already partnered in the giant Libra oil field off the Brazilian coast since 2013.
Last year, they also partnered to win exploration rights for the Peroba field, another promising deposit in the area known as the pre-salt, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor.
Petrobras has already invested some $13 billion in the Comperj complex, which needs about $3 billion in additional investment to reach an initial capacity of 165,000 barrels per day, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in April.
HONOLULU – The University of Hawai'i men's volleyball team showed off its offensive efficiency in a straight-set win over Academy United on day two of the Waikiki Beachcomber by Outrigger Classic Friday at the Stan Sheriff Center. Set scores were 25-20, 25-16, 25-16.
The match was considered an exhibition but still counted towards tournament play as the Rainbow Warriors (8-1) improved to 2-0 and all but locked up their second title of the season. UH will face Canada's Thompson Rivers (0-2) in Saturday's finale.
Outside hitter Stijn van Tilburg led the way with 12 kills and five blocks while middle blocker Dalton Solbrigadded eight kills and five stuffs. Outside hitter Brett Rosenmeier added nine kills on .533 hitting.
Setter Joe Worsley dished out 40 assists and led the Warriors to a team hitting percentage of .400.
Academy United (1-1), which participates in the National Volleyball Association and features former Warrior Nemanja Komar and Punahou School stars Riley and Maddison McKibbin, were led by former USC outside hitter Tony Ciarelli with 12 kills, hitting .296.
UH scored the first four points of Set 1 but from there it was a battle until the end. The Warriors scored five of the final six points as van Tilburg tallied two of his six kills in the set and middle blocker Patrick Gasmanstuffed Conrad Kaminski on set point.
The Warriors jumped out to a 9-3 lead in Set 2 behind a rocket ace by Parapunov. UH went on to hit .591 in the set and recorded four team blocks while limiting United to .087 hitting.
Set 3 was much like the second as UH led early on 11-4 after a 5-0 run. But Academy rallied back eventually pulling within one at 23-22 before Austin Matautia‘s sixth kill gave the Warriors match point. Solbrig's ace ended the match.
In the first match of the day, Lees-McRae (1-1) outlasted Thompson Rivers, 33-31, 25-27, 25-23, 25-19 in a contest that featured 28 service aces and 61 service errors.
The final day of the tournament features Lees-McRae versus Academy United at 4:00 p.m., followed by UH and Thompson Rivers at 7:00 p.m.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola took a big step towards his first trophy in English football with a 2-1 derby win over Manchester United on Sunday which sent his team 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League.
Guardiola, who won three Spanish league titles and two Champions League crowns during his time with Barcelona and then won three Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich, had faced questions about whether his trademark possession style would work in England.
City finished 15 points behind Chelsea in third place last season but it will take a major collapse for them to not win this season's championship.
“We can play this way in England. People said we couldn't play the way we did in Barcelona in England but it is possible and we did it,” Guardiola said after the victory at Old Trafford.
“I knew that last season. Always I believed we could do it. Everyone can play how they want, that's why football is so beautiful. I'm happy to go to Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford and to beat them in this way,” he said.

“Football is incredible. We spoke about how to play United but never set-pieces offensively, and then we score two. Football is unpredictable,” he said.
Despite the points gap, Guardiola was quick to make clear that the title race was far from over.

“This win means a lot in the way we played for our confidence but in three days we go to Swansea in the winter time. We are going to face a lot of difficulties. In December it's impossible to be champions but it's good for us,” he said.
The Spaniard also responded to comments from his United counterpart Jose Mourinho who had blamed the referee's failure to give his team a penalty for the loss.
“Last season it was the same –- we won here and it was the referee. Today as well. Yesterday he spoke about the referee. We are an honest team. We had 75 percent ball possession, which means we wanted to play. We came here and did that,” he said.
“We won because we were better in all departments”.

An explosion at a commercial building at 11211 Morang near Somerset in Detroit appeared to be a pot-growing operation, said Deputy Fire Commissioner David Fornell. One person was killed, he said.
“The fire chief was on the scene and they're trying to determine what was going on,” said Fornell. “Everything is unfolding right now.”
One fatality was reported, he said. Police closed Morang as they investigated.
Later, at the scene, Capt. Mark Thornton said two people had been in the building before the blast. One person left to move a car and when he got to the vehicle, he told authorities, he heard an explosion, which killed the person inside.
The incident appeared to be “some type of explosion or failure of a settling tank,” Thornton said. He would not explain more or say if it was a marijuana growing operation.
DTE was notified about the blast.
“DTE has been called to the scene to cut service to the location,” said Jennifer Wilt, a DTE spokeswoman.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 14 (APP): Babar S Akbar, a founder member of Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaaf on Tuesday said that Imran Khan who throughout his political life talked about accountability, was now avoiding courts to hide his financial misdeeds.
Akbar said this while talking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court premises after appearing in the case to restrain Election Commission of Pakistan from examining audited accounts of PTI on the allegation of foreign funding to the party.
He said, “I was founder member of the PTI and me and Imran Khan established the party together. PTI was launched in the name of accountability of corrupt people. Now he would not let Imran Khan escape from his own accountability.”
Akbar offered Imran Khan to debate with him on any TV show and he will prove that Imran was running from his own promises which he made with the party.
He said Imran Khan himself said that levelling allegations was an immoral act but now when he approached ECP, PTI chief made baseless charges against him.
He accused Imran Khan of double standards.
Now PTI was afraid of revealing its accounts to hide its
corruption and money trail, he added.

As the Okanagan faces another season of flooding, the City of West Kelowna is getting a pat on the back for its handling of last year's freshet.
The municipality said it is set to receive the American Public Works Association's Exceptional Performance in Adversity Award thanks to a nomination from the Public Works Association of BC.
“The team faced unprecedented challenges as flash flooding caused bridge and road closures and threatened other public infrastructure and private property, followed by historically high Okanagan Lake levels that damaged property all along the city's waterfront,” the city said in a media release.
Watch Below: Global Okanagan's coverage of the 2017 flooding in West Kelowna.

The city said its flood response team worked continuously for a hundred days during the flood threat, and their efforts are winning high praise from West Kelowna's mayor.
“I have seen our crews do tremendous things on a day-to-day basis, but I have never witnessed such perseverance, dedication and grit as I did last year,” Mayor Doug Findlater said.
“Even weeks into the relentless event, when I visited impacted areas, I would see our staff, no doubt tired and stressed, but continuing to work as hard as they did on day one, literally doing everything they could to keep the waters at bay. It was humbling and heartwarming and I am very proud of all involved.”

Fresh off Stop & Shop's announcement that it would partner with online grocery delivery service Instacart, Wegmans Food Markets said Wednesday that it will team up with Instacart as well. The partnership initially will cover a few dozen Wegmans stores.
The new Wegmans service will be available for shoppers in northern Virginia and Maryland. Customers can order from here and have groceries delivered in little as an hour.
The service marks the first time Rochester, New York-based Wegmans is offering same-day delivery for online shoppers and using a private firm rather than an in-house service.
Instacart operates in about 65 markets and is on pace to expand to more than 100 markets by the end of the year.

WASHINGTON - US consumer confidence rose in May, reversing the prior month's modest decline as consumers' mood grew rosier, according to a survey released Tuesday.
The uptick in positive sentiment suggested the world's largest economy was improving in the second quarter of the year but expectations for the near future held steady.
But despite the massive tax cuts in December, fewer respondents felt their incomes were likely to rise in the coming months, according to the Conference Board survey.
The consumer confidence index rose 2.4 points to 128.0, up from April's 125.6, which was revised down. The May result was narrowly better than economists' expectations, the survey showed.
The present situation index rose 4.2 points to 161.7, its highest level since 2001, while expectations for the near term also moved up a token 1.3 points to 105.6.
"Consumers' assessment of current conditions increased to a 17-year high," Lynn Franco, the board's head of economic indicators, said in statement.
However, "Consumers' short-term expectations improved modestly, suggesting that the pace of growth over the coming months is not likely to gain any significant momentum."
The share of respondents saying business conditions were good rose 2.6 points to 38.4 percent but their assessment of the jobs market was mixed: the share saying jobs were "plentiful" rose but so did the share of those saying jobs were "hard to get."
The short-term outlook also was modestly better: those saying conditions would improve fell a half percentage point to 23.6 percent, but those believing conditions would worsen fell 1.5 points to 8.3 percent.
Those expecting more jobs in the coming months rose 1.1 points to 19.7 percent but those anticipating that jobs will be less plentiful also rose six tenths to 13.9 percent.
Consumers were less optimistic about wages: those expecting higher income fell a half a point to 21.3 percent and those expecting wages to fall rose three tenths to 8.2 percent.
Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the 12-month inflation expectations measure rose by three tenths to five percent, the highest since September 2016.
"One monthly increase does not make a trend, and this likely is a response to higher gas prices," he said, adding that the Federal Reserve members "do not want to see a sustained increase in these numbers."
The Fed is widely expected to raise the benchmark interest rate in mid-June for the second time this year, but expects inflation to remain around its two percent target.
MAPUSA: Anjuna police Sunday registered two cases of unnatural death involving tourists from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Even as the exact cause of death is yet to be ascertained, police have not ruled out the possibility of drug overdose.
According to the police, a group of four-five friends had travelled down to Goa on a holiday tour and on Saturday night they had been to Vagator. As they were returning from Vagator, one of them collapsed in the parking area and was subsequently rushed to a private hospital at Anjuna where he was declared brought dead.
The deceased has been identified as Pravin Sundaram, a 28-year-old and a native of Tamil Nadu. Police conducted the panchanama and sent the body to Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC) at Bambolim for autopsy. Police said that the family members of Pravin Sundaram have been informed about the incident.
Sources claimed that on Saturday, the deceased and his friends had attended a rave party. The sources said that the deceased felt uneasy there and later collapsed in the parking area at Vagator.
Another case of unnatural death was reported at Anjuna wherein a youth identified as Abdul, who was rushed to a private hospital by an unknown person and admitted for treatment, died at the hospital. Police have registered a case and are trying to trace the person, who had brought Abdul to the hospital. A source claimed that the deceased was a Kerala native. The body has been sent to the GMC for autopsy.
The viscera of both the bodies will be preserved so that the exact cause of death can be ascertained.
Anjuna police have registered the cases and are further investigating into the matter.
When contacted, Anjuna police inspector Rahul Parab said, “In the first case, we are in the process of recording statements of the deceased's friends regarding what they had consumed and we are awaiting the viscera report knowing the exact cause of death. In case of the second death, we are trying to trace the person, who had brought the deceased.”
Meanwhile, reacting to the unnatural deaths, Water Resource Minister and Siolim MLA, through a video message, expressed his unhappiness and said, “The death of two youth in my constituency is extremely unfortunate. Since day one, I have been raising this issue. The outdoor music parties should be stopped; because of parties such drug-related cases are increasing.” He said that with regard to these cases, he has spoken to Superintendent of Police, North Goa, to stop all such drug-related activities or else police should be held responsible for such cases.
The stars of Netflix's “Stranger Things” have landed big pay increases for the sci-fi drama's upcoming third season.
According to a report in Deadline, the child and adult stars of the series will all make six figures per episode for the coming season. Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, and Caleb McLaughlin, the show's young male stars, are set to make more than $150,000 per episode, according to the report. Millie Bobby Brown, considered the breakout from the first two seasons, is reportedly earning more than three boys. All four reportedly earned $30,000 per episode for the first two seasons.
The two main adult stars, Winona Ryder and David Harbour, are now set to make more than $200,00 per episode, according to the report.
Created by the Duffer Brothers, who return as exec producers and showrunners, “Stranger Things” is coming off another critically acclaimed season. It earned a recent Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for best ensemble in a drama series.
The show is executive produced by the Duffer Brothers, Shawn Levy, Iain Paterson, and Dan Cohen of 21 Laps. Earlier this month, Netflix revealed that Maya Hawke would join the cast as a new co-lead for season three, with Priah Ferguson being promoted to series regular.
ANC NEC member Bheki Cele has launched a blistering attack on the party's secretary-general‚ Ace Magashule‚ and has accused him of destroying the party by saying it introduced him to the Gupta family.
Addressing an ANC rally in Vryheid in northern KwaZulu-Natal to celebrate the ANC's 106th birthday on Saturday‚ Cele said Magashule had said he was introduced to the Gupta family by the ANC when newly-elected NEC leaders were introducing themselves.
“There is one who said he was introduced by the ANC to the Guptas and he happened to be the SG. I have never met a person who was introduced to the Guptas by the ANC. Ace Magashule says he was introduced by the ANC to the Guptas.
“I see why we are going to have a problem. And the problem is going to be that the Guptas have a stranglehold on us. So there is one who was taken on a tray to the Guptas but he does not say what his programme is but now we are beginning to suspect that his programme is to destroy the ANC‚” said Cele.
He also lashed out at Magashule for saying that the newly-elected ANC leadership will be there for five years. Cele said Magashule had made the remarks while addressing ANC members sympathetic to President Jacob Zuma in Pietermaritzburg last Sunday.
“You can't be SG and go to a platform and say that people who have been elected will be there for five years. You need to tell us who are you working for. It's not even two months [since we were elected] and you are already giving us five years. You can't do that without being sent by someone who sent you to destroy the ANC.
“The ANC will defend itself. We want this ANC to live forever and that's why we will defend the leadership that has been elected. Who are you? You attack the body that you have been elected to lead. We promise that five years is going to finish and if there is someone who has to leave‚ it's you‚” said Cele.
The ANC rally in Vryheid is believed to be a response to the one addressed by Magashule in Pietermaritzburg. While ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has been preaching unity within the party‚ it continues to be dogged by divisions in KZN over the formation of a provincial task team (PTT) aimed at unifying the party ahead of the 2019 elections.
The 16-member PTT appointed by Magashule included members of both factions in the province — those who supported former provincial chairman Senzo Mchunu and Sihle Zikalala who defeated him in the contested 2015 elective conference which has since been annulled by the court.
But Mchunu's supporters have rejected the composition of the PTT which is dominated by members of the unlawful Zikalala provincial executive committee which has been suspended by the NEC.
Cele‚ who openly campaigned for Ramaphosa‚ told ANC supporters that the party will not ignore unity and will not stop working for it.
He also called on party supporters to stop wearing T-shirts that promoted factionalism ahead of the ANC elective conference at Nasrec in Johannesburg in December.
“I had said that whoever will win and become ANC president I will be there to support them. I openly said who I supported and I never hid that. Now I have the president. When the president is elected he is our president.”
He said while he was ashamed to be a member of the old ANC NEC “I am not ashamed to be a member of this ANC NEC”.
He said the NEC was dealing with complaints about the composition of the interim provincial task team and encouraged ANC members to choose the names of people they want to be part of it.
“I heard you complained that it is not balanced and that is being dealt with. The provinces should choose the names of the people who should be part of the PTT which will then be sent to the NEC for approval‚” he said.
He also urged members not to be part of those destroying the unity of the ANC.
“If there are people who want to do that let them go.”

With only days left to go before Avengers: Infinity War arrives in theaters, the first critics have finally seen the super-sized Marvel epic from Captain America: Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo. The studio played it close to the vest this time, holding press screenings much later than their average movie to protect spoilers for as long as possible. But not to fear, if you want some spoiler free early reactions, you can check out our round-up of the first social media reviews for the film out of early press screenings.
Overall, the reactions lean toward positive, though there's a bit more middling reactions than you usually get out of the first round of reviews. What everybody seems to agree on is that this is one of the most massive superhero epics ever put on screen, with one of Marvel's best villains and endings. There also seems to a BS a lot of love for the film's humor, which is a bit surprising considering the ominous doomsday tone of the marketing. However, there also seems to be a common thread that the film might be a little too big for its own good, and as the first part of a two-film epic, it will definitely leave folks wanting more.
Infinity War stars Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Josh Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston, and Jeremy Renner. The film is scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and directed by Anthony and Joe Russo.

After 10 years of investment in this series & these characters, boy does #AvengersInfinityWar knock you on your ass. Humor, sky high stakes & a truly overwhelming amount of emotion in it.

I liked #Avengers #InfinityWar more than a lfew other folks I'm talking to after the premiere. It's hugely emotional and very funny but some might find it … I need to sleep on this. — Jim Vejvoda (@JimVejvoda) April 24, 2018
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is basically CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR times 20, except with less hero-on-hero fighting. I think people who loved the airport fight in CIVIL WAR like I did will go nuts for this film, and people who were bored will be 20 times as bored here. #InfinityWar — Tasha Robinson (@TashaRobinson) April 24, 2018

My God. #AvengersInfinityWar was Incredible. Incredible. Incredible. The visuals, the story, the GUTS. The action is non stop, the movie grips you and never lets you go. EVERYONE gets a moment to shine. And that ending…My God that ending…Best film the MCU has ever done! — John Steven Rocha (@TheRochaSays) April 24, 2018
#InfinityWar is everything you want, nothing you expect. It's funny, surprising, dark, filled with delightful interplay between characters never seen on screen before.

INFINITY WAR is exhausting. *Exhausting.* It all just turned into noise for me after a while. But the amazing ending almost made up for the rest of it. And Thanos is a good, sad villain. — Bilge Ebiri (@BilgeEbiri) April 24, 2018
i'm actually still up for the INFINITY WAR social embargo!

I dunno. what a world! — David Sims (@davidlsims) April 24, 2018
#AvengersInfinityWar: #Marvel puts it all on the table and wipes it off. Stress-inducing, full of dread, darker than usual, yet, funny as hell and super entertaining.

From beginning to end, #AvengersInfinityWar is non-stop action. It's really dynamic and jaw-dropping, but at times, it could have stopped for air and give us more substance on plot points.

Anyone who writes a review of #AvengersInfinityWar has their work cut out for them, because you're literally reviewing half a movie.

Beyond the inevitable deaths, the most shocking thing about Avengers: Infinity War is what an unapologetic, full-bore sci-fi movie it is.

AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR has like ten legit “chill down the spine” great moments. But it's for sure the first half of a two part movie and I left a little unsatisfied/frustrated, maybe by design … at least that's how I feel right now three hours later. — Mike Ryan (@mikeryan) April 24, 2018

Before Mario Batali was himself accused of inappropriate conduct in the workplace, he sounded off on the issue — saying there's no room for harassment in the restaurant industry.
The celebrity chef and author had addressed the recent sexual harassment scandals in Hollywood during a media preview last month for Eataly L.A., the new Los Angeles outpost of his Italian marketplace chain.
Batali, who has since stepped down as co-host on ABC's “The Chew” as well as his own businesses, stressed that it's “as much about awareness as it is about training,” and noted that his company provides twice-a-year sexual harassment training for its employees.
“You'd be surprised at how few people recognize the tell-tale signs [of harassment],” Batali said. “You don't want to be drowned by P.C. [political correctness] but you can't have people be deterred from a workplace, like in hospitality, because they were frightened, or intimidated, or disgusted by something that was in the kitchen.”
The website Eater reported Monday that four women have accused him of groping and other inappropriate behavior. In a statement, Batali apologized “to the people I have mistreated and hurt.”
Back at the press preview last month, Batali said the recent developments signal a changing of the guard, not just in the film and TV industries, but in the restaurant industry as well.
“The dinosaurs are going to slowly die off, and the quicker it happens the better it is,” he said, “but it's a tricky time, and we got to be careful, they have to be very careful how they do it. The best way is to just make sure there is no tolerance for any bulls–t in any workplace that you're associated with. Zero.”
In light of the recent allegations, Food Network has also put on hold plans to relaunch “Molto Mario,” the series that made Batali a TV star.
Traveling with a baby for the holidays? First you've got your own gear to worry about, then a stroller, something for the baby to sleep in, a baby carrier, toys, snacks, a diaper bag, possibly a car seat and whatever else the plane might allow you to shove into the overhead compartment or check at the gate. Then you've got to soothe and entertain the little one so everyone on the plane doesn't hate you. the struggle. is. real.
But one startup out of New Mexico hopes to at least take care of the gear portion of your personal travel nightmare. Babierge (think baby+concierge) is a baby gear rental marketplace where, instead of lugging everything around with you from city to city, you can rent baby cribs, strollers and whatever else you'll need from individuals wherever you go.
It's also a way for families, called “trusted partners” to make an extra bit of cash for the baby gear they already have.
It works like this: those needing baby gear log onto the site and choose the destination city they'll be traveling to. From there, you'll see the family willing to rent and the equipment they have to offer listed below. Choose what you need and then select the dates you'll need the equipment. From there you'll see if the gear is available and the total price. If all looks good you can check out and arrange for delivery wherever you may be in town.
It's conceivable the company could go beyond baby gear at some point. This month, some on the site are even offering holiday packages such as delivery of a full-bodied faux pine Christmas tree that comes pre-lit with 300 mini-white & 300 mini-colored lights or a Menorah with candles and matches. However, given the name and focus the site isn't likely to branch out further than a few of these one-offs.
The startup's growth is a testament to a need in the market for this type of platform. According to Babierge co-founder Fran Maier, Babierge has served about 5,000 traveling families this year, fulfilling more than 400 orders during Thanksgiving alone.
The company launched a mere 18 months ago and so far covers more than 100 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Maier also tells TechCrunch Babierge is adding about 5 new markets a week — and all that on very little funding of about $500,000 from friends and family so far.
Of course, activity is going to spike around big family travel days like Thanksgiving and Christmas and Babierge will need to figure out how to sustain sales and revenue throughout the year. It's also seen fast adoption from those wanting to rent their goods in several markets and will likely need more cash to help it safely scale.
Maier told TechCrunch she expects to get to about 6,000 orders by year's end and has considered raising from venture capital or “wood for the fire” for next year.
In a way, the startup is a bit like Airbnb in the early days, but on a niche, baby scale. Still, it's able to learn from those who've gone before and I'm told it does offer liability insurance to ensure no harm comes to either party in the process.
Or perhaps it's more like a Craigslist. Trusted partners choose the pickup and delivery details and list their pictures, emails and phone numbers on the site. Babierge will need to scramble that contact info or create a messaging system to prevent unscrupulous individuals from abuse.
But Babierge says it also offers required safety and cleanliness training for all partners and is a good way for stay-at-home moms to earn a little extra cash for used baby items. The average partner makes about $600 per month, according to the startup.
Overall, it seems like a pretty useful idea and without much competition, excepting one company out of Colorado called Babies Away, which offers similar rental services in about 80 locations throughout the U.S.
“But they haven't changed,” Maier says. Though Babies Away, which has been in business since 199, does offer more equipment on the site.
But it doesn't come with the same personal touch or family friendly feel as Babierge. There's no Christmas tree delivery, for instance.
It's also not geared towards moms hoping to make a few extra bucks on extra gear. Babies Away partners run their shops like a straight up business.
But it's a niche industry, either way. Parents (and grandparents and other family members hosting the parents) don't need to rent gear all the time. Just a few times a year when families are traveling. Still, Babierge fills a definite need for those not wanting to lug their entire nursery with them around this time of year and i'm glad it's around as I'll be joining this special lot in the next few months.

A no-budget indie often demands that the director be his or her own editor—getting two for the price of one. At first blush, one person wearing both hats may seem cost-efficient, but the loss of a second pair of eyes offers no collaborative advantage and is actually a disservice to the film.
Just because you can don't mean that you should. A director can be too close to a project, from concept to production, so an editor provides the much-needed objectivity. After accounting for all the footage actually shot (rather than relying on what a director “remembers”) a veteran editor will open up creative options yet to be considered.
So, does your budget allow for another warm body and a reasonable production schedule? Then here are some traditional protocols and etiquette for a healthy collaborative relationship between director and editor.
Meeting Each Other's Minds
Have you ever experienced a particular incident with a group of people, only to have each person describe it differently afterward? This is because each of us interprets a situation with our own personal set of values, history and experience, and it's something to keep in mind when pairing director and editor. Moviemakers whose creative tastes complement each other are of tremendous aid to any project.
If the old cliché that a film story is told three times is true—first in script, second on set and third in the edit—then a common groove between director and editor is vital, particularly in setting nuances in tone, pacing, subtext and character development. In other words, team up with someone you already hold in high regard. If you respect this person's past work, it shouldn't be a chore to decide on a creative direction on your current project.
The Director's Checklist
Dark room contempt can bloom quickly if a director delivers footage without any regard for the editor. Here is a fairly ubiquitous list of industry expectations.
A few precious seconds between “quiet on the set” and “action” could work wonders for a scene. So get your actors in character and framed up before the camera rolls.
Don't yell “cut” right after the last line. Instead, let it breathe a bit, then Again, there could be some precious frames here.
Get adequate coverage. Don't lock the editor in with your perceived cut.
Be mindful of continuity, especially with medium shots and close-ups, to match the master.
Avoid starting takes on a static shot. Have your actor(s) move into the scene, especially if the editor has to match the previous cut.
Watch out for vectors. If you do cross the line, provide a bridge shot.
After principal photography, head to Maui and stay out of the edit bay. Let the editor have first crack. Trust him or her. Why deny yourself the only opportunity to be surprised and (fairly) objective when seeing your film's first cut? You can always dick around with it later.
The Editor's Checklist
Likewise, a director's patience will wear thin if stuck in an edit suite with someone who is not a creative equal. Consider the following points.
Be passionate about the project. (Do I even need to say this? Yes, I do.)
Even if you have an assistant editor, screen every frame of footage yourself. How else will you find that obscure 10-frame shot that salvages an entire scene?
Check your ego. Defend your work, but take every criticism as an opportunity to create anew.
Treat every revision as challenge to see the number of narratives you can actually create from the same footage (especially beneficial if you're being paid on the clock).
Have access to a good sound effects library and a wide selection of soundtrack scores for rough-cut temps.
Rely on the producer as the neutral in resolving creative differences.
Remember, you're a storytelling creative equal, not a paint-by-numbers tech head. If a director wants to treat you as such, then you have permission to ignore this editor's list and assume the role of button-pusher for the director. (Let the director defend his cut to the financiers.)
It goes without saying that the above checklists assume both director and editor are technically proficient in their craft.
Measuring the Temperament
I would be remiss if I didn't take into account the importance of pairing personalities that are congruous at working long hours in small, dark caves. It's fascinating how subconscious personal habits and quirks reveal themselves over time in a closed environment.
Trust, both creatively and professionally, is a fundamental factor in this partnership. It's like a marriage: Once you've found someone who puts up with your less-desirable traits, you still have to find a way to keep it working. The industry is replete with examples of career-long relationships between director and editor. Starting with those at the top of the food chain: director Steven Spielberg with editor Michael Kahn; director Clint Eastwood with editor Joel Cox; director Lawrence Kasdan with editor Carol Littleton; director Martin Scorsese with editor Thelma Schoonmaker; director Ron Howard with editors Dan P. Hanley and Mike Hill. The list is long and speaks to the strong creative bond between director and editor that's necessary for great cinema to be achieved. When you're lucky enough to find this kind of relationship, you'll want to nurture it. This is a profound alliance with far-reaching implications, and the sooner you find your match, the sooner it will pay off in rich professional dividends. MM

The T-bills Market traded on a slightly bullish note, with demand skewed to the shorter end of the curve, as system liquidity remained significantly buoyant following inflows from N300bn bond maturity.
The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, raised the total amount on offer of N49.60bn at its PMA on Wednesday, May 30, which was moderately over-subscribed (N103.40bn), mostly from non-competitive bidders.
The market expects a slight uptick in yields tomorrow, as we expect the CBN to conduct another OMO auction due to c.N250bn inflows from Maturing OMO bills and Net PMA repayments.
The OBB and OVN rates crashed further to 1.75% and 2.50% respectively, as system liquidity is estimated to have increased significantly to c.N600bn positive, following inflows from today's bond maturity. We expect rates to tick slightly higher tomorrow, as the CBN is expected to intervene in the market via an OMO auction sale.
The Interbank rate remained stable at its previous rate of N305.95/$, even as the CBN's external reserves maintained a steady plunge, down to $47.65bn following continued intervention by the CBN in the various market segments.
Closing Rates in the I&E FX Window as published by the FMDQ has depreciated to a 10-month high of N362.02/$, as the market has remained net short of dollars in the past two weeks.

NEW YORK (AP)  A man with a pipe bomb strapped to him set off the crude device in the subway near Times Square on Monday, injuring the suspect and three other people at the height of the morning rush hour.
The man and three others were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries in what the mayor and police labeled an attempted terror attack.
The explosion happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. The 7:30 a.m. blast caused smoke to fill the passageway, which was crowded with throngs of Monday morning commuters.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner James P. ONeill labeled it an attempted terror attack.

Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve his ultimate goals, de Blasio said.
The suspect was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah.
Law enforcement officials said he was inspired by the Islamic State group but had apparently not had any direct contact with the group. The officials said he lives in Brooklyn and may be of Bangladeshi descent. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.
Authorities said the bomb was a low-tech explosive device attached to the man with Velcro and plastic ties. They were investigating how it was made.
A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with his shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering his bare midriff. A police officer is holding the mans hands behind his back.
The explosion triggered a massive emergency response by police and firefighters both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal.
Fire officials said the suspect had burns to his hands and abodmen. The others who were injured suffered ringing in ears and headaches.
Elrana Peralta, a customer service worker for Greyhound, said she works in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened, but didnt hear the explosion.
All we could hear was the chaos, she said. We could hear people yelling, Get out! Get out! Get out!
John Miles, 28, from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. He also didnt hear the blast, but saw police react.
I didnt know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out, he said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. They didnt incite panic. It was fairly orderly.
Video from above the Crossroads of the World showed lines of police and emergency vehicles, their lights flashing, lining the streets and no other vehicle traffic moving.
Everything around the Port Authority area was shut down  a surreal scene of still at what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour.
New Jersey Transit buses headed to the Port Authority were diverting to other locations. NJ Transit said buses were taking passengers to Secaucus and Hoboken, where they could take trains into the city.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the explosion.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Andrew Luck was eager to get back to work Monday. Hes still not sure when hell be start throwing passes.
Three months after undergoing shoulder surgery, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback showed up for opening day of offseason workouts looking fit, trim and minus the sling hed been wearing to protect his right arm.
I am where the physical therapists, trainers and doctors say I am. Im not going to worry about it., Luck said, declining to provide a timetable for his expected return. I have full trust in the guys helping me out. I want to play, I want to play, but Im not going to worry about it.
Team officials have already said they dont expect Luck to participate in much  if any  on-field drills between now and the end of Junes three-day mini-camp.

The hope is Luck will be healthy enough to return to action for the start of training camp. And theres little doubt the Colts will be patient after watching their franchise player endure two straight injury-plagued seasons.
Luck acknowledged Monday for the first time that his physical woes began at Tennessee in Week 3 of the 2015 season. Luck led the Colts to a come-from-behind win that day to avoid a 0-3 start, but the most indelible image from the game was the sideline video of then backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck tapping Luck on the chest. Luck winced in pain.
Over the next four weeks, Luck downplayed the injury, though he had the first two missed games of his career.
He wound up missing nine games that season, the last seven with a lacerated kidney, before opting for rehab over surgery.
Last year, the Colts thought they could keep Luck on the field with extra time off during the week. At times it helped, but the pain eventually returned and the continued ailments prompted Luck to choose surgery after last season.
There were times when, yeah, you play through pain, and there are times when you feel great. Ive played through pain every year, Luck said. It was a little different beast (last year) in that my practice schedule was different and altered. And there were times during the year where I would get hit in an awkward way, and it would hurt.
Until Luck is ready to go, Scott Tolzien and Stephen Morris will run plays. They are the only other quarterbacks on Indys roster.
The problem is that Lucks spring absence could hurt the Colts in the fall because this is when he normally tries to get in sync with familiar faces and newcomers .
Ill just let him know that Im accountable knowing the plays, knowing that Im a smart player, recently signed receiver Kamar Aiken said Monday. Its letting him know Im locked into the plays and when its time for him to get back on the field, Im ready to go.
Luck isnt the only Colt coming back from injuries.
Left guard Jack Mewhort and defensive end Kendall Langford both finished last season on injured reserve with bad knees. Both said they felt pretty good Monday, though its unclear how much work theyll do before training camp.
Defensive tackle Henry Anderson, who wasnt the same after coming back from a torn ACL in his right knee last year, said Monday hes more confident in cutting on his right leg this year.
Coach Chuck Pagano was not available Monday. General manager Chris Ballard is scheduled to take questions Wednesday.
But the biggest questions surround Luck  and right now there arent many answers.
At first, its a little weird, especially when youre in a sling, thats really odd. But once youre in a routine, its like anything else, youre in a routine, Luck said. It was my decision, ultimately. The team gave me all the resources I felt like I needed to make the best decision, and I have no regrets about having surgery.
NOTES: The Colts announced Monday that receiver Quan Bray and tight end Erik Swoope have signed their free-agent tenders. Both were exclusive rights free agents.

Chinese company copies BMW Isetta Enlarge Photo
Chinese companies have a track record for copying other automakers. Porsches, Hondas, and even tires often have knockoff alter egos in the country. The latest digs deeper into the past, however. Eagle, a Chinese carmaker, has blatantly copied the iconic BMW Isetta, Cars News China reported Tuesday.
The Isetta was built between 1956 and 1962, and its design oozes the time period. Eagle decided to give the "bubble car" a modern update with new sheet metal, but the same hard-to-miss shape. However, the body doesn't extend over the rear wheel partially like the original BMW Isetta.
Eagle's car, which it calls the EG6330K, doesn't feature front-opening doors, or a gasoline engine at that. Instead, four traditional doors are in place and an all-electric powertrain scoots the tiny car around. A 72 kilowatt-hour lead-acid battery provides—wait for it—5 horsepower. The battery pack will propel the car for 87 miles before needing a recharge if it's any consolation for the lack of power.
The report said Eagle is targeting younger buyers with the retro design, but will also pitch the EG6330K to elderly drivers who may want to downsize into a smaller car.
The small footprint and tiny electric powertrain will make the Isetta knockoff quite affordable, though. Eagle priced the car at around $4,000.
The former head of the Michigan Department of of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth is making a run for his fathers seat in Congress.
Andy Levin, D-Bloomfield Township, made the announcement following U.S. Rep. Sander Levins decision to retire after 35 years in Congress. Currently, Levin joins three others in seeking to fill Michigans 9th Congressional District seat.
Levin said its time to unite around policies that raise living standards for working people.
We need a new movement focused on creating good jobs, education and training, protecting our air and water, and restoring faith in our government, said Levin.

Levin, founder and president of the Lean and Green Michigan Property Assessed Clean Energy Program (PACE), worked with the county to develop its own PACE program, which offers flexible financing options for businesses that want to implement green energy infrastructure.
The new program, implemented a year ago, encourages businesses to increase their energy efficiency and renewable energy systems.
From 2010-2011, Levin directed the states working training program and created No Worker Left Behind, the largest job retaining program in the country. The program provided training to 152,000 Michiganders during the great recession.
Congressman Sander Levin said in a statement Dec. 2 that its been an incredible honor to serve the people of Michigan. Following his departure from Congress, Levin will join The University of Michigans Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.
I have tried to live up to the trust given to me by my constituents by following the values of my parents and family and by acting on what I believe after digging deeply into the facts and consulting broadly, said Levin. I now want to share these same values in ways other than being an elected official.

Islamabad - The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has directed the higher education institutions to uphold academic standards in order to ensure quality education and fulfilment of all requisite criteria in quantitative and qualitative terms.
In a letter issued to vice Chancellors, rectors and directors of all public and private universities here Tuesday, the HEC has expressed its serious concern regarding certain universities which announce admissions and admit students three-to-four times a year. They even enrol fresh students in summer programmes which are meant only for the improvement of courses and fulfilment of deficiency.
The letter reads, “As per policy, any educational institute can admit student's maximum twice in one academic year i.e. Spring and Fall sessions. It is neither allowed as per policy nor administratively and physically viable to run more than two academic sessions in one year,” the letter explains.
It advises all the universities to refrain from enrolling students more than twice in an academic year, and instead advertise and enrol students in spring and fall sessions as per HEC semester system guidelines.
Referring to financial regulations, the HEC has further advised universities to maintain proper and dedicated bank accounts for fee transactions of students.
Universities have been urged to ensure all fee transactions through official bank accounts instead of collecting fee in cash or through any other method.
Many universities have been issuing academic transcripts to students from its principal seat without mentioning the actual institution from where the students completed their education.
The letter emphasizes that due diligence must be exorcized in issuance of degrees and transcripts and HEC-prescribed semester guidelines be complied with in letter and spirit before issuing any transcript or Detailed Marks Certificate to students.
“All transcripts must reflect the actual place of study of the students accurately to save the students from inconvenience during their degree verification process,” the letter underlines.
ISLAMABAD - A Senate Select Committee yesterday approved the Right to Information (RTI) Bill 2016.
The committee met with its Chairman Senator Farhatullah Babar in the chair at the Parliament House and discussed all clauses of the draft bill in detail.
It also added a new clause relating to get footage from CCTV installed at public places. The clause was suggested by PTI Senator Shibli Fraaz.
In its previous, the committee decided that the proposed Information Commission would consist of three members — a grade 22 officers, a retired judge and a representative of civil society. The PM will have the authority of the appointment of three members of commission. The Senate and National Assembly Standing Committees will have power to remove the members. The commission members age limit has been capped at 65-year at the time of appointment.
It was also decided in the meeting that the RTI Bill 2016 will not be applied to 20 years old record.
The committee had decided the appointment of staff above grade 16 in Information Commission would be made through Federal Public Service Commission, instead of Chief Information Commissioner and Commissioners.
Talking to the media after the meeting, Farhatullah Babar said that the common persons will be able to get access to information through this bill. He said that parts of information could not be made public in the name of national security. He said if the security agencies arrest a citizen and kill him, it will not be considered an issue of the national security. The Bill will be helpful in case of missing persons.
Minister of State for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb told the media that the government, parliamentary committees, lawyers and members of civil society made a sterling contribution to the draft bill that would be presented in the next session of the parliament for formal enactment of the law.
She said that the law regarding access to information and democracy were inseparable as they reinforced each other.
The bill seeks to ensure transparency in all areas of government responsibility and betterment in governance. This law is already in force in some provinces.
The minister reiterated that the Information Commission contemplated to be set up under the proposed law would be an independent and autonomous body. She however pointed out that the Access to Information Bill would accord protection to the matters related to national security and interests as well as those that could affect Pakistan's relations with other countries. Senators Syed Shibli Faraz, Rubina Khalid, Pervaiz Rashid, Ilyas Bilour, Mushahidullah Khan, Mukhtiar Ahmed Damrah Ejaz and Javed Abbasi also attended the meeting.

Plus, two state troopers monitoring Saturday's mayhem were killed when their helicopter crashed. Dozens of others were injured in the clashes between white supremacist groups and those who came to protest against them. The Ohio man who was behind the wheel of the car that plowed into the crowd is charged with second-degree murder. Twenty year old James Fields is expected in court later on today to be arraigned.
HAPPY ENDING: Basil has found his forever home after spending 16 months in the Coffs Harbour RSPCA shelter.
HAPPY ENDING: Basil has found his forever home after spending 16 months in the Coffs Harbour RSPCA shelter. Rachel Vercoe
AT just six years old, Basil the lovable and well-known greyhound has spent 16 months of his life in the Coffs Harbour RSPCA shelter, but now he's found his forever home.
With tears in their eyes and joy in their hearts, the staff were overjoyed when they found the lanky canine a home with a family who knows and loves greyhounds.
His new master had his eye on Basil for months and when he heard there was an adoption drive on at the weekend, he decided to bring in his greyhound to meet Basil.
The rest is now history.
"We're hoping the promotion of Basil leads pet lovers of the Coffs Coast to being more open to greyhound adoption,” said RSPCA NSW senior manager Eliza Walker.
"Like any breed they have their quirks, but they really do make wonderful companions for a wide range of families and age groups.”
In February last year, The Advocate reported on greyhounds at the RSPCA desperate for homes, including Basil, who was at risk of becoming a permanent fixture at the shelter.
Fourteen months on and Basil has been rehomed.
"There's a longstanding stigma that there's a time limit on how long we hold animals which are looking for homes - this is simply not the case,” Eliza said.
"Once an animal is deemed suitable for adoption, we spend hundreds of dollars preparing each animal.”
The writer-director Paul Schrader has gotten some of the most ecstatic reviews of his career for “First Reformed,” and though I'm not in the rapturous/masterpiece camp about it (I think he's made much better movies, like “Affliction” and “Auto Focus”), I agree with the praise more than not. The movie, which stars Ethan Hawke as an upstate New York minister who is undergoing a crisis of faith/health/isolation/midlife woe, is an austerely unabashed and compelling oddball, a pastiche of “Diary of a Country Priest” and “Winter Light” and what you might call the Schrader Paradigm, the one derived from “The Searchers” that he used (and made iconic) in his screenplay for “Taxi Driver,” and then in “Hardcore” and “Light Sleeper”: the loner who goes down a blood trail of redemption, trying to rescue a ravaged maiden who was taken by the forces of sin but remains, in his mind, unspoiled.
That said, there's an additional component to “First Reformed” that, I think, accounts for some of the cartwheels that critics have done over it. The picture is a gravely absorbing cinematic-spiritual journey, but it's also a message movie about environmental catastrophe in which the hero, emerging from his dour despair, begins to find a purpose in becoming radicalized. He gooses himself awake, and by the time the film reaches its nutty inspired climax, this somberly cautious and reflective man is flirting with strapping on a suicide vest. For a lot of indie-film buffs who consider themselves social justice warriors, that's close to a feel-good ending.

Environmental message movies are, of course, a dime a dozen, but “First Reformed” is a sophisticated art-pulp fantasy that leads you, almost through a trap door, into the new mood of what might be called environmental fundamentalism. The film embraces the idea that the world as we know it isn't just spoiled — it's heading toward the apocalypse, and if we don't do something about it we're all guilty. Extreme action is required.
The notion that we're now counting down the clock to the collapse of civilization, all because of man-made damage to the earth, isn't new to movies; it's the premise of every dystopian sci-fi film since “Blade Runner.” What's different, and provocative, about “First Reformed” is that Schrader introduces these sentiments by handing them to a character whom the film presents, quite overtly, as depressed and disturbed and (as a consequence) warped in his vision. His name is Michael (Philip Ettinger), and in a scene that's a quiet tour de force of acting and filmmaking and perception, he sits down with Hawke's Reverend Toller and explains his agony.
The environment, says Michael, may now be too ruined to salvage. In his twitchy compulsive way, he offers facts, statistics, geophysical realities — all the evidence on the subject that informed people confront and absorb every day. Michael, though, lives each moment with a heightened fear and awareness of what he views as the impending disaster, surrounding himself with evidence of it, drowning himself in it. The result is that he wants his wife, Mary (Amanda Seyfried), to abort the child she's carrying.
Here's a question, one that is built, I think, into the very nature of a character who's so alienated that he “won't bring another child into this world.” The question is: Who is less on the side of life? People who exist in denial of today's environmental crisis? Or those who are so out of denial that they believe we should stop perpetuating the human race?
I don't think I'm alone in saying that a character like Michael (we've all met them) is the greater life denier. The very fact that he's the only one who can see the truth is, in itself, an expression of his pathology. He views himself as an enlightened activist, but he's also a messianic narcissist who has figured out a way to make climate change all about him.
Toller counsels Michael by saying what a lot of us would say: that despite the ravages to the environment that the human race has caused, all hope is not lost; that the future, as of now, is not so predictable; that mankind has always had to transcend the darkness; and that giving in to despair is, in itself, a form of death. (Not to mention the fact that the price of renewable energy sources has begun to lead, rather than follow, this struggle.)
Paul Schrader, I think, believes all these things. Yet in “First Reformed,” there's a way in which he wants to have his over-the-cliff left-wing despair and eat it too. The Reverend Toller has major problems of his own: He sent his son to the Iraq War (the son was killed, which broke up the reverend's marriage), and he's been suffering for five months from a stomach ailment that is very likely cancer. By the second half of the movie, he's drinking cocktails of whiskey and Pepto-Bismol — and more to the point, he's searching for a mission to restore his sense of self. The disaster of the environment provides it. Instead of luring Michael back from the spiritual dead zone of radical absolutism, Toller begins to see the war for the planet's future as his own war, and as the church's. The power of “First Reformed” is that it's a fever dream in which Toller passes through the looking glass of apocalyptic progressive belief.
As a lifelong leftist about the environment, I, of all people, should be the target demo for Toller's transformation, and should have incredible sympathy for it. Yet watching “First Reformed,” it was hard for me to escape the feeling that the movie is indulging in a form of radical chic. As Michael demonstrates, this kind of thinking can evolve into an addiction, and in recent years some very smart people have become addicted to it — like Jonathan Franzen, who has argued that the raw science now renders it an incontrovertible fact that climate change has passed beyond the point where it can ever be reversed. He argues that we're all, more or less, just sitting around waiting for the end times. The nihilistic environmental “policies” of our current president (more coal! more fracking! f—k the Paris climate accord!) would seem to be evidence that the doomsday arguments mounted by Franzen, or by the professional environmental scold Bill McKibben, must be heard and heeded. And maybe they must.
Yet extremism, as “First Reformed” reminds us, creates its own vortex of destruction. Michael turns out to be an eco-terrorist who passes the virus of his beliefs onto the Reverend Toller, and as Toller's own crisis grows more flamboyant, he mirrors the arc of implosion experienced by Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver.” Part of the hypnotic amoral quality of that film is that it asks us to form an almost trancelike identification with Travis's descent and, at the same time, to stand back and realize that we're seeing a sociopath complete his withdrawal from the human race. That's the spooky beauty of “You talkin' to me?” The in that cocky question (improvised by Robert De Niro) is just about anyone in the world who's not Travis.
More or less the only character that doesn't apply to is Jodie Foster's Iris, the child prostitute Travis is out to save because, in his madness, that's become his way of saving himself. In “First Reformed,” the equivalent of the Jodie Foster character — who was Schrader's inferno-of-the-streets update of Natalie/Lana Wood's kidnapped and ravaged girl in “The Searchers” — is, in an odd way, not a person at all but a phenomenon: the fate of the earth. The environment. That's the fair maiden that is now being ravaged, and that Toller, ravaging his own body with metal thorns (and maybe bombs), must rescue. The end of the movie, which is gonzo and brilliant, fuses Bresson and Bergman with “Vertigo” and Schrader's own elevated exploitation-film extravagance. The difference, and it's a crucial one, is that this is a Travis Bickle who stands for ideas that the movie has come to embrace. Even though it should know better.

Watch Ghanaian-born, former France football captain, Marcel Desailly on the maiden edition of Sports Check with GhanaWeb's Sports Editor, Daniel Oduro.
The two-time UEFA Champions League winner and FIFA World Cup winner opens up about what he has been doing since his retirement from football a little over a decade ago.
Marcel Desailly who has set up the magnificent Lizzy Sports Complex in East Legon, Accra says Ghana needs a lot of private investors to help provide modern and state of the art sporting facilities in the country.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hundreds of tourists in New Zealand were left stranded on Friday after a strong storm damaged roads, uprooted trees and felled power lines.
Former Tropical Cyclone Fehi this week has brought heavy rain that flooded the southern city of Dunedin and west coast town of Buller, forcing authorities to declare a state of emergency and ask people not to travel by road.
New Zealand authorities said the adverse weather has damaged a major road around Haast, 426 km (265 miles) northwest of Dunedin, leaving hundreds of tourists stranded in the town.

“There are at least 600 tourists in Haast and we are undertaking a welfare assessment of their needs,” Westland District Council said in an emailed statement.
Authorities said work on repairing the damage was underway but were unable to say when the tourists would be able to see the small costal town.
New Zealand's weather forecaster Metservice said on Friday the storm was moving southeast, providing some relief to the country's west coast, which has been the hardest hit by the heavy rain and strong winds.
NEW YORK, NY (April 17, 2017) /PRNewswire/ — Inimitable and irrepressible , Black Death Vodka returns to the on- and off-premise across the United States this month as it ramps up in New York and New Jersey and starts with distribution on the West Coast.
Launched globally in 1987, by 1995 Black Death Vodka was selling more than 120 million bottles and cans in over 60 countries. It had won over 30 medals in International competitions and became the preferred vodka among the rock music elite. After being attacked by the then-Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Black Death Vodka went underground in the late 1990's.
“Now is the right time for Black Death to return,” comments Bob Miller, Chief Commercial Officer for Black Death Drinks. “On our first rodeo in the 1990's people really were not as mentally liberated as they are now. Today, almost everybody has a personal opinion they are not afraid to air and tattoos and skulls are mainstream, whereas in the 1990's they were symbols of rebellion and angst. We have been copied hundreds of times as other brands try to capitalize on our image. Black Death Vodka has an incredible history and the authenticity of who we are and what we stand for making it the perfect time to return to the States.”
Black Death Vodka traces its origins back to 1906, in Siglunes in the North of Iceland. The ancestors of Valgeir T. Sigurðsson fished, raised livestock, and traded their “Moonshine” with passing boats. To keep warm in the cold winters the family would drink the Moonshine they distilled which soon became a favorite of visiting sailors. This popular Moonshine would eventually, after much refinement deliver the recipe for Black Death Vodka. Sigurdsson's signature still appears on each bottle as a guarantee of authenticity and a testament to the quality of the product.
“Beyond our Icelandic roots, the soul of Black Death is about our place in recent history. We were the first spirit to have a manufacturers warning, the first to communicate Don't Drink and Drive, the first to use curvy girls, gay people and transvestites in our ads, the first beverage to support disabled persons, the first to run ads in communist countries saying we stand against communism and the first spirit brand to run ads supporting the worldwide fight against AIDS,” Miller added.
“We encourage respect, tolerance peace and freedom of choice. We stand against racism, radicalism, intolerance, and all who needlessly harm others and we are the first alcohol brand to believe in our message enough to put it on our label and cap,” he concluded.
Black Death Vodka will initially be made available in the New York metropolitan and New Jersey markets with a suggested retail price of $19.99 per 750ml bottle.

The cluster of stars is surrounded by clouds of interstellar gas and dust — the raw materials for the creation of new stars, NASA said.
The nebula, located 20,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Carina, contains a central cluster of huge, hot stars, called NGC 3603, the space agency said.
"Appearing colorful and serene, this environment is anything but," NASA said. "Ultraviolet radiation and violent stellar winds have blown out an enormous cavity in the gas and dust enveloping the cluster."
Most of the stars in the cluster were "born" around the same time but have different colors, temperatures, sizes and mass, NASA said. The cluster includes stars at various stages of their lives, giving scientists a chance to perform detailed analysis of stellar life cycles.
"NGC 3603 also contains some of the most massive stars known," NASA said. "These huge stars live fast and die young, burning through their hydrogen fuel quickly and ultimately ending their lives in supernova explosions."
Star clusters give scientists important clues to help them understand the origin of massive stars, the space agency said.
"Astronomers also use massive clusters to study the distant starbursts that occur when galaxies collide, igniting a flurry of star formation," NASA said.
The relative closeness of NGC 3603 to Earth "makes it an excellent lab for studying such distant and momentous events," NASA said.

We now know the Galaxy Note 9 will be unveiled at an event in New York City on August 9, and that gets all of our wheels turning thinking about the possibilities of what we can expect and whether it's worth waiting for. For Samsung fans looking to make the move to a new phone, there really are two options: buy a Galaxy S9+ today, or wait for the Galaxy Note 9. Let us help you down the path of choosing which one is right for you, and whether you should wait it out. Who should buy a Galaxy S9+ now
The Galaxy S9+ has a massive advantage here: it's actually available to buy. The Note 9 will likely be available to pre-order about a week after announcement, but retail availability will probably take a week more, meaning we're still well off from having a true head-to-head comparison here. Smartphone fans may be willing to wait for a specific phone to come out, but you may not be so flexible. If you need a phone right now, don't try to scrape by for a month and a half with a broken phone (for example) just to get the Note 9 — pick up a Galaxy S9+ and you'll be happy. Unless you have a strong affinity for the Note line, just get a Galaxy S9+ now. Now we don't know exactly what the Galaxy Note 9 will offer in terms of specs or features yet, but we can make an educated guess based on previous releases. We can count on the Note 9 to basically match the GS9+ in terms of internal specs, with the same processor, RAM and storage options — though the base storage may bump up to 128GB, that isn't really an advantage considering the GS9+ has that option already. The screen will likely be a little bigger, but keep the same resolution — and the Galaxy S9+'s screen is fantastic still no matter what. The cameras are likely to be the same or ever-so-slightly tweaked for a new feature. The software will also be similar, since Samsung typically reserves the Galaxy S release to debut altogether new software designs and features. So really, the core of the Note 9 experience will just be the same as the Galaxy S9+. That bodes well for Note fans, because they're getting a preview of how great their next phone will be, but it's also good for anyone who just wants a Samsung phone now — you won't be missing out on much. If you don't have any affinity for the Galaxy Note line, it makes the decision even easier to just buy a Galaxy S9+ now and start enjoying your new phone. The Note 9 promises to be even more expensive than the GS9+ as well, so you'll save some money in the process. Reasons to wait for the Galaxy Note 9
Premier Doug Ford has halted new anti-vaping rules so his fledgling Progressive Conservative government can get a handle on the impact of health measures that have affected medical cannabis users. “The changes to the Smoke Free Ontario Act that were set to come into effect on July 1 … are being paused to give the new government the opportunity to carefully review the new regulations related to vaping,” Ford's spokesman Simon Jefferies said Wednesday.
Former premier Kathleen Wynne introduced laws that banned the smoking and vaping of medicinal cannabis in all enclosed public places, workplaces and many outdoor areas. ( Nam Y. Huh / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS file photo )
Jefferies said the move will allow the new government to “work with the public, experts, and businesses to re-examine the evidence related to vaping as a smoking-cessation tool to ensure that any changes are in the best interests of everyone and protect Ontarians' health and safety.” “The current provisions in the Smoke Free Ontario Act and the Electronic Cigarettes Act remains in effect and will continue to be enforced,” he said. Ontario's vaping industry, which claims there are 900,000 users in the province, hailed Ford.

“We're excited that the government led by Premier Doug Ford and new Health Minister Christine Elliott (has) recognized our efforts and (has) paused the implementation of these regulations,” said Maria Papaioannoy-Duic of Vapor Advocates of Ontario. “We have the utmost confidence that they are going to look at the regulations based on science and not guesswork,” said Papaioannoy-Duic, who argued that vaping is safer than smoking and is an effective way to wean smokers off tobacco. The Canadian Vaping Association's president Shaun Casey said “the provincial regulations need to align with Health Canada's stance on vaping as a less harmful alternative to smoking to ensure the industry is clear on the legal expectations from both levels of government.” “We are working towards a framework of regulations that keep vapour products accessible to adult smokers looking to support harm-reduction through specialty shops where they can safely sample products and receive training on their devices from experts in an adult-only environment.” Former premier Kathleen Wynne, whose Liberals were toppled by Ford's Tories in the June 7 election, introduced tough new laws that banned the smoking and vaping of medicinal cannabis in all enclosed public places, workplaces, and many outdoor areas. A ban on selling e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 19 took effect on Jan. 1, 2016, but other measures were to take effect last Sunday.

"I think that he's been trying to play through something that's been very problematic in terms of mechanics, being able to swing properly, all those types of things," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "It's taken away some of his aggressiveness as a base runner and a defender to some degree.
"If we're going to get going in the right direction, he's going to be a part of it and we want to make sure we get him back on track. We think taking a little break, maybe getting that foot re-examined to make sure that there are no changes in how he has healed to this point."
Santana threw 59 pitches over 3 1/3 innings in a Tuesday start for Class A Fort Myers, allowing one run and two hits, in his second minor league rehab start with Class A Fort Myers at Clearwater.
Molitor said they are pulling Santana off his rehab because he is dealing with swelling.
"We want to get him back to the surgeon and make sure that we're doing the right things as far as how we're bringing him along," Molitor said.
"We're going to get it examined again, get some more pictures and see, and put together some kind of plan again over the next 10 days and see where it takes us, but I don't know exactly how it's going to go. I think it'll somewhat be determined by what we learn getting it re-examined."
Santana went 16-8 with a 3.28 ERA in 33 starts last season. The 35-year-old is in the final year of a four-year $55 million contract with the Twins.
Minnesota recalled right-hander Aaron Slegers from Triple-A Rochester, where he was 5-2 with a 3.27 ERA. The 6-foot-10 rookie went 0-1 with a 6.46 ERA in four appearances last year with the Twins.

The Houston Astros placed catcher Brian McCann on the disabled list Monday with a sore right knee.

Max Stassi was recalled from Triple-A Fresno to join Juan Centeno as options behind the plate for Houston.
CHARLESTON, S.C. — The same jury that last month unanimously found Dylann Roof guilty in the slayings of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church is returning to court to begin contemplating his punishment.
With the 22-year-old representing himself, the process is sure to be unconventional. But even if Roof is sentenced to death, it's highly unlikely he'd be executed anytime soon.
While prosecutors plan to call up to 38 people related to the nine people killed and three who survived the June 2015 slaughter during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, Roof said last week he plans on calling no witnesses and presenting no evidence.
Roof was found guilty last month on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion. A jury took less than three hours to return its verdict, and a judge dismissed the jury for a break over the holidays.
Typically in what's known as the sentencing phase, defence attorneys call relatives and other witnesses to testify about their client's unsteady state of mind before and during the crimes. Given that background, the defence hopes, a jury might be more likely to spare the defendant's life and opt against the death penalty.
But Roof, who is acting as his own attorney, has said he plans to do no such thing.
In his journal, which was read in court during his trial, Roof said his doesn't believe in psychology, which he called “a Jewish invention” that “does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don't.”
Roof also seems to be determined to try to keep evidence embarrassing to him or his family out. Not only did he take over his own defence, but he asked the judge at a hearing Wednesday if he could file a motion limiting what prosecutors can introduce.
Roof also was adamant that a transcript of a hearing where he was found mentally competent not be released to the public.
“I know this is not a legal argument, but the unsealing of the competency hearing defeats the purpose of me representing myself,” Roof said at last week's hearing.
Neither Roof, nor U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel nor prosecutors have given specifics on the evidence Roof is objecting to.
On Thursday, Gergel ordered another competency evaluation of Roof “in an abundance of caution,” after his standby counsel filed a sealed motion again questioning Roof's mental ability to proceed. The judge's order specified he saw no reason to delay Tuesday's start of the penalty phase.
On Monday, over the objection of an attorney representing media outlets including The Associated Press, Gergel ordered the competency hearing to be closed to the public. Saying he'd have to sequester jurors if he opened up the proceedings, the judge promised to release a transcript after Roof is sentenced.
“This is an incredibly sensitive moment in this proceeding,” Gergel said. “We are putting in the hands of 12 people the life and death of a person.”
Roof's lawyers tried repeatedly both to stop him from being his own lawyer and to work mental health-related evidence into the first phase of his trial, saying they feared Roof fired them because he feared the attorneys would present evidence that would embarrass him when trying to save his life.
Prosecutors objected at every turn, and Gergel wouldn't allow any of it into court, ruling mitigation evidence is allowable during sentencing and not before.
Court papers show prosecutors are expected to present evidence showing that Roof picked his victims because of their race, killed them to incite more violence, showed no remorse and killed three particularly vulnerable people who were 70 years old or older.
Evidence speaking to Roof's mental state, one expert argues, could make the difference between life and death.
“The Dylann Roof case is a classic example of the type of problem you can have when an obviously mentally ill or emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to represent himself,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “There's a huge difference in the eyes of a jury between someone they perceive as evil or despicable and someone they perceive as being seriously mentally ill. ... If you take mental health out of it, you are putting a thumb on the scale of death.”
Both the judge's decision to allow Roof to represent himself and waive the introduction of mental health evidence are sure to be raised in an inevitable appeal, Dunham argued.
Roof also faces nine murder charges in state court, where prosecutors have also said they will seek the death penalty in a trial likely to begin sometime next year.
Whether he's sentenced to death or not, it's unlikely Roof would be executed anytime soon, in either jurisdiction. The federal government hasn't executed anyone since 2003, and there are years of appeals between a death sentence being levied and carried out.
South Carolina's death chamber hasn't been used since 2011, due at least in part to a lack of availability for the drugs the state uses for lethal injection.

HYDERABAD - The Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) has expressed hope that its 660 Megawatts coal power project in Tharparkar will be completed ahead of the scheduled time.
According to a press release issued here Wednesday by the company's spokesman, SECMC's Chief Executive Shamsuddin Ahmed Shaikh said the commissioning date was set at June 3, 2019. "The total duration envisaged for completion of the project was set at 42 months, but the pace of the work ensures us of its completion in 38 months instead," he apprised. The 660 MW coal powered power project is being built at a cost of $2 billion in Thar Coal Block II.
Sharing details of the coal mining project, Shaikh said they had achieved 40 percent of the mining target while 33 percent progress had been made for the establishment of the power plant.
"This progress had been made in 15 months after the financial closure was achieved in April 2016," he noted.
The SECMC's head asserted that he strongly believed that benefits from the coal projects should go to the local people of Tharparkar besides the rest of the country.
"That's why the company has started interventions in education, health, livelihood, and drinking water sectors for the people of the area and these schemes have already started benefiting the local communities," he added.
Shaikh reiterated his offer for holding negotiations with the people who apprehend that the Ghorano reservoir project would in any way affect their villages.
"Despite the fact that the reservoir project has been declared technically and environmentally sound by the judicial committee of Sindh High Court, we are ready to talk with the people to remove their concerns which were created due to misinformation," he said.
KHYBER AGENCY - The Khasadar and Levies forces foiled an attempt to smuggle centuries-old antiques from Afghanistan to Pakistan and arrested the alleged smuggler at Mechni Checkpost on Friday.
The post in-charge Subedar Hikmat Afridi said that the Khasadar troops, during a routine search, recovered numbers of ancient time items from a Peshawar-bound Afghan citizen. The antiques were concealed in boxes under the grapes.
The forces also arrested an alleged smuggler identified as Ali Muhammad. The suspected smuggler has been sent to Landi Kotal lock for interrogation, the official said.
According to sources, the seized items included statues, Mughal era coins, ornaments and other commodities related to different old civilizations.
Assistant Political Agent (APA) Landi Kotal Niaz Muhammad told that the antique pieces, worth of millions of rupees, were being smuggled from across the border to Peshawar from where these items would be smuggled to abroad.
The experts and archaeologists would be contacted to determine the real status of the seized antiques, APA said.

Jonathan Drouin (Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports)
For the second straight offseason, Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman's biggest question revolves around who he will be able to re-sign ahead of free agency.
Last summer's list included captain Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov and Alex Killorn, among a handful of others. This offseason, Yzerman's biggest decisions will be what to do with restricted free agents-to-be Jonathan Drouin, Tyler Johnson and Ondrej Palat. There's also questions about the future of pending unrestricted free agents like Peter Budaj, Yanni Gourde and Luke Witkowski, to name a few.
Let's take a look at the big three RFAs pending for this summer and how they may play into the Lightning's plans for the future, and in particular, what the future of Jonathan Drouin may hold with the club. In a follow-up piece Tuesday, we will look at some other important pending free agents the club must make decisions about this offseason.
Jonathan Drouin
There's perhaps not a more intriguing pending free agent situation for the Lightning than the case of Drouin.
He turned 22-years-old in March and had a breakout season in 2016-17, scoring 21 goals and 32 assists in 73 games. It was a strong follow-up to his 14-point performance in 17 games this past postseason, where he was playing with a chip on his shoulders after he returned to the team after an eventful regular season off the ice.
Drouin's maturity level has grown over the past couple years and while he still has the occasional turnover and defensive lapses, he's a truly dynamic offensive talent. In fact, at his age and if he continues his upward trajectory, it's reasonable to believe he's a top-10 scorer in the NHL in the not too distant future.
But a somewhat telling statistic (depending on how much faith you put in plus/minus) is that Drouin was a team-leading minus-13 this season. The next closest Lightning players were Sustr (minus-10) and forwards Adam Erne and Killorn (minus-9). While plus/minus isn't the most reliable indicator of a player's defensive ability, it's certainly something that may have played into Drouin being held out of certain situations where you might expect to see him on the ice this past season.
Where things get interesting, though, is when you consider what his value may be to other teams. The Lightning are in desperate need of a top-4 defenseman and Drouin may be the sort of player it takes to land one. Yzerman certainly sees the value in Drouin. Why don't you think he was willing to ship him out of town in 2015-16 to the highest bidder at the trade deadline? A player with Drouin's offensive skill is a tough find but it also means it will come at a price for the Lightning if they opt to keep him.
Drouin could seek a long-term deal of anywhere from five to seven years in the neighborhood of more than $6 million per year, according to TSN's Bob McKenzie. The hockey insider did NOT report anything about a trade being on the horizon but was merely pontificating that he “would not be surprised if Drouin was moved” on his Bobcast Podcast on April 14 about what could play out this summer. Again, this was McKenzie just thinking out loud about the reality of the team's salary cap situation, also adding that it's possible Drouin stays right where he is.
That's real money and Yzerman will have to evaluate how that figures into the team's finances. One that includes a Victor Hedman extension (eight years) which begins next season and nearly doubles over his cap hit this past year and Andrei Vasilevskiy's three-year extension which kicks in beginning next season at a bargain of $3.5 million per year. And you can't forget about Nikita Kucherov's bridge deal expiring in two more years. He earns $4.7 million and if he is remotely close to the 40 goals he scored this year, that number could very well become $8-9 million annually, too.
There's also always the potential threat of an offer sheet. What was once a way for competing NHL teams to attempt to land big fish RFAs is now seemingly a thing of the past, but whose to say Drouin is a guy that doesn't garner at least a head scratch from an NHL GM. The sky is the limit for him offensively and he's the dynamic sort of player that sells tickets when he's at his best.
Tyler Johnson
Almost as intriguing is the situation posed by Johnson's pending RFA status.
The 26-year-old center turns 27 in July and things just didn't go like he (or the team) hoped they'd go for the most part this past regular season. Plagued with a wrist injury that he suffered in the 2015 Stanley Cup Final and the short summer that came with a June exit from the playoffs that year, he struggled until the second half of the 2015-16 season. He bounced back strong in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs and scored at a point per game average in 17 postseason contests.
Entering the 2016-17 season, Johnson spoke about the excitement he had for entering the year feeling 100-percent and after a good summer of training. This, in part, paved the way for sky-high expectations for him this season as he began a contract year. But things play out like they'd been drawn up. He struggled to find the score sheet during the early part of the season but found his groove at times (a six-game point streak in November was a season high). He scored 24 points in the 28 games he played in the new calendar year, but was plagued by injury again — this time it was a lower-body injury he suffered March 9 that kept him out of all but two games the remainder of the season.
By the end of the season, 21-year-old rookie Brayden Point was playing regularly as the team's No. 1 center and looked pretty comfortable playing alongside Palat and Kucherov. One has to wonder if Point's performance, coupled with the team's strength at the center position in the American Hockey League and in major junior hockey hasn't at least caused Yzerman to consider the idea of moving Johnson for a defenseman. Point has two years left on his entry-level contract which carries an average annual value of $919k.
Point has shown similarities in the game of Johnson — an undersized forward with a tremendous work ethic and good speed. The big difference being that keeping Johnson could potentially cost more than four and a half times what Point makes at the center position.
Ondrej Palat
And then there's Palat, who is a one NHL scout told me earlier this season that he thought was one of the best two-way forwards in the league. At 26-years-old, his unique set of size (6′, 188-pounds) and physical play make him a player the Lightning cannot afford to move.
Palat struggled in the first part of the season, scoring just 17 points in the first 33 games he played. But if there is one player who helped spearhead the Lightning's turnaround during the last third of the season not named Kucherov, Point or Vasilevskiy, it was Palat. He scored four goals and 18 assists in the final 21 games of the season and was a physical force night in and night out.
He is another player who has battled injuries too but a player who is another tough find in today's NHL. He and Johnson have been praised in the past by head coach Jon Cooper for their tireless work ethic. Palat is the sort of player who leaves it all out on the ice every night. Between that and his defensive awareness (he was third on the team with a plus-8 this season), he's the sort of player you'd be hard pressed to move at this point in his career.
What Does Yzerman Do?
I was asked recently whether or not I believed the Lightning needed to move a forward or two to improve the team's defense corps. In short, my answer is yes. The question then becomes, who? If you are looking at these three players only, I would narrow it down to Johnson or Drouin. This is not to imply that either player is on the block to move at this point. I can't see Palat being moved — especially not after the last third of the season he had. When it was crunch time for the club, he stepped up in a big way and that is something he will be rewarded for this summer.
So we circle back to Drouin and Johnson.
In short, Drouin is a 22-year-old who plays somewhat of a different style than Cooper is accustomed to and has virtually two seasons of full-time NHL playing experience (really one if you look at the playing time he received this year vs. 2014-15). On the other hand, you have a soon-to-be 27-year-old forward, Johnson, that fits the mold of Cooper's sort of player, but who hasn't sniffed the 29-goal and 72-point campaign he had in 2014-15 as a second-year NHLer. He's played a combined 135 regular season games the past two seasons and is showing some durability issues at a center position where the Lightning is deep now and into the future. If you are looking down the road, Drouin has the most offensive upside of any one of these three.
So what gives?
When he was asked point blank if he thought he had enough cap space to re-sign Drouin, Johnson and Palat, Yzerman chose his words carefully but confidently. “I think we can sign all the players we need to sign,” Yzerman said during his exit interview on April 10. But there's no shortage of players for Yzerman to sign outside of these three.
People doubted his ability to land Stamkos and keep the team cap-friendly with Kucherov and Killorn re-signed, among others. Can he pull off the same sort of feat this summer? Do Drouin and Johnson each play into the long-term plans? If Yzerman wants to keep all three of these RFAs, does he try to move Alex Killorn, who has six years left on a deal that pays him $4.45 million annually, instead? He may try to move a player like Jason Garrison who has one-year left at $4.6 million, but that may be hard to do. The bottom line is that for all three — Drouin, Johnson and Palat — to return to the club next season, some player(s) have to go.
As much as Yzerman was able to defy all logic and keep each of the big pieces of his roster in place heading into the 2016-17 season, the team has some holes it must plug to take the next step. Filling them is almost undoubtedly going to mean moving at least a forward or two. Moving Drouin might be what it takes to land that top-end defenseman they need, but moving him seems like a harder thing to do give that his most productive years of his career are in the near future. But if Drouin only considers at a long-term deal and not a short-term bridge bargain, Yzerman will be hard pressed to find room without making other deals and it puts him in a tough spot.
Drouin's value right now — the “What could be?” factor — makes his value sky high. So much so that some believe that he was the player involved in the trade that would have sent former St. Louis Blues defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk to the Lightning at the trade deadline. Then again, Johnson seems to be primed for a move too, but he's probably not the player that will land you the perennial top pair (or top-4) defenseman the Lightning need. It would be hard to unload a player with Drouin's upside unless you felt you had to do it to improve the club. Perhaps Yzerman feels that way, but only time will tell.
Ultimately, what this will come down to is who fits in the long-term plans for the club and of course, economics.
Then again, isn't that how free agency always plays out?
Tune in Tuesday as I discuss more of the free agency picture Yzerman faces this summer.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes suffered their worst week in two years as bond yields soared and renewed fears of inflation gripped investors.
But amid the selloff, corporate earnings forecasts keep improving.
Forecasts for earnings, one of the fundamental factors that drives stock prices, are rising fast as analysts factor in benefits from the U.S. tax overhaul.
Optimism over forecasts has caught the attention of anxious investors, who hope that strong earnings can support lofty stock valuations and offset the concerns over rising bond yields and the pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Rising interest rates in general mean higher borrowing costs for companies.
This week, fears of higher rates overwhelmed the upbeat profit picture as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell 3.9 percent and raised some concern about a deeper pullback.
“This uptick in bond rates has everybody nervous obviously,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
“But we step back and look, and so far earnings have been awful good. Even though you have seen rates move up some here, they are still very low, inflation is still low,” he said.
With half of the S&P 500 index companies still to report fourth-quarter results and potentially give guidance on 2018, profit estimates are likely to increase further.
Even after the selloff this week, the S&P 500 is up 3.3 percent for this year and that is on top of a 19.4-percent gain for 2017. Whether this week's downturn in global equity markets continues will depend in part on upcoming earnings reports.
Reports from both Apple and Google parent Alphabet late Thursday disappointed investors, as did Friday's results from ExxonMobil and Chevron , but fourth-quarter S&P 500 company results overall have been much stronger than expected.
Among changes to the tax law, the corporate income tax rate drops to 21 percent from 35 percent, so earnings estimates for the first quarter and all of 2018 have jumped.
First-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies is now estimated at 17.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 11.7 percent on Dec. 20, when both houses of Congress approved the tax revamp. Earnings growth for 2018 is now forecast at 18.2 percent, up from 11.5 percent on Dec. 20.
Typically, expectations decline as the earnings reporting season for the quarter approaches. On average, profit growth expectations fall by four percentage points from the start of the quarter to the start of earnings season, said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.
This January, revisions to S&P 500 2018 earnings estimates were 4.3 times more positive than negative, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The one-month ratio of upward to downward revisions was the highest since at least 1986, as far back as the bank's data goes.
All of the S&P 500 companies together are expected to show earnings of about $155 per share this year in aggregate, up about $9 since Dec. 20, Thomson Reuters' estimates show.
The tax reform benefit is estimated to add more than that, however, a full $13, which suggests there “there is more room to run,” BofA-ML strategists said in a note.
In addition to the tax law, U.S. companies' earnings are benefiting from improving global economic growth and the weaker U.S. dollar, which helps U.S. multinationals exports sales, said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Those factors could help to underpin U.S. earnings even after the tax benefit is priced in.
“Stocks may have been overbought, but some of that was alleviated this week, and global growth and profit growth are still intact,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Among companies due to report next week are Walt Disney, General Motors, several biotech companies including Gilead and restaurants including Chipotle Mexican Grill.
Carson Wentz expressed confidence in Nick Foles on Monday night, saying in a video message that the quarterback will do an "amazing job" in place of him for the Philadelphia Eagles the rest of this season.
Wentz, who will miss the rest of the season after tearing the ACL in his left knee Sunday, posted a video message on Twitter to address his injury.
Some quick thoughts for everyone. Can't thank my family, friends, teammates, and fans enough. Love y'all! #AO1 pic.twitter.com/vBwxG4So5N — Carson Wentz (@cj_wentz) December 11, 2017
"Obviously, it's been a rough day for me, personally, I'm not going to lie. I have a ton of faith in the Lord and in his plan but at the end of the day it's still been a tough one. And it will be tough on me for a little bit," he said.
He said he will rely on his faith and vowed that "this will not stop me going forward."
"I will come back stronger than ever, I will use this as motivation and then I will be attacking it, this whole process as I recover," he said.
The Eagles clinched the NFC East with their 43-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday as Foles helped Philadelphia rally from a fourth-quarter deficit.
"(Clinching the NFC East was) Step 1 of our goals this season and we're just continuing on from there," he said.
Wentz said he will be with the team to support them the rest of the season.
"I have the utmost confidence in Nick and the coaching staff that they will step up. We have been plagued with injuries all year long. It's just been the next-man-up mentality and that's going to continue. That's just going to continue.
"Nick's going to do an amazing job and lead this team now and I'm going to be there to support in whatever way I can," he said.
Wentz said he was thankful for all the phone calls, texts, emails and tweets he has received since suffering his season-ending injury.
"It's so humbling to know how many people are praying for me and lifting me up and encouraging me. It means the world," he said.

NEW YORK (AP)  Grace Ellis has never known a time when you needed a TV to watch TV.
The North Attleboro, Massachusetts, fifth-grader watches shows like Liv and Maddie, Jessie and The Lodge on her laptop, iPad and phone.
Sometimes I watch TV in the car, she says. I have ballet every day, so I watch on the way.
She has a TV in her bedroom that isnt hooked up to cable but is perfect for watching DVDs.

And the familys flat-screen has advantages of its own.
Its much bigger, Grace explains, and on the couch, its comfier.
Ever since freckle-faced puppet Howdy Doody ushered in childrens television nearly 70 years ago, each new generation of viewers has been treated to a growing bounty of programs on a mushrooming selection of gadgetry.
But nothing compares to the current wave: The generation coming up now is used to having everything at their fingertips, says Stacey Lynn Schulman, an analyst at the Katz Media Group.
Why not? From birth, theirs has been a world of video digitally issuing from every screen. And for them, any of those screens is just another screen, whether or not you call it TV.
When they love a (show), they love it in every form and on every platform, says Nickelodeon president Cyma Zarghami.
This keeps the bosses at each kids network scrambling to make sure that wherever children turn their eyes, that networks programing will be there.
Even so, it may be surprising that children nonetheless watch most television on, well, a television. As in: old-fashioned linear, while-its-actually-airing telecasts.
A new Nielsen study finds that in the fourth quarter of 2016, viewers aged 2-11 averaged about 17 hours of live (not time-shifted) TV each week. Granted, thats a drop of about 90 minutes weekly from the year before. But by comparison, kids in fourth quarter 2016 spent about 4½ hours weekly watching video content on other devices.
Linear TV is still the lions share of where kids time is spent, says Jane Gould, senior vice president for consumer insights for Disney Channel. But its important for us to be in all the OTHER places where they are, as well.
One reason: Those other outlets can pave the way for a new programs arrival on linear TV.
Gould points to Andi Mack, an ambitious young-adult comedy-drama that debuted on Disney Channel on April 7. Weeks before it landed there, the series could be sampled on digital platforms including the Disney Channel app, Disney.com, Disney Channel YouTube, iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.
Count Grace Ellis among the legions of kids whose attention was snagged by this mega-buildup. When Andi Mack premiered, Grace was one of the 9 million TV viewers who tuned in.
When Sesame Street premiered on PBS back in 1969, it joined a bare handful of TV shows (chief among them Captain Kangaroo and Mr. Rogers Neighborhood) devoted to uplifting their young audience.
Nearly a half-century later, Sesame Street is going strong.
PBS is still at its core, says Sesame Workshop COO Steve Youngwood. So is TV overall, as demonstrated by the series expanding to HBO a year ago. TV currently accounts for 40 percent of its viewership.
But Sesame Street has never stopped adapting to an evolving media landscape that today finds 18 percent of its audience viewing on tablets, 14 percent on mobile phones and 25 percent on other streaming devices and computers.
That includes YouTube, where its program content has been a presence for some time. Now its getting special focus with the launch of Sesame Studios, which Youngwood describes as a separate production unit specifically for that platform. We want to harness the power of YouTube to educate kids just like we harnessed the power of TV 50 years ago.
A half-century ago streaming video was an unimagined wonder. But todays TV landscape has been upended by this technology, and by major streaming-video outlets like Hulu, Amazon and Netflix as they aggressively vie for kids (as well as everybody elses) attention.
Netflix famously doesnt disclose viewership figures. But according to Andy Yeatman, director of global kids content, About half of our members around the world watch kids content on a regular basis. So its a very large, engaged audience.
Between new and returning series last year, we added 35 new seasons of kids originals, he says. Similar expansion is projected this year.
In a bygone era with just a handful of TV channels, kids could count on finding shows aimed at them only on Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons.
Nickelodeons Zarghami pegs 2013-14 as the most recent turning point for kids TV, when the landscape seriously shifted, she says, with streaming-video-on-demand providers gaining a real foothold and supplemental devices like tablets and mobile taking off.
Today, Nick has six on-demand platforms, and we went from 500 new episodes in a season to close to 700 this season, she says.
In short, kids are flooded with just-for-them content from every direction. But even thats not enough.
What they really look for is, to be surprised, says Disney Channels Gould. Thats the real challenge: How do we surprise and delight them?
Schulman of the Katz Media Group has her own prediction for where the next round of surprises might be waiting.
Virtual reality has been hard to get off the ground, but kids are all about immersive experiences, she says. When VR is ready for them, thats probably going to be the next big thing.
ATTORNEY GENERAL STEVE MARSHALL LEADS 14-STATE AMICUS BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF RIGHT OF CITY OF PENSACOLA TO MAINTAIN HISTORIC CROSS IN PUBLIC PARK Alabama Deer Breeder charged with Illegal Transportation of Whitetail Deer » STATE AG ANNOUNCES MULTIPLE LAWSUITS TO ENFORCE STATE LAW BANNING ILLEGAL GAMBLING MONTGOMERY—Attorney General Steve Marshall announced recently the filing of multiple lawsuits against casinos in five counties that continue to operate illegal slot machines, as so-called “electronic bingo,” in defiance of state law. The lawsuits call upon local circuit courts to prohibit the defendants from promoting, operating and transporting so-called “electronic bingo” machines and slot machines in those counties. The State also filed motions requesting that the circuit courts grant preliminary injunctions to cease unlawful gambling operations in these counties while the lawsuits are pending. The civil lawsuits were filed in Greene, Houston, Lowndes, Macon and Morgan counties against the operating casinos, machine manufacturers and vendors, and the governmental authorities responsible for licensing and overseeing electronic bingo operations in those counties. “It is the responsibility of the Attorney General to ensure that Alabama's laws are enforced, including those laws that prohibit illegal gambling,” said Attorney General Steve Marshall. “Through multiple rulings in recent years, the Alabama Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that electronic bingo and the use of slot machines are illegal in all Alabama counties. Therefore, we have taken action to hold accountable those who defy the laws of our state. These lawsuits represent a comprehensive legal approach developed by the Attorney General, with the assistance of the Office's career experts, to finally put a stop to illegal gambling.” Since assuming office in February, Attorney General Marshall has continued to assist other agencies and district attorneys in the enforcement of anti-gambling laws in Alabama. The multi-county lawsuits filed today are the culmination of ongoing investigations into these casinos and gambling ventures around the state. The civil complaints call for the closure of the casinos because the illegal gambling they offer presents legal nuisances in the state. The State has pursued numerous cases over the past five years to bring clarity and enforcement to the anti-gambling laws of the state. In each of these cases, the courts of the state have repeatedly determined that the game of bingo cannot be played on electronic devices, and slot machines are clearly illegal in the state. The most significant cases include the following: State v. Anchor Club, et al., CV-2011-900213 (Jefferson Co. Circuit Court) – the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State because the devices were illegal slot machines
State v. Southern Star, CV-2012-900053(Lowndes Co. Circuit Court, 2013) – the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State as machines cannot play the game of bingo in Lowndes County
Ex parte State, 121 So. 3d 337 (Ala. 2013) – the Supreme Court ordered that the Macon County Circuit Court issue a search warrant for illegal gambling devices at VictoryLand because the machines did not appear to play bingo and were slot machines
State v. Greenetrack, Inc., 154 So. 3d 940 (Ala. 2014) – the Supreme Court ruled that games of bingo in Greene County must meet all Cornerstone requirements and a machine cannot play the entire game, ordered the trial court to issue a search warrant for gambling machines in Greene County
HEDA v. State, 168 So. 3d 4 (Ala. 2014) – the Supreme Court upheld the Houston County Circuit Court's determination that machines do not play the game of bingo
State v. $223,405.86 et al., 203 So. 3d 816 (Ala. 2016) – the Supreme Court found that bingo cannot be played on machines in Macon County, contrary to the trial court's ruling and ordered the condemnation of all seized devices and money from at VictoryLand
State v. $191,249.11 et al., CV-2014-900041 (Greene Co. Circuit Court, 2016) – the trial court held that the sized devices, records and currency from Frontier Bingo in Greene County were condemned and forfeited as illegal gambling devices
State v. Choctaw Entertainment Center, et al., CV-2013-903288 (Mobile Co. Circuit Court, 2017) – the trial court held that bingo could not be played on electronic devices in Mobile County
State v. 825 Electronic Gambling devices, et al., — So. 3d —- (Ala. 2016) – The Supreme Court held that machines could not be used to play bingo in Greene County and overturned the trial court's erroneous ruling
State v. $1,077.00 et al., CV-2016-903396 (Jefferson Co. Circuit Court, 2017) – the trial court found that the games played at Bid City in Jefferson County were illegal slot machines and condemned them Click links to download October 4, 2017 filings: Greene County

Designed to expand the availability of high quality cancer care globally and help save the lives of millions more cancer patients, treatments with Varian's Halcyon system have started at three different cancer centers in northern and southern Africa. Halcyon simplifies and enhances virtually every aspect of image-guided volumetric intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), including improved patient comfort and shortening the time from installation to first treatment without sacrificing quality.
The cancer centers now offering Halcyon treatments in Africa are Clinique le Littoral Casablanca and Centre d'Oncologie Nakhil Rabat in Morocco, and Busamed Oncology Center- Hillcrest in South Africa.
Clinique le Littoral Casablanca, Morocco was the first Halcyon installation in Africa and was selected over other available solutions to help address the cancer center's growing patient volume, and as a complement to their existing capabilities.
Centre d'Oncologie Nakhil Rabat, Morocco was able to have the system installed, commissioned, staff trained and begin treating patients in just two weeks. Since beginning Halcyon treatments in January 2018, the center is already providing care to over 70 patients per day on this system as part of their expanding state-of-the-art techniques including IGRT, RapidArc and SBRT using other Varian equipment exclusively.
Busamed Oncology Center- Hillcrest, South Africa was the first Halcyon installation in Sub-Sahara Africa. This project is a symbol of a successful collaboration between the oncology center, Varian and partners for responding to the oncology need in the province. The fast installation process, ease of customer training, useful QA tools, and seamless workflows allowed the center to quickly begin offering treatments with the new system.
With the innovations in Halcyon, the system delivers high quality treatments, which empowers clinicians to care for more patients. Halcyon features a streamlined workflow that only requires nine steps from the start to the end of treatment compared to up to more than 30 steps with older technologies.
To assist in the reduction of time and construction costs from installation to first patient treatment, Halcyon offers expedited commissioning, requires less shielding than traditional systems, can fit in the majority of existing small vaults and can be installed in two weeks or fewer. Several cancer centers have already begun treating patients with Halcyon including Radiation Oncology Centres (Australia), University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium), Queen's Hospital (England), and Penn Medicine (U.S.).
“We are proud of our collaboration with these centers in Africa and increasing the access to high quality cancer treatments with Halcyon,” said Jean-LucDevleeschauwer, president, Varian Oncology Systems EMEIA. “We look forward to working with more centers across the region, and around the world, in the global fight against cancer.”
WASHINGTON (AP) — Even before he'd read the memo, President Donald Trump seized on what it could mean.
The president first learned of the House Intelligence Committee document last month from some Republican allies in Congress and he watched it take hold in the conservative media, including on some of his favorite Fox News programs, according to seven White House officials and outside advisers.
The classified memo sent to the Oval Office by the committee's majority Republicans asserted that the FBI and Justice Department abused their surveillance powers to monitor the communications of a onetime Trump campaign associate. Trump told confidants in recent days that he believed the memo would validate his concerns that the “deep state” — an alleged shadowy network of powerful entrenched federal and military interests — had conspired to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency, according to one outside adviser.
That adviser and the others weren't authorized to publicly discuss private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Trump's decision to authorize the memo's public disclosure was extraordinary, yet part of a recent pattern. Like few of his predecessors, Trump has delivered repeated broadsides against intelligence and law enforcement agencies, working in tandem with some conservatives to lay the groundwork to either dismiss or discredit special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation.
“This memo totally vindicates ‘Trump' in probe,” the president tweeted Saturday from Florida, where he was spending the weekend. “But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!”
Trump had dismissed forceful pleas from the FBI director, Christopher Wray, and the second-ranking Justice Department official, Rod Rosenstein, to keep the memo under wraps. They said the four-page document was inaccurate and lacked critical context, and they made their views known in a remarkable public statement objecting to its release. Democrats said the memo, which disclosed material about one of the most tightly held national security processes, selectively used Republican talking points in an effort to smear law enforcement.
Trump, however, was undeterred.
Early last week, aides briefed him on the never-before-used-process that the House would use to release the classified memo. Lawyers at the White House and Capitol Hill worried about making dangerous missteps.
Trump told allies he believed the memo would reinforce his belief that accusations of collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials were false and part of the conspiracy to discredit his victory. And the president signaled that he would approve the memo's public disclosure if the House committee voted to pursue that course.
Several aides cautioned that the memo did not contain convincing evidence of a conspiracy, while others urged him to black out sections on intelligence-gathering methods, according to a White House official. Other advisers, inside and outside the West Wing, questioned why his administration had allowed the memo to become the dominant talking point during the week when he gave his first State of the Union address, overshadowing the well-received address.
But those worries, as well as fears that the disclosure could lead to retaliatory leaks from the Justice Department, did not hold sway in the Oval Office. Trump made clear to aides he was intent on seeing the memo released as soon as possible.
White House officials with concerns resigned themselves to the memo's release. Trump put his chief of staff, John Kelly, in charge of making that happen, and Kelly called Justice Department officials multiple times to upbraid them for criticizing the likely disclosure.
Trump's counsel, meanwhile, took issue with the House process. Don McGhan believed that if the president only allowed the memo to go out, rather than declassify it, that would set a dangerous precedent and curtail executive powers, according to a White House official.
A final decision to authorize the release, without any part blacked out, came Thursday, a day before the document was sent back to the House for publication. While many in Congress, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., denied that the release undermined the FBI or Mueller's investigation, Trump seemed to acknowledge that the memo was explicitly political.
“The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans – something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago,” the president tweeted on Friday.
Trump has complained bitterly about Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mueller's inquiry after Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped aside. Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director last May.
Trump would not say on Friday whether the memo made him more likely or not to fire Rosenstein.
“You figure that one out,” Trump told reporters.
Later, two White House officials said Trump was not considering parting ways with Rosenstein, at least for the moment. But the memo's release and Trump's penchant for keeping Justice Department officials on their toes were just the latest signs that the president intends to keep the agency on a short leash.
Trump first asked Comey for loyalty before firing him. He repeatedly berated Sessions, publicly and privately, after the attorney general's decision to withdraw from the Russia investigation, and railed about what he perceived as insufficient loyalty while urging the Justice Department to reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. He reportedly asked the FBI's No. 2 leader, Andrew McCabe, which presidential candidate McCabe voted for in 2016 and targeted the deputy director for attack in the weeks before McCabe announced a sudden departure from the bureau.
Trump also has taken his cues from conservative media and latched onto to a number of stories — including anti-Trump text messages by FBI agents — to distract from the Russia investigation and call into question the integrity of Mueller's work.
Sessions, eager to return to Trump's good graces, seemed to tacitly agree with his boss' criticisms of the Justice Department. “I have great confidence in the men and women of this department. But no department is perfect,” Sessions said.
The Porsche Mission E Taycan is coming. The German marque's first fully electric vehicle – named after a “lively, young horse,” oddly enough – will make its debut sometime in 2019 as a 2020 model year vehicle, and could come with as much as 600 horsepower (447 kilowatts) on tap. Unfortunately, we're still more than a few months away from the EV's debut – but that doesn't mean we can't dream of a more exclusive version.
Rendering artist Aksyonov Nikita has imagined the new Taycan wearing a Porsche Exclusive makeover, complete with a fresh new paint job, unique carbon fiber accents, and a new set of wheels. Its styling is nearly identical to the 911 Turbo S with the same treatment – but there are some unique stylizations to note.
For one, this rendering takes the original Mission E concept and gives it a more production-ready look. The headlights are more pronounced but carry over mostly unchanged. The fascia is unique, too, adopting a tri-grille setup as opposed to the singular grille setup found on the Mission E. There are also side mirrors, something we didn't see on the original concept.
In the rear, the Taycan gets a more aggressive look. The same singular light bar fixture carries over unchanged from the concept, but now the Taycan makes do with a unique spoiler, a more subtle diffuser design, and dual exhaust tips. We're not exactly what exhaust tips are doing on an EV, though.
Even though its designer doesn't dream up any specifications, one would imagine that – similar to its 911 sibling – the Taycan Exclusive would get over more power over the standard variant. The 911 Turbo S Exclusive produces 598 horsepower (445 kilowatts) and 553 pound-feet of torque, giving it the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) in just 2.9 seconds.

Los Angeles Kings center Alex Iafallo 19) clears the puck from the corner during the second period of the team's NHL hockey game against the Arizona Coyotes in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb. 3, 2018.
As a young boy, William Nylander drew some inspiration from Nicklas Backstrom, who's now an opponent with the Washington Capitals. Rick Madonik / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
It was a small part, but Nicklas Backstrom had a hand in turning Maple Leafs rookie William Nylander into the NHL player he is today. Backstrom was a 19-year-old rookie with the Washington Capitals back in 2007-08 and, like most first-year players, he fell under the watchful eye of one of his team's veterans — in this case Nylander's father, Michael. It was something of a natural thing for Backstrom to gravitate toward Michael, a fellow Swede and a family man with a pair of youngsters that had an obvious affinity for hockey. “Michael took care of me, and he had his family and his wife there, it was pretty hectic,” Backstrom said Monday morning, reflecting back on his rookie season and how he grew into the Nylander family. “Michael cooked the food and I hung out with the family.” Nearly a decade later, Backstrom is facing off against William in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
Article Continued Below
Backstrom remembers at least six kids in the house outside Washington, where Michael Nylander had two playing stints, including the final two years of a 15-year NHL career that ended in 2009. Backstrom also noticed how 11-year-old William and 10-year-old Alex, now a top prospect with the Buffalo Sabres, had a natural love for the game. “(William) had a good attitude to hockey, him and Alex wanted to play all the time,” Backstrom said. “That's all they thought about, playing hockey. They played outside the house, they watched YouTube clips, they were doing that all the time.”
“When me and Mike were there, the kids just loved hockey, you could tell they really wanted it.” Alex and William had certainly benefitted from being in a family with an NHL father. The two would shoot pucks on the ice prior to team practices at the Kettler Capitals Iceplex. They also got to hang out in the dressing room and when the pros were on the ice, they'd huddle by the glass and peer out at all the star players, a young Alexander Ovechkin among them. William Nylander said that's when hockey became a very serious love for him. “It was cool growing up there,” said Nylander, a first-round pick (eighth overall) of the Maple Leafs in 2014. “Me and my brother, we were in the rink a lot, and at our home, we did a lot of hanging out (with Backstrom).” Including in the family driveway, where Backstrom would fire ping pong ball after ping pong ball at William while he was tending goal. “It was great having those guys around,” William said. “And going to the rink, you saw what you wanted to do when you got older, the image of what you wanted to be.”

ESPN Saints reporter Mike Triplett says that after a third consecutive 7-9 season, the buzz around coach Sean Payton's future with the team will begin to rise. (0:55)
ATLANTA -- All Sean Payton would say Sunday when asked about his coaching future was, “Next question.”
But really, until that one gets answered, there is no next question with the New Orleans Saints.
And if Payton leaves, there will be a lot more questions.
Namely, do the Saints try to build off the gradual improvement they've been making with offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael Jr. and defensive coordinator Dennis Allen? Or do they seek a more radical culture change?
Everyone from ownership to coaches to players feels genuine optimism about the direction this team is heading, despite a third straight 7-9 season. But for the second year in a row, Payton's future looms as a potential buzzkill.
This time, the possibility of Payton leaving seems even more serious, with NOLA.com reporting Sunday night that the Los Angeles Rams are expected to seek permission to speak with Payton and that Saints general manager Mickey Loomis would be open to a trade.
Although it seems the Saints would rather keep Sean Payton, they might be able to add some important draft picks if he wants to leave. Jason Getz/USA TODAY Sports
A source told ESPN that Payton and Loomis met on the subject following Sunday's loss to the Atlanta Falcons and will continue meeting into the week. For any deal to be struck, it would have to be considered a win-win-win for the Saints, Rams and Payton, as Loomis and Saints owner Tom Benson really have ultimate control.
The Saints signed Payton to a five-year contract extension worth more than $9 million per year this past offseason, and multiple sources have told ESPN that they are happy with the direction the team has been headed this year.
This is not a case in which they're eager to shove Payton out the door or start over and “blow things up.” They feel like Drew Brees leading the NFL's No. 1-ranked offense and a defense that showed some signs of progress this year could evolve into a playoff contender with some pieces added this season.
However, the Saints won't force Payton to stay if he wants to leave. They could exploit the opportunity to use Payton as a chip to load up on some quality building blocks, like a bigger version of what they did with their trade of Jimmy Graham to the Seattle Seahawks two years ago.
In that sense, I wouldn't hate the move, considering the Saints have been stuck in a sort of limbo between contending and rebuilding for three years now.
I have strongly been against the idea of the Saints rebuilding by parting ways with Brees until they find a suitable replacement. I think Brees makes the playoffs a much more realistic goal every year, and the search for a quarterback can set a franchise back years or decades.
But maybe the added draft picks from a Payton deal could help the Saints find the QB of the future.
The bigger question the Saints have to answer is whether they want to retain Carmichael and Allen, both of whom have done quality work this season. In that case, hiring former Saints assistant Doug Marrone or even Allen as head coach could be a route the Saints consider.
Then again, the Saints might need more of a shake-up than that, seeing as they haven't sniffed a winning record since 2013. Maybe they need a defensive-minded version of Payton who could revamp that side of the ball while Brees, Carmichael and young receivers such as Brandin Cooks, Michael Thomas and Willie Snead keep the offense running smoothly.
Perhaps Loomis would be eager to try to catch lightning in a bottle again, like he did 11 years ago, when he hired a young up-and-comer in Payton without knowing much about him before the interview process began.
The biggest risk in letting Payton go, however, would be losing some of the team morale that seemed to build up the past two years after New Orleans revamped its roster and locker-room culture.
Players young and old have talked excitedly about the team's future, and the idea of losing Payton seemed like a real turn-off to veterans Brees, offensive tackle Zach Strief and running back Mark Ingram following Sunday's game.
Brees reiterated that he thinks the vibe around the team is similar to that of the 7-9 and 8-8 seasons in 2007 and 2008 before the Saints won a Super Bowl in 2009. Strief even admired the way the team rallied from Sunday's brutal first half (the Falcons led 35-13) to come close in a 38-32 loss.
“I don't know how to explain why that's special, but it's not always like that," Strief said. "It's hard to explain without feeling it.”
Ingram agreed and said the Saints are "extremely close, and we're young, and we just continue to thrive together."
“So I feel like, let's just keep this unit together. And Coach Payton and Drew and just, I feel like we're family," Ingram said. "So I don't feel like we're gonna be broken up.”
That's what this would be -- a breakup -- even if there are ways to spin it positively.
That might ultimately provide a fresh start. But in the short term, it sure would feel like a buzzkill.

– Detroit, Michigan
One look at the parking lot behind European Auto Solutions in Waltham, Massachusetts, and it's obvious these guys know a thing or two about Benzes. The most beautifully eclectic collection of classic Mercedes metal is on hand, cared for by skilled technicians who specialize in the sort of persnickety engineering built into every drop of decades-old Daimler.
My buddy Daniel Golson is no stranger to the team at EAS – and neither is his W123-generation 1984 Mercedes-Benz 300TD Wagon, painted in an iconic shade that I can only describe as “German taxi beige.” This was Daniel's first car, purchased secondhand when he still lived outside of Boston. But after moving to Detroit, where Golson studied at the College for Creative Studies and currently works as an online production assistant at Car and Driver, the Mercedes gained a bit of a cult following. At a party of auto industry folks following the 2016 Detroit Auto Show, an attendee had no idea what Daniel's name was, but instantly knew him as “the guy with the Mercedes.”
You can imagine the collective heartbreak, then, when the 300TD blew its engine and died a few months ago, off the side of Interstate 94 just west of Detroit. (For the record, Daniel saw all four GMT201 vans that day, and was therefore destined for tragedy.)
I had to help save the Mercedes. The Mercedes. So without a second thought, I offered my services to tow the W123 from Detroit back to Boston, some 800 miles. I would need a truck – one that could safely tow upwards of 6,000 pounds, but that would be comfortable enough to handle a 1,500-mile round trip. A Ford Super Duty was the logical choice, but that's too easy. I could've gone with something like a Ram 1500 EcoDiesel, but again, too easy. And that's when I remembered I had a Raptor on the test-car schedule. Perfect.
The backup assist lets you “steer” with a controller on the dash – just turn left or right based on where you want the trailer to go, and the truck does everything else.
As I've told you before, the 2017 F-150 Raptor is a marvelous truck that's both outrageously capable and downright great to live with, looking wholly badass in the process. It's important to point out, however, that I could only have done this trip in the SuperCrew model, which is rated to tow 8,000 pounds. The shorter SuperCab is only rated for 6,000. Still, whenever I told someone I'd be towing the Mercedes with a Raptor, the response was always, “that's so cool.” But beyond its image as a super rad truck, the Raptor – like the full F-150 range – comes with a lot of helpful technology that makes it a champ for when it's time to get dirty and go to work.
The towing aid starts with several different backup camera views, so you can see things from trailer level, and above. There are directional lines for the side of the truck, and one in the middle that shows you where the hitch ball is headed – reversing at the U-Haul station, all I had to do was wait for the attendant to yell “woah!” to know I was back far enough. With the trailer attached, the Raptor's backup assist function lets you “steer” with a controller on the dash – just turn left or right based on where you want the trailer to go, and the truck does everything else. It's beyond simple, and makes negotiating a big car trailer as easy as using a joystick.
For the 800 mile drive from Detroit to Boston, Daniel and I opted to go south, around the U.S. side of Lake Erie, simply because I didn't feel like dealing with angry border patrol agents going into Canada. (A truck I don't own, with manufacturer plates, pulling a rented trailer and a non-running car I also don't own, and I'm “just passing through.” Not suspicious at all, right?) We left on a Friday afternoon, after an incredible struggle of actually getting the W123 onto the trailer. We thought the car could drive under its own power long enough to get on the flat hauler, but no. So we pushed it. And failed. Then we pushed it with Daniel's NA Miata, and succeeded. (The answer is always Miata.) In retrospect, I wish someone would have caught it on video.
Daniel and I decided to split the drive over three days. Friday would be Detroit to Syracuse, Saturday we'd finish the trek to Boston and then come back to Syracuse for some sleep, and then Sunday we'd cut through Canada (free of trailer and Mercedes) and get back to Detroit in time to watch the highly anticipated Lady Gaga concert that was taking place in the middle of some big football game.
The Mercedes is like a combination couch and bank vault when it's running in top form. It's a lot like me – in its early 30s, but with so much love to give.
Friday's drive was through the greater part of Dullsville, U.S.A., where we counted bad Landau roof jobs in Ohio while cruising at 60 miles per hour down Interstate 90. Into Pennsylvania and on into New York, we hit some slick, snowy weather for a spell, which the Raptor negotiated with aplomb, though the lousy trailer tires out back occasionally had the Mercedes sidestepping a bit on the freeway. Not fun, but things never got out of hand – the Raptor was surefooted, and kept moving us forward.
We got the W123 to EAS midday Saturday, the Mercedes covered in a thick, gross layer of grime and road salt. Seeing it among the outstanding collection at the Massachusetts-based shop was inspiring – I knew we were leaving it in good hands. I'm eager to see it running around the streets of Detroit again.
The car is like a combination couch and bank vault when it's running in top form. It's a lot like me – in its early 30s, but with so much love to give.
As for the actual experience of towing, after 812 miles, the Raptor wasn't even phased. With an average speed between 55 and 60 mph on the freeways, and much slower speeds around town, I recorded an average of 13.2 miles per gallon – lower than the 15-mpg EPA city rating, sure, but I also had over 6,000 pounds of German metal and a big ol' trailer clinging onto the back. Plus, with the transmission put into its tow setting, it tends to hold gears a bit longer than you'd expect – rather than constantly shifting between seventh, eighth, and ninth, for example, it'll just hold seventh for a while. Higher revs contribute to more fuel consumption. But thanks to the Raptor's 36-gallon tank, fuel stops weren't as frequent as you might think. Expensive, yes, but not something I had to do every couple of hours.
So with the Mercedes unloaded, the trailer dropped off at a metro-Boston U-Haul, and a quick visit to see Daniel's family goats, we headed back toward Syracuse, and eventually, home. Now, the Raptor could just be itself – a big, comfortable truck with a fantastic sound system, easy-to-use infotainment interface, and a ton of “get the hell out of my way” presence on the road. I honestly believe the long drive wouldn't have been as nice in a Super Duty or standard F-150 – the Raptor's sophisticated suspension and cushy shocks make it great for long drives, and even on knobby, off-road tires, only small amounts of wind and road noise filter into the cabin.
A big, comfortable truck with a fantastic sound system, easy-to-use infotainment interface, and a ton of “get the hell out of my way” presence on the road.
With the tow job complete, my highway speeds increased to a more livable 75-80 mph, and the transmission was free to make use of all 10 of its forward gears. For the last 737 miles, my observed fuel economy was a more respectable 14.7 mpg. Still not quite the 18 mpg highway that Ford and the EPA suggest, but I admit to driving this thing like a Raptor, and Raptors don't give a flying fork about observed fuel economy numbers.
At the end of it all, the Raptor left me damn impressed. Every single part of the trip was simple (once we finally got going). Trailering was easy. Cruising was effortless. And everywhere we went, thumbs-up and “cool truck!” greetings came aplenty. Daniel is excited to fly back to Boston, pick the car up, and drive it back to Detroit with his father. But if it came down to it, I'd grab another Raptor and triumphantly return the Mercedes to Michigan in a heartbeat.

Enhanced Sino-Pak ties in the realm of culture and information would further reinforce heart to heart bond between the people of two iron brothers.
Marriyum Aurangzeb, Minister of State for Information, Broadcasting, National History and Literary Heritage (IBNH&LH) said this in her statement while leaving for Peoples Republic of China on a five-day official visit (February 3-8) on the invitation of Lu Shugang, Minister of Culture of China, here Saturday.
She said that the CPEC would not only be a source of economic and infrastructural development but would also open new avenues of collaboration in the arena of art, culture and heritage.
Terming the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC) a route of peace and prosperity, Marriyum said that history of the world was replete with events where alliances were built primarily to contain other powers, to conquer other territories or for the sake of self-defence. The Pak-China partnership under the CPEC was unique in the sense that it was meant to bring the fruits of development, opportunities of employment and provision of basic amenities not only for the people of China and Pakistan but also for the entire region and beyond, she stressed.
Apart from solidifying regional connect, the CPEC would also boost tourism and establish cultural linkage through One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, which was imperative to bring people of both nations closer to each other, Marriyum said.
She said that the One Belt One Road initiative would not only bound the two countries in eternal partnership for shared economic progress of the whole region but would also strengthen heritage which was its one of the most important components.— APP
Communication Skills
Communication skills are essential in every economy, and in every industry from government, to manufacturing, to high tech, to education, and beyond. The ability to express oneself clearly, concisely and appropriately is a cornerstone to success not only for work, but life in general.
It is equally important to be able to communicate well both verbally and in writing. Use of SMS messaging particularly among the younger generation has taken the focus away from formal writing. In a work context, it is important for workforce entrants to be able to express themselves in complete sentences with appropriate grammar, which is distinguished from the informal abbreviations used to communicate on mobile devices.
An especially important skill in the workforce knows how to communicate numbers effectively. Being able to capture data in a written presentation, either in slides or in a longer written report, is a valuable skill used to persuade decision makers through the use of data to support one's proposals, or to demonstrate how one has achieved desired outcomes.

KARACHI - Sindh Rangers on Friday claimed to have arrested a man posing as an army major to swindle people during snap checking in Gulistan-e-Jauhar area, said a press release issued by the paramilitary force.
Muhammad Rafiq, the con man, introduced himself as Major Ali affiliated with an intelligence agency when stopped by the Sindh Rangers. The paramilitary troops started inspection of his car when Rafiq failed to provide his departmental identity card.
During inspection, one illegal 9mm pistol, narcotics and fake property papers were recovered. The man was immediately taken into custody.
Initial investigation of the suspect revealed that the man posing as an army official used to take bribes from the families of arrested suspects, and was also involved in land grabbing. Two of his accomplices, Ghulam Fareed and Ali Hasan, were arrested by the law enforcement authorities after Rafiq's disclosure. The suspects have been handed over to police.
AUGUST 14, 2017 — DNV GL surveyors have carried out the classification society's first offshore drone survey on the semisubmersible vessel Safe Scandinavia in the North Sea. The 25,383 GT tender support vessel (TSV) is owned and operated by Prosafe, supporting Statoil's drilling operations off the coast of Norway.
Using camera-equipped drones, DNV GL's drone pilots checked the TSV's fairleads and their connection with the vessel's two columns as part of the intermediate survey.
"We are very pleased that we chose to try the drone survey, as it helped us optimize our survey requirements and allowed us to save significant amounts of time and money," says Ian Young, Chief Operating Officer at Prosafe. "Normally, this kind of operation would cause disruption to our client for several days. The drone survey took only a few hours and was just as effective."
"This was a great opportunity for us to demonstrate our drones' abilities to check the condition of remote external components in challenging offshore conditions," says Cezary Galinski, Project Manager Classification Poland at DNV GL. "The inspection only required the semi-submersible to de-ballast, then we flew the drone approximately 25 meters below the main deck to check the condition of the fairleads and their connections to the columns that hold up the TSV. With wind speeds of approximately 15 knots, this went very well and the survey showed that the fairleads and their connections were in a good condition,"
The classification society has carried out multiple drone surveys on both ships and offshore units, inspecting many areas on board, ranging from tanks and cargo holds to external structures such as jack-up legs. The inspection of such spaces can be both costly and time consuming, and even in some instances potentially dangerous. Using drones to visually check the condition of remote structural components can significantly reduce survey times and staging costs, while at the same time improving surveyor safety.
DNV GL has built a network of trained drone pilots based in Gdynia, Piraeus, Singapore, Houston and Shanghai, allowing drone survey inspections to be offered from any of these hubs.
At the same time, DNV GL is developing guidelines and updating its rule set to reflect the use of remote inspection techniques.

Over 100 volunteers are canvassing the streets of Guelph and service agencies this week to find out how many people are experiencing homelessness.
The Point-in-Time Count, which got underway Monday, will continue through to Wednesday and is meant to provide a snapshot of homelessness in the community.
READ MORE: Volunteers hit Regina streets for 2018 point-in-time homeless count
It is being led by the Guelph & Wellington Task Force for Poverty Elimination and County of Wellington Social Services, and it's part of coordinated count taking place across the country.
“The Point-in-Time Count helps us build a shared understanding of the needs of our most vulnerable community members,” said Randalin Ellery, coordinator of the task force. “This is important work that informs referrals, resource allocations and needs for the homeless-serving system.”
The last count was conducted in 2016 and showed that 295 individuals were homeless over a three-day period.

The task force said of those counted, 22 per cent were identified as Indigenous or having Indigenous ancestry which has now inspired the task force to put more focus on outreach with Indigenous communities.
“We welcome a call to action, to explore together what connects us, past and present, and how we engage with Indigenous community members to take a collective step forward to bring healing and space to our community,” said Manon Germain, Indigenous homelessness coordinator with the task force.
The count will take also take place in Wellington County until April 29.
The results will be released on May 3.
Welcome to the second installment of Second Serve!
Click here to get acquainted or re-acquainted to the first video and article. The response to my maiden effort was nearly universal.
Every comment went something like this:
“Wow, very cool. I'm looking forward to following your progress. Also, your serve sucks.”
And that sentiment was shared by hardcore tennis fans and people who don't even know how the scoring in tennis works. My looping, noodle-armed serve united sports fans and non-sports-fans alike!
And, hey, you're all preaching to the choir. I had an inkling my serve was going to be a liability going into my first tournament; it absolutely was, and now I'm emboldened to make significant changes before winter is over.
Because my tennis pedigree is so limited (2018 marks my sixth year of playing) and I've only given myself until the end of the summer to climb as far as I can up the Tennis Canada leaderboard, I need to expedite my development.
So, I went straight to the top: The Aviva Centre in Toronto, home of Tennis Canada. As I mention in the video, I was there for a story on Tennis Canada's “Long Term Athlete Development” plan.
And I certainly wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to get Bianca Andreescu, the 182nd-ranked woman in the world, and national coach Andre Labelle to triage my game.
To my surprise, both Bianca and Andre expressed actual interest in my joining Tennis Canada and trying to obtain a national ranking. They asked a number of questions about my game, which I demurred until after we hit the court. I wanted to go in fresh and get an honest assessment.
I was nervous stepping onto the court. Not only did I have a professional tennis player on the other side of the net, but I had a top coach on my side of the net watching my every move.
I felt like an impostor who snuck onto the Tennis Canada practice courts. I mean, I guess that's kind of what happened. But I'm proud to say, we actually got into some decent rallies. If you squint really hard at the video, it may look like I actually belong on the court with Bianca.
Or at least 60 per cent Bianca. She asked me before we started hitting how hard should she play. I told her to give me what I could handle.
And for a few minutes at least, I was able to play well. I think both Bianca and Andre were surprised at my skills (although I'm sure the bar for broadcaster athletic talent and tennis ability is extremely low).
Bianca even complimented my game a number of times. That was too much for me to handle. I immediately crumbled and sent one to the back wall.
What happens when the 182nd ranked female tennis player in the world compliments your game?
You immediately fall apart. A preview of @Bandreescu_ and I on court @TennisCanada pic.twitter.com/dzU585ROYo — Mike Arsenault (@MikeGArsenault) January 30, 2018
That was my fault 😂😝 — Bianca V. Andreescu (@Bandreescu_) February 3, 2018
She was moving me side to side with relative ease while I produced grunts of exertion on every swing, but we were rallying. Then I flew too close to the sun.
“Okay, let's see your top gear.”
Wow. I didn't get another one in play after that. She just crushes the ball.
In my first tournament, I was playing top provincial male teenagers. And Bianca, one of the top female teenage players in the world hits significantly harder than them with a modicum of effort. She wasn't even short of breath after our hit.
I kept forgetting she's a teenager. She speaks beyond her years and definitely plays beyond them. But there was one moment when I was reminded that she's 17: She teased me for needing to wear my glasses to see the ball.
Teenagers.
After watching my ground strokes, I asked Andre for an honest assessment. He was impressed with my athleticism and my quickness, and my power. He said I looked like a 5.0 player, which is analogous to a Canadian university tennis player.
Then he asked to see my serve.
Oh boy. That didn't go well. They both said it needs a complete overhaul, starting with my grip. I know it sounds bad, but it's actually not.
I'm embarrassed to admit, but I actually didn't know you were supposed to use a different grip whilst serving as opposed to your groundstrokes. I just use my forehand grip for every shot. Yes, that sounds worse, but bear with me.
They introduced me to the continental, or, hammer grip. It's suggested that you use that grip for serves, volleys, overheads, and the two-hand backhand. And while I couldn't replicate it on the spot, I've put in a lot of work since then. I've played a couple of times and my serve is definitely better with the new grip. Obviously, there's still lots of room for improvement in terms of power, accuracy, and consistency, but when it does work, it feels like a normal tennis serve.
That gives me confidence. I've been playing tennis for five years, with success at the club level, and I've been holding the racquet wrong the entire time?
That's saying, well, it's saying something. Most likely that I'm an idiot, but I think it bodes well for my game when I can actually serve properly consistently.
And to help with the muscle memory, I've been spending five minutes a day holding my racquet in the continental grip and pantomiming proper shot technique. Yes, I probably look insane, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
And I'm less than three weeks away until Tournament #2.
PanARMENIAN.Net – Boeing has revealed a concept design for a hypersonic aircraft that could reach most locations in the world within one to three hours, Dezeen reports.
The American aerospace company showed a rendering of what the plane could look like at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Atlanta this week.
Boeing said the design was based on current research by company engineers, who are looking at passenger travel as one of many possible applications for the hypersonic technology they are developing.

When you make a bet on Twitter, do you have to follow through?
There's been plenty of times we've seen celebrities make outlandish statements on Twitter: Stranger Things' David Harbour who promised to be in a student's yearbook photos if she got 25,000 retweets, and if the Cleveland Cavaliers win the NBA Finals, Cleveland Browns player Damarious Randall has promised to buy everyone who retweeted his post a jersey.
Tennis star Genie Bouchard even said she'd go on a date with a Twitter follower if the Patriots won the Superbowl in 2017.
READ MORE: Genie Bouchard follows through on Super Bowl Twitter bet, goes on date with Pats fan
Though Harbour and Bouchard followed through (we'll have to wait to see if Randall does), there are others out there who haven't.
NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers once said, “he'd put his salary” on defending his friend Ryan Braun of the MLB in a doping scandal in a tweet to a man named Todd Sutton.
When Braun was suspended for violating the league's drug policy in 2013, Sutton asked for Rodgers to pay up.
READ MORE: Twitter is changing its privacy policy; here's how to opt out of what it shares on you
He even told USA Today this week that he'd settle for a game cheque instead of Rodgers' full-year salary (for comparison, USA Today reports that would be about US$281,250 compared to Rodgers' yearly earnings of US$61 million.)
But is Rodgers legally required to hand over the money?
Not in Canada, gaming lawyer Michael Lipton explained.
Lipton, a partner at Dickinson Wright law firm in Toronto, said that while Twitter bets can be valid, this one, in particular, doesn't meet the requirements.
So what makes a Twitter bet valid?
It's similar to a bar bet – when two people bet on the outcome of an event in a casual situation, for example, a bar.
“Theoretically, that is enforceable,” Lipton explained. “It really comes down to a contract where you have an offer, acceptance and you have what is called consideration.”
Consideration is what binds the offer and acceptance, he said.
WATCH: New rules for online gambling
First off, Lipton explains that you'd have to check if the bet is legal. Most types of gambling are illegal when it's not regulated by the provincial government. But private bets are exempt from this.
Since the bet – whether it's a bar bet or on Twitter – is a private bet between individuals, it doesn't violate the Canadian Criminal Code.
Then you have to check if “the parties intend to enter into commercial contractual relations that were binding on each other,” Lipton explained.
He said the people involved have to agree on the stakes – and both people have to put up something of value.
“So there has to be statements for that. Bear in mind that a private bet between individuals is where each of you gets a certain sum of money, or something of value,” Lipton said.
“Each [person has] exposed ourselves for consideration.”
So in the case of Sutton and Rodgers, it's not enforceable because Sutton didn't agree to put money or something else of value on the table.
In this case, it's mere “puffery,” Lipton explained.
“People often say certain things which courts will say, ‘Come on, you don't really mean that.'”
It's a high-profile investigation drawing the world's attention, stretching police resources and placing pressure on Toronto's homicide squad. This much was said in the wake of the deaths of billionaire pharmaceutical magnate Barry Sherman and his philanthropist wife Honey, killed in their home last December under still-mysterious circumstances. It was echoed only weeks later, when police announced the arrest of Bruce McArthur, an alleged serial killer who stands accused of killing eight men since 2010, dismembering and burying some of their bodies in planters at a Leaside home. Now, in the wake of Monday's van rampage, Toronto police homicide investigators are yet again probing a major incident on the world stage, one involving mass casualties and injuries. Alek Minassian, 25, stands accused of 10 counts of first-degree murder and 14 counts of attempted murder. Read more:

“I can't recall a time when there have been three high-profile murders of this magnitude in such a short period of time,” said Mark Mendelson, a former Toronto police homicide investigator. Much of the considerable work that lies ahead requires strength in numbers, Mendelson said, and at a news conference Tuesday, police Chief Mark Saunders said “the GTA collectively called to pitch in.” Acknowledging that the ongoing investigation is taking place on a stretch of “the busiest strip in the country,” Saunders said outside agencies stepped up to help in the vital hours, aiding to expedite the probe without compromising it.

Specialized traffic reconstruction resources were provided by York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police and the Ontario Provincial Police to help perform a complete reconstruction of the van's path. Officers are collecting evidence aimed at determining everything from where the van travelled, the speed at which it drove, where the vehicle mounted the curb, the location where each person was struck, and more. Officers will still have a massive task ahead after the initial collection of evidence at the scene is completed — including finishing the grim task of identifying the deceased. Dr. Dirk Huyer, chief coroner for Ontario, told a news conference Tuesday that it will be several days before his office can finalize the process of identification, though some families have been notified that their loved one is likely dead. Officers will also have to get statements from victims and witnesses as well as sift through reams of photo and video collected from the scene and surveillance footage from nearby businesses. Toronto police have set up a special web portal for anyone to upload images or video from the scene. The wealth of video in this case, some of it already posted to social media, will be a huge asset to the investigation, but will extremely time consuming to go through, Mendelson said. Investigators are also now seeking judicial authorizations, including production orders, which will allow officers to search Minassian's home and likely, his cellphone and any computers he might have. Det.-Sgt. Graham Gibson, the lead homicide cop on the case, would not comment on whether police had already gained access to Minassian's residence. In short, much work lies ahead. “As you can imagine the investigation is extremely detailed, and ongoing,” Gibson told reporters Tuesday. Asked if police resources were stretched from what is now three large-scale investigations in recent months, Saunders said he is “very comfortable” with where he stands. “Everybody steps up to the plate in time of need,” Saunders said.

The University of Toledo Press will host an Open House on Wednesday, May 9 showcasing its latest publications. With a diverse catalog, the Press offers something for every kind of reader, along with a chance to support and learn about one of our community's educational assets.
Evolving with the region
The May 9 event will feature recently published books, with authors available for autographs and discussion. Notable works include “Hindsight” by photographer Ben Morales, a stark photographic depiction of significant buildings in the region, and the multi-authored “Caps, Capes and Caring,” a work that documents the history of eight Toledo-based nursing schools and their graduates. Attendees can also pick up a copy of “From Glaciers to Glass: Volume 1,” a compendium of Northwest Ohio history, along with an autographed copy of David Ossman's “Sullen Art,” which showcases interviews and careers of renowned American poets.
The Press publishes manuscripts relevant to our region, including everything from local poetry chapbooks and academic journals to Northwest Ohio history and art. The Open House is an opportunity to support our local University Press. Managing Editor Yarko Kuk, who sees manuscripts through the publication process from start to finish, stressed that, as a collegiate institution, the University Press plays a vital role in making regional art and history available to the public. “Over the years, the role of University Presses has evolved, and while scholarship is still an important aspect of their mission, many have diversified into a variety of other areas,” Kuk said. The editor mentioned recent publications “The Calling” (Grubb) and “Can I Get A Witness” (Rockford) as further examples of the Press's mission to expand its catalogue.
Local focus
During the event, visitors will have the chance to meet locally focused authors. Patricia Beach, one of the five nurses who authored “Caps, Capes and Caring,” remarked that her inspiration to write about a local issue came from personal experience and a need to to preserve and protect Toledo's history.
Cap spans nearly a century in the nursing field, and details eight different schools in the Toledo area via first-hand accounts from nursing graduates. When asked about the inspiration for “Caps,” Beach replied, “Who would remember these things from the past? Who would tell the stories? [ . . . ] People spoke to us and trusted us with their memories. It became our responsibility to share these memories in the best way we could.”
Kuk stressed that events like the Open House fit well with the continued growth of the Press, with new titles by UT grads and community members soon announced for 2018 and 2019. “The UT Press is proud to produce books that document the rich culture and history of our area and its people,” he said. “We try to serve as caretakers of our community's narrative and identity.”

It will be a happy New Year indeed for millions of the lowest-paid U.S. workers. Nineteen states, including New York and California, will ring in the year with an increase in the minimum wage.Massachusetts and Washington state will have the highest new minimum wages in the country, at $11 per hour.California will raise its wage to $10.50 for businesses with 26 or more employees. New York state is taking a regional approach, with the wage rising to $11 in New York City, to $10.50 for small businesses in the city, $10 in its downstate suburbs and $9.70 elsewhere. Some specific businesses - fast-food restaurants and the smallest New York City businesses - will have slightly different wage requirements."This $1.50 increase, I cannot even comprehend or tell you how important this will be," said Alvin Major, a New York City fast-food worker. The 51-year-old father of four helped lead the fight for the increase in his state, one of several successful efforts by fast-food workers and other low wageworkers around the country. "The price of food has gone up. Rent has gone up. Everything has gone up. ... This will make a difference for so many people."Voters in Arizona, Maine, Colorado and Washington approved increases in this year's election. Seven other states, Alaska, Florida, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio and South Dakota, are automatically raising the wage based on indexing. The other states seeing increases are Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan and Vermont.Additional increases are slated for later in the year in Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Maryland.In Arizona, the state Chamber of Commerce and Industry filed a lawsuit challenging the increase, which will raise the minimum wage from $8.05 to $10. On Thursday, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to temporarily block the raise.Workers and labor advocates argue the increases will help low-wage workers now barely making ends meet and boost the economy by giving some consumers more money to spend. But many business owners opposed the higher wages, saying they would lead to higher prices and greater automation.Some restaurant owners may consider reducing portion sizes or charging for side dishes that were once included in the price of a meal to absorb the increase, according to Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association."I'm sure prices will go up where they can, but restaurants want to avoid sticker shock," she said. "They're going to have to get creative."The adjustments in New York, California and several other states are part of a series of gradual increases to a $12 or $15 hourly wage.The minimum wage will also go up this weekend in 22 cities and counties, including San Diego, San Jose and Seattle.The high number of states and localities raising the wage this year reflects the successful work of fast-food workers and organized labor, according to Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, as well as federal inaction on the wage. The national minimum was last raised, to $7.25, in 2009."These aren't only teens trying to make some pocket money," she said. "Increasingly it's adults who are using this money to support their families."
NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. – A trapeze artist from a renowned family of daredevils is planning to hang by her teeth from a helicopter over Niagara Falls today.
The stunt by aerialist Erendira Vasquez Wallenda comes on the fifth anniversary of her husband's tight-rope walk over the falls.
According to organizers, the chopper will hover about 100 metres above the Horseshoe Falls.

Members of the Wallenda family have gained fame as a circus act.
In 2012, Nik Wallenda walked 550 metres from the American side of the falls to the Canadian side.
Today's televised stunt, hyped by local authorities, is expected to last about seven minutes.
It seems that China's leaders have now forsaken Deng Xiaoping's advice to tao guang yang hui («keep a low profile»). In declaring a «new era» for China during October's 19th National Congress in Beijing, President Xi Jinping presented the Chinese system of governance as a model for other countries to emulate. Leaders who «want to speed up their development while preserving their independence,» Xi said, should look to China as «a new option.»
About the author Pranab Bardhan is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
Developing countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, seem awestruck by this possibility. China's official news agency, Xinhua, has even suggested that as the West's democracies falter, «enlightened Chinese democracy» could offer a path forward.
Amid all the lofty rhetoric, it is worth asking: what, precisely, is the Chinese model of economic and political development? And, is it actually preferable to the alternatives?
Authoritarianism is not indispensable
China's model comprises a number of key characteristics, including authoritarian governance buttressed by the perception of stability; state-guided industrial policy and finance; massive infrastructure investments; rural industrialization backed by small-scale agriculture; and openness to foreign trade and technology. This model has, no doubt, produced rapid economic growth in China over the last three decades, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
But the implication that the first ingredient – authoritarianism – is necessary for rapid development misses the mark. In fact, it is this characteristic of the Chinese system that should give other countries the greatest pause.
Consider China's East Asian neighbors – in particular, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Each has achieved high growth through state-guided industrial policy, rural industrialization, and openness to trade. But Japan achieved these objectives within the framework of its postwar democracy, while South Korea and Taiwan have been democracies for three decades. Authoritarianism, in other words, served no necessary modernizing role.
Democracy prevents huge errors
Democracy is, to be sure, exasperatingly slow and often contentious. But its deliberative and electoral processes help mitigate conflicts, especially in heterogeneous and conflict-ridden societies. Even in a more homogeneous country like China, the absence of open public discourse does the opposite, as evidenced by the state's mishandling of ethnic unrest among Tibetans and Uighurs.
Without a strong civil society or an independent judiciary to check government power, Chinese leaders have, on many occasions, made catastrophic errors in judgment. Look no further than Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution.
Xi, too, has blundered. For example, his decision to order China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to prop up China's falling stock market in 2015 was an epic miscalculation. Once foreign exchange reserves held by the People's Bank of China stopped flowing to struggling SOEs, the market fell to the same low levels as before intervention. By that point, hundreds of billions of dollars had been wasted.
Lack of transparency
The absence of political checks and institutional mechanisms for public scrutiny has also encouraged abuse of power and high levels of corruption, contributing to high inequality, arbitrary land grabs, unsafe working conditions, food safety scares, and toxic pollution, among other problems. While Xi's energetic anti-corruption efforts may stem some injustices, without fundamental political reform, his campaign against dishonest party officials is likely to be a Sisyphean task – when it is not merely a ploy to curb potential political rivals.
Economic management suffers from similar opacity. At the moment, there are few, if any, checks on debt-fueled investment by SOEs or politically connected firms. This shortcoming, to the extent that it results in massive misallocation of capital, is and will remain a source of major macroeconomic uncertainty for China.
As China's economy becomes more complex, the absence of transparent and accountable governance processes, combined with frequent crackdowns on civil society and efforts to enforce conformity and discipline, will ultimately stifle entrepreneurship and innovation. It does not help that, while China's expenditure on research and development as a share of GDP is now quite high, much of it is in the public sector. If the SOEs remain too-big-to-fail, this will create a further drag on innovation. As China graduates from the «catch-up» phase of economic development, addressing this constraint will only become more important.
In the end, democracy is more resilient
The lack of openness and transparency could also test political stability. In the face of crisis, China's leaders often overreact by repressing dissent. Collective and pragmatic leadership in recent decades has done a reasonable job of managing the problem, but Xi's consolidation of power, and the cult of personality surrounding him, could exacerbate instability.
Democratic governments, for all their messiness, are less fragile, as they draw their legitimacy from pluralism and political contestation, rather than from high economic growth or nationalist appeals. Judicial decisions overturning President Donald Trump's arbitrary travel bans in the United States, or similar rebukes of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to criminalize dissent, are examples of how institutional autonomy strengthens the resilience of democratic political systems – resilience that China lacks.
China's unique culture of meritocracy
Despite the official narrative, most of the features of the Chinese system of governance that Xi has championed have little to do with him. They are vestiges of China's imperial or early communist governments: a performance-based meritocratic promotion system; an organizational framework that ensures top-down loyalty without compromising the quality of local governance; and a unique system of political centralization combined with economic and administrative decentralization.
In other words, for all its allure, the Chinese model is deficient in some basic respects, and not easily reproducible in others. Any country that takes to heart Xi's invitation to emulate China but does not have a similar organizational history will likely be unsatisfied. Not only is China politically unique, but it also possesses a large and increasingly prosperous domestic market that enables it to lure foreign investment on its own terms.
So, no matter what the Middle Kingdom's newest emperor might claim, development with Chinese characteristics is really only for China.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has learned to be elusive in the pocket. He seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to feeling rushers coming and moving in the pocket to avoid them.
But that's only gotten him so far in 2017 when he's taken 16 sacks and 33 quarterback hits. His pass protection has been letting him down on many occasions. Brady was slow getting up through the Patriots 19-14 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday.
“Just football. I'll be there next Sunday,” Brady said in a postgame press conference in Tampa.
Brady stayed on the ground for an extended period of time on a few occasions against the Buccaneers. He came up limping. He stretched his neck and shoulder. Despite obvious maladies, he didn't seem fazed. After the game, he said he wished he could have scored more points. But the offense scored just enough, as Brady was 30 of 40 for 303 yards, one touchdown and an interception.
Despite being on pace to take 106 hits and 48 sacks, Brady is also on pace to throw for 5,446 passing yards and 35 touchdown passes.
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): The whirling dervishes from the brotherly
country Republic of Turkey swirled the souls of devotees with their affectionate performance at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA).
Specially flown from Istanbul to participate in the 70th Independence
Day celebration of Pakistan, the Istanbul Historical Turkish Music Ensemble attracted a huge crowd to the Grand Music Show, one of the month-long series of events being organized by the PNCA to mark the Pakistan's Independence Day.
A 30-minute performance was an unusual experience of spiritual journey
of tranquillity, peace and fulfilment. The presentation included naat, reed flute improvisations, peshrev, the sultan veled cycle, four selams and a prayer.
The ensemble, which was started in 1991 by Republic of Turkey, Ministry
of Culture, has been founded to present the original style and performance characteristics of the Classical Turkish Music especially the Sufi Music (Tasavvuf) and Military Music (Mehter), which are of the outstanding values of Turkish culture, and to make observations on this area. The ensembles, following this goal, first establish the community of the artists and the other equipment, repertory studies and style performances, now they perform to the audience by giving concerts.
The music from all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK was also
presented. The singers included renowned Shaukat Ali, Ghulam Abbas, Akhtar Channal Zahri group from Balochistan, Zafar Ali group from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Bano Rehmat from AJK, Gulshan Jehan, Usman Ali Raees and Raga Boys.
A 16-member National Performing Arts Group (NPAG) also presented a
thrilling performance on the song “Pakistan banana hae”. Clad in different regional and national attires, the young artistes gripped the theatre with their synchronised moves and spontaneous expressions.
Earlier, the PNCA Director General Syed Jamal Shah thanked the Turkish
Ambassador S. Bab'r Girgin for bringing the Ensemble to the Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations. He said both countries have deep rooted friendly and brotherly relations for the decades. Both countries can learn from each other through the exchange of art and cultural and joint initiatives.
Turkish Ambassador S. Bab'r Girgin thanked Pakistan for every support
in the hour of need. He said Turkey would prove to be sincere friend to Pakistan in all times. He said there are many spheres where both countries can cooperate to boost mutually beneficial ties.
The Director Devcom-Pakistan Munir Ahmed while talking to this scribe
said the music show was a great experience of the cultural bouquet where every colour was evident of its regional identity that assembled Pakistan's fragrance. The cultural harmony among the regional identities can bring the cohesive national life that can avert any conflict of any sort.
Fahmida Gul, a poetess, termed the show a unique experience of musical
diversity from all parts of the country. The Raga Boys recaptured the tunes of old masters such as Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and Asad Amanat Ali Khan besides singing some popular numbers of their father Ustad Hamid Ali Khan.
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper proposed Tuesday what he called a compromise to repeal the state's so-called bathroom bill, saying a new measure is designed to allay fears over public bathroom safety.
A spokeswoman for a leader of the Republican-controlled legislature immediately suggested it didn't go far enough, citing privacy concerns in a signal that any agreement between the governor and legislators still wasn't near.
The law, known as House Bill 2, triggered backlash from businesses and LGBT advocates who say it's discriminatory because it requires transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. It also excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from local and statewide antidiscrimination protections. A federal trial to decide HB2 is scheduled to begin later this summer.
Cooper's proposal comes as New Orleans welcomes the NBA All-Star game this weekend. The city of Charlotte was supposed to host multimillion-dollar event, but the NBA moved the game after the law was passed. The NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference also moved several sporting events in the state and businesses such as PayPal decided not to expand in North Carolina.

Cooper said his compromise "will bring back the NCAA, it will bring back the ACC, the NBA and it will bring back jobs."
The proposal does away with House Bill 2 and increases penalties for crimes in public bathrooms, the governor said at a news conference with the top Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. It would also tell local governments seeking ordinances covering sexual orientation and gender identity to give legislators 30 days' notice before doing so. Bills detailing the proposal were to be filed later Tuesday.
The office of one Republican General Assembly leader scoffed at the plan.
It does "nothing to address the basic privacy concerns of women and young girls who do not feel comfortable using the bathroom, undressing and showering in the presence of men," said Amy Auth, a spokeswoman for Senate leader Phil Berger.
In December, an apparent deal between Cooper and the GOP-controlled legislature to repeal HB2 collapsed. Interest picked up in recent days after a statewide sports development association warned legislators in a letter that action must be taken very soon or the state would be disqualified from hosting NCAA events for the next five years.
VAN WERT COUNTY, Ohio (WOWO) – The Van Wert County Sheriff's Office is conducting an investigation after numerous mail thefts were reported in northwest Ohio and throughout several counties in Indiana.
Sheriff Thomas M. Riggenbach reports the thefts are believed to have happened during the last ten days.
The Sheriff's Office has spoken with several known mail theft victims, but if a resident believes they may also be a victim, they should contact the Van Wert County Sheriff's Office at (419) 238-3866.
Sheriff Riggenbach is also asking that anyone who notices any suspicious activity in their neighborhoods to contact the Sheriff's Office immediately. Suspicious activity may include the following:
A person/vehicle stays in the same place for an unusual length of time.
A parked car with the engine running, regardless if a person is inside or not.
A person behaving odd or exhibiting unusual movements, appearing out of place, or is wandering around.
A person concealing an object, carrying a weapon or suspicious bag.
A person looking into windows of homes for no reason, or forcibly entering a car or home.
A person looking into cars, moving from car to car, or trying door handles.
A person running from a home for no reason, especially at night.
A person carrying or transporting unusual valuable objects day or night.
A person selling or conducting business out of their car, van, truck or other vehicle.
A vehicle driving around your block frequently, slowing down and speeding up.
A vehicle without lights on arriving or leaving late at night.
A person leaving a neighbor's house, who isn't a neighbor or someone you recognize.
Sheriff Riggenbach wants to encourage residents to refrain from putting mail out the night before it is picked up, and to make sure they remove their mail from their mailbox each day.
RIVERSIDE – A coalition of politicians, police and community activists today urged Riverside County residents to check whether their vehicles' airbags are under a nationwide recall that was implemented following several deadly deployments, including one involving a Corona woman.
“As a lifelong resident of Riverside County, and in my capacity as a city council member, I am deeply invested in the safety and security of our community,” said Corona City Councilman Randy Fox. “I join … in lending my voice and support to ensuring all members of our community, including diverse, low-income and under-served populations, are educated about the gravity and magnitude of the airbag recall.”
Fox is a member of Airbag Recall: Southern California, a public interest group dedicated to raising awareness about the potential dangers of faulty airbags connected to the Takata recall implemented by U.S. Department of Transportation. The councilman joined colleagues for a news briefing at Riverside City Hall.
The federal government has expanded the recall several times since its original order went out, identifying 42 million vehicles as at risk. Eleven deaths have been blamed on malfunctions of inflators produced by Tokyo-based Takata Corporation.
One of the victims, 50-year-old Delia Robles, died last Sept. 30 when the driver's side airbag in her 2001 Honda Civic burst after she struck a pickup truck head-on at 25 mph. She died a short time later at Riverside Community Hospital.
“Less than one year ago, a member of our community lost her life when the recalled airbag in her vehicle exploded like a grenade, spraying sharp, metal shrapnel at her face, neck and chest,” said Riverside Mayor Rusty Bailey. “We must work together to address the hundreds of thousands of vehicles that contain defective airbags in Riverside County and prevent additional tragedies from occurring on our roadways.”
John Buretta, identified as a designated “monitor” of the Takata recall, said county residents should “fix it, don't risk it.”
“Even a minor fender bender can be fatal,” he said. “It's imperative—and easy–to look up your vehicle identification number now at www.AirbagRecall.com.”
The vehicles considered at highest risk of containing faulty inflators were manufactured between 2001 and 2003 and are mostly Hondas and Acuras.
However, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall applies to vehicles that rolled off of the assembly line as late as 2015.
Nineteen automakers have been impacted. Airbags are to be replaced for free.
More information about the recall is available here: https://www.safercar.gov/
Armed with a new singer in Aussie novelist/poet Jessica Bell, synthpop outfit Keep Shelly in Athens are readying a new album suited just for the summer. Dubbed Philokalia, it's due out September 29th via their own Athenian Aura Recordings.
Spanning eight tracks, it serves as the Greek group's third to date and follows 2015's Now I'm Ready. The album's title comes from the name for a body of spiritual texts written between the 4th and 15th centuries, and its lead single, “Leave In Silence” seems to mirror that air of serenity.
Here, Bell's voice floats weightlessly above a hazy yet tranquil mix of softly glowing synths and flickering percussion. Queue this one up for those humid August nights. Check it out below.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has expelled almost 40,000 Pakistani migrant workers in the last four months, local media has reported.
Over 39,000 people have been deported since October 2016 over visa violations and security concerns, the Saudi Gazette reported, citing unnamed interior ministry officials. As well as crimes including drug trafficking, forgery and theft, an unknown number of those removed from the country were suspected to have links to Isis and other extremist groups, the paper said.
The alleged mass deportations come after a year of strikes and other unrest in the kingdom due to unpaid wages following the oil market's decline and subsequent blow to the Saudi economy.
Official Saudi statistics say that 243,000 Pakistanis were deported between 2012 - 2015. Mass deportations of migrant workers - which Human Rights Watch and other rights organisations say often involve illegal beatings and detainment in poor conditions - are fairly common.
2010 census figures show that 8.5 million of Saudi Arabia's 27 million strong population, or around 30 per cent, are foreign nationals.
According to a 2014 European University Institute report, there are approximately 900,000 people of Pakistani nationality currently employed in Saudi Arabia's vast construction industry and other low-paid service jobs.
In Mecca in January, dozens of expatriate workers, mostly from poor Asian and Middle Eastern countries, were beaten and jailed over public protests against unpaid salaries that turned violent.
While the Philippines and India have also seen hundreds of thousands of citizens returned home after lay-offs in Saudi Arabia, the deportation of Pakistani workers has been mainly driven by security concerns, the New Arab reported.
Several prominent Saudi politicians, including Abdullah Al-Sadoun, chair of the security committee of the country's Shura Council, have called for tougher screening processes for Pakistani nationals before they are allowed entry into the country.
“Pakistan itself is plagued with terrorism due to its close proximity with Afghanistan. The Taliban extremist movement was itself born in Pakistan,” he said.
Approximately 80 Pakistani nationals are currently in prison in Saudi Arabia charged with terror or security related offences.
In 2016, 35-year-old Abdullah Gulzar Khan, a Pakistani citizen who had lived and worked in Saudi Arabia legally for the previous 12 years, blew himself up in a suicide attack near the US consulate in Jeddah. No other injuries were reported in the incident.
Two Pakistani nationals as well as one Sudanese and one Syrian were also arrested for allegedly planning a terror attack on a football match between the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates in Jeddah's Al-Jawhara Stadium last year.

Capitol Report

President Donald Trump has said he's “looking forward” to the prospect of sitting down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But privately, increasing members of Trump's legal team are vehemently urging him to decline any invitation to talk to Mueller.
Negotiations are continuing. But constitutional law experts have already theorized that if the White House does choose defiance and Mueller responds with a subpoena, it would likely set up a high-stakes legal showdown — one in which the special counsel might have the upper hand.
A decision by the White House to reject Mueller's request for a voluntary interview would signal a clear shift in the legal team's game plan from reluctant cooperation to outright delay. From all indications, Trump's legal team has been split as to its legal defense strategy. As illustrated by the fact that before his resignation, White House lawyer Ty Cobb had reportedly continued to argue for full cooperation while Trump's private attorneys, Jay Sekulow and John Dowd, who was then leading discussions with Mueller's office on the issue, were arguing against a sit-down interview.
Moreover, one could argue that Dowd's subsequent departure raises new questions about the direction of Trump's legal strategy and clearly signals a more aggressive posture on Trump's part. As evident by the fact that before leaving the White House, Dowd had consistently urged the President to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe and resist attacking him publicly.
Trump has countered by bringing in some new minions to his defense effort who harbor a more aggressive approach. This, in turn, has paved the way for Trump to step up his attacks on the special counsel and has emboldened him to release his version of the kraken: Rudy Giuliani.
If Trump ultimately declines an interview with Mueller, things could escalate quickly, according to legal experts. Mueller's team would likely issue a subpoena asking a court to compel the president to appear before the grand jury. Trump might then comply and take the stand, where he could take the politically risky step of pleading the Fifth or telling the jury he does not recall the answers to key questions.
More likely, Trump's legal team would move to quash the subpoena, arguing that a sitting president shouldn't be required to take time and resources away from his official duties to be questioned in an ongoing criminal investigation, and that Mueller's queries extend beyond his mandate to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.
After a round of litigation in district court, the matter would likely then go to the D.C. Court of Appeals and all the way up to the U.S. Supreme court. History offers some pointers on the legal question of whether the president can be forced to testify in civil or criminal litigation. But past commanders-in-chief have either left office before doing so, as Richard Nixon did amid the Watergate scandal, or ultimately agreed to voluntary interviews, as Bill Clinton did with the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and George W. Bush did during the Valerie Plame affair.
The Nixon ruling makes it compelling for Mueller to obtain presidential testimony under the theory that nobody is above the law, which most legal experts think is sound legal precedent. But make no mistakes, there continue to be arguments that can and will be made that [special counsel] questioning can't be open-ended and has got to be narrowly tailored in scope.
There is one thing we should all know now about Donald Trump; he only has one gear: attack mode. Trump thinks he knows everything; has never done anything thing wrong; and completely believes he's above the law. It remains to be seen whether the two other branches of government (Congress and the Supreme Court) will hold him to task, if the situation arises.
Nova Scotia's chief public health officer says you should keep your eye out for ticks as the weather warms up.
Dr. Robert Strang says it's important to enjoy the outdoors, but it should be done safely. He says just as you protect yourself from the sun, you should also protect yourself from ticks.
“Even though ticks can be around for most of the year, the risk can increase as the days become warmer,” Dr. Strang says.

There are several places where ticks live, including the woods, shrubs and long grass. They can also carry viruses like Lyme disease.
Dr. Strang says it's important to prepare yourself before enjoying the milder temperatures.
“We really recommend that you wear long clothing, long pants, tuck the pants into the socks … and one of the most important things, once you come inside at the end of the day, is doing a tick check,” Dr. Strang says.
WATCH: Ticks and Lyme disease prevention tips
Those tick checks can be done by taking a shower and checking your body for anything out of the norm. Dr. Strang says it's important to check around ears, behind knees, in the hair, between the legs and in the groin area, and around the waist.
“Ticks have to be on the body for 24 to 36 hours to be able to transmit a disease like Lyme disease, so taking the preventative steps and doing a tick check every day are very important in preventing any kind of tick-born disease,” he says.

If you do notice a tick bite, Dr. Strang says it's important to immediately contact a primary care provider.

Former premier Christy Clark has landed a job at a law firm as she officially moves on from political life.
Clark, who lost her post last July when the NDP-Green coalition was allowed to form government, had retired as leader of the BC Liberals in August.
The province's longest serving female premier has taken a step back from public life for the past year, surfacing Wednesday with an announcement that she was joining Bennett Jones.

(Reuters) - The three major U.S. stocks indexes ended higher on Friday, snapping three days of losses, as investors bet on slower U.S. rate hikes, but gains were muted by increasingly aggressive exchanges between the United States and North Korea.
Weaker-than-expected July consumer price data led investors to bet that benign inflation would keep the U.S. Federal Reserve from raising rates again this year.
While this gave investors some hope after a jittery week, there were still signs of nervousness in choppy late afternoon trading, primarily due to ongoing threats between the United States and North Korea.
President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. military was "locked and loaded," while Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war. He told reporters in the late afternoon that he hoped North Korea "fully" understood the gravity of his warning about taking military action against the United States or its allies.
While the data gave investors appetite for growth sectors such as information technology and biotechnology it soured them to rate-sensitive stocks such as banks, said Keith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist, SunTrust Advisory services in Atlanta.
"There's not a great incentive to buy big. You're less than 2 percent off the high for the S&P heading into a weekend where uncertainty with North Korea still lingers," said Lerner.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.31 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,858.32, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.11 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,441.32 while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 39.68 points, or 0.64 percent, to 6,256.56.
For the week the S&P fell 1.4 percent and the Dow lost 1.1 percent - their largest weekly drops since the week ending March 24 - and the Nasdaq was off 1.5 percent.
Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, said he was reassured after Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan said the Fed needs evidence of progress toward its inflation goal before raising rates.

"If earnings can stay strong and interest rates remain low, investors can look beyond North Korea and continue to rally equities," said Phipps.
Traders saw the chance of a rate hike in December falling to 40 percent from 42 percent before Friday's data, according to Federal funds futures.
Nearly $1 trillion has been wiped out from global equity markets since Trump's vow on Tuesday to unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea if it threatens the United States.
Five of the 11 major S&P sectors ended higher, with technology's .SPLRCT 0.75-percent rise leading the advancers.
But the S&P Bank sub-sector .SPXBK fell 0.7 percent on dimming prospects of another rate hike this year since higher rates tend to boost bank profits.
While the Russell 2000 index ended up 0.1 percent on the day, it was more than 5 percent below its July 25 record close and for the week it fell 2.7 percent, its biggest weekly drop since February 2016.
Shares of Snap (SNAP.N) ended down 14 percent after hitting a record low following a miss on revenue and daily active users. At least 12 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock.
J.C. Penney (JCP.N) finished down 16.6 percent after hitting a record low following the retailer's bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.
Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliner on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
About 6.15 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.29 billion average for the last 20 sessions.
Although Jennifer Lopez and Drake are earning descriptions such as “really happy” in their new romance, his ex-girlfriend Rihanna, who also is supposedly a close friend of J. Lo's, allegedly is upset by their fling and had hoped to rekindle her own romance with the rapper. Moreover, Rihanna “can't believe that her ex-boyfriend” has become involved with “someone like Jennifer,” according to sources cited by Celeb Dirty Laundry. Reportedly informing family and close friends that Drake ranks as her “one true love,” Rihanna secretly had hopes that the two could reignite the flames of their romance, claim the insiders. And despite the on-again, off-again nature of their relationship, Rihanna “knows that one day she'll ultimately end up spending the rest of her life with him,” according to those sources, who also revealed Rihanna's alleged envy of Drake and Lopez. Drake kisses Rihanna on stage. [Image by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images] “[Rihanna] is completely jealous over their relationship.” But while that's how Rihanna allegedly feels, Drake and Lopez are sending out signals like a couple truly in love, with their intimate cuddle session photos surprising their followers on Instagram. Rihanna reportedly unfollowed Jennifer after the canoodling pictures went viral. At this point, although there is speculation that Rihanna might be plotting a “new revenge song,” she is “absolutely devastated” over the romance between her ex-boyfriend and her supposed pal, according to the insiders. In addition, an insider told Hollywood Life that the photo of her ex-boyfriend and J. Lo hugging “made Rihanna sick to the point where she wanted to throw her phone down three flights of stairs.” A photo posted by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Dec 27, 2016 at 11:38pm PST However, the source also claimed that Rihanna “is just glad it's not her falling for this BS,” alleging that the “only thing” the rapper has “ever been good at is talking a good game and never following through.” As for whether Drake might have any lingering feelings for Rihanna? The rapper just dissed Rihanna on New Year's Eve, according to the Daily Beast. During a performance at an event on New Year's Eve at a Vegas hot spot, his DJ played the Rihanna song “Work.” But as that collaboration between Rihanna and her ex played, Drake threw shade at Rihanna with his proclamation. “That was an old vibe.” The rapper then reportedly ordered the DJ to switch the track at the event, which included sightings of Jennifer partying and reportedly dancing on tables. Lopez allegedly even canceled her own $1 million New Year's Eve performance in Miami to be there for her boyfriend. When it comes to how Rihanna is feeling at this point about J. Lo, she reportedly viewed her as a “mentor and friend of hers, and considers it strange that she's chosen to date her recent ex,” noted the media outlet. Rihanna and Drake delighted fans when they performed together, but now he's dating her supposed pal Jennifer Lopez. [Image by Ian Gavan/Getty Images] Rihanna and Drake have a long history together ranging from light-hearted (shark tattoos that match) to dark (he reportedly became involved in a “bottle-throwing match” with Rihanna's boyfriend at the time, Chris Brown, in 2012), according to the media outlet. However, Rihanna and Drake reportedly split in October. Now, leaving Rihanna behind, Drake has moved on with Jennifer, and a source cited by Yahoo described their feelings for each other. “Jennifer and Drake seem really happy.” Although there have been reports that Lopez's on-again, off-again boyfriend Casper Smart is attempting to woo her back, the source revealed that the one “certain” element in J. Lo's romantic life is that “there is no way she is going back to” Smart. The actress/songstress “moved on months ago,” added the insider. “[Casper Smart] keeps trying to convince her he should have another chance but that door closed months ago,” emphasized the source. “That door is not only closed, it's sealed.” In contrast, the door is open when it comes to the rapper and Lopez, reported People, citing a source who revealed that he has visited her home and that she has “nothing but nice things to say” about her new boyfriend. “Jen is looking forward with excitement to the new year. She keeps hanging out with Drake.” The insider revealed that she “loves the attention,” and appears to be “very happy to be spending time with him,” noting that he is “very charming,” treating Jen “with lots of respect.” “She seems very smitten,” summed up the source.

Owens ranks second to Jerry Rice with 15,934 yards receiving and is third on the all-time touchdowns receiving list with 153.
Lewis is widely considered one of the greatest middle linebackers, winning two AP Defensive Player of the Year awards and earning eight All-Pro selections. He anchored a dominant defence for the 2000 Baltimore Ravens in a season that ended with him winning Super Bowl MVP, then retired as a champion after Baltimore closed his last season with a title win over San Francisco in February 2013.
"Growing up as a child, I know what that looked like, Mike Singletary, Dick Butkus," Lewis said. "Who dreams of being in that category, sitting with those guys?"
Lewis joined tackle Jonathan Ogden as the only Ravens voted into the Hall of Fame as both of the team's first-round picks in its initial season of 1996 received the high honour.
Lewis' career was also marked by legal problems off the field. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour charge of obstruction of justice after initially being charged with murder in connection with two killings following a Super Bowl party in Atlanta in January 2000. Lewis was also fined $250,000 by the NFL.
Urlacher wasn't far behind Lewis with his play on the field and is the latest in a line of great Chicago middle linebackers to make the Hall, joining Butkus, Singletary and Bill George. He was the Defensive Player of the Year of 2005 and joined Lewis on the 2000s all-decade team.
Dawkins spent most of his 16-year career in Philadelphia, earning five first-team All-Pro selections for his versatility that included 37 career interceptions and 26 career sacks. He became the first player in NFL history with a sack, interception, fumble recovery and touchdown catch in the same game against Houston in 2002.
Kramer got passed over 10 times previously as a finalist before finally getting enough votes as a senior to become the 14th member of the Vince Lombardi Packers to make the Hall. Kramer helped anchor the Green Bay line for 11 seasons, winning six NFL titles and making the block that cleared the way for Bart Starr's TD sneak in the "Ice Bowl" for the 1967 NFL championship.
Brazile was a finalist for the first time after a 10-year career for the Houston Oilers that included five straight All-Pro selections.
Beathard, also not on hand Saturday, helped build four Super Bowl champions in Miami and Washington and made seven trips to the title game during more than three decades as a personnel executive with a sharp eye for talent.
Five offensive linemen were among the 15 finalists, with tackle Joe Jacoby getting eliminated in voting that reduced the candidates to 10, and tackle Tony Boselli, guards Alan Faneca and Steve Hutchinson, and centre Kevin Mawae getting cut in the next round of voting.
Cornerback Ty Law also made it to the final 10 in his second time on the ballot. Defensive backs John Lynch and Everson Walls, receiver Isaac Bruce and running back Edgerrin James were the other candidates eliminated in the first cuts.
"I'm glad I didn't have to vote for this class," Urlacher said. "It's a great class."

Enjoy the sunshine for a few more days, because more rain is on the way.
The Bay Area's brief break from the rain is expected to end Thursday when the first in a series of four storms brings more wet stuff to the already-soggy region.
Back-to-back rounds of rain are expected Thursday and Friday as separate storm systems make their way through the Bay Area, according to Ryan Walbrun, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.
Followed by a brief respite part of the weekend — showers could linger Saturday morning — a third system is expected on Sunday night into Monday, followed by a fourth system Tuesday into Wednesday, according to the weather service.
Before the rain arrives, the Bay Area has one more day of sunny skies and temperatures in the mid to upper-60s.
The storms aren't expected to be as strong as some of the previous systems that caused widespread flooding and mudslides, Walbrun said. The first two storms could deliver rainfall totals ranging from 1 to 1.5 inches to most cities, with 1.5 to 3 inches in higher elevations, including the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Still, any additional rainfall on the already saturated Bay Area could pose problems.
“The amounts aren't overly extreme, but we're still recovering from all the rain we've had this year,” Walbrun said. “Reservoirs are full and streams respond quickly. That's the concern.”
One unique aspect of the storm on Friday is that the rainfall will be heaviest in Southern California, Walbrun said. The Bay Area will likely experience a “dreary, light rain” throughout Friday.
Walbrun said it's too early to predict how much rain will be delivered from the storms next week.
“Nonetheless it's going to be more rain,” Walbrun said. “It's going to be a very wet February after what was a very wet January.”
Rainfall totals throughout the Bay Area are all running above average for the season, which began on Oct. 1, including Santa Rosa, which has received a staggering 46.57 inches (198 percent of normal). Others include San Francisco at 21.86 inches (141 percent), Oakland at 19.09 inches (148 percent) and San Jose at 11.82 inches (123 percent).

Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos thinks the Big Ten's two highest-profile coaches are "running a little bit scared right now" of the Huskers, who begin a new chapter under coach Scott Frost.
Speaking Tuesday at a luncheon at the Omaha Press Club, Moos, who hired Frost months after he arrived from Washington State, said Nebraska football is ready to recapture the "golden era" under its new coach.

"We're gonna run that up-tempo offense we saw [at Saturday's spring game], and we're gonna get the Blackshirts [defense] back to being Blackshirts. And that's extremely important," Moos said, according to the Omaha World-Herald. "You've got Urban Meyer and Jim Harbaugh thinking, 'We better put a little more into that Nebraska game coming up.' And that's the way we want it. They're running a little bit scared right now. And they won't admit it. We'll leave that at that."
Frost will coach his first Big Ten game as Nebraska's coach against Harbaugh and Michigan on Sept. 22 in Ann Arbor, Mich., in the teams' first meeting since 2013. Nebraska will visit Ohio State on Nov. 3. Meyer is 3-0 against Nebraska as Ohio State's coach, and the Buckeyes have averaged 60.3 points in the games and won the last two by a combined scored of 118-17. Harbaugh has yet to face Nebraska since he became Michigan's coach.
Nebraska is coming off of a 4-8 season and seeking its first conference title since 1999, when it played in the Big 12. The Huskers entered the Big Ten in 2011 but have won their division just once.
ion of the church themed “Halleluyah”.
She stated at the meeting that compelling members of the church to participate in Aso ebi during special programmes in local assemblies was ungodly.
The news that some members of the church without financial power to buy such uniforms, were excluded from the programmes for which the uniforms were sown, was seriously repudiated by the church leadership.
She noted that Aso ebi which should ordinarily be for the family, must not be elevated to the point of making it to overshadow the spiritual life of the congregants.
She warned that such un-Christianly act of keeping church members out of programmes because of Aso ebi, must never be heard again among the women in the church, adding that those caught would be severely sanctioned.
He stated that the concept of appearing in compulsory uniformed attire for an occasion started with the world and should not be allowed to take a firm space in the church.
She also frowned on the idea of what is seen as petty lies during Christian wedding engagement, where those conducting such events would have to engage in lies to make money from the attendees.
Pastor Adeboye explained that with God, there is no white or black lie, small or big lie, stating that when attendees are asked to bring air fare to fly in, an item already provided for at the event venue, those involved are simply engaging in ungodly act which is a sin.
She called for moderation among Christian women, saying that their focus should be bringing halleluyah and spirituality into their homes and not engaging in the ungodly acts of the unbelievers.
The 2017 convention of the church also came to a close today, with millions of worshippers gathering together on the camp along Lagos/Ibadan expressway for the week-long event.
The highlights include numerous testimonies, prophesies of turn-around and victories as well as what could be tagged harvest of babies.
As of 4pm on Friday, a total of 74 new births had been recorded on the camp, with the breakdown showing 43 boys and 31 girls.
At the Friday Holy Ghost night attended by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo, thousands of babies were also brought forth for dedication.

Chris Silva scored a career high 16 points and tied his best with 11 rebounds to lead South Carolina to a 67-56 win over Mississippi on Saturday night.
The Gamecocks (14-3, 4-0 Southeastern) are off to their best league start since the 1997 team, which won South Carolina's only SEC regular season title.
PJ Dozier added 16 points for the Gamecocks, who never trailed despite missing 10 straight shots at one point in the first half.
But the Rebels (10-7, 1-4) were shooting just as poorly and turning the ball over more. And when Ole Miss went the final 4:06 of the first half without a point, the Gamecocks lead grew from 25-20 to 34-20 at the break.
Mississippi was missing its leading scorer, Deandre Burnett, who sat on the bench with a boot on his leg. The junior averages 18 points a game. Cullen Neal led Mississippi with 12 points.
It's the time of the year again, when children across the city line up to spend some time with Santa Claus, but for many families, it's not all that simple.
Once the Lawson Heights Mall closed Sunday evening, Autism Services of Saskatoon hosted its third annual Sensitive Santa event, allowing kids with autism to meet Saint Nick.

For the Mahlum family, the experience allowed their five-year-old son, Jacob, to interact with Santa in a better environment.
“It means a lot to us because it gives us the opportunity to bring our son here and not have any worries of the hustle and bustle and all the distractions,” said Cliff Mahlum, Jacob's father.
The family attended the event last year and said they came back again because of the positive experience.
“He was able to sit on Santa's lap and actually tell him what he wanted for Christmas, whereas if we would be in a crowd, he would be hiding behind things,” said Jacob's mother, Lincoln Mahlum.
“It's early support and early programming and events like this that help us get through and set him on the right track where he needs to be,” Cliff said.
The Caruk family also attended the Santa meet and greet. Kelly Caruk said the event was a great opportunity to bring all three daughters to see Santa in a quiet environment without waiting in line, as her seven-year-old daughter has autism.
Caruk said the event took the pressure off as a parent because her family was “with other families who are well aware of what autism is and who won't think any differently of your family or your child if they're acting up or having a hard time with anything.”
“We've typically avoided coming when there's going to be a long lineup and so we generally don't come and visit Santa at the mall, for that being one of the reasons why,” said Caruk. “This gives us the opportunity.”

Around 40 families enjoyed the Sensitive Santa event, which aimed to addresses the overwhelming experience which kids with autism and sensitivity issues may feel during the annual holiday visit.
“Many of them don't have the opportunity for their kids to succeed in a public setting just because it's so loud and bright and a lot going on. (The families ) are very thankful for it,” said Alex Scott, the director of family programs with Autism Services of Saskatoon.
Jada Pinkett Smith is tackling her hair loss with steroid treatments.
The 46-year-old actress opened up earlier this month about her battle with hair loss after experts told her they "don't know why" she is losing her locks, and she has now revealed she's begun to have "steroid injections" to help temporarily treat her condition.
In an Instagram video, she said: "I'm getting my little steroid injections, and they seem to be helping, but not curing, but they seem to be helping, but I'm open to other ideas."
The 'Girls Trip' star also took a moment to thank her fans for their support in the weeks since she revealed her ongoing struggle with hair loss.
She added: "I just want to say a thank you to everyone for all the outreach, from all the doctors and all the holistic practitioners, who have been reaching out to me for this head of mine, I appreciate it so much. And I'm taking into a lot of consideration all the recommendations that are coming my way."
Jada revealed her struggle during an episode of her 'Red Table Talk' show earlier this month, and said that the condition is the reason why she always sports a shorter cut.
She said: "A lot of people have been asking why I've been wearing turbans. Well, I haven't talked about it. It's not easy to talk about, but I am going to talk about it. [I have] issues with hair loss.
"It was terrifying when it first started. I was in the shower one day and had just handfuls of hair in my hands and I was just like, 'Oh my god, am I going bald?' It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking in fear. That's why I cut my hair, and why I continue to cut it.
"My hair has been a big part of me. Taking care of my hair has been a beautiful ritual and having the choice to have hair or not. And then one day to be like, 'Oh my god, I might not have that choice anymore.'"
KARACHI - Nepal's Ambassador Sewa Lamsal Adhikari has invited the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) to participate in the forthcoming Nepal Investment Summit scheduled to be organised in Katmandu on March 2-3, 2017.
Exchanging views with KCCI office bearers during her visit to the KCCI, the Nepalese ambassador said that the investment summit was being organised to promote Nepal as the investment destination for the next decade which will showcase investment opportunities especially to large scale investors who were keen to explore opportunities in new destinations. The Nepalese envoy urged the Pakistani business and industrial community to invest in different sectors of Nepalese economy, particularly the hydropower sector which has the potential to offer lucrative opportunities whereas major facilities are accorded to the investors in Nepal.
She was of the view that although the trade volume between Pakistan and Nepal was currently not at a satisfactory level but the situation can be improved as the two countries have tremendous potential in the areas of trade, tourism, investment and cultural promotion.
Adhikari stressed the need to exchange business delegations for enhancing trade and promotion of investment opportunities between Pakistan and Nepal. She opined that agriculture and tourism were the main areas where both countries can collaborate but the logistics issues, lack of communication and proper marketing were some hurdles in the expansion of trade. She was fairly optimistic that 2017 is going to be a remarkable year to enhance bilateral trade relations between Pakistan and Nepal.
Earlier, KCCI President Shamim Ahmed Firpo, while welcoming the Nepalese ambassador, said that the volume of trade between Pakistan and Nepal has not reached to significant levels due to limited trade operations. However, in FY16, Pakistan's export to Nepal increased gigantically to $108 million as against exports of a mere $2.73 million in the corresponding period of last year. A sharp surge was witnessed in the exports of textiles, cements and food items to Nepal, he added.
He further informed that Pakistan's import from Nepal during FY16 declined 78 percent to $0.13 million as against imports of $0.59 million in the same period last year, whereas the trade balance has usually remained in favour of Pakistan.
Touching upon some of the potential areas for enhancing trade, the KCCI president said that as tea consumption was one of the highest in Pakistan whereas Nepal was one of the finest tea producers, this creates a good trade opportunity between the two countries. Similarly, in recent past, Nepal has emerged as one of the best quality producer of coffee. Hence, the Pakistani coffee entrepreneurs must avail advantage of geographic proximity in having these products at competitive price. He said agriculture has special potential for expansion of bilateral trade.
Pakistan and Nepal can explore products of comparative advantage favoured by specific climatic zones in both countries, he added.
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP)  A South Carolina woman who spent two months chained inside a large metal container says her captor raped her daily and warned that if she ran or tried to hurt him, she would die.
"He told me as long as I served my purpose, I was safe," Kala Brown told Phillip McGraw, the host of the television show "Dr. Phil."
It was the first time she has talked publicly since her Nov. 3 rescue, which authorities say helped them solve seven slayings in the area dating back 13 years. Police said Todd Kohlhepp, a real estate agent with his own firm until his arrest, killed Brown's boyfriend, a couple who had been missing nearly a year and four people at a motorcycle shop in 2003.
Brown said she and her boyfriend had gone to Kohlhepp's rural property Aug. 31 to help him clear some underbrush from trails. After the couple followed him to a two-story garage on the 95-acre property, Kohlhepp handed them hedge clippers and bottles of water. He said he needed to get something inside and came out a few minutes later shooting, Brown said.

He shot Charles Carver three times in the chest, she said. He gagged Brown and handcuffed her ankles and wrists. Kohlhepp took her to a "pitch black," 30-foot-long storage container nearby, chained her by the neck in a back corner and raped her, she said.
He "let me know that if I tried to run, he'd kill me. If I tried to hurt him, he'd kill me. If I fought back, he would kill me. And then he raped me," Brown said in episodes that aired this week. "He would rape me twice a day, every day."
Kohlhepp, 45, faces murder, kidnapping and weapon charges. He is not charged with sexual assault. Spokesmen for the sheriff and prosecutor declined to address the rape allegations or whether more charges are forthcoming. His attorney did not return messages.
Police said Kohlhepp acknowledged the grisly cold cases after authorities granted him several requests, including letting him speak to his mother.
The Associated Press normally does not identify victims of sexual assault but is naming Brown after she publicly identified herself.
The day after her rescue, investigators found Carver's body in a shallow grave on Kohlhepp's property. Brought to the site in handcuffs, Kohlhepp showed authorities the graves of the couple missing since December 2015.
Brown, who had previously cleaned several of Kohlhepp's properties, said he made sure only Carver accompanied her to his land, telling her "he didn't want anyone else knowing where he lived."
Nothing seemed awry over the several months she periodically worked for Kohlhepp, she said: "He was nice, polite, just a regular businessman. ... No red flags."
Brown said Kohlhepp told her he killed Carver because "it was easier to control someone if you took someone they loved."
She thought Kohlhepp was infatuated with her and didn't want to kill her, even saying he would let her go and give her money "if he ever got old and sick," she said. He explained Stockholm syndrome, in which a hostage starts feeling sympathetic toward their captor, and said "it would kick in and we'd be happy together."
She remained tied up, even when he took her to the garage apartment to eat, she said.
When Brown heard people talking outside the container the morning of Nov. 3, she panicked, thinking maybe he had brought someone else. When she realized help had come, "I started screaming and hitting the walls," she said.
"I knew my family would never stop looking, but he was so careful, I couldn't see how I could be found so soon. I was scared it really wasn't happening," she said. "And when they finally got the door open and I saw the police uniforms, I was relieved."

He remains on call and leaves the comforts of his home for some of the harshest realities of life.
Dr. Nic Sparrow volunteers his time assisting emergency services at some of the most serious 911 calls in the West Kootenay. (Submitted photo)
For most people, going above and beyond means working overtime to complete an important project or help a neighbour out of a tough situation.
But for Dr. Nic Sparrow, going above and beyond means saving people's lives or drastically changing the recovery outcome of a severe injury or health crisis, and he is hoping more doctors and community members will join in the fight.
Sparrow is an emergency room doctor at Kootenay Lake Hospital in Nelson, but he feels the duty of saving lives doesn't end when he leaves the hospital at the end of his shift.
Sparrow remains on call and often leaves the comforts of his home for some of the harshest realities of life — the most severe 9-1-1 calls in the West Kootenay. He does this work as a volunteer — giving his time and providing his own supplies and equipment.
The idea of doctors attending accident scenes, cardiac arrest calls and drug overdoses seems like a new approach here in Canada, but the practice is actually quite common in Europe and other parts of the world.
Sparrow first became familiar with the practice while working in the United Kingdom.
After moving to Canada, Sparrow started volunteering his time for this type of work in 2008 while working on the Sunshine Coast.
Sparrow is quick to emphasize that he does not do this work alone, that it is a team effort — he is there to support the first responders, ambulance attendants, paramedics and fire department personnel.
“I think they do an absolutely amazing job — but there are some calls that a physician who is trained in pre-hospital response can assist with,” said Sparrow.
“To support the emergency services, and secondly to help save lives and help the most critically ill or injured patients in the community — that is my goal,” explained Sparrow who has attended 260 calls over the last four years.
Sparrow says It's hard to calculate how many lives have been saved through the work.
“I'm not working in isolation, I'm working always with the paramedics, with the firefighters — so it is hard to equate to lives saved. But I have definitely, massively changed the outcome for a subset of critically ill patients,” he said.
This is partly because he is able to provide things like anti-seizure medications — stopping patients from enduring long periods of seizures and advanced life support drugs and treatments to the scene of cardiac arrests.
“There are certain things that I can provide that other providers at the moment in the pre-hospital environment cannot — that's partly why I respond,” said Sparrow.
“The paramedics on the ground and the firefighters … they have to deal with some really tough stuff and work in the confines of what they are allowed to do — when we have basic life support, there are only a limited number of things the province allows them to do.”
Before moving to Canada, Sparrow responded with the ambulance service of the UK as a first responder and also alongside ambulance services in South Africa.
“I have seen the benefit of having physicians in rural areas respond,” he said.
“I think it should be a national program. There should be volunteered pre-hospital trained physicians — and maybe in the fullness of time it won't be volunteered — across the province in rural areas assisting the ambulance service.”
Kootenay Emergency Response Physicians Association
Sparrow and others have formed a non-profit organization to help fund this work — the Kootenay Emergency Response Physicians Association (KERPA).
He hopes other physicians will join him in the work but explained it may take a while before that could happen.
“There is quite a lot of specialist training you require to translate your emergency skills into the pre-hospital setting,” explained Sparrow.
He also knows the idea is a tough sell.
“It's an unusual model because you are not being paid for your time, you are on call 24/7 unless you turn your phone off. It's not an overly attractive job concept.
“You have to be slightly weird in order to want to do it — hopefully the Kootenays will attract some more weird people to join me,” added Sparrow.
KERPA has developed a wish list that includes a designated marked vehicle to take to the scene of calls. The vehicle could then be stocked with the necessary equipment and outfitted with lights and sirens.
Sparrow has been using a LifePak 12 defibrillator/monitor on loan from Interior Health and an upgrade to a LifePak 15 is also on the organization's list.
They would also like an automated chest compression device — the LUCAS 3.
KERPA has already raised about $20,000 and has purchased a state-of-the-art hand-held ultrasound machine.
The above equipment will cost about $75,000 to $100,000 so KERPA is looking for a dealership or someone else to sponsor the vehicle and is accepting donations through its Facebook page.
“We are just a volunteer organization, trying to help — we have no political agenda,” added Sparrow. “I feel I have a duty to help these people and I am going to do it — I'm just going to do it.”
And that is where the conversation ended — Sparrow's phone rang, and he was needed elsewhere.
NORTH West Hampshire MP Kit Malthouse hosted a packed meeting in Kingsclere to discuss the roll-out of high-speed broadband across the county.
Around 100 people attended the Friday February 3 meeting to hear from speakers including Patrick Blogg, assistant director of Hampshire County Council.
Other speakers were Stacey King and Grant Munn from BT and Joshua Burton, project director of Broadband Delivery UK, (BDUK) – the Government agency responsible for the broadband roll-out.
Mr Blogg revealed that the roll-out of superfast broadband (24 megabits per second) was on track for 95 per cent of the county by the end of 2017, with coverage expected to be completed by 2018.
Following the Government's autumn statement pledging £1bn to broadband delivery and with grant funding available from BT, Mr Malthouse said it was possible for a small community to club together, then obtain match-funding of £1,650 per household towards superfast broadband.
In addition, a £150 ‘betterband' voucher is available for each household that has broadband speeds of less than 2Mpbs.
Ms King and Mr Munn said any new housing development over 30 units would be entitled to free superfast broadband installation.
A grant of up to £20,000 is also being made available to Ofsted registered schools.
Chairman of Ashmansworth Parish Council, Alan Cox, said afterwards that villagers in the 83-household parish suffering low broadband speeds were looking instead at wireless solutions.
Kingsclere parish councillor Ian Bowes afterwards said 50 houses were to be built in Kingsclere, as outlined in a draft Neighbourhood Plan.
He said: “We could end up with plots smaller than 30 houses and there is no guarantee that BT will put in communications.”
After the meeting, Hampshire county councillor, Warwick Lovegrove (Lib Dem, Tadley and Baughurst) said many of his ward members were “suffering” by being unable to connect to superfast broadband.
Ramsdell villager and Tadley borough councillor Jonathan Richards (Con, Baughurst and Tadley North), afterwards said he lost his internet connection up to three times a day and that downloading large documents proved “a big time factor”.

You have paid a “pardna” for tickets for you and your family of five. But with just over quarter of an hour to go before the start of the crucial, potentially pulsating Hero CPL Knight Riders vs Patriots match-up at the Queen's Park Oval, you are still outside the venue. Ticketless.
That was the predicament in which “Gentle Giant” found himself as Pardna was a no-show. But “Gentle Giant” is a cool customer and he showed no signs of impatience.
“He has to come with those tickets, man,” Gentle Giant told me. “He has to! We've been waiting since six o'clock. He has to come, man.”
Well, I thought to myself, if Pardna is a Trini, good luck with that.
Two scalpers got into a brief argument after a ticket sale gone sour. One protested loudly, claiming that the other was “trying to outsmart mih.”
“I call you to cut you in on a deal and daiz wha you do me, boy?” he asked his dreadlocked partner in crime over his shoulder as he stormed angrily away.
“I will make it up to you with the next sale, boy,” Ras apologised, his metaphorical tail between his legs.
As I left the conflict and made my way into the Oval, it occurred to me that GG was likely to be conflicted tonight; he had confessed that his favourite player is Chris Gayle and he had really come to the Oval to see a Gayle Storm. But he was a Trinbago Knight Riders supporter all the way.
Such is his affection for Gayle, he told me, last year he was shown out the Oval door by the police, having “let loose” after the power-hitting opener had destroyed Sulieman Benn and the Trinbago bowlers en route to a rapid century.
Not tonight, though! No infrastructural damage, no gusty winds, no gale. Champion off-spinner Sunil Narine accounted for him early, caught at slip by DJ Bravo for just four.
“We get the big fish,” Ashton J beamed at me in the Cyril Duprey Stand.
I wondered whether Gentle Giant had got inside in time to see the former Tallawahs skipper on his way back to the pavilion. Or if, listening on the radio, he had just torn up his tickets and gone back home.
Either way, I was glad I was no longer next to him.
On the inside, the Knight Riders players were receiving stiff competition for the title of Hero of the Night. Both Batman and Spider-Man were in attendance while Duck Man had reappeared as well.
Yes, Ducky's yellow suit was causing pandemonium in the Carib Stand.
No pandemonium on the field, though among the St Kitts and Nevis players. Unperturbed by Duck Man's antics, they rallied on like true patriots after Gayle's dismissal and managed to post a very competitive total of 158 for 7.
Shamarh Brooks showed he was an adequate replacement for the aggressive but absent Trinidadian Evin Lewis at the top of the order. And he was ably assisted by Jonathan Carter, whose 31 was six runs short of his own score.
Crowd favourite and Trinbago adopted son Shadab Khan got no special treatment from the Patriots because of his imminent departure. In his farewell performance at the Oval, his four overs went for 41 runs, easily his worst figures so far.
Shadab's spin twin Narine suggested that there was some kind of telepathic understanding between him and his skipper DJ Bravo who gleefully took the slip catches that earned the off-spinner his two scalps.
With DJ pulling out his best dance moves, a few spectators wondered if Narine was saving his energies to try to repeat his heroics from the Tridents match.
“You feel Sunil bring back the garlic head he had in his pocket the other night,” Jerome, a young man who appeared quite knowledgeable about the game of bat and ball, enquired cheekily.
He didn't have long to wait for his answer, Narine going caught by Mohammad Nabi off the bowling of Carlos Brathwaite in the second over.
As a teenager, perhaps a Narine fan, busied himself on his phone, the no-nonsense lady behind me pulled him up: “Young man,” she asked sternly, “you come here to watch cricket or to be on your phone?”
“He's texting his girlfriend,” Ashton intervened, grinning from ear to ear. “Or at least I hope so.”
“Thank you very much, Bravo!” a spectator near the railing exclaimed after Darren Bravo's tortured 11-ball stay at the crease was mercifully cut short when he lobbed a simple catch to cover.
“This is not Test cricket; you're not auditioning for Cameron and them here,” someone advised.
As the run chase intensified and the required rate rose, a few desperate fans suggested that TKR might need some help from the Patriots Trinidadian leg-spinner Samuel Badree.
The economical Badree didn't get the memo, though, getting rid of Colin Munro and Shadab in consecutive overs.
“We need a Frylinck over,” Jerome said, nudging me in the side.
With 50 required from the last four overs, Denesh “Shotta” Ramdin and the most popular DJ in the house set about taking TKR home.
“Brav-nooo!”
The TKR skipper had to depart, brilliantly run out by Hasan Ali.
It was up to the “Shotta” and, not for the first time, Barbados' Javon Searles.
The pair delivered. In style!
They gave Carlos “Remember the name” Brathwaite a taste of his own medicine in the penultimate over, taking 20-something runs, I think, off it.
Vivian, talk nah!
Icy roads are making driving treacherous in some parts of Metro Vancouver Monday morning.
There are reports of icy side streets in a number of areas and drivers are urged to slow down and leave space between vehicles.
Drive with caution the roads are icy all around Metro Vancouver. A number of areas don't have power so watch for uncontrolled intersections — GlobalBCtraffic (@GlobalBCtraffic) January 2, 2017
These icy streets are a result of a New Year's Eve snowstorm on the South Coast that left tens of customers without power.
Just over 3,000 customers are still without power this morning due to the storm.
The bad weather also created dozens of delays for New Leaf passengers at Abbotsford Airport.
Conditions are not expected to improve this week with temperatures forecast to stay around the freezing mark.
Registration for Nutanix .NEXT 2017 in the US is now open. It will be held from 28 – 30 June, 2017, at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Washington, D.C.
Last year I really enjoyed Nutanix .NEXT 2016, it was a well organised event and I had some great conversations and was able to catch up with the vCommunity.
I booked my trip last week and I will probably be there earlier that week to complete my NPX Panelist trainee requirements with the mid-year NPX Defences (date not finalised). Look forward to seeing you all there!
Rabbit rescue organizations are preparing for an influx of surrendered and stray bunnies as Easter weekend comes to an end.
Kaylie Ngo, president of London-based Hoppy Hearts, said the peak season for her rescue starts in June and July — and much of the volume stems from bunnies that were hastily purchased as Easter gifts for kids.
Bunnies are usually given as gifts when they're about eight weeks old, Ngo said. But after a few months, their personalities start to shift.
“They start becoming very hormonal and active little teenagers that like to poop and pee and start destroying things,” she said.
The executive director of Rabbit Rescue Inc. in Cambridge, Ont., said oftentimes, parents who buy the animals for their kids don't understand what they're getting into.
“They're really similar to cats and dogs, not like hamsters and gerbils,” Haviva Porter-Lush said. They can't be kept in a small cage, for instance. Porter-Lush recommends keeping them in a pen or a dedicated room to themselves.
And they're also more like cats and dogs in terms of cost than many people realize, she added.
“When people see them in the store for $30 or $40, they don't realize that, say, 'in five or six months time, I'm going to need to spend $300 to $700 getting my rabbit spayed.”'
Ngo said that sometimes, a lack of veterinary care can be an issue for rabbit owners.
“Despite being the third most popular pet in North America, they are still considered an exotic pet by many veterinarians, and it can be really, really hard to find a good veterinarian to care for the rabbit,” she said.
Both Hoppy Hearts and Rabbit Rescue Inc. send rabbits that are up for adoption to foster homes — neither organization has a dedicated shelter space.
“It's hard, because it's a busy time of year and we get full very quickly,” said Porter-Lush, adding that they're limited by the number of people who have agreed to act as foster families.
In fact, Ngo said her rescue has become so busy that it's had to stop accepting owner-surrendered bunnies. Right now, she said, Hoppy Hearts is only taking in rabbits that have been abandoned outside.
“Even if only temporarily, being put outside is a death sentence,” she said.
So when they get the call about a domestic rabbit that someone has spotted outside, they act fast. Ngo said that at least two people will go out to the scene and try to corral the rabbit into a pen.
Then, they scan the bunny for immediate health concerns: dental issues, parasites and injuries. If it's all clear, they go ahead and get the bunny spayed or neutered as quickly as possible.
Both Ngo and Porter-Lush recommend fostering a rabbit before eventually adopting one — it's less commitment, and gives people a chance to see whether a rabbit is a good fit for their household.
The manufacturer you may have rarely heard of is making some great devices.
Xiaomi is a smartphone manufacturer that is growing in stature day-by-day, despite having virtually no physical presence outside of Asia. Sales of its phones in territories including India and its native China have propelled the relatively young company into the top five smartphone manufacturers in the world. Impressive, certainly, and it seems Xiaomi is set to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Apple and Samsung in the higher reaches of the smartphone market.
And yet while so many may have heard the name, the phones are still relatively alien to many in the West. Xiaomi has a reputation for building devices that are an extremely good value without cutting corners in the process. If you're interested in picking up a Xiaomi phone or just interested in the brand, these are the phones you'll need to know about.
Xiaomi Mi Mix
Released October 2016: The Mi Mix is Xiaomi's latest and greatest, and quite possibly the most futuristic phone on the market today. With a 91.3% screen-to-body ratio, the Mi Mix has virtually no bezels, allowing Xiaomi to fit a 6.4-inch display in a handset that's the same size as a 5.7-inch phone.
To achieve an edgeless design, Xiaomi had to innovate in other areas as well. The front camera module is located at the bottom of the screen, and is 50% smaller than an average sensor. As there isn't room to accommodate an earpiece, Xiaomi relied on "cantilever piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology" to transmit sound. And as it couldn't fit a traditional proximity sensor, Xiaomi went with an ultrasound sensor that's located behind the glass panel.
The Mi Mix isn't just about the design either. The phone has the latest hardware in the form of a Snapdragon 821 SoC, 6GB of RAM, 256GB storage, 16MP camera at the back, and a 4400mAh battery.
The end result is that the Mi Mix is a stunning phone to look at, and given the internal hardware, it is fully capable as a daily driver. The only problem with the phone is that it is limited to China, and won't be sold outside the country. Trying to buy it through resellers turns into a costly affair, as they're charging a healthy $300 markup, bringing the cost of the phone up to $900.
Xiaomi Mi 5s
Released October 2016: The Mi 5s is Xiaomi's second phone in its flagship Mi series for 2016. The design is an evolution of the Mi 5, with Xiaomi eschewing the glass back for an all-metal chassis. Making high-end hardware available at an affordable price is what Xiaomi excels at, and the situation is no different with the Mi 5s. For what amounts to $400, you get a phone with a Snapdragon 821, dual rear 13MP cameras, 6GB of RAM and 128GB flash storage.
There's a standard variant of the Mi 5s that offers a single 12MP rear shooter and 3GB of RAM along with 64GB storage, retailing for $300 in China. Other specs include a 5.15-inch Full HD display on the Mi 5s, and a 5.7-inch Full HD panel on the Mi 5s Plus. The smaller Mi 5s has a 3000mAh battery, while the larger Mi 5s Plus offers a 3800mAh unit.
Both phones are now retailing in China, and as of now there's no information to suggest they'll be making their way to other markets. That could change in the coming months, but with Xiaomi rumored to unveil the Mi 6 sometime at the end of Q1 2017, it looks like the Mi 5s will be a China-exclusive. However, you can buy it from reseller sites for the equivalent of $295, which comes out to be a pretty sweet deal for those located in Asian markets.

Xiaomi Mi Note 2
Released October 2016: The Mi Note 2 doesn't get as much attention as it deserves, primarily because it made its debut alongside the Mi Mix. That said, the phone is important to Xiaomi's global ambitions as it is the first from the manufacturer to offer global LTE bands. With support for over 37 LTE bands, you'll be able to use the Mi Note 2 on most carriers around the world.
The phone itself isn't all that bad. The Mi Note 2 features a 5.7-inch dual curved display similar to that of the S7 edge, although Xiaomi partnered with LG on the display front. Although it is an AMOLED panel, it is Full HD and not QHD, a letdown in an otherwise great phone.
Other specs include the Snapdragon 821, up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage, 22.5MP camera at the back, 8MP front camera, and a 4070mAh battery. Even though the phone has global LTE bands, it is sold exclusively in China.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 3
Released December 2015: The Redmi Note 3 represents incredible value for money while still offering a great experience. If you want a larger Xiaomi phone but would prefer to spend less than the Mi 5, this is the one to go for.
Hardware-wise there's a 5.5-inch 1080p display with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 paired with 16GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM or 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM. There's a 13MP camera around the back and a whopping 4000mAh battery squeezed inside it's all-metal chassis. The Redmi Note 3 is also one of Xiaomi's first phones to feature a fingerprint scanner on the rear, and it recently picked up a Marshmallow-based build of MIUI 8.
Xiaomi released the Redmi Note 4 in China in late 2016, but the phone is yet to go up for sale outside the country. It doesn't offer anything extra in terms of hardware prowess, with Xiaomi instead tweaking the overall design and introducing a much better camera. Even after a year since its debut, the Redmi Note 3 is a great buy.

Xiaomi Redmi 3S
The Redmi 3S is Xiaomi's latest budget wonder. The Chinese manufacturer's claim to fame two years ago was the Redmi 1S, and this year's offering in the entry-level series offers even more value for money. For what amounts to $110, you get a phone with a 5-inch 720p display, the all-new Snapdragon 430 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, 13MP camera, 5MP front shooter, and a massive 4100mAh battery.
Xiaomi is also selling a Prime version of the Redmi 3S for $140 that offers 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage, as well as a fingerprint sensor at the back. And in a bid to target offline buyers, Xiaomi is rolling out a variant of the phone called the Redmi 3S+ that will be sold exclusively offline in India. The phone will be available from over 7,000 retail outlets across the country.
Overall, the Redmi 3S solidifies Xiaomi's position in the budget segment. For more on what the phone offers, read our review:

Xiaomi Mi Max
Released July 2016: Unveiled in China in June, the Mi Max is Xiaomi's largest phone to date, with the handset packing a huge 6.44-inch display backed by Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is available with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage and a Snapdragon 650, or a more powerful variant with Snapdragon 652 under the hood and 4GB of RAM and 128GB storage.
There's a 16MP camera with PDAF at the back, a 5MP shooter up front, LTE bands for India and China along with VoLTE, and a massive 4850mAh battery that Xiaomi claims will easily deliver two days of battery life on a full charge. On the software side of things, there's MIUI 7 with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The phone is now available in India for ₹14,999 ($225).

Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week, Indian industry chamber Ficci on Tuesday described it as an opportunity for discussing both bilateral issues, and on steps to ease pressure on world trade from US protectionist measures.
Xi and Modi will hold an informal summit in China's Wuhan city over April 27-28, to improve bilateral relations and discuss global issues of mutual concern.
"While China's increasing dominance in world trade has made its role extremely significant in defusing the possibilities of a global trade war, India has shown in the last few months that it can play the role of a facilitator for serious dialogues on this issue," a Ficci statement said here.
"It is quite encouraging that China has already indicated that positive results are expected on globalisation and the threat of rising protectionism from the meeting" between Modi and Xi, Ficci President Rashesh Shah said in a statement.
US President Donald Trump slapped import tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium in March. China retaliated earlier in April, increasing tariffs by up to 25 per cent on 128 US products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts.
Along with the understanding to work together in furthering global trade, Modi must also discuss the greater opening of the Chinese markets for the Indian products with Xi, Shah said.
According to Ficci, the need of the hour is stronger India-China ties, "which is in the interest of the world trade, but not in any direct confrontation with the US".(IANS)

Some of the NDC MPs are under investigation for taking double salary while in office as Ministers
The Caucus for Democratic Governance (CDG), says investigation of double salary allegations should not be limited to Ministers of State who served from 2013 to 2016.
“Reliable sources show that there were many of such double payments during former President Kufuor's time. Why has the period 2000 to 2008 been left out?”
Dr Ebenezer Kofi Hayford, Chief Convener of the CDG, said this on Tuesday in Accra, when he briefed journalists on the topic, “Corruption is Indivisible, Double Rent Allowance Scandal must be probed.”
He said there were gross inefficiencies in the salary administration in the public sector that had to be corrected, adding that those inefficiencies only became visible, where the structures at the Controller and Accountant General's Department did not adhere strictly to the clauses of Article 71 of the 1992 Constitution.
Article 71 (i) and (i) of the 1992 constitution stipulated, that salaries and allowances of Executive, Legislature and Judiciary, paid from the Consolidated Fund, would be determined by the President, on the recommendation of a committee of not more than five persons, said Dr Hayford.
He said the five persons, were also to be appointed by the President, acting on the advice of the Council of State.
Dr. Hayford said in determining the salaries of the President, his ministers and political appointees, as well as members of the Council of State, the Constitution stated that parliament would determine the salaries, based on the advice of the same committee.
“Article 71 clearly shows that many of the lapses and inefficiencies in the payments is as a result of the disconnect between the Parliamentary Service Board and the Controller and Accountant General's Department,” he said.
Dr. Hayford observed that the situation had resulted over the years in billions of Cedis of the tax payer's money going down the drain saying, “indeed as long as there is no centralisation or single payroll system for all Article 71 office holders, there will always be this problem.”

The Chief Convener of the CDG, touched on what he termed the politics of the issue and questioned why the CID should investigate the nine members of parliament for stealing.
“Where is the element of stealing? Lack of administrative coordination leads to overpayment. The simple issue is to ask the Members of Parliament to refund the extra amount paid,” he said.”
He questioned why the CID was investigating “this double payment allegation instead of the Parliamentary Board”.
Dr Hayford said the CID was also silent about the double rent allowance payment involving NPP Ministers of State and added, “is it the political interest and victimisation of the opposition that is important or payments into the Government coffers?”
He stressed that it was important to investigate all cases of corruption without any partiality, because the aim of such investigations was to recover lost funds to the state.
The month of November was a painful time for the Vancouver Canucks both figuratively, and primarily literally—a handful of injuries to key players has left the Canucks in a bad place at a key point of the season.
Coming into the 2017-18 season, nobody expected the Canucks to actually be competing for a playoff position, but they proved everyone wrong. Most people expected a bit of a throwaway season where the organization tested out some fresh faces and developed some up-and-comers. Now, with these injuries, the Canucks have room in their lineup for some young players looking to make a reputation for themselves.
The Injured Canucks
Erik Gudbranson
Injured Nov. 27 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, was Erik Gudbranson, the team's toughest customer. He has been tagged with an upper-body injury and is currently listed as week-to-week. The 6-foot-5 monster has had injury problems before so the “week-to-week” label isn't exactly comforting.
The big man hasn't been too productive this season, carrying along zero points, but he is still second on the team in hits and will be missed in front of the net quite drastically.
Brandon Sutter
Just two days after Gudbranson's injury, Brandon Sutter was also sidelined in a contest against the New Jersey Devils. Sutter is also considered week-to-week but differs with a lower-body injury and is half-expected to make his return within the next week.
He's been middle-of-the-pack in terms of points but Sutter is the go-to shutdown center for Travis Green's Canucks and he's done quite an impressive job to this point in the season, alongside his former partner in crime, Derek Dorsett.
Derek Dorsett
Derek Dorsett was a major talking point of the NHL for the first couple months of the 2017-18 season, remember? He was lighting up the league and carrying the Canucks in terms of goals—he's still fifth on the squad with seven notches. His impressive play seemed to overshadow the fact that he had bounced back from a devastating injury-surgery combination with his neck.
It was nothing short of a miracle that he came back and it was also nothing short of heroic that he was able to play as well as he did. Unfortunately, his injury caught up to him and forced him to retire from hockey after playing 20 games in the 2017-18 season. Another tough customer, and a huge morale guy, Dorsett will be hugely missed with the Canucks.

Bo Horvat
Last on the injured list, is Bo Horvat, who suffered a fractured foot in the Dec. 5 bout with the Carolina Hurricanes. He is expected to miss no less than six weeks and it couldn't come at a worse time.
With the Canucks already being down the three aforementioned players, Horvat's injury is instrumentally deflating to a team that is currently two points out of a playoff spot behind two good hockey teams in the Calgary Flames and the San Jose Sharks.
Horvat is second on the team in goals (10) and points (20) behind his linemate, Brock Boeser, but he's a two-way guy who is missed in the defensive zone too. The Canucks have dropped their last two without Horvat and his absence has been all too evident.
Moving Forward
The next six weeks are going to be a struggle for the Canucks and they'll need to finish above .500 if they'll have any hope of making the playoffs. However, as Sutter and Gudbranson make their returns, the battle will get easier.
On the flip side, the Canucks are able to run other players in the lineup and see if anybody makes an impression. Brendan Gaunce and Michael Chaput are two players who have been with the organization for quite some time and I'm sure are more than happy to try to pounce on these opportunities in the midst of unfortunate injuries.
A physical presence is missing with the Canucks right now and Gaunce and Chaput need to fill the void.
Police are looking to identify two persons of interest as they investigate suspicious activity in an Upper Stoney Creek townhouse complex.
Officers were called to Echovalley Drive on Monday night to investigate what was described as a potential shooting more than 13 hours earlier.

Witnesses have described seeing two men running away from the scene, while a third ran into one of the units after what sounded like gunshots was heard sometime around 8 a.m.
Hamilton police have since canvassed homes in the area and are looking for two suspects dressed in construction-type clothing and wearing yellow construction hats with white breathing masks over their faces.

Echovalley Drive runs off Mud Street, just west of Upper Centennial Parkway.
Derek Rivers wasn't going to let his ACL set him back an entire season in the NFL. The New England Patriots defensive end, who tore his ACL during the 2017 offseason just months after the team selected him in the third round, did his best to stay engaged while overcoming the injury.
“I was able to learn the defense,” Rivers told reporters after last week's organized team activities on Tuesday, via Pats Pulpit.. “And I wasn't away from the building, so I could do everything except be here on the field.”
Indeed, Rivers was present in the locker room regularly during the end of last season. During that time, he was able to study the team's game plan for each game while getting versed in the team's playbook.
Perhaps that studying has paid off, because Rivers got the first snaps at left defensive end during 11-on-11 drills last Tuesday. Trey Flowers wasn't practicing, so the picture of the competition battle is incomplete. But getting those first-team snaps bodes well for the second-year defensive end, who will enter what the NBA would call a rookie season.
“Now, it's just listening to the coaches and studying the playbook and pretty much just getting ready to roll for each practice and just trying to get better each and every day,” Rivers said.
Rivers should figure into the Patriots' plans for the 2018 season. He finished his senior season at Youngstown State with 58 tackles, 19.5 for loss and 14 sacks. He set a record with 41 sacks in the school's history. The Patriots finished seventh in the league in sacks in 2017. But New England won't be complaining if Rivers can help bump their sack totals higher in 2018.
NEW DELHI: Tata Motors ' small car Nano is inching closer towards the end of its journey with just one unit produced in June, although the company maintained that no decision has been taken yet on stopping its production.The entry-level car, the brainchild of Ratan Tata who envisaged giving a safer and affordable alternative to families riding on two-wheelers, sold just three units last month in the domestic market.In a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said there was no export of Nano in June this year. It had shipped 25 units in the same month last year.In terms of production, only one unit was produced last month as against 275 units in June 2017.Domestic sales were at three units in June as against 167 units in the year-ago month.When contacted for comments on whether the company has taken a decision to stop Nano production, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, "We are well aware that the Nano in its present form cannot continue beyond 2019 and may need fresh investments to survive. No decision has been made yet in this regard."The spokesperson further said, "Meanwhile, we continue to produce Nano catering to customer demand in key markets."Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with many expectations of being the people's car, could not live up to the billing.The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to Rs 1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that "a promise is a promise".However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors' proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition.The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat.Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn't help its cause either.Ratan Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as 'the cheapest car'.It becomes a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even went on to claim that the Nano "consistently lost value, peaking at Rs 1,000 crore."Mistry also termed the Nano as one of the "legacy hotspots" and there was "no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy".He had also claimed that Tata Motors did not stop producing the car due to "emotional reasons."
EATON — The Preble County Humane Society is asking the community for donations of adult dog food to help feed the many dogs they house, something they have not had to do since 2016 when they lost a major funder and the community rallied around them.
According to Kennel Tech/Assistant Manager Tiffany Kreider, the Humane Society has been around for more than 40 years, but in the current building since 2006. They take in as many dogs and cats as possible. They have room for 60-75 dogs, but have housed 90 when there were litters of puppies. They can house 30 cats at the most, while keeping room for kittens (who get adopted at a faster rate).
The shelter is no-kill, so any animals they accept are kept until adopted out. Their monthly adoption rate is 35, although that depends on how many dogs they have in the shelter. There is an adoption fee, but all Humane Society animals are spayed/neutered, microchipped, given flea treatment/deworming, examined, given a heart worm test, and vaccinated.
“It has been a hard year with how many dogs have been surrendered and dumped,” Kreider said. “For the first time in awhile we've had three dogs test positive for heart worms in the past three weeks. Heart worms are fatal if not treated, and treatment is expensive. We're working on getting that taken care of right now.
“We work with the dog warden to try and pull from him once we have room. He holds them for awhile as we assess them and makes sure they're adoptable before we move them here and put them up for adoption. We do have an application process that we have potential adopters fill out. That way we know what they're looking for, what their set up is, and how they are going to exercise their dog. We get a lot of dogs from the dog warden as strays so we like to make sure they have fences so they can't run the town.”
With the amount of adult dogs they house, the Humane Society goes through 50lbs of food a day. There is no specific brand the shelter needs, though Kreider noted, most dogs enjoy Purina the best.
“Adopt, don't shop,” Kreider stressed. “There are a lot of mixed breed dogs who deserve good homes and with us getting them neutered or spayed, the adoption fee we have for them is not bad. It is worth it to get an older, already fixed mixed breed dog.”
If interested in adopting, the Humane Society has an active Facebook page where they post all of their dogs and they also have a Petfinder page where adoptable animals can be found. Applications can be emailed or dropped off in person.

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should continue to raise interest rates to prevent an overheating in an economy buoyed by strong financial conditions, global growth and the Trump administration's tax cuts, a top policymaker said Friday.
But San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, in his first public comments since the Fed left rates unchanged after its policy-setting meeting this week, made it clear he is not advocating more than the three rate hikes the Fed has forecast for 2018.
“The expansion is proceeding at a good pace, unemployment is low, and inflation is finally headed in the right direction again,” said Williams, who votes this year on Fed policy and is said to be under consideration for the position of vice chair under incoming Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “But at the moment, while I'm buoyed by the optimism, I don't see an economy at risk of shifting into overdrive.”
Economic data has strengthened over the last month or two, with a report earlier Friday showing hourly wages rose in January at their fastest pace in more than eight years, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model spitting out a searing estimate Thursday of 5.4 percent growth for the current quarter. Unemployment is at 4.1 percent, lower than most economists think is sustainable in the long run.
Many Fed officials, including Williams, see inflation picking up this year after several years when it lingered below the Fed's 2-percent target. On Friday Williams said wage growth has been “ratcheting up” and is likely to intensify, helping lift inflation along with it.
Still, Williams, in his prepared remarks to the Financial Women of San Francisco, said he was pleased by what he termed “healthy growth,” but is neither surprised nor concerned.
“I have boosted my growth forecasts for this year, but I don't see an economy that's fundamentally shifted gear,” he said. “Given that the economy's performing almost exactly as expected, you can expect policymakers to do the same.”
Markets are currently pricing in the same three rate hikes this year that the Fed has forecast. (Reporting by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

Greyhound Canada is calling on the province to create a new fund that would help pay for bus transportation between the province's rural communities.
Earlier this summer, Greyhound applied to the Passenger Transportation Board to discontinue several major routes, including all service to northern B.C.
The company blamed the cuts on increased costs and declining ridership.

Now, Greyhound is proposing a new “Connecting Communities Fund” that it says would support crucial connections between B.C.'s smaller towns.
“Federal and provincial governments and large municipalities spend billions annually on urban transit services; B.C.'s rural communities deserve transportation investments as well,” said the company in a news release.
WATCH: Greyhound service cuts could be coming to the Similkameen
Under Greyhound's proposal, First Nations and smaller communities would have access to the fund, which they could use to seek competitive bids between different transportation providers.
“Connecting communities over 400 miles is where the challenge is, and this is where this type of funding for this type of model will alleviate that,” said Greyhound vice president for Western Canada.
READ MORE: Greyhound applies to cut service in Similkameen Valley
98 Mile House resident Karen Simonson said she'd like to see something like what Greyhound is proposing put in place for rural transportation.
“If you don't have a car where we live, you pretty much are stranded,” Simonson said.
“When you get up the Prince George area where all the women are missing, well, this is the reason why. Because they have no access to transit.”
At least 18 women have disappeared or been killed along Highway 16 between Prince Rupert and Prince George, better known as the “Highway of Tears.”
That route is among the service areas Greyhound plans to discontinue, but, the province began rolling out its own long-awaited new BC Transit service along the highway earlier this year.
LAHORE - AGHS legal Aid Cell has organised a Joint Action Committee (JAC) meeting and expressed concerns over the crackdown against NGO's activities.
According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the modalities of harassment were discussed and the participants shared a range of tactics being adopted against them to intimidate NGOs and to curtail their work. The participants said that due to the exhausting process of acquiring a NOC to conduct project activities, the activities of the NGOs suffer, putting their future funding at risk.
In the discussion, participants further said that the scope of NGOs activities have also been reduced as they are not allowed to talk on a political issue, research, conduct a survey or study, collect data, conduct mapping exercises, and conduct any advocacy campaigns.
During the meeting, it was decided that those NGOs that are facing harassment should hold seminars, press conferences etc to highlight the issue. The NGOs also stated that the Societies Registration Act should not be used as part of the legal or advocacy strategy as the law has loopholes that make way for state-sponsored control and intimidation.
With a strong desire, both to see the Himalayas and challenge herself mentally and physically, in November 2016 Thompsons' Human Resources Manager, Zoe McKane set off on an unforgettable journey to Everest base camp.
Building on a long term relationship between Thompsons and Marie Curie, Zoe decided to raise funds through raffles and various events held at York Road, which combined with Zoe's ‘Just Giving' page and support from Thompsons, raised over £6,500.
After 12 months training around Belfast carrying the equivalent of a bag of horse feed on her back, in all weather conditions, Zoe was ready to fly to Nepal for what was to prove to be an emotional journey.
Zoe explained: “Having left my three young sons in Northern Ireland, when I flew into Kathmandu and viewed the Himalayas for the first time, the enormity of the challenge began to sink in.
“I had received such wonderful support from my friends and colleagues, so I felt a huge responsibility to those that were giving me financial and emotional investment to complete this mission.
“Over the course of 12 days we trekked 150km at high altitude to reach base camp. At several points I wasn't sure whether I would make it, but the support of the wonderful people of Nepal and thoughts of those at home kept me going through the amazing scenery on particularly tough days.”
Everyone at Thompsons is very proud of Zoe's achievement and would like to thank all that supported her to achieve this incredible personal and financial goal.
One of two Mount Royal University aviation instructors killed in a plane crash west of Calgary Monday night has been identified by the school's president.
“Jeff Bird was an experienced pilot who joined Mount Royal University as a class 3 flight instructors for Mount Royal's aviation program,” David Docherty said Tuesday afternoon.

Docherty said prior to joining the Mount Royal team, Bird was a pilot instructor with the Royal Canadian Air Force stationed in Moose Jaw, Sask.
“He spent 10 years in the military,” Docherty said. “He brought that wealth of experience and his love of teaching to Mount Royal.”

Bird was also a helicopter pilot in Edmonton with the 408th squadron, Docherty said.
“We've spoken with the family and can tell you they are understandably heartbroken.”
Docherty said the family of the other pilot has not given permission to release his name.
He said there will be a “pop-up memorial” for students and others to lay flowers and leave “expressions of love” so that students can get together and celebrate the lives of the two pilots, in concert with their families.
Docherty said the program will continue and both students and instructors will get back in the plane when they're ready to fly.
Cochrane RCMP were first alerted to the crash at around 5:55 p.m. Monday by a witness in another aircraft who saw a plane crash east of Highway 40 in the Waiparous area.
The small passenger plane was later located in a remote area northwest of Cochrane, near Highway 40 and Highway 579.

Transportation Safety Board of Canada launches investigation
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is investigating the crash. In a phone interview with Global News, spokesperson Johnathon Lee said it could be days before they'll be able to release any details on what happened.
“[Investigators] are still processing information at the site, taking measurements, taking photographs,” Lee said. “The next steps will be going to the Mount Royal operations at the Springbank Airport to collect more information and to conduct interviews.”
Lee said they have secured radar of the flight path from NavCanada, and are in the process of reviewing it. He confirmed the plane left from the Springbank Airport but said it's not known how long the plane was in air before the crash.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted that Mesut Ozil signing a new contract at the Emirates feels like a new signing.
The World Cup winner with Germany had less than six months on his earlier contract. There were speculations surrounding his future, with reports suggesting Manchester United and Barcelona are interested in signing him on a free transfer in the summer.
Ozil ended the rumours by committing his future to the north London club. He signed a new "long-term contract" with the Gunners on 1 February. Wenger has expressed his delight after the playmaker committed his future to the Gunners.
"It is, because many predicted that he will not commit and not sign for us. Overall it's good news for us," Wenger was quoted as saying by Arsenal's official website.
"When you look at the transfer market today, the fact that you can keep a player of that calibre is of course good news. The fact that he committed for a longer period shows as well that he will have to do that as well on the pitch and lead the team."
Now that Ozil has signed a new contract, the Frenchman has urged the former Real Madrid start to start taking responsibility in order to "lead the team to success."
"Yes of course. He has committed his future to the club in a period where we are in a trick position on that front, in qualifying for the Champions League. You expect that he becomes the leader and takes the responsibility to lead the team to success," he explained.

The month of November was a painful time for the Vancouver Canucks both figuratively, and primarily literally—a handful of injuries to key players has left the Canucks in a bad place at a key point of the season.
Coming into the 2017-18 season, nobody expected the Canucks to actually be competing for a playoff position, but they proved everyone wrong. Most people expected a bit of a throwaway season where the organization tested out some fresh faces and developed some up-and-comers. Now, with these injuries, the Canucks have room in their lineup for some young players looking to make a reputation for themselves.
The Injured Canucks
Erik Gudbranson
Injured Nov. 27 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, was Erik Gudbranson, the team's toughest customer. He has been tagged with an upper-body injury and is currently listed as week-to-week. The 6-foot-5 monster has had injury problems before so the “week-to-week” label isn't exactly comforting.
The big man hasn't been too productive this season, carrying along zero points, but he is still second on the team in hits and will be missed in front of the net quite drastically.
Brandon Sutter
Just two days after Gudbranson's injury, Brandon Sutter was also sidelined in a contest against the New Jersey Devils. Sutter is also considered week-to-week but differs with a lower-body injury and is half-expected to make his return within the next week.
He's been middle-of-the-pack in terms of points but Sutter is the go-to shutdown center for Travis Green's Canucks and he's done quite an impressive job to this point in the season, alongside his former partner in crime, Derek Dorsett.
Derek Dorsett
Derek Dorsett was a major talking point of the NHL for the first couple months of the 2017-18 season, remember? He was lighting up the league and carrying the Canucks in terms of goals—he's still fifth on the squad with seven notches. His impressive play seemed to overshadow the fact that he had bounced back from a devastating injury-surgery combination with his neck.
It was nothing short of a miracle that he came back and it was also nothing short of heroic that he was able to play as well as he did. Unfortunately, his injury caught up to him and forced him to retire from hockey after playing 20 games in the 2017-18 season. Another tough customer, and a huge morale guy, Dorsett will be hugely missed with the Canucks.

An African Children's Choir has five more performances scheduled in Iowa, after two shows this past weekend in Waterloo and Cedar Falls.
Keira Carnie is a volunteer chaperone from England with the choir. She says the long trip from Uganda to the U.S. was a memorable one for the 19 children.
“They still tell stories of the noises the plane made, the food that they had, or the movies they watched on the plane,” Carnie said, laughing. The choir is under the direction of the Music for Life Organization and formed 30 years ago out of war-torn Uganda. The organization now works in seven different African countries, helping some 52,000 children get an education.
“The purpose of the choir is…these children, amongst other children in Africa, their education is now paid for from primary school, through high school, and all the way through college or their first degree,” Carnie said. The five upcoming choir performances in Iowa are free to attend, but donations are encouraged.
The first of the five shows is scheduled for tonight in Reinbeck. Other upcoming performances this month are scheduled in Cedar Rapids, Urbandale, Pella, and Shenandoah. Carnie says the show includes a 15-piece drum solo and a wide mix of musical styles.
“Favorites, everybody would love, like ‘This Little Light of Mine' that get the audience singing a clapping along,” Carnie said. “They sing traditional African songs as well. They sing in three different languages throughout the concert.” The African Children's Choir performed for Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee, alongside Paul McCartney, and many others.

West, who was hospitalized after abruptly canceling the remainder of his “Pablo” tour following a week of curtailed concerts and rants about politics, is expected to be at Wednesday's New York presentation of his latest Yeezy collection of high-end athleisure wear for sports brand Adidas.
Music producer Malik Yusef said he has visited with the rapper recently and that West was focused on his recovery and spending time with his two young children with wife, reality star Kim Kardashian.
“His memory's coming back,” said Yusef, who worked with West on “The Life of Pablo” album that was nominated for eight Grammy awards.
Yusef's remarks to celebrity news outlet PopSugar at Sunday's Grammy awards were the first details of West's recovery after his sudden hospitalization in November for what was first said to be exhaustion.
Representatives for the 39-year-old rapper did not offer any explanation for West's 10-day hospitalization last year and did not return requests for comment on Tuesday on the remarks about memory loss.
The fashion event is likely to be a family affair for West. Kim Kardashian posted on social media on Tuesday that she was on her way to New York.
Both Kim and Kanye were a no-show at the Grammy Awards. Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, told celebrity outlet E! that West did not attend the Grammys because he was working on his fashion presentation.
“He's got a lot of work to do,” Jenner said.
People Magazine, citing unnamed sources, said Kardashian was worried that the fashion show would cause West undue stress.
West's previous collections have often been a spectacle and are a popular stop during the New York Fashion Week celebrations. Yeezy collections have regularly sold out.
A year ago, more than 20 million viewers watched online as the rapper debuted his “Pablo” album at Manhattan's Madison Square Garden alongside the presentation of his Yeezy season 4 collection, which featured a diverse group of models dressed in leotards, tops, leggings and parkas in neutral tones.
West has kept a low public profile in recent months, although he did meet with then President-elect Donald Trump in New York in January and posed for photos afterward. – Reuters

Beijing
In the late 1930s, when the generals and soldiers of the Communist Party of China (CPC) established a revolutionary base in Lyuliang in north China's Shanxi Province, they didn't know this mountain city would remain poor 80 years later. Among the 13 counties in Lyuliang, 10 counties and 3,350 villages are still considered regions in “abject poverty.”
With about 128,000 villages and over 40 million people in China still living in poverty, the country's fight against invaders and oppressors decades ago has now turned into a fight against poverty, as more than 120 CPC members have sacrificed their lives in the fight.
In the past 30 years, even with 700 million people lifted out of poverty, abject poverty remains one of China's top concerns.
It persists not only in areas around old revolutionary bases, but also in ethnic minority regions, border areas, and places with poor infrastructure, fragile environmental conditions and frequent natural disasters.
In late June, Chinese President Xi Jinping went to Lyuliang to visit poor families and talk with officials in charge of poverty alleviation work.
Xi called on the villagers to “roll up your sleeves and work harder, together with the CPC Central Committee.”
China has set 2020 as the target year to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society, which requires the eradication of poverty. The task has become more difficult and costly as the process approaches its end.
According to global experience, the most difficult phase in poverty eradication is when the population living in poverty accounts for less than 10 percent of the overall population.
As of the end of 2016, there were still 43.35 million people in China living below the country's poverty line of 2,300 yuan (344.30 U.S. dollars) of annual income as constant with 2010 prices, accounting for about 3 percent of China's population.
To achieve the target in 2020, China needs to bring more than 10 million people out of poverty every year, meaning nearly one million people per month or 20 people per minute.
China is in a race with time, and President Xi has put himself on the front lines. In December 2012, Xi was in Fuping County of Hebei Province, while in November 2013 he went to Huayuan County of Hunan Province, and in June 2015, he visited Zunyi County of Guizhou Province.—Xinhua
ISLAMABAD - Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is appearing today before the joint investigation team (JIT) probing his family's offshore business dealings.
He is the first sitting prime minister to appear before any investigating agency of the country.
In the past, prime ministers Yousuf Raza Gilani and Raja Pervaiz Ashraf had been summoned for presenting their stances, but both of them were called by a judicial forum (Supreme Court) and not by any investigation body.
Even Raja, who was a respondent in a corruption case involving rental power projects, never personally appeared before NAB investigators while in office.
Law enforcement agencies have taken stringent security measures for PM Sharif's appearance before the JIT. As many as 2,500 security personnel of Rangers, police, Frontier Constabulary (FC), traffic police and special branch will be deployed for providing him security cover.
The JIT had issued summons to Premier Nawaz on June 8, asking him to appear at the Federal Judicial Academy on June 15 and bring along relevant record of Panama Papers case.
The probe team, headed by FIA Additional DG Wajid Zia, will quiz the prime minister over corruption and money laundering allegations against his family.
It was unclear if the statement of the PM would also be video recorded like the other witnesses who have appeared before the team, as the three-member SC Special Bench overseeing the investigation reserved its decision on the matter on Wednesday.
PM's elder son Hussain Nawaz, has filed a petition seeking the formation of a commission to investigate a photo ‘leak' from his appearance before the JIT.
Hussain and his younger brother Hassan Nawaz have already been quizzed a number of times by the probe team. A cousin of the PM has also been grilled by the investigators, who have been given only two months time by the apex court to complete the investigation.
Nawaz Sharif's younger brother and Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also due to appear before the JIT on June 17.
On Wednesday, the JIT also summoned Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's son-in-law former captain Safdar Hussain.
In this regard, the JIT has issued summons directing him to appear before the JIT on June 24 at 11am at the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA).
The sources said that the JIT had also asked Safdar Hussain to bring all the relevant record with him.
Former interior minister Senator Rehman Malik, who voluntarily offered the JIT to record his statement, was called by JIT on June 13 but he could not appear before it for being out of the country.
Malik has worked in the FIA against various posts and also remained the agency's director-general. He was investigating Nawaz Sharif for corruption during the second government of Benazir Bhutto in the mid-1990s while being in the FIA.
A spokesperson for the senator said Malik would ‘soon' be appearing before the investigation team. A news agency quoted sources as saying that Malik will appear before the probe team now on June 23, and he has been directed by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to appear with full preparation and complete record.
Beside head of the JIT Wajid Zia, the six-member team includes Amir Aziz from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Bilal Rasool from Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Irfan Naeem Mangi from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Brigadier Nauman Saeed from Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Brigadier Kamran Khursheed from the Military Intelligence (MI).

Daisy Sweeney, a pillar of Montreal's black community, has passed away at the age of 97. As Global's Phil Carpenter reports, she taught her younger brother, jazz great Oscar Peterson, how to play piano.
Two-time WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair was hospitalized and admitted to an intensive care unit over the weekend, and after initially downplaying the seriousness of the issue, a representative for Flair has made a plea for public support.
Melinda Morris Zanoni, the CEO of Legacy Talent LLC, tweeted out the latest on Flair's situation late Sunday night.
Are u a Fan/Friend of Ric Flair?If so, we need prayers & positive energy 4 our Living Legend as he is dealing w/some tough medical issues🙏🏻 - MelindaMorrisZanoni (@LegacyTalentCEO) August 14, 2017
As first reported by Pro Wrestling Sheet, Flair was hospitalized on Saturday morning for heart-related issues, with Zanoni initially reporting the situation involved "routine monitoring." PW Insider's Mike Johnson reported that Flair is hospitalized near his home in Atlanta.
Flair, 68, has spent the past five decades of his career in the world of professional wrestling with a reputation as one of the most charismatic personalities in the history of that business. His popularity and personality have transcended into the world of professional sports on many occasions, with players recreating some of his most famous wrestling promos and Flair himself often called to serve as a motivational speaker.
Christina Aguilera felt it was "important" for her to leave 'The Voice' after she became "disconnected" from the show.
The 37-year-old singer - who starred as a judge on the talent show between 2011 and 2016 - decided to walk away from the NBC programme after becoming disgruntled with some of the behind-the-scenes goings on.
She said: "[I felt] disconnected for a while and I wasn't in the right headspace either being in an environment that was just not good for me".
The 'Dirrty' hitmaker was a big fan of the blind audition phase of the show, because she felt it was more meritocratic.
However, the chart-topping star ultimately decided to quit the programme because she was unhappy with the general working environment, saying it was something "no one would want to put up with" on a daily basis.
Speaking to the Los Angeles Times newspaper, Christina shared: "The blind audition idea was really intriguing to me because it was an opportunity for anyone to get on stage and be discovered, regardless of how they looked.
"I also saw blatant things that I did not think were OK and that I am sure no one would want to put up with in the work environment. It was important for me to step away."
Since quitting the show, Christina has returned to her touring roots.
But the 'Candyman' hitmaker admitted she's been happy to play modestly-sized venues because she's "scared" by the idea of performing in front of huge audiences.
Christina - who took a decade-long break from touring - explained: "I am dipping my toe back in this water while also giving my fans a chance to see me after they have not in so long."
The more compelling matches on Day 5 of Roland Garros are in the women's draw. That's one of the benefits of the wide-open state of the WTA, which started the week fielding half a dozen women who could end up with the No. 1 ranking by the time the red dust settles on Court Philippe Chatrier. Here are three matchups Thursday that should prove interesting:
Serena Williams, the former champion and now ranked No. 451, is playing her first post-baby Grand Slam. Matthew Stockman/Getty Images
No. 451 Serena Williams vs. No. 17 seed Ashleigh Barty (Williams leads series 1-0)
These women both know a thing or two about comebacks, although theirs could not have been more different. Williams is newly returned to the tour at age 36 after giving birth last September. Barty, once a prodigy, left the tour, burned out at age 18, to try her hand at pro cricket in her native Australia. She returned to the tour in February 2016.

Williams needs to avoid an emotional letdown after getting through the jitters and surviving the general pressure of her first match in Grand Slam play since late January 2017. She was able to raise her game at the most crucial of times in her first-round win over Kristyna Pliskova, and logged other promising stats: a plus-4 differential in winners-to-unforced errors (29-25), a 75 percent success rate in net points and an 80 percent winning percentage when she put her first serve into play.
Barty has a great head for tennis and so much variety in her game that in her early days on the tour she was often compared to Martina Hingis. A pro since age 14, she won the Wimbledon junior title shortly after she turned 15. But significant singles success eluded her, partly because she's just 5-foot-5. Since her return, she reached a career-high ranking in January of No. 16.
Williams must be wary of Barty's assortment of spins and drop shots as well as her solid forehand. Barty, 6-4 on clay over the past 52 weeks, will try to jerk Williams all over the court and tire her out, something she was unable to accomplish in their only previous meeting. But that was long ago and far away, on the Australian Open hard courts. The slower clay will afford Barty more latitude in trying to pry open Williams' game.
Prediction: Williams should be able to hit through Barty, but she needs to keep the match short.
This promises to be a real barnburner between two of the most charismatic and fan-friendly women on the WTA tour. Who can forget the "Petko dance," or the time Mattek-Sands arrived at the Wimbledon players' party dressed as a ... tennis ball?
The careers of both women have been significantly affected by knee injuries. While Petkovic, who's 30, has been relatively healthy for some time now, Mattek-Sands, 33, is in the midst of an aggressive comeback from a dislocated kneecap and ruptured patellar ligament, suffered at Wimbledon last year.
The previous matches between this pair have been very close, the best of them a second-round 2010 US Open clash won by Petkovic, 7-5 in the third set. Mattek-Sands won their only meeting on clay, in the qualifying for Madrid in 2013. Both women play aggressively from the baseline, with Mattek-Sands -- a terrific doubles player -- more eager to get to the net to finish points.
Prediction: This one is a toss-up.
Simona Halep, twice a runner-up in Paris, is looking to figure out what it takes to finish the French Open as a champion. Chaz Niell/Icon Sportswire
No. 1 seed Simona Halep vs. No. 72 wild card Taylor Townsend (Halep 1-0)
You couldn't blame Townsend if you caught her wandering around humming the words from that old chestnut, "I love Paris (in the springtime)." Nor could you fault Halep for wondering what it will take for her to finally crack the Roland Garros code. Townsend is a respectable 4-3 in Paris despite never having been ranked higher than No. 130 going in until this year. Halep is a two-time runner-up who muffed a lead of a set and a break against first-time Grand Slam finalist Jelena Ostapenko in last year's final.
Townsend has a fascinating game. She isn't a great mover, but she has marvelous hands and an innate feel for the ball as well as the ebb and flow of a given point. Her clay-court record lately has been excellent: She's 18-3 since the start of Charleston, and that includes her first-round win at Roland Garros. Townsend returned well in that match, winning 38 percent of the points when Myrtille Georges put her first serve into play.
A comparably sharp return game will help Townsend against Halep, who isn't the most intimidating server on the tour. But Halep, who overcame a sleepy start to roll through Alison Riske in her first match, is one of the most gifted when it comes to retrieving, rallying and counterpunching. That means Townsend will have to find ways to keep the match from becoming a track meet. She held her own for the better part of a set in their only previous meeting, a straight-sets win for Halep in 2017 in Cincinnati.
Prediction: Halep in straight sets; she's just too steady and quick on the clay.
Upset Special: The great things once predicted for Donna Vekic, a hard-hitting Croatian, haven't happened yet. Maybe they will start with an upset of Maria Sharapova.
Tim Kay, 53, who lost his longtime job as a window installer due to failing health, says a basic income would have helped him avoid becoming homeless, which made his health problems worse. Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
As Ontario gears up to launch a basic income pilot project, described as a simpler, more effective way to fight poverty than welfare and other supports, the Star spoke to three Torontonians struggling to get by to see how they would spend the no-strings-attached payment. * * * Tim Kay quit school when he was 16 to work in his father's window installing business. He spent the next 34 years working in the industry for various companies until his body gave out and he lost his job. “I couldn't climb a ladder anymore. I would just get too winded,” says the 53-year-old Scarborough man who has since been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart trouble. “I can't even climb stairs anymore. My doctor tells me not to.” Failing health and job loss was the beginning of Kay's downward spiral to the streets. Homeless and too afraid to stay in a shelter, he spent two years couch surfing and sleeping in parks, where his breathing got worse.
Article Continued Below
Although Toronto's Streets to Homes program helped Kay find a bachelor apartment last fall, the past three years have taken a toll. He has lost all but two bottom teeth due to numerous beatings on the streets. And he says his nerves “are shot.” “If I had access to a basic income back then, I would have been able to afford rent,” he says. “I probably would still have all my teeth. And I wouldn't be so sick.” Hay is an example of a growing number of older, low-wage workers engaged in manual labour who fall into deep poverty due to lay-off, disability or ill health.
At a time when high-skilled workers with post-secondary education have difficulty finding work, job prospects for older unemployed workers like Hay are limited. Too young to qualify for federal senior's benefits of at least $1,525 a month, Hay's only option is welfare, which provides half that amount. As a result, Hay constantly struggles to pay rent and buy food while his health continues to deteriorate due to the stress. A basic income equivalent to 75 per cent of Ontario's 2016 poverty line, as proposed in a provincial discussion paper last fall, could replace Hay's meagre welfare cheque with a monthly payment of $1,415. “If I had a basic income, I'd be able to live in a better neighbourhood where I'm not so afraid to go out,” he says. “I could afford toiletries, detergent to wash my clothes, all those things that cost money that I just don't have.” Hay has just qualified for the Ontario Disability Support Program, the province's welfare program for people with disabilities, which provides up to $1,128 a month. But if he manages to find a part-time job, he would be able to keep just $200 before his wages are clawed back. The rent on his affordable apartment would also go up. Former Conservative senator Hugh Segal, a long-time advocate of basic income, suggested people with disabilities on the basic income pilot should receive an additional $500 a month. It would mean people like Hay could receive up to $1,915 a month. And depending on how the pilot project is structured, he might be able to keep any earnings on top of that. Hay's blue eyes widen at the prospect. Anti-poverty activists say a basic income would fill an important gap in Ontario's social safety net by supporting older, unemployed workers until they are eligible for more generous seniors' benefits. They say it would cut food bank use, improve health and reduce stress and social isolation. However, a basic income should be set at a level that lifts people out of poverty and should not come at the expense of other social supports, including job and life skills training, notes Richard Matern of Toronto's Daily Bread Food Bank. * * *
Laila Rashidie, 29, who has a Master's degree in education but has spent the past three years working a series low-wage temp jobs trying to break into teaching, says a basic income could help her get established in her career. ( VINCE TALOTTA )
As a child refugee from Afghanistan, Laila Rashidie was determined to get a good education and escape the low-income struggles she endured growing up in a newcomer family in North York. She excelled in school and earned three degrees, including a Master's in Education. But since graduating in 2012, Rashidie has been able to obtain only temporary contract work, mostly in high-skill but low-pay administrative jobs. The 29-year-old single woman is on the Toronto District School Board occasional teacher list and is trying to work enough hours to be considered for a long-term occasional contract, key to obtaining a permanent teaching job. But after two years, she can no longer afford to wait every morning for the phone to ring with an offer to replace a teacher who is ill or otherwise unable to work that day. She has to take any job she can find to pay her rent and put food on the table. Since she can't afford an apartment downtown where most of the temp jobs are located, Rashidie often stays with a friend and goes back to York Region on weekends where she rents a one-bedroom unit. “I have no career stability, no income stability or even housing stability,” she says. “I can't wait at home for the occasional one-day teaching assignment. I need a stable income.” Rashidie says she is not alone. Most of her peers are having similar difficulties building careers in a tight and changing employment landscape. “A basic income would give me some stability, both mentally and emotionally,” she says. “At least I would be able to rent or share an apartment downtown, closer to transit and work. I could afford to stay on the supply teaching list. I could begin to pursue a permanent career.” Although a basic income could provide financial stability while younger workers get established, workers' rights advocates caution the initiative must not be used to prop up precarious work and low wages. “Any basic income program must be accompanied by strong employment standards legislation, increased access to unionization and a minimum wage that brings people above the poverty line,” says Pam Frache, an organizer with the Workers' Action Centre. * * *
Nesha Khan, a single mother of five, works as a short-order cook and struggles to get by. Generous child benefits mean she probably wouldn't qualify for a basic income unless monthly payments brought participants to the poverty line. ( Vince Talotta )
Nesha Khan, 48, is a mother of five who has struggled from the day she arrived from South America in 1994 under Canada's spousal sponsorship program. With little formal education and low literacy skills, she had few options when her marriage broke down. A women's shelter helped her find subsidized housing where her current monthly rent is about $750. And in 2004 she landed a job as a short-order cook. Today, Khan earns $12.50 an hour. But the fluctuating nature of the work means she is often laid off and has to draw employment insurance. As a result, she supports herself and four of her children on annual earnings and EI benefits of about $24,000 after taxes. If it wasn't for about $22,000 in child benefits and tax, she would be living in deep poverty. But these benefits raise Khan's annual income to $46,000, just short of the $49,000 low-income measure, or poverty line, for a family of five in Ontario. The measure is equal to half the median household income in the province, adjusted by family size. If a basic income was set at 75 per cent of the low-income measure, Khan probably wouldn't qualify. But if it was set at 100 per cent, she could receive about $250 a month. This money would help pay for her daughter's Kumon math tutoring and hip hop dance classes, Khan says. It could also help pay for hockey and basketball for her sons. But Khan worries the extra income might push up her rent and she may end up no further ahead. “It's very hard,” she says. “What little money you have, you have to give away (in rent increases.) You can't save.” Social policy expert John Stapleton says Khan is like most low-income single parents. While provincial and federal child benefits have pulled most of these families closer to the provincial poverty line, they are still struggling, especially in Toronto where the cost of living is high. “Khan's case shows how a basic income doesn't really help people who are right at the razor's edge of poverty,” he said. “It supports the view in some circles that a basic income would have to be set a little bit above the poverty line to make a difference.”
LOS ANGELES—The whiff of plagiarism is blowin' in the wind for Bob Dylan.Phrases sprinkled throughout the rock legend's lecture for his Nobel Prize in literature are very similar to phrases from the summation of Moby Dick on SparkNotes, a sort of online “Cliff's Notes” that's familiar to modern students looking for shortcuts and teachers trying to catch them.The saga began when writer Ben Greenman pointed out on his blog on June 6 that Dylan appeared to have invented a quote from Moby Dick, which Dylan discussed in the lecture along with Buddy Holly, “The Odyssey” and “All Quiet on the Western Front.”Then Andrea Pitzer, a writer for Slate, delved into the supposed quote and wrote in a story Tuesday that the line was not in Moby Dick but was very much like a line from the SparkNotes summary of the book.Here's Dylan: “Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness”Article Continued BelowAnd SparkNotes: “someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness.”Pitzer went on to find, and The Associated Press has verified, 20 other sentences with traces and phrases from the Moby Dick SparkNotes. She cites no examples in Dylan's discussion of the other two books, and the AP found none.The cases Pitzer found are not blatant or explicit — there are no verbatim sentences, only identical phrases and similar phrasing.
With the marching season under way in Northern Ireland, few realise that it was once a cause for celebration in Limerick where Orange Lodges operated across the county. Armagh historian Quincey Dougan takes a look at this little known element of Limerick's heritage.
In 1875, Number 97 George Street in Limerick, now better known as O'Connell Street, was purchased by the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association.
They soon added a lecture hall and gym to the building, which also accommodated a library, reading room and billiards room. At different times the premises served as headquarters for Limerick Masonic Lodges, but perhaps of more interest was its use for another lesser known body.
Number 97 George Street was the last meeting place of the County Limerick Grand Orange Lodge.
The willingness of many Limerick Protestants to embrace Orangeism is not surprising given the city's role in the ‘Glorious Revolution', also known as the Siege of Limerick in 1690 and the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. That chapter in the city's history is now largely forgotten as its Protestant population has dwindled.
The first lodge was established by May 1798; and by 1824 it was big enough to accommodate a countywide organising structure, with the Northumberland Rooms its regular meeting place under the leadership of County Grand Master Ralph Hill.
That same year it is recorded that one lodge in the City enrolled 175 new members!
Continue reading below...
By 1836, there were eight lodges and in 1869 this had risen to 15 affiliates including lodges in Adare, Rathkeale, Ennis and Tralee. By this point, there was no county structure in operation with the Limerick Orangemen being tied to County Cork. In 1871 it became the ‘Limerick District' of County Cork Grand Orange Lodge, and in 1874 once again became a County Lodge in its own right under the leadership of Charles Monck Wilson.
There are no recorded Orange parades in Limerick but regular celebrations of Orange dates such as July 1 and 12 were common. In 1839, the local press reported that it was the first year in memory that the ‘Limerick Orange Bells' of the Cathedral did not ring out on July 12. However individual lodges continued to meet privately to celebrate the date for many decades to follow.
At its peak, there were more than 800 Limerick Orangemen and a strong local organisation survived well into the 1880s.
Decline came as local Protestants became fearful of being identified with the Orange Institution, and the County structure ceased to exist in 1899. One working lodge, LOL 1080 ‘Schomberg' however continued to meet and work in the 20th Century.
By the onset of the Civil War there were no traces of any active Orangeism in the city or county.
The latest in a series of presentations looking at the forgotten Orange heritage will examine Limericks Orange history in depth. The venue will be Sloan's House Museum of Orange Heritage in Loughgall on August 29 at 8pm.
The museum has recently taken possession of an exhibit of much broader Limerick historical interest. Patrick Sarsfield's sword, which was presented to him by Charles VII of Sweden, will soon be on display.
If you have any insights, knowledge of or regalia relating to the Orange Institution in Munster, or would like to learn more about the event, contact Quincey Dougan at qdougan01@qub.ac.uk or on 00447835624221.

Provincial police say four people suffered minor injuries when a small plane went off the runway at a Tobermory, Ont., airport.
Police say the Piper Warrior was attempting to take off from the Tobermory Airport on Sunday night when the 50-year-old pilot from Kitchener, Ont., decided to abort the takeoff.
Investigators say the plane slid sideways off the end of the runway and came to rest on its roof.
Paramedics treated the four occupants at the scene and OPP say the plane sustained significant damage in the second crash at Tobermory Airport this year.
The plane had a flight plan filed to fly from Tobermory to Kitchener-Waterloo Airport.
Source: The foundations of the Marshall Plan with Africa | The Zimbabwean
The Marshall Plan with Africa is being proposed by The Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation of Germany which recently put out a discussion paper titled “Africa and Europe- a new partnership for development peace and a better future.”
This paper is inviting input of ideas into a new paradigm on the relationship between Europe and Africa, and seeks to set a tone of what the key issues need to be and has termed them the cornerstones of a Marshall plan with Africa.
The plan has ten starting points which are considered critical for progress and three key pillars which support it. I have covered these. It then has what it terms: the foundations for a Marshall Plan with Africa, which will be my final review of the subject matter. These critical foundations include food and agriculture, the protection of natural resources, energy and infrastructure and lastly health education and social protection.
This week we will look at the issue of food and agriculture.
The first observation is that Africa could feed itself and yet it imports $35billion annually in food imports. The agriculture sector has been neglected and even though it employs at estimated 70% of Africa's population, it only adds an estimated 30% value to GDP. Something is wrong as more than 230 million people (one in four) in Africa are facing hunger.
It is therefore critical that Africa increases its productivity in agriculture through better education, skills development and access to information through better research and markets.
Africa's more than 300 million small scale farmers can contribute significantly to food security through secure land rights, better land use, access to affordable development and productive capital including insurance and an expanded infrastructure. In addition to this, they also need to add value to other crops so that they may create higher sustainable incomes.
What must happen?
We need to see Africa pursuing better policies which result in food security especially for vulnerable groups especially pregnant women, mothers and children. We must also see more investment in innovation agriculture to diversify, increase yields and also to value add.
Intra Africa trade is also key and this requires removal of trade barriers and the development of appropriate infrastructures to create access to new regional markets. It is estimated that Africa only trades with itself 11% while Europe trades with itself 80% of goods and services most then of course being manufactured goods. That has to change for more value to be retained within the continent and create jobs.
It is also suggested that there will be need to protect Africa's agricultural markets in order to allow locally driven growth and development. All this must of course be underpinned by secure land rights.
German will strengthen rural development initiatives and assist the establishment of local supply chains with high quality standards. It will also intensify public research on seeds and breeding while creating more access for small holder farmers to new technologies in order to increase productivity.
Europe will afford better access to its markets for African produce. It will also allow the strengthening of measures to protect Africa's agriculture sector to facilitate growth and diversification while abolishing its unfair subsidies through the WTO.
It will promote youth employment and innovation in the agriculture sector. It intends to also protect Africa's fisheries and conclude fair agreements which prohibit illegal fishing.
As Africans, our belief must first be that hunger in Africa as a whole is not inevitable and malnutrition is not a consequence of food scarcity, but a result of the way our economies are organized and of the political choices we have made to address—or ignore—the causes of hunger and poverty.
Amartya Sen (1999) in his book Development as Freedom defines hunger by saying that “Hunger relates not only to food production and agricultural expansion, but also to the functioning of the entire economy. It includes the operation of the political and social arrangements that can, directly or indirectly, influence people's ability to acquire food and to achieve health and nourishment.”
We must create a new narrative that says that in Africa, we can grow enough food, we have the necessary land and water resources, we know enough about agricultural economics, and we can afford to provide the basic needs that protect every person's entitlement to an adequate, nutritious diet. But this depends on political leadership and the choices we make going forward.
Sadly Zimbabwe is a good lesson of how to destroy agriculture and decimate rural livelihoods and increase poverty. We are therefore a bad example of land reform and we will need to rationalise this post Mugabe era. A Successful agricultural recovery will drive recovery of industry where 60% of industrial input comes from the agricultural sector. This can help to create jobs thus improve disposable incomes and have a positive impact to also reduce urban poverty.
In his speech in South Africa in 1994, the late Harry Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, pleaded with African leadership to “resolve contradictions between the aspirations of their people and the realities of the economy. They have to settle on a formula which gives enough relief to many who feel they have been dispossessed – but will not cause serious damage to the competitiveness of the economy”. Unfortunately, this seems to have fallen on deaf ears.
We can certainly give a new impetus to reconstruction to Zimbabwe and make a decisive contribution to the revival of the whole economy, renewal of urban and rural infrastructure, the modernization of our industrial base, the resumption of normal production, the raising of productivity creating employment, and the facilitating of intra-regional trade through adopting the Marshall Plan with Africa.

The new B.C. government has followed through on their 2016 campaign promise of banning the contentious practice of grizzly bear trophy hunting.
Along with ending grizzly bear trophy hunting, the B.C. NDP announced they would also stop all hunting of grizzlies in the Great Bear Rainforest. Hunting grizzlies for sport was banned in the Great Bear Rainforest by the Coastal First Nations four years ago.

“By bringing trophy hunting of grizzlies to an end, we're delivering on our commitment to British Columbians,” Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations Minister Doug Donaldson said in a release.
“This action is supported by the vast majority of people across our province. In particular, we owe it to generations past and future to do all we can to protect the beauty and uniqueness of the Great Bear Rainforest. We believe the action we're taking goes beyond the commitment to Coastal First Nations made as part of the 2016 Great Bear Rainforest agreements.”

Premier John Horgan made the pledge in November 2016 after a recent poll found 90 per cent of British Columbians were opposed to the hunt, adding the hunt didn't make economic or environmental sense.
Another poll conducted by Insights West in late January found 74 per cent of voters in five rural ridings with significant hunting traditions said they opposed the trophy hunting of grizzly bears.

The Ministry estimates there are 15,000 grizzly bears in B.C. and each year about 250 are killed by hunters. While the trophy hunt will end, hunting for meat will be allowed to continue.
Horgan's pledge in 2016 was met with criticism by conservationists. Chris Genovali from the Raincoast Conservation Foundation called it a “pretend to eat the meat policy.”
Ian MacAllister of the group Pacific Wild, which has been fighting to end the grizzly bear hunt for years, said at the time, Horgan's plan is unenforceable.
“There's clearly no way to enforce this. The only way they'd be able to do that is to video-monitor a hunter as they ate their grizzly bear dinner, to see if they did in fact consume the meat,” McAllister said.
The ministry said in the coming months Donaldson will be consulting with First Nations and other stakeholders to figure out next steps.
The Commercial Bear Viewing Association (CBVA) said in a written statement that it applauds the new policy and although they believe all grizzly bear hunting is trophy hunting, will look forward to consulting with the B.C. government about next steps.
The ban on grizzly bear trophy hunting will take effect on Nov. 30.

PALMDALE, Calif. (AP)  Authorities arrested two teen suspects after a man was repeatedly stabbed during a fight in the parking lot of a church in northern Los Angeles County.
Sheriff's officials say the 21-year-old victim was hospitalized in stable condition with at least ten stab wounds after collapsing late Thursday in Palmdale.
A witness told investigators the man had fought with a group of people and the suspects fled in multiple vehicles.
Officials say a short time later deputies took two male suspects, 17 and 18 years old, into custody.

Before Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump met Monday, members of the Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership (STEP) were confident.
Some concern existed surrounding Trump's protectionist approach to trade, though he called the trading relationship with Canada “outstanding.”

“We'll be tweaking it. We'll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries,” Trump said.
The remarks are positive news for Saskatchewan exporters, but they'll need to remain vigilant, said STEP president and CEO Chris Dekker.
“The devil is always in the details. So the level of the negotiations or the re-negotiations between our two countries on NAFTA, we'll have to wait for the specifics to come out,” Dekker said.
Jeff Simpson, who farms in the Ruthilda, Sask. area called the United States a key market for Saskatchewan producers.
“We don't want to see any changes with that. We certainly don't want a lower amount of product going down there,” Simpson said.
He cited the softwood lumber agreement and country of origin labeling as past examples of trade struggles between the two nations.
“We do not want to go back to that,” he said.
On Monday, Premier Brad Wall stated he was hopeful and that both countries have “much to lose” if either is too protectionist.

“When we hear Americans concerned about job loss and trade issues, by and large, their reference to countries is limited to Mexico and China,” Wall said.

Toronto police resume dig at home where Bruce McArthur worked as landscaper
The investigation into alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur has triggered an internal police probe. (Photo by THE CANADIAN PRESS)
Toronto police say they will resume digging at a property where accused serial killer Bruce McArthur worked as a landscaper.
Police have already found the remains of seven men buried in planters at the property in midtown Toronto.
McArthur, 66, has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of eight men with ties to Toronto's gay village.
“We originally did a dig at the property over the winter and nothing was found,” police spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said.
“Then we decided to go back and revisit all the properties (where McArthur worked) again when the springtime hit and the thaw was done.”
Canine units found “a number of different spots” of interest on the property when they returned in the spring, Gray said.
Police dogs also searched about 100 other properties with links to McArthur's landscaping business but found nothing, she said.
The excavation began Wednesday and is expected to last multiple weeks, Gray said.
McArthur, currently in custody at a west Toronto jail, is alleged to have killed Selim Esen, Skandaraj Navaratnam, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Dean Lisowick, Soroush Mahmudi, Abdulbasir Faizi and Kirushna Kanagaratnam.
His case is scheduled to return to court on July 23.

As state and local agencies continue to search for the body of 16-year-old girl in the Merrimack River, one man has been arrested in connection to the jet ski crash that caused the girl to go missing, according to investigators.
State Environmental Police report Douglas Dematos, 32, of Lowell, was arrested Monday morning for operating a jet ski under the influence of alcohol. He faces several other charges, including driving negligently, at night, without lights, too close to another vessel as well as use of an unregistered motorboat.
Dematos was allegedly on the jet ski that collided with the same jet ski the 16-year-old girl was riding. According to environmental police, the teen was riding on the rear of a jet ski with another person.
The impact of the crash knocked the teen into the river, while the other passenger was transported to a hospital and is now recovering fine. Authorities also said the operators of the jet skis all knew each other.
At around 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, officers were sent to the Merrimack River for reports of people yelling. Soon they learned of the jet ski crash and began a multi-agency search for the 16-year-old teenager. The search was suspended at 3 a.m. and picked up again Monday morning at 5 a.m.
The renewed search for the missing girl, a 16-year-old who was reportedly wearing jean shorts, a black top and a yellow life vest, is being conducted by the Chelmsford Fire Department, Massachusetts Environmental Police, State Police and the Lowell Police/Fire Dive Team. The search will take place over a two-mile radius in the Merrimack River.
Dematos will be held overnight at the Chelmsford Police Department and will be arraigned on Tuesday at Lowell District Court.
This is a developing story.

Germany and Costa Rica play the Group C opener of the FIFA U-17 World Cup at the Nehru stadium in Fatorda today and the result could well be an indicator which team from amongst the two ends up winner of the group. Iran plays Guinea in the second match of the evening.
Germany, Costa Rica, Iran and Guinea have all been practising in the various practice grounds in Goa and from the four – based purely on watching their practise sessions- Germany and Costa Rica appear to have a slight edge over their rivals- an edge that is unpredictable and one that makes football worth spending time watching.
Germany was the first to arrive and have got an edge over the feel of the weather in Goa over their rivals. Germany is enjoying world domination in football today in all age groups and appears to have come well prepared to add this tile into the cabinet.
The Under -17 German players are shaping into the German style of play-fast, accurate and powerful. The players bond well and most of their practise was centered on loosening up and adjusting to a different environment.
The Germans showed more maturity in their approach to the ball and have a physical advantage over most of the other members of their group.
Costa Rica , on the other hand , will tend to slow their opponents with their sleek style of football , quick short passing and nice long curlers that on any day could fox any goalkeeper. Their style is more South American- where emphasis is on entertaining with ball possession- and this could well kill the steam of Germany.
The football demonstrated by the Costa Rican will endear more to fans from Goa .They start with short passes and switch to the long ball when switching the game and that do that very often. They use the centre to switch wings and a few of their players have demonstrated a penchant to take long shots at goals – sometimes from almost zero angles.
Many of their players are versatile using both feet- for short passes and long balls and this could be a dampener to Germany's plans.
Both have good goalkeepers and perhaps the power and unpredictability could be the tools that will need to be used to beat both goalkeepers.
Iran did not get much support during the Under -16 AFC Cup because India were the hosts and thus ate away whatever they could from the crowds. The story is different now with India playing in New Delhi and Iran being the Asian flavour in Goa.
The team has progressed substantially since they last played in Goa and whether there is support or not , they seem to have walked the extra mile to ready themselves for this stage. The co-ordination and understanding between players is showing a lot of improvement and the boys do not appear to be physically beaten by their rivals.
How Iran reacts to European or South American flavour is something that will be worth waiting for.
The second match today between Iran and Guinea will witness powerhouses of two continents trying to show that age or physique does not play much in football. What does is the control over the ball and how it is used to fox opponents.
Guinea has the youngest player in the team in fifteen year old Ibrahima and there are two others within the same age group. It is not clear whether they would be in the starting eleven or not. However, what coach Camara said is worth remembering: “ The players are in the team not because of their age but because they are the best in this age group.”
Quite a few Costa Ricans are tall but the rest have shown to be the type not to be intimated by physical appearances. They appear to be of the types who have their own ways to hinder their opponents and seemed prepared to fox all with their plans. Guinea was one team that did not give much access to the public or the media.
Football is, like most sports, beautiful because it is unpredictable. Sat the end of ninety minutes any team can win and any team can win the group. However, what can be said from watching most practise sessions is – football fans in Goa are set for a quality of football never seen before.
LONDON (Reuters) - Yohann Diniz produced an astonishing solo tour de force to become the oldest man ever to become a world athletics champion at the age of 39 as he won the 50-kilometre walk title on Sunday.
The French world record holder, one of the great figures of race walking, produced the second fastest walk in history, 3 hours 33 minutes 12 seconds -- a time only he has bettered -- with one of the performances of the entire World Championships.
Diniz was so dominant en route to his long-awaited first global title that he lapped nearly all the 43-strong field over the 2km looped circuit on The Mall, finishing less than a minute adrift of his three-year-old world record of 3:32:33.
He was even able to take a swift comfort break when leading in the first 15 minutes before rejoining the race and destroying his opponents over the 25 laps between Admiralty Arch and Buckingham Palace.
A great showman, father of two Diniz was even able to smile and wave to the crowds lining the course well before the finish as he landed a third gold of the championships for France.
He blew kisses towards Buckingham Palace on the last circuit, turning it into a glorified lap of honour, and approached the line while making a scarf out of a tricolour he had grabbed from the crowd before then hoisting it aloft to celebrate his new championship record.
He had only one moment of concern when he received a red card for an infringement at about the 20km mark. "I started having doubts but in training, we have been doing lots of changes of rhythms, so I just kept going.
"I got a card too and I thought 'I just must not mess this up.' I just concentrated completely on my technique.
"Last night I kept away from watching the athletics on TV because I did not want to get too excited. I went to bed at nine because I knew it was going to be my day!"
Athletics - World Athletics Championships – men's 50 km walk – London Stadium, London, Britain – August 13, 2017 – Yohann Diniz of France celebrates winning the gold medal. Matthew Childs
His eight-minute gap over his two distant Japanese pursuers, silver medallist Hirooki Arai (3:41:17) and bronze medallist Kai Kobayashi (3:41:19), was by far the biggest ever recorded in the championships.
Diniz became the oldest male world champion in any event, surpassing another walker, 37-year-old Veniamin Soldatenko. The Soviet athlete won a specially-staged 50km event in Malmo in 1976, seven years before Helsinki staged the first global championships.
Belarussian Ellina Zvereva holds the overall record of being the oldest world champion, having won the women's discus in 2001 at the age of 40.
Diniz's triumph, the first ever in race walking by a Frenchman, came a year after his heartbreak in the Rio Olympic final when he led by nearly two minutes before he collapsed at 37km with heatstroke, dehydration and gastric problems.
He was then hailed as a hero as he got up, insisted on continuing and, incredibly, finished the race in eighth place.
When Diniz competed on this same course on the Mall during the 2012 Olympics, he had been forced to pull out during the race.
His familiar all-or-nothing approach had seen the three-time European champion Diniz miss out in five previous global championships but for a man famed for being a wine-making expert, this was a champagne moment.
Would it not perhaps be the perfect time to retire on a high, he was asked. "It is a lovely Sunday afternoon. I know you should never take any decision when you are hot," he smiled.
"I am still missing one title and that is the Olympic one. It would be a nice way to finish in Tokyo."

Kid Rock is reportedly being considered as a potential candidate for Senate.
The 46-year-old musician, real name Robert Ritchie, was apparently discussed during a Michigan Republican Party convention last weekend, according to Rollcall.com.
The website reports the rocker was thrown into the mix as one of the Republican contenders for Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow's Senate seat next year, but no official decisions have been made as yet.
While Rock's name is likely to come as a surprise to the majority, he has always been very vocal about his political beliefs. Despite considering himself as Republican, there are some issues he disagrees with the party on, as he previously explained to The Guardian newspaper.
“I am definitely a Republican on fiscal issues and the military, but I lean to the middle on social issues. I am no fan of abortion, but it's not up to a man to tell a woman what to do. As an ordained minister I don't look forward to marrying gay people, but I'm not opposed to it,” he said.
Born Free singer Rock has been a massive supporter of several Republican candidates, including Mitt Romney during his bid for the U.S. presidency back in 2012.
He is also a supporter of new U.S. President Donald Trump, and began stocking Trump merchandise in his online store prior to the November election. Among the items are T-shirts bearing the slogan “God, Guns & Trump”, and hats stating, “Make America Bada-- Again”.
The right to bear arms is something Rock feels very passionately about, and he owns several guns himself, including a .22 rifle and a semi-automatic with a silencer.
“I'm always buying more guns. I have everything from a Civil War cannon to an MP5 machine gun and old police guns. If someone invades your house, yeah, you can shoot them. I don't think crazy people should have guns,” he added.
LAYYAH-The people held a protest as Indus River has eroded hundreds of homes and crops while completely destroyed more than 20 villages in Layyah during the last week.
Almost 400 homes of Union Council Lohanch Nasheeb have been destroyed due to erosion while crops destruction has cause heavy loss to the farmers.
Indus River erosion started from September 2016 and destroyed Basti Matla, Basti Bodla, Basti Manjotha, basti Dirkhan Wali, Basti Sobywali, Basti Jar, Basti Tahirwali and many others. It continued the whole year on a 72 kilometre area in low-lying strip of Layyah. The residents of village Chandharar protested against the district administration, parliamentarians and the Punjab chief minister.
Residents Ikramullah, Khuda Bakhsh and others talking to The Nation said that the people of low-lying areas were facing heavy loss of houses, crops and other material but the chief minister cannot pay attention to the issue. They said that if a dog dies in Lahore, the CM reached at the spot but in Layyah, thousands of people have been displaced, but the government did not pay any attention to them. They demanded tents, food and land for their resettlement. Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader Javed Iqbal visited the effected village and assured them of his support.
LUCKNOW: Intensifying its crackdown on criminals, the Uttar Pradesh Police has arrested twenty four criminals in 15 encounters in different districts of the state during the past two days.
The encounters took place in Bulandshahr, Shamli, Kanpur, Saharanpur, Lucknow, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, Gorkahpur, Hapur and Meerut. "As many as 24 wanted criminals were arrested and one gangster killed in 15 police encounters reported from 10 districts of the state over a span of 48 hours," a police spokesperson said.
The Special Task Force also gunned down gangster Inderpal, who carried a reward of Rs 25,000, in an encounter in Naglakhepad jungle. Inderpal was wanted in over 30 cases of loot and murder in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
Apart from cash, countrymade arms, ammunition, motorcycle, have also been recovered from the criminals.
The maximum number of encounters were conducted in Bulandshahr and Shamli in which four and six criminals were arrested respectively.
Two suspected criminals and two policemen, including a station house officer, were injured in an encounter in Gorakhpur. The incident took place when two suspected criminals - Maneesh Yadav and Manoj Yadav - were escaping after threatening a village head. Police caught the duo in an encounter in which Station House Officer, Khorabar, Sudhir Kumar, and Sub-Inspector, Jhangha, Sunil Kumar Singh suffered minor injuries.
Police claimed that the two have confessed to their involvement in the murder of businessman Dinesh Gupta of Nai Bazaar, Jhangha, in Gorakhpur on Sunday.
The Uttar Pradesh Police is acting tough against criminals after the new DGP OP Singh took charge last month. Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath had also vowed to take strict action against the criminals after his government faced criticism over a string of crimes in the state.

The B.C. Government has introduced legislation that will give Indigenous communities greater involvement in child-welfare decisions.
Minister of Children and Family Development Katrine Conroy introduced a bill that, if passed, would support more ways to keep children in their Indigenous communities and ensure those communities receive ongoing notification of legal proceedings affecting children.
“Keeping Indigenous children connected to their family and communities is a key priority of out government,” said Conroy. “We will continue to listen to, and work with Indigenous communities to reform the child-welfare system and reduce the number of Indigenous children in care.”
The way the current law works is that the the ministry can only reach out to a child's Indigenous community with the parent's consent or to ensure the child's safety and well-being. The government says this makes it challenging for the Indigenous community and social workers to find alternatives to removing the children from their home.

The province was recently criticized for removing a child from an Indigenous parent who is a member of the Huu-ay-aht First Nation. The baby was returned after nearly two months following a ruling from a B.C. Provincial Court Judge.
“This judgment provides strong recognition of the importance of the maternal/infant bond, and the obligation upon the ministry to fully consider the supports that are available to keep mom and baby together rather than simply removing the infant from the mother,” said Maegen Giltrow, counsel for the mother and Huu-ay-aht at the time.
“This is an especially important recognition of the role of the Huu-ay-aht community in supporting one of its citizens as she moves into the role of new mother.”

The decision of social workers to remove the child from its mother drew quick criticism from the province's Children's Representative Bernard Richard. He said the case is extremely frustrating, adding that it is complicated, but that it shouldn't be complicated to allow for breastfeeding and to provide necessary support for the mother to stay in her community.
“In fact, the community has really come out quite strongly in support of this mom. They're providing resources to her, [and] they're asking the court to be able to help her stay in close proximity to her baby,” said Richard.

The Huu-ay-aht First Nation is supporting the changes announced on Tuesday but has concerns about whether the child-welfare system will be properly funded to support Indigenous families.
“These changes are important in recognizing that Indigenous families and Indigenous communities share responsibility for the upbringing and well-being of Indigenous children,” said Huu-ay-aht Councillor Sheila Charles.
“However, the true test will be whether the government commits the financial resources and shows the willingness on the ground to work with us, so we are all working as hard as we can, doing everything we can for each child, together.”

The warm weather lured many people outside; Josh Alston spent most of Sunday morning roaming through Calgary on his quest to find some outdoor ice. Alston finally found some in at the Rosemont rink near Confederation Park.
“Half of them are melted and the other half were not even flooded. It's crazy. For December, it's really crazy,” Alston said.
“It's too hot for December with Christmas being less than 20 days away, it feels weird.”
Signs reading “keep off the ice” are up around Carburn Park in southeast Calgary. Carburn Park is one of seven outdoor rinks maintained by the City of Calgary. None are open now except for Olympic Plaza.
At Canada Olympic Park, snow making has been shut down since Wednesday because it's been too warm to make snow.
“It has to be -2 C or colder to make any decent snow,” WinSport spokesman Dale Oviatt said. “We did a little bit of a touch up on Wednesday but really it's just taking advantage of every opportunity we have. When it's this warm we can't do much. We have a really good base and then we just top it up whenever we can so really, it's spring-like conditions in December.”

PESHAWAR - Former spokesman for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and a key figure carrying the same responsibilities for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Ehsanullah Ehsan, yesterday surrendered to the security forces, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor disclosed Monday.
Ehsanullah Ehsan, a resident of Mohmand Agency's Safi tehsil whose actual name is Sajjad Mohmand, surrendered to the forces. Interestingly, he is the third spokesman for the terrorist organisation, who is in the forces' custody. Former TPP spokesman Molvi Umer and TTP Swat spokesperson Muslim Khan are already in the forces' custody.
Ehsanullah Ehsan has also been spokesman for Pakistani Taliban, however, in December 2011, he objected to the negotiations between the Taliban and the Pakistan government for a ceasefire. He asserted that the individuals were negotiating the ceasefire without the authorisation of the Taliban leadership. He was sacked by TTP on June 25, 2013. Omar Khorasani, a senior leader in the movement, established Jamaat-ul-Ahrar after developing differences with TTP chief Fazlullah in September 2014. Ehsan joined Omar Khorasani's Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. Fazlullah of Swat had become TTP chief after the death of Hakeemullah Mehsud in a drone strike in South Waziristan in November 2013.
Being Ahrar's man, Ehsan had claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist acts in Pakistan. Ahrar has not yet reacted to the information.
In 2014, after a split in the TTP, Ehsan had become a spokesperson for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) which was then a newly-formed splinter group of TTP. Ehsan had said once that 70 to 80 percent of TTP commanders and fighters had joined the splinter group.
Ehsan's surrender was interpreted as a major breakthrough as the JuA was sponsoring most of terrorist attacks in Pakistan since its creation, the experts said. His surrender is a serious setback for militants as he was one of their top leaders. The army spokesman did not elaborate on how Ehsan surrendered. He, however, said there can be no bigger achievement for Pakistan than the fact that the state's biggest enemies were surrendering to the forces.
The JuA was behind the horrific attack on The Mall Road, Lahore, earlier this year, which sent shock waves through the country.
Ehsanullah, had been active in media, especially using social media's various sites. Being much fond of sharing his pictures on social media, he most often used to send friendships offers to journalists. Sometimes, he talked on phone too. Ehsan has also been controversial among militants. Besides taking responsibility of militant acts, he had also accepted responsibility for attacking Malala Yousafzai. On October 17, 2012, the then interior minister Rehman Malik had announced Rs 100 million on Ehsan.

CHICAGO—A fatal shooting on the West Side over the weekend was the 100th homicide of the year in Chicago, a milestone reached nearly a month later than the past two years, according to data kept by the Tribune.
A 36-year-old man was sitting in a car in the 5400 block of West Division Street in South Austin when five people walked up and opened fire about 8:45 p.m. Sunday, police said.
Last year, Chicago recorded its 100th homicide on Feb 24. In 2016, it was on Feb. 22. Both years saw the worst gun violence in two decades.
The number of shootings and homicides this year continue to be higher than other recent years. In 2015, Chicago did not record its 100th homicide until April 10; in 2014 it was April 26 and in 2013 it was April 30.
At least 454 people have been shot in Chicago this year, again lower than 2016 and 2017 but higher than 2015, 2014 and 2013, according to Tribune data.
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday that a Brexit transition period will be agreed with the European Union in the next seven weeks as she tries to ease concerns that a deal could take longer to reach.
“In seven weeks time, we will have an agreement with the European Union, that is the timetable they have said on an implementation period,” May told the BBC in an interview.
French billionaire Vincent Bollore, who last week stepped down as chairman of media giant Vivendi, was taken by police into custody on Tuesday for questioning as part of an investigation into allegations of corrupt business practices in Africa.
The head of the Bollore Group, who is 66, is being questioned in the Paris suburb of Nanterre about how the group obtained contracts to run ports in Togo and Guinea, which are both former French colonies, his company has confirmed. Police now have up to 48 hours to investigate Bollore and decide whether he will stand trial.
News that the magnate whose group holds a majority stake in Vivendi, which in turn owns Universal Music Group and the Canal+ Group, caused shares in his Bollore Group holding company to tumble more than 8%, while Vivendi shares dropped around 1%.
In a statement Bollore Group has denied any illegal actions in its African operations.

If you've been reading Stereogum for long enough, you may have noticed something about your Stereogum staffers: We don't agree on shit. We argue constantly, in public and in private, and we get behind things that our colleagues consider absolute bullshit. Which is to say: We're music fans, and we do what music fans do. Every year, we get together to vote on our favorite albums, and some sort of rough-consensus picture comes out of that. But when it comes to our favorite songs, we keep those personal. So every year, we, your Stereogum staff, pick a few favorites, making sure not to pick any of the same songs. We're not voting. We're not arguing about whether these songs are the best. We're just sharing some songs that we loved. We hope you like them, but even if you don't, we still do.

This year I caved and bought an Amazon Echo. It's become the default device for listening to music in my home, even though at least once a day my daughter calls out “Alexa, STOP” when I'm merely trying to expose her to some classic Fleetwood Mac or something, man. Then at the office I'd be checking out an inexorable Late Late Show YouTube before two hours go by without me remembering to turn iTunes back on. It was almost as if streaming technology was conspiring to keep me from my music this year. Fortunately, I do my best listening on the subway and constant delays due to train traffic ahead meant I had ample time for Katy Perry mixing chillwave and dancehall and sounding like a woke Matthew Wilder. (“Chained To The Rhythm” might've been #1 on this list if I hadn't heard it so many times.) Toward the end of the year I spent an entire commute looping a haunting ballad by Susanne Sundfør then another looping Quicksand's fiery first track in 22 years. Both of those are included here, along with some jazz, metalcore, trip-hop, indie rock, etc. Topping the playlist is that Paramore song that sounds like Tango In The Night because old habits die hard.

Pop music still hasn't lost its capacity to surprise. Here in the Year of the Asshole, maybe it's not surprising that a song with Justin Bieber on it would top the charts all summer, dominating to historic degrees. But what was surprising was that the song in question was a deliriously horny Spanish reggaeton ballad and that Bieber would sing in lovely, fluid Spanish. (He would promptly forget all that Spanish and then make fun of it on video, but he is, after all, an asshole.) “Despacito” — as well as J Balvin and Willie William's “Mi Gente,” its little cousin — provided a lovely little moment for pop music. So did Cardi B, snarling with fearsome panache and ensuring that she'd never have do dance again. So did Kendrick Lamar, making a song that straight-up bangs in uncomplicated ways. My list has fun songs (Brockhampton's giddy “Gummy,” Carly Rae Jepsen's endorphin-shooting “Cut To The Feeling”). It has sad songs (Julien Baker's howling “Turn Out The Lights,” Jason Isbell's keening “If We Were Vampires”). It has hypnotic songs (Future's transcendently self-destructive “Mask Off,” Goldlink's quietly swaggering “Crew). And in this Year Of The Asshole, I needed all of them.

Back in August, I wrote a review of the War On Drugs' A Deeper Understanding, and buried somewhere among a few thousand other sentences was this one: “Right now, it's my favorite album of 2017, and I'll be pretty surprised if I'm not saying the same thing come December or a decade after that.” Well, it's now December, and I'm saying the same thing, with one caveat: My year was actually full of surprises. I was surprised by amazing new music from bands I'd never heard of before, and amazing new music from bands I'd never expected to hear from again. I'll be honest: When it came time to vote on our favorite albums, A Deeper Understanding wasn't even the clear #1 on my ballot — it was running neck and neck with Counterparts' You're Not You Anymore, a record that came out only four weeks after the War On Drugs' masterpiece. For me, that was a huge fucking surprise. So anyway, the two cuts at the top of this list are culled from my two favorite albums of 2017. After that, the rest of these songs aren't ranked so much as sequenced. I made this list the same way I would make a mixtape for my friends, back when people made mixtapes: starting easy, slowly drawing them further out, and finishing up with the epic, apocalyptic denoument. I miss those days. But things haven't changed all that much, really. It's just that, as we close out 2017 and get ready for the new year, there's nobody with whom I'd rather debate/hear/share music than Stereogum readers. My sincere wish is for all of us to still be doing this a decade from today, at which point we can fully test my theory about A Deeper Understanding. For now, this list is for you, from me. I hope you find some surprises.
01. The War On Drugs – “Strangest Thing”
02. Counterparts – “A Memory Misread”
03. Incendiary – “Awakening”
04. Body Count – “No Lives Matter”
05. Kreator – “Gods Of Violence”
06. Quicksand – “Cosmonauts”
07. Ostraca – “Waiting For The Crash”
08. Slowdive – “Sugar For The Pill”
09. Heaven In Her Arms – “Abyss Of The Moonbow”
10. Pallbearer – “A Plea For Understanding”

Let's dispense with the conceit that this list is unified by some grand narrative and move on to explaining why 100% of living humans agree these are all perfect songs. “Slide” is joy and confidence and perfect weather. “DNA.” and “No Halo” are brutal and exhilarating, albeit in vastly different ways. “Sanctuary” is brutal and exhilarating for 11 minutes and 14 seconds without ever ceasing to amaze. “T-Shirt,” with its hypnotic staccato stabs and eerie white noise and slo-mo swagger, converted every hardline lyrical-miracle hip-hop purist on Earth into a Migos lover forever. Or maybe that last part happened in a dream? After all, my other five universally beloved picks add up to an extended mirage. (Crap, a grand unifying narrative after all.) Instant standard “Love” traces the thrill of a new romance, melancholy melodic wonders “Dreams Tonite” and “Passionfruit” depict its gradual disintegration, the spectacular “Supercut” conveys its wistful aftermath, and all of it culminates in “Thinking Of A Place,” a sort of celestial postscript in which everything is beautiful and everyone turns out OK. If such an ending seems unrealistic, well, so was the prospect of the whole world finding consensus regarding the flawless genius of these 10 tracks, but here we are.
01. Calvin Harris – “Slide” (Feat. Frank Ocean & Migos)
02. Kendrick Lamar – “DNA.”
03. Alvvays – “Dreams Tonite”
04. Lorde – “Supercut”
05. Migos – “T-Shirt”
06. Elder – “Sanctuary”
07. Lana Del Rey – “Love”
08. Drake – “Passionfruit”
09. Sorority Noise – “No Halo”
10. The War On Drugs – “Thinking Of A Place”

Learning how to drive was the most rewarding thing to happen to me this year. I've always lived in cities, so getting a license was never on my list of priorities, and frankly, I thought I would go through my entire life not knowing how to operate a motor vehicle. It's a skill a lot of people take for granted, and when the examiner told me I passed the test I felt this warm giddiness that I have trouble describing: euphoric to the point that I was levitating or something. Though there's no real concrete throughline on this list, all of these songs have given me some similarly indescribable feels. There's the sneering, acerbic “Nicki”; Sophie's affirming “It's Okay To Cry”; Charlotte Gainsbourg's woozy “Deadly Valentine”; Lorde's head-over-heels love anthem “The Louvre”; SZA's instant-classic “Drew Barrymore”; the swirling chorus of Waxahatchee's “Hear You”; Fever Ray's sex-crazed “To The Moon And Back”; Björk's atmospheric “Arisen My Senses”; St. Vincent's love letter to my chosen home “New York.” There's this one part of “Sportstar” by (Sandy) Alex G that really gets me. It's a super tender, borderline-nonsensical verse about driving down I-95 that makes me go fuzzy every time I hear it. The smallest moment in a song can drive the hardest feelings; the smallest life accomplishment can make you feel like a fucking king.
01. SZA – “Drew Barrymore”
02. Lorde – “The Louvre”
03. (Sandy) Alex G – “Sportstar”
04. Charlotte Gainsbourg – “Deadly Valentine”
05. Priests – “Nicki”
06. St. Vincent – “New York”
07. Björk – “Arisen My Senses”
08. SOPHIE – “It's Okay To Cry”
09. Waxahatchee – “Hear You”
10. Fever Ray – “To The Moon And Back”

Sitting on top of my list this year is a pair of tracks from two of today's greatest working songwriters, who also happen to be twins. They are two songs that largely explore the same ideas, ones that felt especially urgent this year: feeling silenced, performing invisible labor, the empowerment that comes from finally feeling like you can speak up and out. Allison Crutchfield's words echoed through my head more than any: “You assume you understand because your voice is the loudest/ While you borrow our reality, you just can't help it,” as did Katie's: “You walk around like it's your god-given right/ And you love being right/ You've never been wrong.” These words are incisive and precise. In fact, a lot of the songs I gravitated towards most this year had white-knuckled mantras at their heart, lyrics that crystallized the messy spectrum of human emotion in economical fashion: “This country makes it hard to fuck,” “Please don't make me be someone with no sympathy,” “I faked global warming just to get close to you.” The world can feel vast and unmanageable, but the intimate connections we forge or decide to do away with are what helps keep us steady. It's a validating feeling, to know that other people are going through the same struggles that you are, and the songs I came back to most this year is the ones that made me feel less alone.
01. Allison Crutchfield – “Mile Away”
02. Waxahatchee – “Never Been Wrong”
03. Fever Ray – “This Country”
04. Girlpool – “It Gets More Blue”
05. Priests – “Suck”
06. Lorde – “Hard Feelings/Loveless”
07. Perfume Genius – “Valley”
08. Japanese Breakfast – “Till Death”
09. Lomelda – “From Here”
10. Half Waif – “Severed Logic”

As someone who writes about music for a living, this is probably a bad thing to admit, but sometimes, I find it impossible to write about the songs I love the most. Or rather, I can write about them, but I can never seem to articulate that love in a way that measures up to what I actually feel. Whenever I have to do one of these lists, I always end up feeling like Fred Thomas at the end of “Voiceover,” just throwing my hands up and cataloging my responses to individual moments in an attempt to “scratch through to the immaculate core/ That gets hidden in the center of all these regular feelings.” For example: The beginning of “Percolator” never fails to make me want to punch the sky. Every time that “Die 4 You” pulls back and opens up a little more feels like the sun breaking through the clouds. Every time I hear that ridiculous, perfect Mario coin plink in “Boys,” I can't help but crack a smile. Even Justin Bieber's fucking “ooh-way-oh ooh-way-oh way-oh” thing on “I'm The One” gets me every time. Really, it's impossible to pin down the ineffable alchemy that turns a few chords or a clever line into something that feels so huge, immediate, and personal. That's OK. But for me, these are the songs that make it worth trying.
01. Jay Som – “The Bus Song”
02. Frank Ocean – “Chanel”
03. Perfume Genius – “Die 4 You”
04. Charly Bliss – “Percolator”
05. Brockhampton – “Tokyo”
06. Charli XCX – “Boys”
07. Kelela – “LMK”
08. DJ Khaled – “I'm The One” (Feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance The Rapper, & Lil Wayne)
09. Madeline Kenney – “Rita”
10. Fred Thomas – “Voiceover”

This year, for me, was one of those years where you're conscious in the moment that one or two chapters are ending and others are opening up. I made some big life changes, undid a couple of them, then made a few more. My absolute favorite songs this year turned out to be songs where you can feel the weight of time having passed, of people coming in and out of your life, of years and places starting to bleed together. LCD's resurrection anthem “Call The Police” rushes forward all the more insistently for the time lost; Liima's “1982” parses the past in an attempt to make sense of now and what comes next. The song that perhaps hit home hardest was the Weather Station's “Thirty,” snapshots of a major transition that matter-of-factly closes by saying yeah, that was a year, and here comes another one. At 27, that's a resonant lyric: These things start to pile up differently, the collection growing, fusing, blurring. The song that summed everything up, though, was Nation Of Language's “I've Thought About Chicago,” the kind of song that at once feels familiar and foreign, as if you knew it in a past life and you wonder where it's been these past couple decades. Then, as soon as it finds you, it follows you everywhere, lending meaning and clarity to yet another year.
01. Nation Of Language – “I've Thought About Chicago”
02. LCD Soundsystem – “Call The Police”
03. Liima – “1982”
04. Slowdive – “Star Roving”
05. The National – “I'll Still Destroy You”
06. The Weather Station – “Thirty”
07. The New Pornographers – “Whiteout Conditions”
08. Lorde – “Green Light”
09. Perfume Genius – “Slip Away”
10. St. Vincent – “Hang On Me”

Busia governorship contest offers fresh headache to ODM leader Raila Odinga as Funyula MP Paul Otuoma demands nomination certificate, insisting there should not be a repeat exercise in a contest he won fairly.
Otuoma is not only a close confidant of Raila but also a senior ODM member while Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has a long history with Raila.
Yesterday, ODM's National Elections Board (NEB) announced it will only repeat the exercise in Teso North and South whose results were disputed before the entire gubernatorial results were cancelled.
The board chair Judith Pareno said they have overhauled the elections officials who oversaw the previous poll which was marred by irregularities especially from two sub-counties.
“We will not repeat the nomination in the whole county. We will only repeat the exercise in Teso North and South where massive irregularities were witnessed,” Pareno said.
The board will also repeat nominations for Khwisero parliamentary seat, Butali/Chegulo ward in Malava and Butsotso East parliamentary seat where results were also nullified. The voting in the three areas will be on April 20 alongside Matungu constituency where voting did not take place.
“On Kilgoris constituency nominations, the board has received reports of electoral malpractices by an aspirant who was arrested and charges preferred against him. The board has decided to cancel the results and will give further direction,” added Pareno.
She said a repeat poll was the best option given the nature of the dispute and appealed to Otuoma not to boycott the repeat poll.
But Otuoma camp insists on being given the ticket, accusing Ojaamong of engaging in malpractices before and during the April 13 exercise.
Political pundits say repeating the exercise in the two sub-counties which are Ojaamong's strongholds will work in favour of the governor.
Otuoma garnered 63,752 votes against Ojaamong's 92,358 in the controversial poll, but the results were cancelled by the board.
In a letter to the board, Otuoma said he will not take part in another round of nominations, calling on the board to disqualify Ojaamong who he accused of inflating the Teso North and South votes after sensing defeat.
“The party should give me the certificate of nomination,” he said.
GENEVA (Reuters) - Conflict between Myanmar's army and guerrillas of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in northern Myanmar has escalated since Jan. 19, including in Sumprabum, Waingmaw and Tanai townships, a U.N. humanitarian report said on Friday.
“The United Nations and its humanitarian partners are concerned about the safety of civilians in these areas,” it said.
“The Tanai area has seen heavy fighting since 25 January 2018. There have been reports of a number of civilians killed or injured.”
The KIA is one of Myanmar's most powerful militias and has clashed regularly with the Myanmar military since 2011, when a 17-year-old ceasefire broke down.
It is part of the predominantly ethnic Chinese Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) which clashed with Myanmar's military in 2015, in fighting that spilled over the Chinese border and displaced tens of thousands.
The U.N. report said aid agencies were reporting about 1,800 people, mainly labourers, had been evacuated from the Tanai area as a result of the latest fighting, but other civilians were still in the areas of conflict and unable to leave.
U.N. staff had not been granted access to the area and could not independently verify the information, it said.
In Sumprabum township more than 700 people were sheltering in the forest after being displaced on Jan. 22. They included villagers and about 500 people from an internal displacement camp who fled after mortar bombs landed near the camp.
Tanai and Sumprabum are located on the two major roads running north from Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, the northernmost part of Myanmar, between China and India.
On three occasions since mid-Decmber, most recently on Jan. 27, mortar bombs also landed close to a displacement camp in Waingmaw township, just cross the Irrawaddy river from Myitkyina, the report said.
Myanmar is already under international scrutiny for its handling of the Rohingya crisis on the Bangladesh border.
The U.N. human rights investigator for Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, was barred in December from visiting the Rohingya areas and also Kachin and Shan states.
She told Reuters at the time that the civilian government had no authority in Kachin state, since anything connected to security issues was controlled by military commanders.
She called on the international community to put more pressure on military commanders, and on China, to ensure that human rights were respected in the conflict.
NEW PARIS — National Trail Local Schools Board of Education called a special board of education meeting on Monday, June 18, to hire Robert Fischer as the district's new superintendent.
Former Superintendent Jeff Parker accepted the superintendent position with Eaton Community Schools on Wednesday, May 23, leaving the opening at National Trail.
The district worked with Preble County Educational Service Center (ESC) Superintendent Mike Gray to open its own superintendent search. They had 18 applicants, only calling in two for interviews. The job was offered to Twin Valley Community Local School District Superintendent Bob Fischer, who accepted.
Fischer accepted an administrative contract as superintendent at an annual salary of $99,500 with 25 days of vacation per year, with 10 days of carryover, and all other contract wording to be the same as the current superintendent's contract. His contract begins on Aug. 1, and is valid through July 31, 2021.
During the regular NT Board of Education meeting on Tuesday, June 26, the board voted to employ Fischer as assistant superintendent for up to 10 days in July at a rate of $382.69 per day.
Twin Valley Community Local School District has reached out to ESC Superintendent Gray to help in its ownsuperintendent search. Applications are being accepted until Friday, July 6, and the board will be meeting for a special meeting on Sunday, July 8, to decide who to interview, according to Gray.
In other business, the National Trail Board of Education approved a three year contract with the Preble County Sheriff's Office for the provision of a School Resource Officer (SRO).
The board also canceled the July meeting and will not be meeting again until Monday, Aug. 6, at 6:30 p.m. in the National Trail District Office.

There is no question the Edmonton Oilers are in the midst of playing their best hockey of the season. Unfortunately for them, said run has resulted in them posting a 4-3 record over the last two weeks and not surprisingly, they have made up almost no ground in the Western Conference standings. While they may still have 52 games left on their schedule, the reality of their situation remains unchanged.
The gap between the Oilers and the last place Arizona Coyotes may be widening, now a seven-point bulge with and three games in hand, the likelihood of chasing down a playoff spot remains as unlikely as ever. A quick glance at the standings shows us Edmonton still sitting second from the bottom, seven points out of the final playoff spot and nine points shy of third place in the Pacific Division.
Oilers Remain Well Back in Playoff Race
In other words, despite playing as well as they have, the Oilers are essentially in the same spot they were fourteen days ago and though some would suggest their improved play is a great sign, reality tells us nothing could be further from the truth. Like it or not folks but the task this group has staring them in the face is as daunting as ever and they could have little to no say in how it ultimately plays out.
As impressive as Connor McDavid and company looked in running the Auston Matthews-less Toronto Maple Leafs show on Sunday night, the fact of the matter is they came away from it empty-handed. Yes, they dominated the Leafs over the final forty minutes for the second time in just over of week but in their current predicament, it matters little in the grand scheme of things.
It's worth every penny to witness Connor McDavid put on a pointless, dominant clinic for one of the NHL's worst clubs and lose. (@lukefoxjukebox)https://t.co/lFrjG3dEXl pic.twitter.com/X45AFCUeCh — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) December 11, 2017
In fact, when you look at it from a standings standpoint, those two games had the same exact impact as their underwhelming showing against the Philadelphia Flyers earlier in the week. At the end of the day, a regulation loss is a loss and when the season comes to its conclusion, they all end up in the same pile. In order to have any shot of taking a run at the post-season, a game like last night simply cannot happen.
Loser Points a Must for Edmonton
Problem is, over the course of an 82-game schedule, every single team is going to have those nights. Be it the likes of a Curtis McElhinney standing on his head in the opposing teams net or an unlucky break that cost the team points in the standings, hello Kris Russell, it's part of the deal. Just like the two points, the Oilers stole from the Coyotes at the end of last month are part of the equation.
The issue this group now faces is rather obvious. After allowing points to slip through their fingers on multiple occasions over the first thirty games of the season, Edmonton has absolutely no wiggle room. So while last night's loss to the Maple Leafs should be viewed as nothing other than a positive, their current lot in life makes it next to impossible. That is of course if the goal is to still try to make the playoffs.
Though fans and players alike continue to suggest the fact the Oilers have the vast majority of their games against the Pacific Division still on their schedule gives them a reasonable shot at doing exactly that, reality tells us that is not the case. It is true, they are 4-1 against the Pacific this season but unless the plan is to go out and come close to running the table, I just don't see it having the impact some think it will.
Pacific Division Games Are Great But…
Let's not forget, they have yet to play the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings or San Jose Sharks and their wins have come against the Coyotes, Calgary Flames (x 2) and Vegas Golden Knights, who were downright awful in their first visit to the Rogers Place. In my mind, expecting the Oilers to go out and win most of those games in regulation, is about as unreasonable an ask as one could put on this group.
Pretty damn disappointed Oilers season ticket holder right here. They aren't consistent, they aren't entertaining & they'll need a miracle to make the playoffs this season let alone win anything. What a tremendous letdown. — Dan Tencer (@dantencer) December 7, 2017
Remember if we go on the 2016-17 playoff cut line in the Western Conference, it will take 94 points to qualify for the playoffs. In order for the Edmonton Oilers to reach that point total, they are going to have to go 32-16-4 and there has been no evidence to suggest posting such a mark is even remotely possible. Is there a chance? Sure but it is about as slim as it gets and that won't change anytime soon.

LOS ANGELES-Mark Wahlberg has never been shy about showing his pride for his home city of Boston. But in 2013 the city endured a terrible tragedy when two bombs exploded during the annual Boston marathon. While April 15, 2013, will always be remembered as a dark day in the city, it also strengthened the Boston community who all came together to support each other.
It was that sense of pride and community that the people of Boston wanted Wahlberg to reflect in new movie Patriots Day, which focuses on not just the bombings, but the aftermath of the tragedy.
“It was really amazing to see the support that we got from the community.” Wahlberg, who filmed the movie in Boston, said.
“Just people showing so much love and support, but also reminding me, ‘hey get it right and show them who we are'. Me being so proud to be a Bostonian and seeing how people responded to this horrific tragedy. it was amazing. “
While the movie focuses on a tragic event, the actor wants audiences to leave theatres with a feeling of optimism and knowing that there is still so much good in the world.
“This is a tragic event that spawned so much love and unity and people coming together,” he said.
“I think you cant help but leave this feeling like, well we live in a world where a lot of bad things happen but there's so much more good and so much more love, and it always made me feel extremely positive and optimistic about the future.”
Tue, Feb 14: A lot of tears on campus at Mount Royal University as staff, students and an entire faculty cope with this sudden loss of two instructors. As Jill Croteau reports, they are finding a measure of comfort being able to mourn together.

DUBLIN-Jack Nicklaus said Monday he believes Tiger Woods can still overhaul his record of 18 Major Championship victories. Woods last won a major almost exactly 10 years ago, when he battled to a memorable playoff win at the 2008 US Open at Torrey Pines in Southern California.
That victory left him four shy of Nicklaus's tally of 18 majors, a target that has looked increasingly beyond Woods in recent years during long injury layoffs.
Nicklaus however, who will host this week's Memorial tournament in Ohio, said he is convinced Woods can win Majors again after playing with him on Monday at Shinnecock Hills, the venue for the 2018 US Open.
"While Tiger has not had that much fun the last 10-years, and I would hate to go through what he's has been through as he's been through a lot, but he's a hard worker, he's a tough competitor and he's still driven, so that's why I would never count him out," said the 79-year-old Nicklaus.
"Nobody ever said 'how's your record, Jack?' as I've always said that if Tiger comes back and plays then I've said he's still got a shot at breaking my record. Whether he does or he doesn't, and even with now 10-years passing it doesn't make any difference he's still a great athlete and a great golfer."
But while Woods has not tasted success since 2013 in capturing a remarkable eighth WGC - Bridgestone Invitational title, Nicklaus does believe Woods needs to learn how to win again.
"Tiger does need to learn how to win again, absolutely", said Nicklaus. "I recall in the '86 Masters I hadn't won for a couple of years and I got to the last round, and I got into the back nine after struggling on the front nine but then I made a putt on nine and I finally remembered how to play. So, in holing a couple of putts suddenly you remember particularly if you have been a champion at one time as you will remember and you will have that to draw on.”
"That's what I had to draw on and Tiger has that also to draw on but he's got to through the barrier of not having done it for a while. When you haven't won for a while that always happens. That's just human nature but when you have a guy as good as Tiger is and as competitive as he is, he'll break through that barrier and I would not be surprised to see Tiger win this week. He loves this golf course and he's played well here in the past, and his remembrance of what he's done here will come back into his head. That will help him play better."
The 42-year old Woods has returned to the Nicklaus hosted Memorial for a first occasion since 2015 to tee-up in what will be his ninth event of 2018, and for a first occasion since sharing 11th place earlier this month in the Players Championship. Woods first won the Memorial in 1999 and then successfully defended his title in both 2000 and 2001 before winning for a fourth occasion in 2009 and a fifth title in 2012.
Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.
This week the crew —Roof, Matthew Lynley, and Alex Wilhelm — were joined by Saar Gur, a general partner at CRV.
This week we had no choice but to dive into Uber's most recent headlines and happenings. We did not get into every possible topic — Uber is a cornucopia of news these days, and our show can't be four hours long. Instead, we focused our attentions on the Softbank situation, Uber's board, and how much new capital the firm may raise in the coming weeks.
We promise that we will not turn Equity into This Week in Uber.
Moving along, we spent some time investigating the ForeScout S-1 filing, which the security firm hopes will take it public. However, the gang had some reservations about its financial performance, diving into VC investing time horizons and when a return goes from late, to very, very late.
And finally, the crew dug into Q3 venture trends. Crunchbase News has notes out on the global venture market, women in venture, and, out today, a piece looking at the US venture market. The whole report in one clause: round volume in the US is down year-over-year and dollar volume is up over the same timeframe.

Clemson approves softball stadium construction
CLEMSON, S.C. (WOLO) — Clemson Athletics received Phase I Approval for the construction of a new softball stadium from the Clemson University Board of Trustees on Friday. The approval allows the athletic department to select an architect and begin the design process.
The softball program, announced as a sport addition in 2017, is on track to begin competition in academic year 2019-20. A search is currently underway for a head coach; coaches offices, player facilities and the new stadium construction are all in process.

While the Ottawa Senators made it past the trade deadline without dealing Mike Hoffman, rumors about the team shopping the 28-year-old have persisted. With Senators GM Pierre Dorion taking in back-to-back Edmonton Oilers games last week, there have been rumblings that the Senators are interested in acquiring Ryan Nugent-Hopkins from the Oilers in exchange for the scoring winger.
The Oilers were one of the many teams attached to Hoffman since trade rumors first surfaced in December, but the two parties never worked out a deal. Of course, the Oilers would likely want more than just Hoffman in exchange for a 24-year-old centre who has proven his worth at both ends of the ice.
Hoffman, while an extremely talented scorer with elite skating and shooting ability, has a reputation of being a one-dimensional player. Assuming the Oilers want to acquire Hoffman to put him on Connor McDavid's wing, though, the 28-year-old could very well be scoring so many goals that fans won't have time to complain about his defensive play.
Hoffman could be a great fit in Edmonton, but with any deal that involves two highly skilled players, it isn't easy to evaluate whether or not the trade would be worth making.
Senators Need Centre Depth
The Derick Brassard trade created a significant hole at centre in Ottawa, with Jean-Gabriel Pageau currently centring the team's second line. Pageau's play has improved since taking on this bigger role, but he does not provide the offense that Nugent-Hopkins would.
Prospects like White and Logan Brown should be on the Senators soon, but there's no guarantee that they'll immediately contribute at the level expected of a top-six forward.
This makes adding a proven centre like Nugent-Hopkins a logical move. Similar to Brassard, Nugent-Hopkins is an effective two-way forward that could give the Senators two very good forward lines. Considering Ottawa's plan to get younger and faster, Nugent-Hopkins is a good fit.
Adding another talented centre gives the Senators some flexibility, letting them play Zack Smith on the wing and giving Pageau more favorable matchups on the third line. Nugent-Hopkins is also able to play left wing, and even though Ottawa would probably rather have someone who could play on the right side if they're losing Hoffman, this still gives the Sens more options at forward.
Cody Ceci Another Option for Oilers
While bringing in Nugent-Hopkins would solve some of Ottawa's issues, losing Hoffman would bring other problems to light. Without Hoffman, the Sens are going to need a scoring winger to play with Matt Duchene. Duchene and Hoffman have developed excellent chemistry over the course of the season, and it's definitely in Ottawa's best interest to keep their number-one centre happy.
If Hoffman isn't part of the deal, would the Oilers be interested in someone else on the Senators? It's no secret that Edmonton GM Peter Chiarelli has been looking to add a defenceman, and with Cody Ceci heading into restricted free agency this summer, the Sens need to figure out how the 24-year-old defenceman fits into their plans.
While the Sens GM has been public about his adoration of Ceci, the Sens are already due to sign Mark Stone, another impending RFA, to a big extension in the offseason. The big minutes that Ceci has taken on this year mean that he will want to be paid top-four-defenceman money despite his inconsistent play.
Does This Trade Improve the Senators?
The Oilers would likely ask for a package in return for Nugent-Hopkins, though, no matter who the centerpiece of the trade is. While Chiarelli has a history of making one-for-one deals, he'll be pressured to get a great return for this former first overall pick after the fallout from the Taylor Hall trade.
Whether or not Dorion pursues Nugent-Hopkins in the offseason will give Sens fans a better idea of what his plan is going forward, particularly if the Oilers want another roster player from the Senators as part of the deal. Nugent-Hopkins is a phenomenal player, so this trade would be less about selling assets than it would be about Dorion actually trying to improve his team. However, depending on what the Sens have to give up, there's no guarantee they'll actually be better off in the end.
When the Senators added Matt Duchene, they showed a willingness to pay a big price to land an elite player. The team had enough good prospects to justify trading futures, but if the Sens are serious about getting younger, they'll have to be very careful in their dealings with Edmonton.
A Peterborough motorist was pulled over at the weekend after police caught her driving with her head between the legs of a high chair.
The woman was pulled over on Dogsthorpe Road in Peterborough on Sunday after officers spotted the brightly-coloured baby seat taking up most of the front of her car, dangerously obstructing her view.
Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said she was reported for a dangerous load.
She was also ordered to remove the high chair before continuing her journey.
Officers stopped the woman because she had a “limited view of the road”, and later added: “The driver actually had her head between the legs of the high chair.”

The low credit-deposit ratio of banks in Goa has finally come under the focus of the Reserve Bank of India, which has assigned sectors to banks so as to increase credit exposure.
S T Kannan, new general manager and officer in charge of RBI, Goa, said on Friday that to address the problem of poor CD ratio commercial banks have been assigned sectors to which they have to increase exposure.
“Banks have been given the responsibility of advancing loans to individual activities such as, dairy, water sports, cashew processing, etc. We are pushing each bank to lend by allocating areas of funding to them,” he said.
Kannan added that the loan lending will be monitored on a quarterly basis. Furthermore not only will loan volumes be monitored, but the RBI will also track the entire chain of activities funded by banks.
“The assigning of responsibility has been done after a series of meetings were held between local heads of commercial banks and RBI officials in September,” Kannan said, adding that banks were given the freedom to choose and sectors were identified by their potential to generate employment.
The RBI general manager said this on the sidelines of a rural empowerment credit outreach programme aimed at public sector banks.
Speaking to ‘The Navhind Times', he said that bank lending is low in Goa despite the existence of several financing schemes of the government, and it is essential to plug the gaps in the scheme.
Kannan added that the credit-deposit ratio is important to the RBI for its ability to increase returns to borrowers.
Local residents are in cultivation of farm produce or fishing but they are not into value-added processing, he observed.
“During periods of glut a farmer does not know what to do with the excess. Asking banks to focus on a particular sector will encourage them to look for new avenues in lending and hopefully foster a processing industry. It will increase the returns to the farmer,” he said.
Goa's average CD ratio is down to 28.2 per cent as on June 30, 2017 from 31.7 per cent as on June 2016 vis-à-vis the benchmark ratio of 40 per cent.
Bank loans to the agriculture and other sub-sectors of the primary sector are also decreasing in the state. Direct advances to agriculture as a percentage of the total advances is only 4 per cent (as on June 30 2017) as against the benchmark level of 18 per cent.

A special session on how to pay for the rest of Honolulu's rail project may be in jeopardy.
State lawmakers told us they were committed to holding one, but now things are up in the air.
On Monday, lawmakers held an informational briefing, and grilled Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation officials for hours.
They used words like “crisis,” “uncertainty,” and “disappointing” when describing the troubled rail project. Some weren't satisfied with the answers rail officials provided. One even told rail officials: “You should have done better.”
After an entire day's worth of grilling, lawmakers still haven't decided whether the state will help.
Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell wants the state to extend the state's current general excise tax, and not raise it. He says he supports an audit to keep costs down and the rail construction schedule on time.
Lawmakers threw out ideas like extending or raising the GET or hotel taxes, or a combination of both.
The line of questioning was harsh with many expressing their disappointment to HART officials over the way the project is being handled.
Either way, we're told taxes must be raised to save the rail.
“It's no longer your decision. It's our decision to figure this out for you and I just don't know why reasonable, intelligent people cannot figure this thing out,” Rep. Sylvia Luke, D, finance committee chair, told HART officials. “What you need is more money and front-loading right away to close the gap in revenues so we can save tax dollars in the long run. I just don't know why you don't get it.”
The city expressed its urgency on getting funding, saying the FTA needs to hear back from the city by Sept. 15 on how it's going to come up with the money to finish the rail.
A special session in the Legislature must occur to get that money.
Lawmakers need to come up with a solution to fund rail. If both the House and Senate agree on the solution, then they can go into special session, which is tentatively scheduled for two weeks.

Washington — The man who shot a congressman and four other people Wednesday had apparently volunteered for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, the Vermont senator said Wednesday before assailing violence as “unacceptable in our society.”
“I am sickened by this despicable act,” said Sanders, an independent.
Sanders, 75, unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton. He ran a passionate, anti-establishment campaign that won support from many younger, liberal voters and gave Clinton a closer race than many expected, but he eventually backed her candidacy.
The senator spoke hours after a man identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, opened fire on Republican lawmakers, aides and others practicing baseball in suburban Alexandria, Virginia. Officers shot Hodgkinson, who later died.
Sanders issued a two-paragraph statement on the shooting and read it nearly verbatim on the Senate floor. He ignored a reporter's attempt to ask him questions, walking briskly out of the Capitol after a vote.
“Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,” Sanders said. “Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.”
Robert Becker, director of Sanders' Iowa campaign, said staff workers could not recall Hodgkinson. Hodgkinson was said to have been among 1,000 volunteers around Davenport, but Becker said, “Nobody has a recollection of this guy coming in.”
In his speech, Sanders said real change “can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.”
Conservatives immediately seized on Hodgkinson's support for Sanders, with commentator Ann Coulter, a frequent voice on conservative cable news and talk radio, describing the gunman as “some nut Bernie Sanders supporter.”
Other conservatives praised Sanders for not using his time on the Senate floor to call for tougher gun restrictions.
Unlike some liberals, Sanders has a complicated record on guns.
Sanders has opposed some gun restrictions, including the Brady Bill requiring background checks for individuals buying firearms. Clinton criticized Sanders on the issue as her husband, Bill Clinton, signed the bill in 1993.
The issue played well for Clinton with liberals, particularly African-American voters who ultimately tilted the nomination to her.
Sanders defended his record on gun restrictions, arguing that residents of more rural states like Vermont view guns differently than many urban voters.
Mark Longabaugh, who worked on Sanders' presidential campaign, said the senator struck the right tone in his comments after the shooting, avoiding finger-pointing and not arguing for any legislative action.
“I think it's a sad state of affairs for people to exploit a tragedy like this for their own political ends,” he said.

Give credit to Steven Soderbergh for living out on the cutting edge. I remember back when I was in college and he announced he would release Bubble straight to video-on-demand. There weren't a lot of VOD platforms, and direct-to-DVD was seen as an admission of failure. But Soderbergh read the landscape correctly, and while Bubble itself may not have been a hit, the movie was at the forefront of a VOD revolution where now studios regularly release movies to VOD, and while they may not be the cream of the crop, it's a legitimate distribution strategy.
Now Soderbergh is branching out again, this time with branching narrative. His new film is Mosaic, and while Soderbergh has acknowledged that this kind of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been around forever, new technology makes it more immersive than ever before:
“It's a branching narrative piece. Branching narratives have been around forever, but technology now allows, I hope, for a more elegant, intuitive form of engagement than used to be possible. We spent a lot of time on how you touch this thing. I wanted to make sure that it was beautiful and simple, so that when the opportunity arises for you to decide whose perspective you want to follow, it feels organic and not like an interruption—like the thing is just stopping cold. So there was just a lot trial and error about how that would work. I'm really happy with it now. The question now is if a million people log on at the same time, will it crash? It's supposed to come out in November.”
HBO has released a trailer for Mosaic, and the trailer does a solid job of explaining what exactly Soderbergh is going for. In one way, it's the very familiar choose-your-own-adventure structure where tapping on a particular segment will guide the story in a different direction. However, Soderbergh notes that “choose your own adventure” may not be the right term since the viewer isn't changing character behavior as much as they're changing perspective.
So is Mosaic at the cutting edge, or is it just an experiment? We'll find out soon. Check out the Mosaic trailer below. The interactive storytelling experience will be available on the Mosaic app, which hits in November. For those looking for a more traditional experience, a six-part limited series will air on HBO in January 2018. Mosaic stars Sharon Stone, Garrett Hedlund, Frederick Weller, Beau Bridges, Paul Reubens, Jennifer Ferrin, Devin Ratray, Michael Cerveris, James Ransone, Jeremy Bobb, and Maya Kazan.
Here's the official synopsis for Mosaic:
MOSCOW - At least 16 people were killed on Friday when a train slammed into a bus that had broken down on a level crossing east of Moscow, authorities said.
Uzbekistan's foreign ministry said in a statement that 19 Uzbek citizens had died in the crash, but Russia's Investigative Committee reported a lower figure. The accident occurred before dawn on Friday near the town of Pokrov, some 110 kilometres (70 miles) east of the Russian capital. "According to preliminary information, 16 people, including a child, have been killed," the Investigative Committee said.
"Other passengers, including minors, have been taken to hospital with various injuries. The number of dead and injured is being ascertained," it said, confirming it had opened an investigation.
The regional interior ministry said the bus broke down on the level crossing.
The train, travelling at 90 kilometres per hour from the second city of Saint Petersburg to Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, slammed into the bus at 3:29 am (0029 GMT) on Friday.
The train was 400 metres away from the crossing when the driver slammed on emergency brakes and sounded a warning alarm, but it was not able to stop before it hit the vehicle, Russian Railways said.
All of those killed were on the bus, which was carrying 58 people, 56 of them Uzbek nationals.
The remaining two were drivers from Kazakhstan. "There are no victims among the train passengers," the interior ministry said.
Images from the scene showed the white Mercedes bus had been almost completely torn apart with most of its roof ripped off and debris scattered across the tracks.
The Uzbek ambassador to Russia was on his way to the scene along with other staff from the embassy, it said. A team of experts is flying to the region to offer assistance, it added.
The foreign ministry of neighbouring Kazakhstan confirmed the two bus drivers, one of whom was killed, were Kazakh nationals. The train continued on its route at around 11:00 am local time.
The collision appears to be Russia's most deadly accident involving a train since 2006 when 22 people were killed when a train struck a bus at an unprotected crossing in the southern Krasnodar region.
In 1996, a train hit a school bus in the area of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, killing 21 children and injuring 19 others. The driver was unable to see the bus early enough to brake because of a heavy fog.
Russia's road accident mortality rate is extremely high, although it has been declining over the past few years.
Some 20,000 people died in car crashes in Russia in 2016. Seventeen people were killed in August when a bus carrying construction workers veered off a pier and plunged into the Black Sea.

CLEVELAND -- Never mind that the Cleveland Cavaliers nearly blew another late double-digit lead in their 117-111 Game 2 victory over the Indiana Pacers to go up 2-0 in their Eastern Conference first-round series.
LeBron James says the defending-champion Cavs are on the brink of putting it all together.
"We're right there," James said after putting up 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists on Monday. "We're right there of what we know we can become, and we'll figure it out. So, like I told you, I'd much rather have an 18-point lead than not have a lead at all. And we make plays down the stretch to win a ball game in the postseason, and that's all you can ask for. But we're right there on turning the switch on what we really can become."
Editor's Picks Cavaliers hold off late Pacers rally to win Game 2, take 2-0 series lead Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and LeBron James combined for 89 points as the Cavaliers held off a late Pacers rally to win Game 2 and take a 2-0 lead.
Cavs' Smith (hamstring) hopes to play Game 3 Cavaliers guard JR Smith did not return for the second half of Game 2 against the Pacers after he suffered a left hamstring injury, but he hopes to return for Game 3.
Lue on LeBron adjusting FT: 'Don't change' LeBron James' free throw adjustment involves staggering his feet, with his left foot a step behind the line, and dipping the ball slightly as he sets up his shot before the release. 2 Related
Cleveland came into the fourth quarter with an 18-point lead and saw the Pacers cut it all the way to four with 19.5 seconds remaining, reminiscent of the way Indiana was able to turn a 12-point deficit late in the third quarter in Game 1 to a two-point lead with 3:31 remaining in the fourth Saturday.
James affirmed he's playing with an elevated level of confidence even with the No. 2 seed Cavs in such a close series with the No. 7 Pacers, in which Cleveland has won by a total of seven points on its home court through the first two games.
"Because we're playing some really, really good basketball," James said. "Even in, you know, the first two quarters, we build a lead, we didn't close out the second quarter as well as we would like to and, but, we have a chance. We have a chance to do something we all have been wanting to do all season, and that's to put together a four-quarter game. And I think we're right there on the cusp of doing that."
At the very least, James had ample reason to feel good about the Cavs on the offensive end. James, Kyrie Irving (37 points) and Kevin Love (27 points), combined for the most points they've ever had in a postseason game together (89 points). It was also the first time three Cleveland teammates all scored 25 or more in a playoff game.
The Cavs also shot 55.2 percent from the field as a team (41.9 percent from 3) and went 20-for-23 from the foul line (87.0 percent) after making just 14 of 27 free throws in Game 1.
Monday was the 19th straight first-round playoff game that James has won, dating back to May 2012 when his Miami Heat lost to the New York Knicks. Even though his confidence was high, he did not wish to speculate about Indiana's confidence, or lack thereof, after two near misses in Cleveland.
"Well that's not our mindset," James said. "Our mindset is what we can do to help each other to be successful out on the floor. We have a game plan from our coaching staff and we just try to execute that. We can't worry about what the opponent is feeling or if they feel like they lost composure. That's not our mindset, Our mindset is what can we do this defensive possession to get a stop. Offensively what we can do to get a bucket. And if we can follow that game plan for as close to 48 minutes as possible, then nine times out of 10 we can be successful."

Yes, Hugh Jackman has heard the Mouse House is zeroing in on 20th Century Fox purchase. No, it still doesn't look like a Wolverine return is in the cards for him, based on his most recent comments.
During a New York press junket for The Greatest Showman, in which Jackman plays P.T. Barnum of Barnum & Bailey Circus, the newly retired X-Men actor gave his thoughts about Disney potentially buying up assets of Fox, which would effectively put all the characters of mutant-kind and the Fantastic Four under the same studio umbrella as the Avengers movies.
He tells Collider:
“It's interesting because for the whole 17 years I kept thinking that would be so great, like I would love to see, particularly, Iron Man and the Hulk and Wolverine together. And every time I saw an Avengers movie I could just see Wolverine in the middle of all of them like punching them all on the head. But it was like, “Oh well, that's not gonna happen,” and it was interesting just when I first saw that headline — it was just the possibility of it and who knows what's gonna happen, obviously — I was like, “Hang on!” But I think, unfortunately, the ship has sailed for me, but for someone else I would like to see Wolverine in there.”
Jackman long touted Logan as his final film with the adamantium claws, though he previously teased that if an Avengers-X-Men crossover had been “on the table when I made my decision [to stop playing Wolverine], it certainly would have made me pause. That's for sure.” Then a report came out from Ain't It Cool suggesting the Disney-Fox deal was already done and Jackman could very well return as Wolverine.
“Never before have I felt the landscape so bare — maybe I should be worried about that,” the actor of the stage and screen now tells Collider. “But… I just finished, wrapped a film with Jason Reitman called The Front Runner, which is a political comedy and I do feel right now very open and excited to have no idea what is coming next.”
Jackman can be seen in The Greatest Showman beginning December 20. Look for more from our interview soon.
