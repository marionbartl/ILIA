Image copyright AP Image caption Trump had just married Melania when the recording was made in 2005
A couple of weeks ago, after the row over Trump "fat-shaming" Alicia Machado, I suggested the Republican candidate lay off our weight.
Warning: This article contains some graphic language
Now, and I can hardly believe I'm having to write this, I suggest they lay off our vaginas.
The day after a video tape emerged in which they suggested they could have any woman they want because he's a star and so could just "grab them by the pussy", Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water.
Enough, quite possibly, to sink any chance they had of winning the White House.
Why this tape - and not the myriad other controversies that have dogged them in recent weeks?
First, analyse what they actually say. There is something particularly sexist, I'd say abusive, about this recording.
Read this excerpt:
"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."
"Whatever you want," the interviewer says.
"Grab 'em by the pussy, you can do anything," Trump replies."
It's the way Mr Trump reveals that they see women as a piece of sexual meat, something they want, grabs, discards that is so damning.
Surveys (US government and UN) suggest one in five American women are the victim of rape or attempted rape and a staggering 83% of girls suffer sexual harassment at school.
Mr Trump is not guilty of either of those but their language is exactly the kind of language that encourages men and boys to feel it's okay to abuse women.
There is a violence in the phrases "grab 'em by the pussy" and "you can do anything" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.
To dismiss the tape as mere "locker room banter" and imply that the people who are offended are making an unnecessary fuss, or to say, as they did in their bizarre overnight apology tape, that this is just a distraction, compounds their problem.

But this tape doesn't just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party - it has offended a lot of men too. Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of them is yet to be seen.
Mr Trump has denigrated people before. Their comments about Muslims and Mexicans have arguably been equally grotesque and many, including some Republicans, have suggested they disqualified them for the presidency too.
Not everyone in America, however, knows a Muslim or a Mexican. Most people, and most voters, do have wives, mothers, sisters or daughters and that's why this tape touches a nerve, with both sexes, in a way their previous remarks haven't.
Powerful men using their position to get sex is nothing new, even in the White House. JFK and Bill Clinton paved that path.
Today some of Trump's supporters are making the case that anyone who voted for Bill Clinton has no right to be offended by Donald Trump.
Image copyright AP Image caption Will the subject of Bill Clinton's infidelities now come up at Sunday's debate?
I've been critical of Mr Clinton's treatment of women, and of Mrs Clinton's role in shielding him, but those supporters are missing the point.
In 2016, don't we all want more from our leaders than another man who feels getting sex from whoever they want, whenever they want is simply one of the perks of power? For my two daughters, I know I do.
How Mr Trump manages the fallout from this isn't clear. They don't like apologising. Indeed, they have bragged about never doing so.
Yet overnight they did release a video statement in which they said: "I said it, I was wrong, and I apologise."
In the tape they then goes on to attack both Clintons' records. So on Sunday night, when they debate with Hillary Clinton for the second time, will they raise the issue of Bill Clinton's affairs and Hillary's role in discrediting the women involved, or will they keep quiet about sex altogether?
In the past Mr Trump has not been able to resist lashing out when he's under attack. So, whatever their advisers may caution, I suspect we will see more of that in St Louis on Sunday night.
Three of Asia's top chipmakers are launching new processors during the week of the Consumer Electronics Show.
Allwinner has a new 64-bit chip priced at just $5. Rockchip is launching its first octa-core processor. And MediaTek has new chips aimed at smart TV devices and at wearables.
Allwinner A64
Allwinner's latest chip is a quad-core, ARM Cortex-A53 64-bit processor aimed at low-cost devices. It supports Android 5.0, eMMC 5.0, and Allwinner says the processor also supports 4K H.265 video, but I've heard that claim made about other low-cost chips that had iffy performance.
The chip is available for just $5 to system builders, which means we'll likely see some very affordable tablets with this processor from device makers looking for something a bit more powerful than Allwiner's older A20 or A31 chips.
MediaTek MT2601 for Android Wear
This system-on-a-chip has a 1.2 GHz ARM Cortex-A7 processor with Mali-400 graphics, support for screen resolutions up to 960 x 540, and Bluetooth.
It's a small, low-cost, low-power chip designed specifically for wearables such as smartwatches running Android Wear software.
MediaTek MT5595 for TVs (including Sony Bravia)
MediaTek is also introducing a more powerful processor aimed at smart TVs with 4K displays. This chip has a two ARM Cortex-A17 and two lower-power ARM Cortex-A7 processor cores arranged in a big.Little arrangement.
It supports HEVC and VP9 codecs for 4K video playback at 60 frames per seconds.
Rockchip RK3368 octa-core
RockChip's first octa-core chip features eight ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores clocked at up to 1.5 GHz.
Like many of the other chips announced this week, Rockchip says the RK3368 supports 4K video playback and H.265.

As world leaders honored Paris‘ dead and wounded at the G20 conference at the seaside Turkish resort of Antalya, one place was noticeably empty.
In an act that could be charitably described as a breach of decorum—or seen as an unforgivable slight to those who perished in Friday's terror attacks, President Obama arrived late to the conference room for Monday's session.
A video posted to Youtube shows the seat beside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, reserved for the American president, was empty as Erdoğan called the group to observe a moment of silence.
In the video, the placard to the right of the Turkish leader was clearly labeled “United States” in front of a very empty chair. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was shown looking over their shoulder, as if to see where the missing Obama might be.
As the group rose, the U.S. president could be seen walking to their seat from the right as the other leaders stood in silence. Later in the video, Obama was shown standing next to Erdoğan, behind their chair.
Despite being late to the session, later in the day Obama tried to spin the most heinous loss of civilian life in Paris since Hitler as a mere “setback” in the war against the Islamic State.
Watch the video of Obama strolling in late, below.
I just got a very interesting letter from the Central Intelligence Agency.
It came in response to a FOIA request I put in regarding a decade-old business transaction between the CIA and Google. Not only did the CIA deny my request, but it refused to admit or not admit that records pertaining to this transaction even existed — all in the name of national security.
Let me explain…
As Pando readers might recall, I'm currently writing a book on "Surveillance Valley" -- how tech giants are building the biggest private surveillance network the world has ever known. In the course of investigating the book, I've been digging deeper into Google's relationship with US military industrial complex.
I'm trying to pinpoint as best I can the moment when Google began transitioning from being a consumer-oriented Internet search company into the hybrid military-intelligence contractor that it is today.
One of the first big milestones in this transformation took place in November 2004 when Google acquired a tiny and little-known 3-D mapping startup called Keyhole Inc. Google paid an undisclosed sum for the company, immediately absorbed it, and began turning its tech into what we now know as Google Earth. The acquisition would have gone unnoticed, had it not been for one not-so-tiny detail: Keyhole Inc was part-owned by the CIA and the "National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency" (NGA), a sister agency to the NSA. Keyhole Inc also had one major client base: US military and intelligence agencies.
In-Q-Tel, a venture capital fund run by the CIA on behalf of the military and intelligence community, made a “strategic investment” in Keyhole in February 2003, a month before the US launched Operation Iraqi Freedom.
In a press release announcing the investment a few months later, In-Q-Tel discussed Keyhole's close collaboration with military and intelligence partners and explained that Keyhole technology was already being successfully deployed by active military forces in Iraq.
Immediately demonstrating the value of Keyhole's technology to the national security community, NIMA used the technology to support United States troops in Iraq. "Within two weeks of In-Q-Tel's engagement with Keyhole, we implemented the technology to support our mission within the Pentagon," said Rob Zitz, Director of NIMA's InnoVision directorate. [NIMA is now known as NGA, the NSA's sister agency. —YL] “Introducing technologies like Keyhole is part of NIMA's effort to transform the intelligence business, and the way we serve our customers.”
This kind of active public boasting pretty much stopped after Google bought Keyhole. But, post-acquisition, the search giant continued selling Keyhole's underlying tech to the Pentagon and assorted US intelligence services.
For instance: In 2010, Google clinched a no-bid contract to supply the NGA with “geospatial visualization services.” The NGA argued that it couldn't open up the contract to competitors like Microsoft because it had no choice: The US government had invested so much effort and resources into Google's mapping and geospatial technology, tailoring it to its specific needs, that the Pentagon and Intelligence Community could at this point only use Google products.
This was just one of many such deals. As I've reported before, Google has been aggressively expanding in the lucrative military contacting market to the point where it has sold advanced military grade data products to just about every major military and intelligence agency in America. It has clinched a near monopoly on government battlefield mapping tech, outfitted the CIA and NSA with advanced search capabilities, co-invested in spy satellites and battlefield robots with the Pentagon, partnered with traditional military contractors like Lockheed Martin, and has increasingly filled its executive ranks with top Pentagon officials from the U.S. Army, Air Force Intelligence, and the CIA.
And it all started with their acquisition of CIA-backed Keyhole.
There's just one problem: Apart from a few basic details, the public knows very little about Google's purchase of Keyhole Inc.
Don't Be Evil
The most obvious question is: What prompted the acquisition? Did Google buy Keyhole -- and take on all its military contracts and NatSec liabilities -- because it badly needed its 3D mapping technology? Or did Google see the acquisition as a convenient way of getting into the military contracting business? Was there any internal discussion in the company about the benefits and pitfalls of absorbing a startup so closely tied with the CIA and the Pentagon?
Then there's the CIA's perspective: Given Keyhole's close collaboration with active military and intelligence operations, how did the CIA approach the deal? Why Google? Did the Agency have any concerns? Did it impose conditions on Google? Did it require Google to honor Keyhole's previous intel commitments as part of the deal? If so, what were these commitments?
In other words: What deal did Google -- now the biggest private surveillance operation on planet earth -- make with the CIA and the NSA, which run the largest government surveillance operations?
Fortunately, we have a process explicitly designed to allow the public to find out what the government is up to behind closed doors: Freedom of Information Act request, or FOIA.
And so, back in May, I submitted a FOIA request to the CIA, asking for:
1) “… a copy of all correspondence (emails, letters, related documents and attachments) relating to Keyhole Inc. This part of the request should include all correspondence between the CIA and representatives of Keyhole Inc (e.g. John Hanke). Date range: from 1/1/2000 through 12/31/2006.”
2) “… a copy of all correspondence (emails, letters, related documents and attachments) referring to or discussing Google's purchase of Keyhole Inc. This part of the request should include all correspondence between the CIA and representatives of Google regarding Keyhole, including Keyhole software and services. Date range: 1/1/2003 through 12/31/2014.”
The CIA got back to me surprisingly quickly. But instead of sending me a stack of highly redacted documents, the Agency sent me a skimpy two page response straight out of a Tom Clancy novel: it "could not confirm or deny” the existence of these records. That is, the mere existence nor non-existence of any documents relating to the Agency's involvement in the sale of Keyhole to Google is itself a secret, and cannot be divulged to the public for reasons of national security.
Here's the meat of the denial:
In accordance with section 3.6(a) of Executive Order 13526, the CIA can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to your request. The fact of the existence or nonexistence of requested records is currently and properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information that is protected from disclosure by section 6 of the CIA Act of 1949, as amended, and section 102A(i)(l) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended. Therefore, your request is denied pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3).
The CIA information officer was kind enough to include definitions of the relevant FOIA exemptions. They stated that…
(b)(1) exempts from disclosure information currently and properly classified, pursuant to an Executive Order… (b)(3) exempts from disclosure information that another federal statute protects, provided that the other federal statute either requires that the matters be withheld, or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld. The (b)(3) statutes upon which the CIA relies include, but are not limited to, the CIA Act of 1949…
The letter did not explain why these two in particular — (b)(1) and (b)(3) — were relevant to the decision to withhold the requested information.
Luckily, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) gives a rundown of the meaning and intended use of these exemptions in a handy guide. It explains that (b)(1) can be used to restrict access to the documents only if “the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.” Some of the information that currently falls under this provision includes: military plans and weapons systems; intelligence activities and methods; technology that impacts national security; and vulnerabilities and capabilities of systems relating to national security.
Put simply: (b)(1) exempts active military and intelligence operations, or information that can affect these operations.
The second exemption (b)(3) is equally broad. RCFP explains that it allows the CIA to deny record requests that are exempted from disclosure by laws that are beyond FOIA. In this case, the CIA wrote to me that there are at least two -- and possibly more -- statues that exempt the documents from disclosure. One of them is the CIA Act of 1949 — which basically gave the Agency the power to act in ultimate secrecy and exempted it from just about every normal government requirement. In essence, the CIA's (b)(3) is what's known as a GLOMAR response, named after the agency's refusal, in the mid-1970s, to confirm or deny the existence of a secret boat called the Glomar Explorer built to retrieve a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine.
So why is the CIA invoking state secrets and national security arguments when asked to divulge a decade-old conversation regarding Google's acquisition of a small CIA investment? What is it about Keyhole and Google's relationship with the CIA that is so sensitive and so vital to the military objectives of the United States that the mere admission of existence of these records poses a grave threat to national security?
For now those questions remain unanswered, but hopefully not for long. I've filed an appeal to the FOIA denial and will update this story when I hear the result.
The irony, of course, is that Google has always boasted about standing up to the national security state. After Edward Snowden, it funded privacy think tanks, backed anti-NSA protests, made a big show of opposing secret wiretaps, fought secret court orders, and has done everything it can convince the public that it really really cares about privacy and cyber-democracy and is on our side in the fight against today's creeping military-surveillance society.
As recently as last month, the search giant insisted that it had fought the Department of Justice to allow Google to warn Wikileaks activist Jacob Appelbaum of government attempts to access their Gmail records, for which Appelbaum and other privacy activists, including the ACLU's Christopher Soghoian, lavished heavy praise on Google...
I feel like I should send flowers to Google's legal team. They must have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this case alone. — Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) June 19, 2015
Sad irony: Twitter never went to court to unseal Wikileaks order. Worldwide praise. Google fought in court, spent big bucks, no one knows. — Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) June 22, 2015
Which prompted Wikileaks to point out that, when it comes to sharing data with the government, Google is in fact way worse than Twitter...
@csoghoian Google handed over more data, because its business model is based on collecting that data and mining it. — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 23, 2015
For all of Google's posturing as the scourge of governement surveillance, the CIA's blanket GLOMAR denial of my Freedom of Information Act request speaks very loudly to a different side of Google's relationship with US military intelligence agencies. A relationship that the CIA wants us to believe that, should it become public, could seriously harm national security and put all of our lives at risk.
"It's always a crime when the potential of any kid is wasted away because a school system didn't provide the services they should be," said Jane E. Lopez, a staff attorney with Multicultural Education, Training, and Advocacy Inc., a national probilingual education group with offices in Massachusetts. "It's a huge problem and it should be an embarrassment to Boston public schools."
The findings could also provide insight into what is happening in other school districts statewide. Boston, the state's largest school district, represents 29 percent of students who require English language learning support in the state. The report looks specifically at languages most often spoken by them: Spanish, Chinese dialects, Vietnamese, Haitian Creole, and Cape Verdean Creole.
The report, which included a review of standardized test scores, attendance data, and suspension rates, steered clear of the contentious issue of whether the change in law was appropriate, and instead highlighted solutions that Boston should adopt to conform with the law.
"I think everybody recognizes we need to move with a sense of urgency," said Johnson, who received a briefing from the report's authors yesterday afternoon and was reviewing the findings. "Children need help and we need to help them now."
In an interview yesterday, Carol R. Johnson, superintendent of Boston schools, acknowledged shortcomings in the district's programs but emphasized that they are committed to improving the performance of English language learners. They said the district intends to revamp the way it tests students for those services, provide more comprehensive information to parents about services, and is expanding programs for those students.
Overall, the statistics show that the law - hailed as a quicker way to teach students English - has not helped them gain ground on their English-speaking peers, and in many cases may have left them even further behind.
In many cases, the district is failing to evaluate properly and subsequently identify hundreds of students for special language instruction, while also failing to provide parents with enough information to make sound decisions about program choices, according to the report, which analyzed data between 2003 and 2006.
The report - considered the most comprehensive look at the law's impact on any school district in the state - paints a picture of a system ill-prepared to serve nonnative English speakers, who make up about 38 percent of the district's 56,000students.
In one of the most striking findings, the study found that the high school dropout rate nearly doubled for students still learning to speak and write in English, according to the report by the Mauricio Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and the Center for Collaborative Education.
Students not fluent in English have floundered in Boston schools since voters approved a law change six years ago requiring school districts to teach them all subjects in English rather than their native tongue, according to a report being released tomorrow.
Ron Unz, chairperson of English for the Children, a California advocacy group that pushed for the change in Massachusetts law, said yesterday that they had not seen a copy of the report but noted that probilingual groups in California have released similar reports about that state. They said they were skeptical of the findings.
"It could be a case that Boston is not doing a good job of implementing the program," Unz said.
Voters approved the law change in fall 2002 against the backdrop of a contentious national debate over immigration; school districts had nine months to implement the dramatic change. The ballot question ended the state's three-decade-old transitional bilingual education program, which promoted the practice of teaching English language learners subjects in their native languages while they learned to speak English fluently.
Under the new law, districts must teach all subjects in English even as students learn the language. In most cases, students are taught as a group in a separate classroom, where a teacher uses more simplified English and pictures and graphics in teaching subjects such as science and geometry. The goal is to merge students into regular education classes within a year or two.
Students can still be taught academic subjects in their native languages under the new law, typically when a critical mass of students who speak that language exist and parents want the program. But many education advocates say school districts are unaware of that provision or do not generally let parents know of this right.
In one finding, the report found that a number of parents declined to enroll their children into English language learning programs, even though Boston officials had identified their children as needing extra help. According to the report, the high school dropout rate for students whose parents declined such services tripled over the period studied.
One parent advocate said yesterday that many parents, particularly those who do not speak English, do not understand the consequences of declining services because school staff has failed to explain program offerings and the law properly.
"There is a lot of misinformation and miscommunication," said Myriam Ortiz, acting director of the Boston Parent Organizing Network, an advocacy group. "Parents go to the [district's] family resource centers and feel lost. They don't always know what the options are or what's the best options for their children."
The report follows a state review of the district's program last year that found thousands of students identified as English language learners did not receive support for the past four years, and ordered the district to develop a remedy. Boston schools submitted their plan to the state this winter. Boston has been without a permanent director for English language learning programs for nearly a year.
The report, which will be the subject of a forum tomorrow, also urged the state to undertake a study examining progress in all the school districts across the state.
"Once it's the law of the land, it has to be done well," said Miren Uriarte, a senior research associate at the Gastón Institute and a coauthor of the report. "It's a challenge for [Boston] and the state as a whole [to make the changes], but they have to realize these kids are here to stay and it behooves us to educate them well."

Initial version
Amendments to Alberta's proposed farm safety legislation were tabled Monday as the NDP government tried to quell a growing backlash to Bill 6 in rural communities.
The changes exempt family members from WCB and occupational health and safety rules, whether they are paid for farm work or not. Neighbours who come to the farm to help are also exempt.
The new rules, which come into effect Jan. 1, will apply only to paid workers who are not related to the owner of the ranch or farm. If a death or injury occurs, occupational health and safety will only investigate the farm if it has paid workers.
"We're amending the bill now to make clear what should have been made clear at the beginning of this process," said Agriculture Minister Oneil Carlier.
Farmers and ranchers have until the end of April to get an account with WCB.
However, the amendments do nothing to protect a child who is badly injured or killed on a farm.
Sigurdson acknowledged the focus of the bill is to protected paid workers. "It's a step forward," they said.
Over the next year to 18 months, the government will consult on industry-specific technical regulations that deal with chemicals, sharp objects and equipment. These issues will be written into regulations.
Calls for consultation
Opposition to the bill has grown ever since it was released last month. More than 1,000 farmers and ranchers demonstrated at two separate protests at the legislature last week.
Hundreds have crowded into town halls to voice opposition to the bill, which aims to subject farms and ranches to workplace safety rules and mandatory Workers' Compensation Board coverage for the first time.
Many farmers and ranchers say they fear the bill will bar their children from helping with chores, or prevent neighbours from helping them with calving and harvesting.
Wildrose Leader Brian Jean repeated their call for the government to kill Bill 6 and consult further with farmers and ranchers. Jean said they don't think the amendments will help.
"No matter what they do to try to fix the bill, I don't think it's going to satisfy Alberta's farmers and ranchers," they said.
Alberta Federation of Labour displays 112 work gloves, each representing the death of a farmworker since 2009. (CBC) PC MLA Richard Starke says people at a meeting in Vermilion on the weekend said they were planning to ignore the bill if it is passed.
"These are law-abiding people. They respect the rule of law in our communities and in our society," they said. "There's a problem with legislation that leaves people with no other option but to consider no other option but to consider civil disobedience."
Documents distributed to reporters when the bill was introduced last month said the bill would apply to children and unpaid workers.
However, Sigurdson, Carlier and Premier Rachel Notley now insist that information was put out in error and the measures will only apply to operations with paid workers.
When asked who provided direction to put the "incorrect" information on the web, Sigurdson said they couldn't provide that answer and said they would look into it.
Notley has vowed to pass the bill before the end of 2015. They said the amendments will clarify who is covered by the bill.
Labour organizers expressed their support for the bill Monday.
The Alberta Federation of Labour laid out 112 pairs of worker's gloves representing the number of farmworkers who have died in a workplace accident since 2009.
"It's got nothing to do with the farmers and their families participating in their everyday lives and continuing on the way they have," said Theresa McLaren, with the United Food and Commercial Workers union.
"It's about the paid employees that they hire."
AFL president ​Gil McGowan said farmworkers have been denied their rights as employees.
At the NITI Aayog Governing Council's third meeting on Monday Prime Minister Narendra Modi made two key pitches that could significantly change the political and economic setup. PM Modi proposed shifting of the financial year period from the present April-March to January-December. Another major proposal was of holding elections to the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies simultaneously. The meeting was attended by chief ministers of several states and the PM raised issues like political and economic mismanagement.
Advertising
PM Modi said: “Because of poor time management, many good initiatives and schemes had failed to deliver the anticipated results,” adding that there is a need to develop robust arrangements that could function amidst diversity. They called for taking the debate into Parliament and state Assemblies;
So what are the pros and cons of the two moves? Here's a look:
Change in fiscal year
In their opening remarks, Modi said that in a country like India where agricultural income is exceedingly important, budgets should be prepared immediately after the receipt of agricultural incomes for the year. The prime minister said that the government had suggestions for a change in the fiscal period to January-December. Niti Aayog vice chairperson Arvind Panagariya later said the prime minister wants that “we should think of January-December financial year as this is appropriate from the point of view of farmers”.

Two years after the British crown took over India's administration from the East-India Company, it introduced the budget system on April 7, 1860. Subsequently, the financial year cycle for April 1 to March 31 was adopted in 1867 by the then British Raj. The move was an attempt to align India's financial year cycle with that of Britain. Before 1867, India's fiscal period was May 1 to April 30. So, the fiscal followed in India since over the last 150 years is only because of tradition for aligning India's fiscal with its erstwhile colonial master.
Even the rare progressive British commissions agreed that the practice needed a change. A report of the Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency – Chamberlain Commission 1914 stated: “The revenues of India, whether shown under railways or customs or directly under the head of land revenue, fluctuate to an extraordinary extent with the success or failure of the agriculture operations of each year, and these again depend pre-dominantly on the south-west monsoon which spreads over the Indian continent and Burma in the months of June to October. Under present arrangements, the Indian budget is presented before the end of March, and the
Finance Minister accordingly has to prepare their estimates in ignorance of the most
important factor on which the results of the year will depend.”
It added: “It is clear in fact that from the financial point of view the present date is almost the most inconvenient possible for the budget, and the suggestion has therefore been made that the date of the beginning of the financial year should be altered from the altered from the 1st April to the 1st November or 1st January.”
There is no global standard for fixing a fiscal. Some countries follow a fiscal that coincides with the calendar year (January 1 to December 31) like China, Brazil, Russia and Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Malaysia, UAE, Saudi Arabia etc. Some like Canada and Singapore follow the same cycle as India. While others like Pakistan and Egypt follow a fiscal starting July 1.
The economic benefits would definitely outweigh the administrative difficulties that will arise initially for the implementation.
The government has, already, formed a commission in 2016 to look into the matter and a parliamentary panel has given its nod to the matter. A report on the matter was already published for government's sensitisation of the matter in 2016 by NITI Aayog written by member Bibek Debroy suggesting a change in the date. A host of statutes and taxation laws will need to be amended for the change to take place and it will be an arduous process but one that would bear results, but with immediate difficulties.
The Parliamentary Standing Committee chaired by M Veerappa Moily had this year in its report criticised the hastening of budget presentation and suggested that the financial year may be shifted to calendar year and the budget date shifted correspondingly.
Another major benefit is that major multinationals follow calender years as their fiscals. In India they have to follow two fiscals which makes business difficult. The change would align India's economy more with the global business environment. Another important factor is that at present the budget cycle suffers due to lack of sufficient data on crop income, monsoon forecast etc. This rain gamble causes difficulties in formulating the budget. Most importantly, it is about time India moved on from colonial tradition and decided on issues based on merit.
Finally, the one time implementation cost along with major financial reforms like GST rollout and merger of plan and non-plan expenditure may be too big a burden to handle. It will be a costly and cumbersome administrative exercise for both companies and the government.
Holding Lok Sabha and Assembly elections simultaneously
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had floated the idea back in January this year. Conducting parliamentary elections, Assembly elections and local body polls at a large scale each year in India is a costly and tiresome exercise which consumes a lot of resources.
Due to elections each year, key leaders holding posts in government are tied up for months in campaigning across the country leaving the functioning of their government to the hands of the bureaucracy. Moral code of conduct also restricts a lot of economic activity and that leads to a financial dent on the economy.
Massive expenses are borne to conduct Lok Sabha elections and then equal, if not more, are spent as combined exercise of Assembly and local body polls. Simultaneous poll exercise would nullify the expenses for multiple elections and at the cost of a single national election. It also gives four uninterrupted years for the government to work on the issues of the public, taking out one year for campaigning again. A similar kind of election is held in US as well for the Presidential elections and the Congressional elections. Though the state elections are held separately, still it is a step ahead to where we stand.
The only issue is when the government falls in between its five-year term. New elections elect governments to a fresh five-year term and thus will break the simultaneous system. For it to work, a change in legislation will be required.
It has been seen in the past that presidential rule has been imposed on weak grounds in many states. Even when Janta Party won in 1977, president's rule was imposed in many states. Similarly, at times local bodies come under control, direct or indirect, of the states which dissolve them prematurely. All of these factors lead to a situation of staggered elections. Hence stable polling bodies are a crucial need. There is no mention of a no-confidence motion in the Constitution. It finds mention in Rule 198 of the Rules and Conduct of Business of the Lok Sabha that states 50 or more members of the Lok Sabha can move a no-confidence motion. The rule says, if the motion passes, government has to resign and if neither party is able to form the government, premature polls are conducted.
A law commission report in 1999 had recommended a solution that could be used henceforth. It took a cue from German Constitution. In German parliament, when a no-confidence motion is moved against a chancellor, a confidence motion has to be moved as well. So if both motions pass, then the new chancellor is appointed by the German President.

Taking the system in India, if it is adopted, it could possibly mean that the elections will be held in a period 5-year manner without violating the national mandate of government formed by the consent of elected lawmakers and people's representatives. It could keep the democratic system from falling prey to political ambitions of leaders willing to sacrifice larger interests of the people.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt met privately with the CEO of a top chemical company before deciding to drop a ban on a widely used pesticide that has been shown to harm children's brains, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.
Pruitt, President Trump's top environmental official, reportedly met with the CEO of Dow Chemical, Andrew Liveris, for 30 minutes at a Houston hotel on March 9, according to records obtained by the AP.
Pruitt announced later that month that they would no longer pursue a ban on Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide being used on food. An EPA review found that even minuscule amounts of the pesticide could impact fetus and infant brain development.

An EPA spokesperson told the AP that Pruitt and Liveris were “briefly introduced” at the conference, where both were speaking.
“They did not discuss chlorpyrifos,” the spokesperson said. “During the same trip they also met with the Canadian minister of natural resources, and CEOs and executives from other companies attending the trade show.”
Pruitt also reportedly attended a larger group meeting with two other Dow executives, but the spokesperson said they didn't discuss the pesticide there.
The Pesticide Action Network and the Natural Resource Defense Council both sued the EPA days after Pruitt's decision. “President Trump and their EPA flouted court orders and EPA's scientific findings that chlorpyrifos puts children, farmworkers, their families and many others at risk,” Patti Goldman, the Earthjustice managing attorney handling the case, said in a statement at the time.
The American Academy of Pediatrics also called for the pesticide to be taken off the market, sending a letter to Pruitt on Tuesday saying they were “deeply alarmed” by their decision to allow the pesticide to continue to be used.
Oculu vs. Oculus: Complaint Posted by Eric Greenbaum on February 19, 2014 · 3 Comments
As promised, I am keeping track of the Oculu v. Oculus trademark case. Attached is the complaint as filed in Federal Court in the Central District of California. There are currently 7 causes of action:
Complaint: Oculus_v_Oculu
Trademark Infringement under 15 U.S.C. section 1114 False Designation of Origin under 15 U.S.C. section 1125a Trademark Dilution under 15 U.S.C. section 1125c Cancellation of Oculus' Application for Trademarks under 15 U.S.C. section 1119 Unfair Business Practices under California law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code section 17200) California Trademark Dilution under California law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code section 14247) Injury to Business Reputation under California Common law
I am submitting this without comment other than I urge interested parties to read the complaint. As far as complaints go, it's rather entertaining.
For Australia, one of the biggest titles of the year is arguably Turn 10 and Playground Games' Forza Horizon 3, which will put us behind the wheel as we head across the oh-so-familiar terrains of the land down under. Aside from getting to play the now pretty famous E3 reveal demo, creative director Ralph Fulton gave us an in-depth look at what the game is truly about and what kind of gameplay features we might expect from the game as we near its September 27th release date.
Starting off with the basics, Forza Horizon 3's different types of cars within its 350-car roster are the heart of the game, as every bit of different terrain in Horizon's outback requires a different approach. Suspension is key here and even though we all like to fool around with a Lamborghini in ridiculous types of terrain every now and then it might not be the best idea to continue these ridiculous practices as we head into a race against opponents who are clearly more prepared for the bumpy ride that lies ahead. The fun thing about this list of vehicles, however, is that it feels inherently Australian, as off-road buggies, three-wheelers, and other outrageous un-Forza-like vehicles make their entrance in what seems to be this franchise's most standalone title yet, as the Horizon festival reaches new heights. Speaking of the Horizon Festival, this time round you'll be put in the driver's seat of the event as Horizon 3 puts you in charge of the now famous festival. Choosing locations and races, it's your call where the festival goes and what goes on during the events. This is where the Blueprint system comes into play, which lets you either create and/or play events made by your friends that will become a part of the festival. These events can be customized by location, vehicle type, and weather and above all that, these events all function as official Horizon Festival races, which means that every single completed event will count towards your progress in the game. Along with this, you can hire the Drivatars of your friends to compete in your festival, though you'll be limited to 4 of them at a time, so choose wisely!
Since early 2014, Ebola has infected about 27,600 people and caused more than 11,200 deaths. And this outbreak is not over. To put this in perspective, the largest outbreak ever recorded previously was 425 cases in Uganda. Gabrielle Fitzgerald, director of The Paul G. Allen Ebola Program, talking with staff at the national 115 Call Center in Conakry, Guinea. Last month, I visited Sierra Leone and Guinea, and continue to be impressed at how hard people are working to try to bring the outbreak under control. Six realities stand out that remind me how far we've come and how far we still have to go to reach zero Ebola cases. There is still an Ebola epidemic in West Africa — Just because the number of new Ebola cases each month is dramatically lower than at the height of the epidemic last year doesn't mean the outbreak is over. Last week, there were 30 new cases, which is the highest we've seen in two months. In any other circumstance, 30 new Ebola cases would be a cause for significant alarm. Additionally, many of these cases came through unknown human contact, so we still do not have a grip on how and where the virus is moving. It's the time of year when Ebola cases might spike — With the onset of the rainy season this month, Sierra Leone and Guinea will receive up to 55 inches of rain on average per month, through November. This annual deluge washes out roads and diminishes sanitary conditions, making it difficult for people possibly infected with Ebola to travel to health facilities, and for response teams to reach the remote villages where Ebola may arise.

New countries at risk — Liberia was declared Ebola-free in early May, allowing the country to breathe a collective sigh of relief. Unfortunately, less than two months later, five new cases have been diagnosed just outside the capital, and the response effort has geared up again. Phone operators taking emergency calls at the national 115 Call Center in Conakry, Guinea. In the meantime, new Ebola cases cropped up in Guinea's Boke prefecture, which borders the country of Guinea-Bissau. International agencies have deployed health workers to this region to help the country prepare for the virus, in case it jumps the border. Complicating matters, Guinea-Bissau is another under-resourced and unprepared country, so the already stretched international response effort will be further taxed. There are few economies of scale in an Ebola response — Managing an Ebola Treatment Unit, or ETU, is an extremely complex and dangerous task. Since the disease is highly contagious, an ETU requires the same number of staff — at least 100 people, working 24/7 in four shifts of 25 doctors, nurses, hygiene workers, cooks, etc. — whether there is only one Ebola patient or a dozen. While the lower case numbers have allowed some ETUs to close, cases could spike at any time. Thus, we must remain well-prepared until zero cases are reached globally.

Ebola survivors continue to suffer even after they are cured — Many ETUs have “Survivor Walls” covered with pictures or hand prints celebrating the more than 16,000 men, women and children who have survived the often-fatal disease. However, shortly after discharge, Ebola survivors have reported painful and debilitating symptoms, including fatigue, chronic muscle aches, anorexia and a devastating eye infection that can lead to blindness.

In a world gone mad, Mel Brooks, now 90, is determined to get people back on their laugh track. Earlier this year, members of the Writers' Guild of America voted for the 101 funniest screenplays of all time. Brooks was the only writer to have three scripts they wrote or co-wrote in the top 12: their Oscar-winning original screenplay for The Producers, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein.
On Sept. 1 at New York's Radio City Music Hall, after a screening of Blazing Saddles, Brooks will discuss why the classic western sendup is still a riot 42 years after its theatrical debut. If that weren't enough, a coffee table book of Young Frankenstein will debut this fall.
Brooks is one of precious few to capture the EGOT, taking home Emmy, Tony, Grammy, and Academy awards. Like Don Rickles, Tony Bennett, and their close friend Carl Reiner, who co-created the 2000 Year Old Man bits, Brooks represents an era of show business that will pass when they do. But until that day comes, this old man river of laughs just keeps rollin' on.
What did Warner Bros. executives think when they first saw Blazing Saddles?
Mel Brooks: They wanted to bury me and the film. The head of distribution told the owners not to release the picture but they only did because it was already booked in theaters and they didn't have a picture they could replace it with. Only John Calley, an extremely filmmaker-friendly executive at the studio, championed it. The rest of the executives wouldn't acknowledge me on the lot even when Blazing Saddles became a huge moneymaker.”
Why did they hate the film so much?
I actually got notes from the studio head in vivid detail who said, “Lose the fart scene, cut out any racial and ethnic jokes, edit scenes where a horse and an old lady get punched,” and my favorite note: “Can you reshoot Black Bart with a white actor?” If I had made their changes the film would have been just 14 minutes long! I stupidly threw all their notes in the trash. Imagine the book I could have written on them today. Then I had a screening on the lot for anyone who worked there, so the executives couldn't think I was faking the results. The screening proved everything the big shots hated was funny beyond belief, and yet the big shots didn't believe the comic tastes of their own employees. I only got my first royalty check recently, which meant it took all these years to show a profit. Hopefully my next check will be in three figures!
And Richard Pryor, of course, was your first choice for Black Bart.
The studio didn't want them because they said they were unreliable due to their personal problems. I fought hard for Richard and was going to quit the film but they told me not to because they needed their screenwriter fees to pay their mortgage. Then we had a long and expensive search to find the right actor for their part. When Cleavon Little auditioned, Richard was in the room and gave me a signal that they were our man!
What other help did Pryor give you on Blazing Saddles?
When I was getting so much pressure to change the script due to it being offensive to blacks, Pryor stuck behind the work. They said the script, which three other people wrote besides us, was hilarious and if it was compromised in any way then we weren't going to make the movie we all believed in.
But didn't you cut one big line from the final edit?
Yes. For some weird reason, and I still can't explain why… well, there's a scene in Madeline Kahn's dark dressing room where she's below frame making Cleavon very happy. They tell them with satisfaction how big they are, and their initial response, which I cut, was: “You're sucking on my arm!”
What's the biggest misconception about Blazing Saddles?
That we shot it in black and white, then we later colored each frame with big crayons.
Do you think Blazing Saddles would ever get made in politically correct 2016?
No!
How do you feel about Hillary and Trump running for president in 2016?
I don't do political humor. It's too passé.
Who makes you laugh today?
Dave Chappelle, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Maya Rudolph, Zach Galifianakis, Louis C.K., Melissa McCarthy, and Harpo Marx.
What have you learned about pitching projects in today's Hollywood?
Never go to a studio executive's office. If you go there, you have a big NO awaiting you. If they come to your office, you've got a 50/50 chance for a green-light for your project.
What was your most unusual pitch meeting?
I went to Alan Ladd Jr., who was running Fox at the time, and pitched them Silent Movie. Even though Young Frankenstein had made them a lot of money, Laddie was very reluctant to do the picture. They said between the slapstick in that film and a non-talkie, it seemed like I really wanted to return to vaudeville, so they said no. I quickly told them I could get Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Marcel Marceau, Paul Newman, and Burt Reynolds, who was the hottest star in Hollywood at the time. I was lying of course, like I'm doing to you now, but Laddie said he'd make the picture if I got all of them. Newman loved the idea of driving a go-kart and not having any dialogue to memorize. I paid Reynolds $25,000 for a day's work and then told them I need them for three more days. Burt was having fun taking a shower with Dom, me, and Marty in the film, of course, I think—so they stuck around.
Didn't you have a strange meeting when you tried to pitch Young Frankenstein to Columbia Pictures?
The short version is they wanted to make it but wanted to make it for $2 million less than its small budget—money Fox made just on the 40th anniversary DVD. My last words at the meeting were, “And we're going to make it in black and white.” As I'm walking down the hall I realized I was being chased by 30 executives telling me I had no green-light if I wanted to make it in black and white. And this was when Blazing Saddles was making millions of dollars daily, money that somehow disappeared immediately when I asked Warner Brothers when I would receive a royalty check.
With truly unlimited source material, why didn't you ever make a sequel to History of the World: Part I?
Nobody asked me to. The film made good money. I'd enjoy doing a sequel to that and Spaceballs. There's still so much you can satirize in both movies.
Do you feel any of your pictures are underrated?
The Twelve Chairs. It was a nice, sweet film with a funny performance by Dom DeLuise—his best, I believe, other than when my wife Anne Bancroft directed them in Fatso. My favorite film nobody saw is Life Stinks. I play a multimillionaire who makes a bet with a peer that they can survive on the streets as a homeless person. You root for this guy and you laugh with him, not at him. You know, basically all my films are about greed versus humanity. I never want people to leave one of my productions feeling depressed. If you come out of the play The Producers humming “Springtime for Hitler” and having a smile on your face, then I'm a happy man. Do you realize the last time I was at Radio City Music Hall was when The Producers won more Tonys than any play in history?! That place is bigger than some New England states. I'm going to be there with Blazing Saddles Sept. 1 . I may be a 2,000-year-old man but I can still see empty seats. Since I'm not getting paid for this fantastic interview I'm giving you, then do your best to help me fill those seats. Is that too subtle?!
OK, but only if you answer one final question: Is it true that Dustin Hoffman was going to receive their first starring role in The Producers?
YES! Dustin came to my house late one night and threw pebbles at the windows of my upstairs apartment. Even then I knew better not to eat with an actor or give them my phone number. Dustin told me they had to drop out of my film, a movie I had spent years trying to get financing for, because they were going to Los Angeles to star in The Graduate. I yelled at them so loud it woke up my fellow renters. I screamed, “You mean you're deserting me to spend the summer in Hollywood making love to the love of my life [Bancroft]?” Then I gave them my blessing by adding, “Good choice!”
Recently, Yao Ming contacted LDS basketball player Jimmer Fredette, who now plays for the Shanghai Sharks, with good news. Fredette broke Yao Ming's record. Averaging 40 points a game, Fredette set a new record for scoring over 30 points for the most consecutive games in the Chinese Basketball Association.
When they learned about their new record, Fredette apologized to Yao Ming, saying they aren't intending to break records. He's just trying to play their best. "You don't want to focus on [records and glory]," Fredette says in a video with CGTN. "You don't want to get happy and complacent. You want to make sure to work as hard as you can."
During the interview, the topic of Fredette's faith arose right alongside Fredette's sudden rise to stardom.
Nicknamed "The Lonely God" by the Chinese, Fredette says he's been able to keep connected with the LDS Church.
"There is a Mormon community here. So I have met a lot of people that have gone to BYU that have invited me over to their house," Fredette says.
In addition, Fredette has made an impact on the community by living their values and standing as an example.
"I always try to treat people with kindness and respect. That's what it's all about; that's how my parents raised me," they say. "Everbody is the same. No matter where you are, you are not better than anyone else. That's what life is all about; it's not just about basketball, it's about having fun and being a good person."
CGTN's reporter, blown away by Fredette's humility and kindness, remarks, "Well Jimmer Fredette, you are quite possibly the nicest man I have met in basketball."

One of the entire purposes of using a compiled language is to have the compiler watch your back. If you ignore it, then what good is it? warning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default --> src/main.rs:19:5 | 19 | reader.read_line(&mut lines); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ warning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default --> src/main.rs:35:9 | 35 | file.read_to_string(&mut response); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Introduce more functions to break up the distinct parts of read_request . From my inspection, there's a part that parses the request, a part that handles the request by reading a file, and a part that responds (which already exists). Note that doing this contrains the number of lines of code a variable is mutable and avoids the need to recover the inner TcpStream from the BufReader . vec_line is poorly named; it's not a Vec . I am happy to see your use of nth ; many people would collect into a Vec , which is inefficient. There's no reason to convert the result of nth into a String , you can call replace on a &str equally well. Avoid using mut just to be able to reassign a variable (e.g. the result of replace ). Instead, just bind the variable a second time. This reduces the amount and scope of mutability. requested_page == "" should be requested_page.is_empty() Why would you convert a String to a String using to_string ? Just take a reference to the existing string. There's no need to create a string to write to the stream; just write! directly to the stream. The code always prints "OK", regardless of the status. Checking if a file exists before reading it introduces a race where the file can be deleted between the check and the read. It's better to open the file and check any resulting error. Instead of creating mutable variables ( response , status ) with defaults, consider only setting them in the appropriate branches. Again, this reduces the number of mutable variables and the scopes of mutability. Once response and status are moved to a function, you can just return them directly. read_request does more than just read, so it should be renamed. The current code doesn't require a TcpStream except in the outermost loop. It only needs anything that implements Read and Write . Using generics will allow you to more easily test those functions in isolation.
use std::io::{self, Read, Write, BufReader, BufRead}; use std::net::TcpListener; use std::fs::File; fn main() { loop { let listener = TcpListener::bind("localhost:8000").unwrap(); let stream = listener.accept().unwrap().0; handle_request(stream); } } fn handle_request<S>(mut stream: S) where S: Read + Write { let requested_page = parse_request(&mut stream); let (response, status) = read_file(&requested_page); send_response(stream, &response, status); } fn parse_request<R>(stream: R) -> String where R: Read { let mut line = String::new(); let mut reader = BufReader::new(stream); reader.read_line(&mut line).unwrap(); let mut words = line.split_whitespace(); let requested_page = words.nth(1).unwrap(); let requested_page = requested_page.replace("/", ""); if requested_page.is_empty() { String::from("index.html") } else { requested_page } } fn read_file(requested_page: &str) -> (String, u32) { match File::open(&requested_page) { Ok(mut file) => { let mut s = String::new(); file.read_to_string(&mut s).unwrap(); (s, 200) } Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::NotFound => (String::from("Not Found!"), 404), Err(e) => panic!("Unable to open file: {}", e), } } fn send_response<W>(mut stream: W, res: &str, status: u32) where W: Write { write!(&mut stream, "{}{}{}{}", "HTTP/1.1 ", status, " OK
", res).unwrap(); }
There are way too many uses of unwrap . At the very least, use expect so you have some clue about what caused the program to terminate. Even better, use Result for error handling.
As a basic step, returning a Box<Error> is extremely simple and allows you to consolidate your error handling:
Police say recruits on anti-depressants are in danger of "spontaneously" relapsing.
Police say recruits on anti-depressants pose a risk to the police force, a view the Mental Health Foundation has slammed as unacceptable.
Marty Fox, the police national manager of wellness and safety, defended the policy preventing new recruits on anti-depressants from joining the police, and said patients on anti-depressants were in danger of "spontaneously" relapsing.
That was "a risk for NZ Police", they said.
ROSS GIBLIN/FAIRFAX NZ Stuart Nash says the two-year ban protects those with a mental health precondition.
"The goal for treating these illnesses is remission where the individual [is] no longer symptomatic and is functioning normally. A partial response to treatment without remission is not absolute and can come with a higher risk of relapse.
READ MORE:
* Police policy on turning away recruits taking anti-depressants stigmatises mental illnesses: advocates
* 'NZ is too indifferent about depression'
* How to tell if you're depressed or just sad
"Hence the two-year stand down guideline applies to ensure the recruit applicant has been treated effectively and is fully recovered."
SUPPLIED Shaun Robinson, Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation, says people with mental illness are often better at dealing with stress than those without.
Stuart Nash, Labour's spokesperson for police, agreed with the policy saying it protected those with a precondition from harmful situations.
"I think there are enough people out there who would make brilliant police officers without any existing mental health condition.
"Do we want someone with an existing mental health condition in the police force, considering the high degree of stress, week-in week-out, that a lot of these officers face?
"I just think it's a lot safer for men and women who want to become police, and for our communities, if people who want to enter the police don't have an existing condition."
However Mental Health Foundation chief executive Shaun Robinson said Nash's comments were "simple-minded and unacceptable" and those with mental illnesses often dealt with stress better than those without.
"It is doubly disappointing that a Labour Party spokesperson is trying to defend discrimination and is in fact revealing an extremely disappointing degree of ignorance about mental health.
"If they [people with mental illness] have been supported well then they will have also learned ways to manage stress in order to maintain their health and wellbeing."
Robinson thought the reasoning was "complete gobbledegook".
"It is not correct to say that anyone who is on anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication that the aim is eventually not be on anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication.
"The objective within mental health is not necessarily lack of mental illness, the objective is for people to be able to feel good and function well and be extremely effective in the workplace including in workplaces such as the police force.
"Medications will help to manage the symptoms but the objective is not necessarily to eventually have to give the medications up."
Police also said serving officers who took anti-depressants were not required to declare their medication to a senior officer, a policy Robinson said was "a complete contradiction" to the two-year ban.
"They don't require those people to disclose. They're obviously quite happy for those officers to continue being serving officers, then clearly they're quite comfortable with the fact that people can be on anti-depressants and an effective police officer.
"Being a serving police officer is undoubtedly stressful but it is incumbent on the police force to provide the support to people to manage that stress.
"The way to do that is not to put in a blanket discriminatory ban against people who have accessed anti-depressant medication."
Robinson said Ministry of Health surveys indicated one in every two New Zealanders would experience a diagnosable mental illness in their lifetime.
"This is not a small number of people and it is not a small number of people who will be excluded from potentially serving in the police force."
Police Minister Paula Bennett was contacted about the policy but a member of their office said it would be inappropriate for them to comment.
Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo has reiterated the threat that unless F1 changes direction in the near future, it will lose its most loyal supporter - as they blasted the new regulations this season for making the racing too 'artificial'.
Ferrari is the only team on the grid to have begun every single campaign in F1's six-decade history, but of late, there have been mixed signals about its continued commitment - and di Montezemolo contends that the advent of the new, steering wheel-operated moveable rear wing and deliberately fast-degrading Pirelli tyres in 2011 as well as the FIA's proposal for four-cylinder, turbocharged engines in two years' time is anathema to everything that the Scuderia represents.
"A steering wheel is now a computer covered in buttons," the Italian lamented in an interview with German magazine Auto Bild, arguing that the sport 'has become too artificial' and that 'the fans no longer understand'. "The [Concorde Agreement] expires at the end of 2012. We need to discuss now how to proceed. Ferrari will continue to be there, so long as the sport gives us back something for the development of technology for our production cars - otherwise not."
Meanwhile, the Prancing Horse is on the verge of aping early-season F1 2011 World Championship leaders Red Bull Racing with a flexible front wing for its underperforming F150? Italia - even if technical director Aldo Costa concedes that such an addition alone will not provide an immediate quick-fix to the car's front downforce issues.
"It was not possible [to keep last season's flexible front wing] with the new, more stringent test for measuring the flexibility of the wings," they explained to Finnish newspaper Turun Sanomat. "Red Bull, however, succeeded and passed the tests. We have studied the situation carefully, and now we will have the same solution.
"We know what our biggest problem is, but solving it quickly is more difficult. We are trying solutions in Shanghai, which I hope will improve things. If they don't bring the results we expect, we have a big development in front of us."
On the opening day of practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix, however, double F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso lost valuable set-up time in the afternoon with hydraulic woes - caused by 'experimental parts' - that left the Spaniard unable to complete their planned programme, one that had been due to include an aerodynamic investigation begun at Sepang, putting several new components through their paces and an evaluation of the two tyre compounds brought to the circuit by Pirelli.
"I did not manage to do any long-run testing to get an idea of the tyre degradation, but fortunately, Felipe [Massa - team-mate] managed to do that on both types, so at least we have a good basis to start from," the 29-year-old reported. "As for the new aerodynamic components, it is too early to say if they really produce an advantage. The engineers will now have to study the data carefully tonight, before drawing any definite conclusions as to whether or not we are moving in the right direction in terms of development.
"From the little I could see, there are no problems - or at least they are very slight - in terms of warm-up on the hard tyres, which could be an improvement for managing the tyres in qualifying; in Australia it was a problem with the warm-up, and even in Malaysia with the hard tyre the first lap was not the quickest. I don't expect much to change from what we saw there, though - McLaren and especially Red Bull are quicker than us and are the favourites. At the moment, we are not capable of fighting for the win, but that doesn't mean we won't be trying.
"The main priority for us is to improve the car as quickly as we can, bring new parts to every race and hopefully they [will] work well enough. We know that all the teams will bring new parts as well, so we just have to bring more parts than them."
"I think we had more problems today in three hours than we had in the whole 15 days of winter testing!" quipped Ferrari's assistant technical director and head of racetrack engineering, Pat Fry. "[That was] a shame, because we needed to cover some distance, especially with Fernando, who was experimenting with the latest aerodynamic solutions that they have come up with in Maranello. We will try and make a virtue of necessity and carry out the job of analysing the data with what we managed to gather.
"The hydraulic problems stem from the same fault, a defective component and we will take action to fix it for the rest of the weekend. We will aim to be as well-prepared as possible for qualifying and the race, but I don't think we can expect anything very much different to what we have seen in the first two grands prix of the season."
How-to: Making contactless payments with Pay apps at Ventra readers
Ventra accepts standard contactless payments for fares right at the turnstile or bus reader, from mobile wallets/Pay apps and contactless bankcards.
If you have a phone, watch or other device with a contactless Pay app set up, you can use it directly for a Pay-as-you-go fare with Ventra instead of needing to get a card or ticket from us first!
Payment methods with the symbol—where you can make contactless payments at places like retail checkouts and vending machines—work for direct, Pay-as-you-go payments at Ventra readers.
Popular mobile wallet/Pay apps we accept include:
See also: Paying with contactless bankcards
Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
Just touch your device on the center of a fare reader target. The PAYG fare for the service you're riding (see agency fares) will be deducted for your first ride.
NEW: Transfers are now available when riding with PAYG on CTA and Pace!
If using a Pay app, be sure to have the app present the same funding source every time you tap to make sure you get the best fare.
See fare information from the service you're riding, such as CTA or Pace, for complete rate details and policy.
How charges appear on your app/statement
Fare is calculated automatically based on the rides you take and charged to your card's account like a standard "credit"-type transaction.
Your credit or debit card (loaded into a mobile device's wallet/Pay app) may be authorized for $5.00 when you first touch it to a fare reader, even though the actual fare is less: This is a temporary pre-authorization, and you'll only be charged the actual fare once it's reconciled in your payment account (this usually happens after about a day).
For example, if you only took $2.75 worth of rides, you may see a pending $5 authorization occur in your payment app and banking app, but after the charge has been reconciled you'll only see $2.75 on your bank statement.
Depending on the app/service you used, you may or may not see detailed (or even final) charges in your Pay app, but you will see the total fare actually charged, in up to $5 increments, in your bank's online transaction history and on your bank statement once fares are fully reconciled with your bank.
Tips for using contactless cards/mobile devices/Pay apps at a Ventra reader
Touch your device or contactless card directly to the reader's target
Touch your the back of your device against the yellow target on the lower part of bus fare readers or on train station turnstiles for a reliable read, every time.
Get your device ready, first, for fastest entry
When using a Pay app, you may need to open your phone's Pay app or authenticate on your device and touch again, if prompted.
Many devices have shortcuts to make them ready to pay before you touch to the reader. Here are some tips for common devices:
If you're using Apple Pay , you can ready your iPhone or Apple Watch with Apple Pay for a contactless PAYG payment using tips from Apple .
, you can ready your iPhone or Apple Watch with Apple Pay for a contactless PAYG payment using . If you're using Google Pay , you can ready many Android phones/devices to make a contactless payment by simply unlocking your device as you walk up. For more, check out tips from Google .
, you can ready many Android phones/devices to make a contactless payment by simply unlocking your device as you walk up. For more, check out . If you're using Samsung Pay , you can ready your device from its locked state by swiping up from the bottom edge of the phone to open Samsung Pay. You'll need to use the fingerprint reader or enter your unlock code to pay. For more, see tips from Samsung .
, you can ready your device from its locked state by swiping up from the bottom edge of the phone to open Samsung Pay. You'll need to use the fingerprint reader or enter your unlock code to pay. For more, see . If you're using Fitbit Pay, you'll need to pull up your card on the device's screen. See tips from Fitbit on how to pay.
Avoid "card clash"!
Whenever you pay, touch only your desired payment method to a Ventra fare reader.
Ventra can accept payments from many different card/payment types. Touching only your mobile payment device—with no other cards along with it—makes sure that the payment method you intended to use covers every part of your trip.
(Never attach any cards that might be used for payment to your phone, such as bankcards with the symbol, or Ventra Cards or Ventra Tickets you've purchased from a vending machine.)
Additional tips for using Pay apps
Using multiple cards in your Pay app
Always use the same card on the same device on Ventra readers to make sure we can follow your trip and make sure you get the best fare, including free out-of-system transfers as well as paid transfers per CTA or Pace fare policies. See agencies' websites for rate details.
Shared cards for your household
If you and someone else in your household share a card (or two cards with the same card number issued by your bank), or you want to be able to use a second device as a backup in case your battery dies, please be sure to use different payment cards in your Pay apps when paying fare to avoid any conflicts.
Using multiple devices with the same card (or card number)
Many card issuers allow you to set up your payment cards on multiple devices, such as on your watch and your phone.
To avoid conflicts and make sure the correct fare is paid, our system only allows a card to be used on one device at a time: if you've used the same payment card on multiple devices, the most recent device that you've used to pay a fare with your bankcard will become the active device for that card in our system and that card may not work if you try to use it again using one of your earlier-used devices to pay with that card at a Ventra reader.
We recommend choosing a device you'll always use when paying fare and using only that one with any given card. If you replace it with a new one, the new device will automatically take over for that payment method in our system.
Pay for others traveling with you
You can pay for up to six other people traveling with you with your contactless bankcard—they can join you at any point along the way and Ventra will figure out their fares, automatically. Learn more about paying for others traveling with you.
What do I do if the reader says "Stop" when I tap?
This may be the result of having used your payment method on another device more recently than the one you tried to pay with (such as tapping your watch to ride once and trying to go back to using this card on your phone).
If this happened and you'd like your previous device to become the active one again, simply call Ventra Customer Service at 1-877-NOW-VENTRA and a representative can help. (In the meantime, you may need to use another payment method to ride.)
They can also help you resolve any other issues, such as if the reader says "Stop" because a charge for a previous Pay-as-you-go ride you took was not accepted by your bank.
Finger tattoos can be a bad idea, but why? Here's why tattoo artists will ask you to think twice, Wolverine…
You've found that gorgeous – if somewhat microscopic – tattoo on Pinterest. It's cute, sexy and, being on the side of your finger, demurely discreet (whilst also being totally obvious you have a tattoo). Arriving at the studio, you cheerily wave your Pinterest discovery in front of the receptionist's face, and suddenly find yourself being lectured at…
I work at a tattoo parlour, and I'm usually the staff member who'll have to explain, for the billionth time that day, why getting a finger tattoo can be a really, really bad idea. For the billionty-first time today, I'm going to explain why you should think carefully before doing this to yourself. Especially if you're considering it as a first tattoo.
You really need to think about the risks and understand it doesn't just happen to other people, it could happen to you.
The thing is, I can't blame people for being so unaware of the risks associated to such a placement. We live in such an image-driven society where celebrities are the beacons of what's defined as beauty. When they do something like getting the side of their finger tattooed (Rihanna) or the sole of the foot (Miley), it's no surprise that tattoo parlours suddenly become inundated with people wanting to emulate their idols.
Why are finger tattoos (usually) a bad idea?

1. They fade. And fast.
Finger tattoos fade because the skin on your finger regenerates super-fast. Verily, thy name is Wolverine.
If you paid attention in Biology, you may remember the teacher explaining how the skin on your palms, the sides of your fingers and the soles of your feet regenerates ten times faster than anywhere else on your body. It's just the body's clever way of coping with constant usage. If you want evidence for it right now, just take a look at your hand. Can you see how there's almost a line separating the top of the hand from the bottom? The skin even feels different!
So what does this mean in terms of tattoos? I like to compare getting finger tattoos to playing an extremely twisted version of roulette – you can never tell whether the odds will be in your favour. When you're up against such fast regeneration, the chances of the ink being able to remain wholly in your skin – if at all – are slim. Very slim.
For example, check out this cute Harry Potter tattoo (and hurry on back).
When freshly done (as most tattoo references you'll find on the internet are), the ink looks bright, legible and… pretty good!
Sooner or later though, because of the placement's fast regeneration, your tattoo will end up looking like the ‘six weeks later' version on that same pic.
Not so good.
Of course there are some people who manage to attain a lovely-looking finger tattoo with no drama. And when I say “some”, I refer to a small minority of people who are just miraculously lucky from the offset. It's a game of twisted roulette; are you sure you want to play?
via GIPHY
Naturally the lucky ones will at some point fall prey to fading like the rest of us, providing they didn't mess up their healing process, and depending on the skin's ageing effects (which incidentally also occur a lot faster in these placements).
However, the majority of us have far more risks to contend with.
And here's where the game gets interesting…
2. Blurred ink and blow-outs: common finger tattoo fails
Other than the fast regeneration which spoils the aesthetics of finger tattoos, the most common fail attributed to such locations is known to tattooists as blow outs. This is where the ink spreads out too far under the skin and causes the line work to appear blurred and distorted.
Unfortunately, this can make itself evident at any time (even to the initial lucky ones). It can happen during the healing process, whilst you're being tattooed or even a few months later. Because your artist will be having to work extra hard to push the ink into the skin to remain there, blow outs are the most common fault to occur. The crappiest thing about it is that it's more likely to happen with each re-touching procedure you have for the tattoo (and, because of the fast skin regeneration, you're more likely to need them than with most other placements).
It's not your fault. It's also not the tattoo artist's fault.
The most important thing to note here is that should any of this happen to you, it all falls down to how your skin takes the ink. For example, I have very pale and frail-looking skin. Whilst it's great for keeping tattoos looking vibrant for longer, I tend to suffer from blow outs much more. It's just a risk I've come to accept.
A finger tattoo isn't always going to get better the more you try.
If you weren't lucky the first time in hitting the sweet spot (where the ink settles properly into the skin), then you can sometimes achieve success with a re-touch or two, providing there were no issues other than fading. However, over time a re-touched finger tattoo will be subjected to fading a lot faster so you'll need to get it topped up again. Whilst some people suffer no consequences and keep having it re-done to look fresh and vibrant, others may end up suffering a blow out anyway…
It's a risk you're going to have to accept and be prepared for.
3. Finger tattoos get more chance of an infection.
You guys still with me? Good, because now we get to the gruesome part…
Infections.
Ew…
A lot of people tend to forget that a tattoo is an open wound, because it doesn't really look like one. And open wounds – whether they be a cut, scrape or fresh ink – are much more susceptible to infections than unbroken skin. With tattoo placements on areas that are used a lot, like the hands and soles of the feet, the chance of an infection is much greater.
Consider everyday activities like coming into contact with dirty dish water when washing up, or giving your kitty a belly scratch. Even putting on gloves can pose a threat to an unhealed tattoo. For the feet, sweating inside shoes or even the fibers from your socks can cause an infection. Basically, extreme care and diligence is required when looking after your tattoo through its healing process.
Unfortunately your artist can't hold your hand throughout the healing process. They can only advise on how to take care of it, but as soon as their art walks out that door, it is solely up to the wearer to ensure its longevity. Of course, with the issues we discussed already, you can look after your tattoo amazingly on the fingers and feet, and still end up with it looking faded or patchy. However, an infection is something you do not want to add to that list. So be smart, and follow your tattooist's advice.
Tattoo artists are not the bad guys. They care about what they do. That's why they care about your tattoo placement.
Remember, whatever an artist creates on someone, it is their work and they'll want it to look its best. If you suddenly find yourself losing your aftercare sheet, go back to the studio and ask. We take much more kindly to those who return to ask for the advice than those who come back with patches missing from the tattoo or an infection occurring because they forgot how to look after it and decided to wing it…
With all this in mind, you can't really blame an artist for refusing to associate their work to such locations. Especially when they're the ones usually coming out as the bad guys in this situation. No matter how they may advise and warn a client, there's always one in a dozen who'll end up blaming them for the tattoo's failure. We get it, it's hard to admit you got your first tattoo in the crappiest place imaginable, but that error can cost an artist their reputation.
4. Re-touches on finger tattoos aren't free. The costs add up…
Speaking of cost, now would probably be a good time to mention the re-touches we mentioned earlier. Although they're free on other body placements, re-touches are not free on finger tattoos. This goes for the palms and the sides and soles of the feet too. Whilst I can't speak for all tattoo establishments and artists, I have yet to come across one that will offer free re-touches. Why? Well if they did, through material costs and the number of times they'd have to re-touch the area in order for it to stay or no longer be tattoo-able, they'd end up paying you to have the tattoo. Which, really, is not a great business model…
So to summarise, those small, delicate-looking tattoos come with a big risk. If you're a first-timer in being tattooed, I really would reconsider and look for a tattoo placement area that's not so high maintenance. Always look for a tattooist with a strong success record of tattoos remaining well in these areas – but also remember that how it heals is largely down to you, and how your skin takes the ink. Even the more “successful” artists for these areas will be encountering such problems.
Just remember, on your own hand be it…
When creating the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, Microsoft's ambition was not to reinvent the device but simply to make it better. The company is committed to the basic Surface concept of a tablet with a kickstand and detachable keyboard, and the second generation devices do nothing to shake up that formula. Like before, the goal is to make tablets that are highly productive.
Aesthetically, the devices look extremely similar to their predecessors. On the Pro version, the only obvious change is the logo on the back. Where before there was a Windows logo, there's now a Surface logo.
The ARM version (which no longer sports the "RT" moniker; it's simply known as Surface 2) has this logo too, but it also has a more obvious visual change: it's now grey. Instead of the black finish of the first generation devices (and still found on the Surface Pro 2), it's a bare metal device. The front is black glass, but all the other parts are metal grey. There won't be a black option either.
The thing that set Surface apart from other tablets, the kickstand, has also been refined. The new kickstand has two open positions instead of one. In addition to the old 22-degree angles, there's a new one that holds the screen at about 45 degrees.
The new angle is intended to make the tablets more convenient when used on your lap or even on desks when you're tall.
From my brief experience with this, I think it's somewhat successful. There is no one "right" screen angle. It'll depend on how you're using the thing—watching a movie on a plane is different from Tweeting on a sofa, which is different from working at a desk—how tall you are, and so on and so forth. Adding another angle means that the kickstand will prop the thing up in a comfortable way more of the time, and I would definitely use the new angle at least some of the time. All that said, it's still not as flexible as a laptop-style hinge.
Even with adding another position, the kickstand clicks reassuringly into place. Whether it will continue to do so after thousands of openings and closings remains to be seen. I trust Microsoft has tested it and made sure that it withstands reasonable wear-and-tear without getting loose.
I may have imagined it, but the new kickstand also felt ever so slightly as if I were flexing it when I opened it. The first generation devices never had that sense, and Microsoft says that some of the metal is thinner in the new device to make it lighter, so some small differences in how it feels may be the result.
I also don't have a good sense, right now, of whether it will be easy to accidentally knock the kickstand from its old position to the new one. I think that this should become clearer once we get systems in to review.
Both devices also have better speakers, with Microsoft licensing some kind of Dolby-branded technology for the version two products. In the noise of the launch event, it wasn't possible to know what difference this makes in practice.
Surface 2
The first Surface was criticized for having a low resolution (1366×768) screen, a slow processor, and a high price.
This time around? The screen has the same 10.6 inch diagonal, but it now comes with a resolution of 1920×1080. This is the same resolution (and same unit) as is found on the Surface Pro 2. Microsoft says that it has improved the color accuracy of the screen by nearly 50 percent. I don't know about that, but it's certainly a nice looking screen.
The processor is now a four core NVIDIA Tegra 4 running at 1.7 GHz. Memory bandwidth and Wi-Fi performance are both claimed to have been doubled. The USB port is now USB 3 instead of 2. Other major specs remain the same: 2GB RAM, 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4, and 32 or 64GB of storage.
The few apps I tapped to open did seem to open quickly enough, and Tegra 4 certainly should be quite a bit faster than the old Tegra 3. Again, the full picture will only become clear with longer testing. Windows RT 8.1 will add Outlook to its existing Office apps (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote) and for me, the real test will be to see how well it copes with my quartet of inboxes and tens of thousands of preserved e-mails.
According to the spec sheets, the new device is a hair thinner (shrunk by two hundredths of an inch) and a fraction lighter (sub-1.5lb). Unsurprisingly, this difference wasn't perceptible when I actually held the thing.
Even with this better performance and marginal weight saving, battery life is estimated at around 10 hours, up from the eight hours of the first device.
We found the cameras in the first generation device extremely poor. They were barely acceptable for Skyping, and you'd never want to use the rear camera to take photos. They've been substantially upgraded in the Surface 2 (though peculiarly, not in the Surface Pro 2). The rear camera is now a 5MP device; the front one 3.5MP. Both are capable of capturing 1080p video. Picture quality appears to be better, as one would hope.
The cameras also support burst image capture. The Windows 8.1 camera app, on hardware that supports burst capture, will automatically capture multiple images when a picture is taken. This allows the best image from the bunch to be selected, potentially salvaging images otherwise ruined by an inopportune blink.
All that's left is the question of price. Microsoft is keeping the old model on sale at $349. The new one will be $449 for 32GB, $549 for 64GB. That still feels a bit expensive for a tablet.
If you look at it as being a robust, secure system that's ideal for students and home users who want or need to run Office (especially now that Outlook is included), I think it feels a bit less expensive. The build quality and general level of fit and finish remain ahead of netbooks or other cheap laptops. With Surface, Microsoft has always been aiming at creating "productive tablets" (where "productivity" spans a fairly full range of typical office tasks). If that productive aspect is important, then the price is reasonable.
A couple of promotional extras might make it even more compelling. Buyers of Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 will also receive a year of "Best of Skype," which provides a year of free international calls and free Wi-Fi at any hotspots that can be paid for via Skype (which I believe in practice means Boingo hotspots). They'll also receive 200GB of SkyDrive storage for two years. Buying these would cost about $120 and $200, respectively. If you're going to make use of these extras, the Surface 2 looks like a decent value.
Surface Pro 2
If Surface 2 felt similar to its predecessor, it had nothing on Surface Pro 2. Surface 2 is, at least technically, lighter and thinner than the first model. Surface Pro 2 isn't even that. Externally, aside from the new logo and dual position kickstand, it's identical to the first model. The changes are all on the inside.
The cornerstone of that change is the use of Intel's 4th generation Core processors, which is to say, Haswell (specifically, an i5-4200 with HD Graphics 4400). The CPU runs at a base speed of 1.6GHz and can turbo boost up to 2.6GHz. This should improve lots of things at once: Microsoft claims that it's 20 percent faster in CPU workloads, 50 percent faster in GPU workloads, and that it has a whopping 75 percent more battery life. A tablet that lasted four to five hours before will now last, theoretically, eight to nine hours.
Just as with Surface 2, Microsoft wanted to make Surface Pro 2 a better Surface Pro. The major complaint leveled at Surface Pro was that its battery life was poor. The internal improvements made to Surface Pro 2 substantially address that.
That change is, however, basically invisible. The device looks and feels almost identical to the old one. It just goes faster and runs for longer. In practical terms, those are huge improvements that will make the new device far better than the old one. In a few minutes of hands-on time at a launch event, however, you'd never notice the difference.
Further strengthening its productivity credentials are additional RAM and storage. Four models of Surface Pro 2 will be offered: 64GB storage with 4GB RAM at $899, 128GB with 4GB at $999, 256GB with 8GB at $1,299, and 512GB with 8GB at a rather eye-watering $1,799.
Overall, it's clear that Microsoft isn't going to abandon its productivity tablet idea any time soon. If the Surface concept appeals, the new devices are in every sense better. They address the major shortfalls of their respective predecessors. In so doing, they become a lot more appealing.
If, however, the productivity tablet idea has no appeal—if you just don't care about Office or just can't give up the laptop form factor—then the new devices won't fundamentally change that. For that, Microsoft will need to take another step down its path to becoming a Devices and Services company. They'd need to develop, for example, an eight inch "Surface Mini" and perhaps even a Surface Ultrabook.
Both of Microsoft's new tablets will be available to buy on October 22 with preorders starting on September 24.

So how does this work?
WHAT YOU NEED
* Specific problems. Basically don't just say "oh I want to be better" or "my mechanics suck", I need some indepth stuff I can tear into. Replays are helpful in this respect.
* Money. 25 bucks an hour, Australian
* Someone of roughly equal skill to play against. This one is sort of optional but being able to yell stuff at you whilst you're trying to play can be helpful.
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO IF ALL THIS SOUNDS GOOD
* just PM me or email me at
WHAT YOU GET
* Knowledge!
If you want I can stream the coaching session. Again, optional. I think twitch saves previous broadcasts or something though? Not sure about that one actually. I get asked "hey iaguz do you coach?" a lot. I usually don't since time spent coaching could be spent playing/studying starcraft but seeing as the next month is pretty quiet, I might give it a go again. After all, I do like money, and coaching is easy.So how does this work?WHAT YOU NEED* Specific problems.

Re: Gonna coach for a month. I am not looking for coaching but just trying to get some more info out of your post for the potential coachees.
How is the coaching time divided?
Do you review the replays before the coaching and then go over what went wrong/right during the coaching hour(s)?
Do you review the replays during the coaching time?
If no similar level opponent is provided by the coachee do you ask stream viewers to jump in as the build test monkey
Do you provide your own replay packs for study? An overview document of what transpired during the coaching? (similar to PiG's coaching I think)?
Do you only coach Terrans? What if a Zerg or P want to learn ZvT, PvT? Wed, 5th-Jun-2013, 5:37 PM Location: Sydney, Australia Total Posts: 1,130 Race:Location: 3 ROOT`iaguz
Re: Gonna coach for a month. I'll give replays a quick look before the session and focus on a few key issues.
Stream viewer, SC2SEA chatbox volunteer, sure. It's generally easier if you can find your own though.
Coaching time isn't really divided because there's no set structure for how this'll work. You give me an indication of where you're at concerning a matchup or other issues and I'll try and help you fix it.
I don't do replay packs. If you want to watch a good terran player there are loads of Koreans you can watch. But that doesn't help you with your problems, does it?
I haven't considered doing an overview document like what you say pig does. it seems interesting. Perhaps I'll ask them about it.
I only coach Terran. I don't know the other races indepth enough to be worth anything. ___________________________________

NOVEMBER 5, 2013 -- We've heard a concern from some of you that there's an island of debris in the Pacific Ocean coming from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. For those of you who may be new to this topic, we'd like to address those concerns. Here's the bottom line: There is no solid mass of debris from Japan heading to the United States. At this point, nearly three years after the earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, whatever debris remains floating is very spread out. It is spread out so much that you could fly a plane over the Pacific Ocean and not see any debris since it is spread over a huge area, and most of the debris is small, hard-to-see objects. We have some helpful resources for you, if you're interested in learning more. While there likely is some debris still floating at sea, the North Pacific is an enormous area, and it's hard to tell exactly where the debris is or how much is left. A significant amount of debris has already arrived on U.S. and Canadian shores, and it will likely continue arriving in the same scattered way over the next several years. As we get further into the fall and winter storm season, NOAA and partners are expecting to see more debris coming ashore in North America, including tsunami debris mixed in with the "normal" marine debris that we see every year. NOAA has modeled the debris' movement, and the model shows the overall spread of all simulated debris and an area where there may be a higher concentration of lower floating debris (such as wood) in one part of the Pacific. However, that doesn't mean it's in a mass, and it doesn't tell us how much is there, it just shows there may be more debris there than in other areas. Observations of the area with satellites have not shown any debris. Even though there's no mass, addressing this debris is very important. NOAA has worked with partners in the states to monitor the debris, form response plans, and try to mitigate any impacts. We'll continue that work as long as necessary. We're happy to answer any questions you may have. Feel free to email us at MarineDebris.Web@noaa.gov.
London, England (CNN) -- A Muslim scholar has issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, that says suicide bombers are destined for hell.
Muhammad Tahir ul-Qadri condemned terrorism and criticized Islamic extremists who cite their religion to justify violence.
Ul-Qadri's 600-page fatwa is "arguably the most comprehensive theological refutation of Islamist terrorism to date," according to the Quilliam Foundation, a London organization that describes itself as a counterterrorism think tank.
"Terrorism is terrorism," ul-Qadri said at a news conference hosted by the foundation. "Violence is violence. It has no place in Islamic teaching, and no justification can be provided to it ..."
Ul-Qadri is the founder of the Minhaj-ul-Quran, an organization with hundreds of thousands of followers in South Asia and the United Kingdom, according to the Quilliam Foundation.
The foundation refers to ul-Qadri as a mainstream Muslim scholar who is a "widely recognized and respected authority on Islamic jurisprudence."
They criticized Muslims who, in justifying terrorism, say it furthers the goal of correcting wrongs done to Muslims.
"No good intention -- even one thousand good intentions put together -- cannot justify a wrong and forbidden act," they said. "Good intentions cannot convert a wrong into good."
Some extremists have interpreted the Quran to suggest that those who kill in the name of Allah will be rewarded after death with 72 virgins and a place in paradise.

Gavel the puppy was facing a tough change when they flunked out of police dog academy for being too sociable.
Instead of tackling hardened criminals, the German shepherd pup liked to meet strangers, and police in Australia felt they "did not display the necessary aptitude for a life on the front line".
Luckily, they had been fostered at the official residence of the Queensland governor since they were six weeks old.
So the governor gave their four-legged friend a brand-new job.
Image copyright Governor of Queensland Image caption Their Excellency the Honourable Paul de Jersey gets acquainted with Gavel
"He has outgrown four ceremonial coats, undergone a career change (his official title is now Gavel VRD, 'Vice-Regal Dog'), and brought untold joy to the lives of the governor, Mrs de Jersey, Government House staff, and the thousands of Queenslanders who have since visited the estate," the office of Governor Paul de Jersey said.
A year after the puppy first arrived, staff shared Gavel's story and photos on social media.
Gavel's promotion came about in February, after their handlers decided they didn't have "the right aptitude" for police work, and gave them a trial as a ceremonial participant.

When they first arrived at their foster home last year, a press release from police said: "Gavel comes from a long line of pedigree... if the family bloodline is anything to go by, in 16 months Gavel will be tracking and catching criminals as a proud member of the Queensland Dog Squad!"
Sadly, it wasn't to be. But "at one of Brisbane's most prestigious addresses, it is unlikely Gavel will be complaining any time soon", it added.

Citizens are assured that everything they lack in crime-fighting aggression, they now make up for in their duties of welcoming guests and tour groups to the grounds of Queensland's Government House.
They also partake in special ceremonial occasions - and the job comes with a custom-made uniform featuring the state emblems of Queensland.
"We hope Gavel's with us for a long, long time into the future," Governor de Jersey told 7 News Brisbane.
Hecklers Try To Veto University Screening Of 'American Sniper;' May Find Themselves Watching 'Paddington Bear' Instead
from the this-alternate-option-is-perfect-because-YOU-ARE-SPOILED-CHILDREN dept
The University of Michigan has succumbed to a heckler's veto, mistaking an alternate point of view for the only point of view, and shutting down legitimate speech in response.
The Center for Campus Involvement announced Tuesday afternoon they would cancel a planned showing of “American Sniper” at UMix following a student petition over the depiction of certain communities in the film.
Protest at the showing.
Offer a contrasting point of view, either by hosting a movie more closely aligned with their worldview or by asking to be allowed to provide some sort of rebuttal before or after the screening.
Note that they disapproved of the screening and leave it at that.
Write letters to the editor of the campus newspaper or any other related journalistic entity.
Notably, the students opposed to this screening didn't do any of the following:
No. They chose to shut down the screening by circulating a petition that described how hurt their feelings were that the university hadn't consulted with every last student before choosing which film to screen.
“Although we respect the right to freedom of speech, we believe that with this right comes responsibility: responsibility of action, intention, and outcome,” the letter read. “The movie ‘American Sniper' not only tolerates but promotes anti-Muslim and anti-MENA rhetoric and sympathizes with a mass killer.”
“Student reactions have clearly articulated that this is neither the venue nor the time to show this movie,” the statement read. “We deeply regret causing harm to members of our community, and appreciate the thoughtful feedback provided to us by students.”
"Surely, this is the best evidence yet that a speech-destroying storm is sweeping across American campuses. The students who seek to ban speech have much to learn but a university that yields to their demands can hardly be trusted to teach them.”
It was a mistake to cancel the showing of the movie “American Sniper” on campus as part of a social event for students.
The initial decision to cancel the movie was not consistent with the high value the University of Michigan places on freedom of expression and our respect for the right of students to make their own choices in such matters.
The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location.
We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.
Therefore, the university also will show an alternative movie, “Paddington,” in another location on campus at that same time and date to provide our students with additional options that evening.
1/4 - would not recommendThe Center for Campus Involvement immediately folded and offered its apologies to everyone it inadvertently offended with its movie selection."Harmed" how? By offering a movie no one on campus was obligated to watch? It wasn't a mandatory event and those offended by the movie had several options available, most of which didn't involve ensuringon campus could see the movie.In what would appear to be a dig at the "victims" infantilization-by-proxy of the entire student body, but is more likely due to a limited selection of last-minute offerings (guaranteed not to result in a swift petitioning), the CCI decided to screen "Paddington Bear" instead. For a student body composed of 18-23 year olds.Howard Wasserman, writing at PrawfsBlog, wonders where the notion of "counter-speech" has disappeared to -- the long-held belief that the best weapon against "offensive" speech isspeech, not. They posit there are a few reasons we see this so infrequently exercised on campus: It's hard. It sometimes doesn't work. Restrictive campus speech rules -- free speech zones , permits, etc. -- make it almost impossible to mobilize counter-speech efforts.But the big one is this: people tend to take the easiest route -- shouting someone down -- and many campuses are quick to indulge those engaging in this behavior. Wasserman quotes Floyd Abrams There may be hope for Michigan's CCI. Sometime during the night following its capitulation, it rediscovered its spine and respect for free speech. This statement arrived the following day And, as a concession to those with nothing better to do and/or still offended by the "American Sniper" screening, the CCI still offering a film targeted at the 10-and-under crowd.So, if the hecklers aren't interested in staying home and brooding about their failed veto, they're more than welcome to sit through "Paddington" -- something guaranteed to be as blandly inoffensive as a documentary on vanilla ice cream. Or maybe those so thoroughly offended by this optional event might take this opportunity to actually engage in some speech of their own, rather than (virtually, via Google Docs) shouting down the speech of others.And maybe the next time this sort of situation arises, the university won't be so swift to grantof the credibility to a small number of complainers -- something far too many schools do by default.

Dear Georgia's Christian Citizens:
Unless something dramatic changes, tonight, March 2, your employees in the Georgia prison system, enforcing your laws, paid by your tax dollars, will take a Christian woman named Kelly Gissendaner from their cell and calmly kill them
This means, in a very real sense, you will kill them That's because someone whose salary you pay will be the one to strap them to the gurney, and someone else you are paying will run the lethal chemicals into their body, and someone you elected made the laws that these prison officials are enforcing. So you are responsible.
Actually, my fellow Georgians and fellow Christians, we are responsible. We will kill Kelly Gissendaner.
We will kill them not because they pose any kind of threat to society, as they are disarmed and rehabilitated, and has been incarcerated peacefully — indeed, as a model prisoner and a real force for good in their prison — for years.
We will kill them not because they are unrepentant for their crime, but even though they are deeply repentant.
We will kill them not because Georgia kills all people convicted of murder, because no state, including Georgia, executes all people convicted of murder, but instead executes a tiny minority of murderers, mainly those characterized by socioeconomic powerlessness or bad legal decisions.
We will kill them not because the death penalty functions as any kind of deterrent, because there is no evidence that such a sparse and randomly used penalty functions anywhere as a deterrent in the United States today.
We will kill them not because executing someone can heal the wounds of grieving family members, because the long death penalty process and finally an execution more often worsens and inflames grief and unforgiveness.
We will kill them not because Georgia's citizens are united in their support for the death penalty, because many Georgians, including many protesting today, are vehemently opposed to this penalty.
We will kill them not because Georgia is participating in a surging national trend toward support for and use of the death penalty, but instead contrary to a strong national trend away from support for and use of this penalty.
We will kill them not because Georgia benefits from national attention to our highly questionable implementation of the death penalty in high-profile cases, but despite the fact that it is not what Georgia's businesses and tourist sites and citizens want to be known for.
We will kill them not because Georgia's largely conservative citizenry generally express support for strongly centralized state power, but despite the fact that Georgians generally distrust an overly powerful government. And there is no greater governmental power than the power to kill its own citizens.
And, sadly, we will kill them not despite but because of the way many Georgians think about our dominant Christian faith.
Here I part ways with my fellow Georgians who do support the death penalty, for I most certainly do not. But I think I understand the version of Christian faith that undergirds that support. I wish to reason with you as a fellow Christian and ask you to reconsider this position on principled grounds.
Knowingly or not, many Georgia Christians support the death penalty because there is a strong tradition of Christian support for the death penalty in the United States. This is true especially in the South, which executes far more people than any other region. The letter I write today could just as easily be directed to nearly any state in the South and a few elsewhere.
I urge my fellow Georgia (and Southern) Christians to pay attention to the sharply declining support for the death penalty among Christians in the rest of the United States and in the global Christian family — including the Roman Catholic Church, most mainline denominations, and a very large number of evangelical Protestants. Principled opposition to the death penalty is not an outlier position but instead widely held in the broader Christian world.
Many Georgia Christian citizens support the death penalty because they take the laws of the Hebrew Bible (our Old Testament) seriously. But I urge my fellow Georgia Christians to pay attention to how most Jewish rabbis and scholars also take these laws seriously but for centuries have not supported the use of the death penalty. This is reflected in the fact that the modern state of Israel does not practice the death penalty, and has only executed one person, major Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann.
I urge my fellow Georgia Christians to think about how little the death penalty is actually implemented even in the Old Testament itself, which offers several key accounts of murderers who are spared death for their crimes. Consider Cain, Moses and David. Perhaps this could lead my fellow Christians to the conclusion that the Old Testament death penalty statutes signal the extreme seriousness of murder and other crimes, and demand a proportionate punishment, but one short of death and tinged with some measure of mercy.
I urge my fellow Christians to contemplate the unjust use of the death penalty to kill the great majority of the leading figures we meet in the New Testament, including John the Baptist, Paul, Peter, Stephen and, yes, Jesus himself. Closely studying these abuses of state power recorded in the New Testament might incline my fellow Christians to be much more suspicious of state claims that it is time, once again, for the state to kill one of its own.
Some Georgia Christians support the death penalty because Genesis 9:5-6 seems to demand blood in retribution for blood. But I urge you to consider that this text does not envision a modern society with prisons where criminals can pay with their lives in a proportionate but very different way than execution — and urge you to again consider the clemency shown to major figures in the Old Testament itself, after Genesis 9.
Some Georgia Christians support the death penalty because Romans 13:1-7 says we should respect government, which executes divine wrath on wrongdoers, making them pay for their crimes. But I urge you to think about the flaws of all existing human governments, their manifest errors and injustices, perhaps especially in the criminal justice system, and the need to limit rather than expand state power.
Perhaps you could agree that life in prison without release is a mighty terrible penalty but one that sets at least that one crucial limit on the power of the state — the power over life and death. And you might dare to wonder how Paul themselves would have interpreted Romans 13 a few years later when they were getting ready to be murdered unjustly by Nero.
Above all, I urge you, my fellow Georgia Christians, to linger around our Savior Jesus. Jesus who was coldly executed by Roman power. Jesus who stood with those on the margins and the bottom of society. Jesus who forgave and forgave and taught us to forgive and forgive. Jesus who said that only those of us without sin are free to cast the first stone.
My fellow Georgia Christians, I urge you to join those of us asking for mercy in this case — which means life in prison, not release, but also not execution. The case for that kind of mercy here is extraordinarily compelling. But ultimately, it's not about one particular individual and the details of one particular case.
The issue is really that Georgia needs to join many other states and end the use of the death penalty once and for all. We don't need it. It isn't rationally or fairly applied. It's marked by race and class bias. It's more expensive than imprisoning someone for life. It doesn't make us safer. It doesn't deter murder. It doesn't heal our wounds. It doesn't make us proud. And Christians, when all is said and done, it doesn't fit with the Jesus whose forgiveness and mercy are the very ground of our lives.
Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, you could stop this particular killing — before night falls.
In the name of Jesus, many of us are pleading with you to do just that.
No more killings in our name, Georgia Christians. Not one more.

The execution of a graduate: Struggles for life at Candler School of Theology, by Jeff Hood
The conflict between Russia and the West is evidence of a post-Cold War clash of worldviews that has never been resolved.
Neither Russia nor the West expected such a deep – and for now irreparable – crisis in their relations. The West responded to the annexation of Crimea and to Russia's egregious violation of Ukraine's sovereignty with economic sanctions. Putin's abrupt policy moves, aggravated by the sanctions, precipitated Russia's economic and social decline. But the West has been unable to make Russia reverse its course. Now, the crisis has gone beyond Ukraine and has raised real concerns about European security.
A quarter century after the end of the cold war, we have found ourselves somewhere that neither Russia nor the West ever wanted to be. Blaming Putin for the current dramatic developments in Ukraine may be justified, but obviously, the true reasons for the crisis run deeper.
The end of Communism, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Russia's painful process of coming to terms with its new identity and stature presented Western policymakers with a tough challenge. However, too often, they were reluctant to address the gravity of the task.
Some in the West never believed the collapse of Communism made a difference.
Some in the West never believed the collapse of Communism made a difference – to them, post-Soviet Russia was just another incarnation of the West's adversary, the Soviet Union. One of those sceptics was Anthony Lake, national security adviser in Bill Clinton's first administration, who said that Boris Yeltsin's government was made up of people who were “basically communists who had changed their suits from red to blue”. Should Lake's opinion have prevailed, there would have been no rationale for ending the cold war.
Another camp hoped that Russia would join the realm of European democracies. Shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO asserted in its London Declaration that “The Soviet Union has embarked on the long journey toward a free society. The walls that once confined people and ideas are collapsing.” It said that those people were “choosing a Europe whole and free”. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the camp of those who believed in Russia's democratic future –first and foremost among them, President Clinton – won the upper hand.
But of course, the West's Russia policy was not guided by those rosy hopes for a new, democratic Russia. This was especially so since post-Soviet Russia's early record was far from encouraging: the results of the 1993 and 1995 parliamentary elections demonstrated that the anti-Communist reformers had little public support. The Chechen War was another huge disappointment. Anthony Lake themselves admitted later that “the United States did not have the leverage to make the Russians reverse course”.
Lake's statement applied to the domestic course of post-Soviet Russia. In foreign affairs, Russia was dramatically weakened and barely had any say. Though political correctness required the US to refrain from triumphalism, after decades of cold war it was hard for it not to feel exactly that – triumphant. In recently published archival research by Mary Sarrotte, President Bush Sr. is quoted as saying “We prevailed, they didn't. We can't let the Soviets clutch victory from the jaws of defeat.” Thus, the US as the victor in the cold war and the sole remaining superpower had tremendous leverage. It used this sway to lead the policy of NATO expansion, the bombing of Yugoslavia, the war in Iraq, another round of NATO expansion, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, and the claim this set no precedent for anybody else anywhere else, to mention just some of the major US foreign policy moves. Russia objected to these policies, and especially to the West's push towards independence for Kosovo. In the fall of 2007 Richard Holbrooke, a prominent US foreign-policy figure, said “The Bush Administration had an open glide path to Kosovo independence during its first term […when] the United States was globally dominant, and, most important, the Russians were still flat on their back.” The Kremlin's objections were seen as an annoyance that, at the end of the day, could be dismissed.
NATO expansion caused grave concerns in Russia.
NATO expansion caused grave concerns in Russia as soon as the project emerged on the US foreign policy agenda in the early 1990s. Even the westernising reformers in Yeltsin's government shared this concern – not so much because NATO was seen as a threat by the members of Yeltsin's government, but because it further empowered Yeltsin's irreconcilable Communist opposition. In 1992 at an OSCE session in Sweden Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's liberal foreign minister, shocked everyone by their speech in which they said that Russia wanted no business with NATO or the West – the ex-Soviet space was Russia's sphere of influence and nobody should meddle with it. Later in the same session they explained that they meant it as a joke of sorts, as a sobering reminder to the West of the power of the anti-Yeltsin revanchist hardliners.
The West was not fully insensitive: the pill of NATO expansion was sweetened by offering Russia a seat on the G8. Whether or not this offer looked generous to Yeltsin and the Westernisers in their team, it hardly softened the hardliners. The pill remained as bitter as before, but Russia was forced to swallow it. Russia was still too weak to be reckoned with.
Just how Russia would evolve was not a major concern for the policymakers locked in the politics of the here and now. Even those who wished Russia well barely realised that the country was too big in every way – geographically, historically, and politically, as a former superpower with the second-largest nuclear arsenal – to become just another nation on the way to Europe whole and free, in the line somewhere between Poland and Ukraine. This was simply not an option. Nor did Russia have the soft power to become a centre of attraction, a leader of a significant political alliance. This inherently uncertain identity was a major impediment to a forward-looking Russia policy.
Throughout the 1990s the West relied on Yeltsin to handle their hardline opposition, and they did. But in the process, their opponents gained more power, while Yeltsin grew much weaker, until they narrowly escaped impeachment and had to step down before the end of their second term. Vladimir Putin, their anointed successor, effectively neutralised Yeltsin's enemies and gradually turned them into allies. At first they did not fully go over to their side. They were not an anti-Western hawk. Arguably, they sought economically beneficial relations with the West. But their higher priority was to make the West reckon with Russia, recognise its sphere of interests, and refrain from meddling with the post-Soviet countries. To the West, the sphere-of-influence approach was obviously unacceptable, and Russia's inappropriate ambition was dismissed.
In Munich Putin stood as a leader of a Russia that had grown stronger and was demanding that it no longer be taken for granted.
Fifteen years after Kozyrev's “joke”, Putin too gave a warning to the West. In their 2007 Munich speech they sounded angry and frustrated over what they saw as American hegemony and its meddling in other countries' affairs. But unlike Kozyrev, Putin was speaking on their own behalf. Unlike Yeltsin, they enjoyed a sky-high approval rating at home and the Russian hardliners were now on their side. In Munich Putin stood as a leader of a Russia that had grown stronger and was demanding that it no longer be taken for granted.
This year, after Putin's abrupt annexation of Crimea, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly said that Putin lived “in another world”. “Another world” may be read as a hint that Putin is out of touch with reality, but it also brings to mind the two worlds of the cold war with their irreconcilable ideologies. In Putin's world national “sovereignty” is a central principle – but just a few countries can claim sovereignty and, therefore, have the right to a sphere of influence. Russia is one of those chosen few – historically, and because Putin stands ready to fight for their nation's sovereignty in a world where Might mean Right.
The West heard Putin's message, but dismissed it again as a nineteenth-century approach. In the twenty-first century, the West responded, all nations are equal and each country is sovereign. This sounds like a wonderful world – except that this does not seem to be the world of the US-led policy of humanitarian intervention, peace enforcement, taking sides in other nations' domestic conflicts, and killing the forces for evil on behalf of the forces for good. Putin saw this as an argument that their world of Might mean Right was real: America could pursue such policies because it was powerful and sovereign. Arguably, in Putin's real world European nations' sovereignty is second-rate because they depend on the US for their security and therefore have to follow US policy lines.
The Ukraine crisis demonstrated that the West has no means to impose its twenty-first century worldview on Putin. To paraphrase Anthony Lake's words of a quarter-century back, the US does not have leverage over Russia's ways, now even beyond Russia's borders. Today, it barely has the leverage to defend Ukraine from Russia's interference.
The current confrontation between Russia and the West is a move back to a cold war design: Russia as “another world” isolated by the US-led West. Russia's world today is limited to just itself with no socialist camp around it, and the West has the potential of pushing Russia deeper into a crisis, both economic and political. Unlike the Soviet meltdown that had numerous internal causes, but is blamed on the West by Russian conspiracy theorists, this crisis will truly be precipitated by the West. In the cold war the West sought to prevail against Communism and hailed the post-Communist Russia. This time round, there is no idea just what “another Russia” should look like – either in the West or in Russia itself.

The number of film and television industry jobs is sinking in B.C. and spiking in Ontario, according to a new report — proof, industry insiders say, that tax credits are luring work east.
B.C. lost 3,500 direct and spinoff film and television production jobs during the year ended March 31, 2012, with the total number falling from 39,500 to 36,000, according to the Canadian Media Production Association report. In the same period, Ontario's industry gained nearly 8,000 jobs, jumping from 43,400 to 51,300.
Industry officials say B.C. is clearly losing business to Ontario and Quebec, which both offer a 25-per-cent tax credit on all production costs. B.C. offers a 33-per-cent tax credit on labour costs only.
The province's decline comes as the total value of film and television production nationally rose by 5.6 per cent to $5.89 billion in the 2011/2012 fiscal year, according to the CMPA report.
Garry Brook is the human face of the numbers.
The 19-year veteran of the B.C. film and television production industry rarely sees a first-run movie anymore — a strange reality given what they do for a living.
Brook, a grip on film and television projects, said they don't work enough these days to pay for luxuries like going to a movie or going out for dinner.
“I own a house and still pay a mortgage on it but if things continue this way, everything I've worked for all these years could be in jeopardy,” said the 47-year-old Maple Ridge resident.
Brook said they get about half the work they used to when the B.C. film sector was thriving. When they do get a job, it's often for far less than they used to make.
They and their wife, who have three children, cashed in $5,000 worth of RRSPs to help get them through this lean period, and their son took out a student loan to pay for their final year at the University of B.C.
“Had I been working, they would not have had to do that at all,” Brook said.
B.C.'s share of Canadian film and television production fell by eight per cent to $1.58 billion as the value of foreign productions in the province fell by about $260 million — from $1.36 billion to $1.1 billion.
Anxious B.C. industry workers organized a rally in Maple Ridge tonight to press their case for more provincial government tax relief to attract more productions to the province. A rally at North Shore Studios in North Vancouver last month drew about 4,000 concerned workers.
Freelance film and television production manager Wayne Bennett, an organizer of the Save B.C. Film movement, said workers plan another rally soon as they try to make the industry's health an election issue.
Bennett met last week with Community, Sport and Cultural Development minister Bill Bennett and four Liberal MLAs and was told there's little the province can do right now, given the tight budget situation.
“It's frustrating that they haven't been able to quantify the value of this industry in the many, many years of its operation,” Wayne Bennett said. “They've built an industry with more than 25,000 jobs and over $1 billion worth of infrastructure yet they can't measure the economic impact of that investment.”
They said B.C. needs to change its tax structure to make the province more competitive but it doesn't have to match the breaks offered by Quebec and Ontario, because B.C. offers other advantages such as highly skilled crews and better proximity to Los Angeles.
Brook also wants the film and television sector to become a provincial election issue this year but they don't care which party wins.
“Ultimately, whoever wins will still need to deal with thousands of people who no longer have steady careers,” they said.
The CMPA report said the 2004/2005 fiscal year was the worst year for industry employment in B.C. in recent memory, as the number of direct and spinoff jobs fell to 24,900 from 42,500 a year earlier.
Several reasons have been given for that drop — including an absence of big-budget U.S. feature films, tax credits in other provinces, a rising Canadian dollar and the prominence of cheaply made reality TV shows.

Beneath Rochdale, a town just north of Manchester, England, there's a river. In the early 20th century, the river, along with an 800-year-old medieval bridge, was banished underground as part of a development project. Now, reports the Manchester Evening News, the town has decided to resurrect some of its natural beauty by removing three sections of the culvert that covers the river and by restoring the bridge, which will be located in the town center.
The restoration project will cost around $7 million, but the town is enthusiastic about embracing a piece of its history. "The idea has been around for ages and we are looking at this in relation to the regeneration of the whole of Rochdale town centre," Rochdale council's John Percival told the Evening News. "We are bringing 800 years of history into the modern era."
Local artists were recruited to help determine the river's ultimate design, and developers say the project could be completed by 2015.
Here, you can see the river's evolution, beginning in 1902, before it was covered:

Some days my time online makes it seem like photographers spend more time making watermarks than they do making photographs. So as it's been a while since I've allowed myself a rant, let me weigh in with my opinions about the theft of images. But first a caveat. Yes, copyright laws matter. Yes, you should register your work. Yes, you should pick your battles and pursue thieves when it counts. And yes, people that steal are the same kinds of people that kick kittens. Of course I've also known a lot of photographers that go on and on about people stealing their work – work tweaked on stolen software and put into slideshows using music they've no rights to…
I also know not everyone's going to agree with me; I'm bringing this up to ask important questions. Your answers will be your own.
Still…
People are going to steal your work. They always have. They always will. And each time it happens your eyes will cloud over with the red mist. I get it. But when that anger forces you to engage in a battle that consumes your creative energy, it can destroy the creative flow you've worked so hard to achieve. Win the battle, lose the war. Same thing with watermarks. By all means, subtly watermark your images – in Canada there are new court rewards if someone removes a watermark – but I've seen watermarks so large and ugly they ruin the photograph. What's the point in posting it at all? You might as well just make ugly photographs. No one will steal those either. And once again, the same thing with posting images online that are the size of a postage stamp. No one will steal them because no one can see them.
To be an artist means you create something and put it into the world. The rest is out of your hands. It will be experienced by people you never anticipated. It will be adored and reviled, which is better than simply being ignored. It will be criticized. It will be interpreted in ways you never intended. And it will be stolen.
We all do this work for different reasons. But most of us do not do it so we can spend our days in paranoia and anger, preventing theft and chasing down violators. For most of us, our problem is not that people are stealing our work but that too few people are seeing it. So let them steal. Hell, make it easy for them to steal. Put a tasteful watermark on your work so people can find you and then throw it into the wind and hope to God that someone with a larger audience than you puts it on Pinterest. Let people use it when they ask, and when it feels right let them do it for free.
I know, free is a bad word too.
When did we all get so consumed with greed and paranoia and self-righteousness? When did we ever do our best work when possessed by those forces? Of course it's your right not to be stolen from. But how you respond to that is your decision, and affects your work.
There's an old saying: “You can't steal something from me that I willingly give you.” It has its limits, of course, but how much happier would we be, how much stronger would our own work be, and how much more would people enjoy seeing our work, if we remained committed to the idea of art as a gift. Some will pay for my work, some will not, and others will steal it. Either way, the gift keeps moving.
Time and again I've seen people thrive when they believe in abundance, generosity, and picking their battles very, very carefully. And I've seen people consumed, bound, and floundering when they've embraced the opposite. It's counter-intuitive, I know. And there's a time and a place for free. But experience suggests to me that the ones that are most consumed by this stuff are the ones that can't afford to be. I'll worry about theft if, God help me, I become complacent and resting on my laurels and my past work is my best, and most valuable, asset. In the meantime I'll spend my energy doing what I love: creating my work and sharing it.

“This tradition has existed for a really long time already in the provinces,” said Ronnasit Proeksayajiva, chief investigator at Nvader, an NGO that investigates and combats human trafficking.
They said some victims were younger than 10 years of age and the youngest victim Nvader had rescued was an eight-year-old Cambodian.
“Some local officials have procured girls to please their bosses. Some have done so because they are sexual-service agents,” Ronnasit said.
They said it was not difficult to gather information on prostitution rings as even hotel bellboys, for example, had information on such practices.
“The problem of child prostitution has existed across various sectors in Thailand, not just among civil servants,” they said.
For example, a prominent sportsman had sought child prostitutes wherever they went, Ronnasit said without elaborating about their identity.
Ronnasit spoke up in the wake of a scandal that suggested several officials might have bought sexual services from minors.
Girls are often coerced into the sex trade as they are lured into |trying drugs, with activities recorded on camera, and then blackmailed.
“In fact, laws don't punish drug-takers but children do not know about this. They are afraid and end up being victimised,” Ronnasit said.
Their information echoed what a mother from Mae Hong Son province told police. They said their underage daughter got involved in the sex trade after they were videotaped taking drugs and then blackmailed.
The complaint from the mother has exposed a child-prostitution ring in Mae Hong Son, causing a scandal involving several officials.
Ronnasit said it was extremely sad that such a culture existed not just among civil servants but also company employees.
“We need to change the attitudes. We need to promote the conscience,” they said.
The Centre for Girls, which works to protect girls in the border province of Chiang Rai, has disclosed that many schoolgirls entered the sex trade at the encouragement of friends.
“We are now trying to educate girls to boost their immunity against the risks of being dragged into the flesh trade. We have gone to restaurants to educate ethnic girls who work there so that they know how they can protect themselves,” the centre's coordinator, Natnaree Luangmoi, said.
They added that their centre had also provided help to girls who wished to stop sex work.
Natnaree said that with officials involved in child prostitution, it was difficult to expect that the problem would ever end.
The Foundation for Women director Usa Lertsrisantad said they had been trying to help women and girls deal with various kinds of problems, including forced prostitution, for 30 years.
“With child prostitution existing for the past three decades, it is clear that the culture of procuring girls for bosses' sexual desire still rages on. The government should do something about this,” they said.
Two Marines are under investigation for torturing a Husky puppy so brutally that they were left with broken hind legs and their mouth was bound shut with rubber bands which cut through to the bone.
Five-month-old Kane the Husky puppy was reportedly abused by the unidentified married couple, however they are currently recovering and has already found a new home.
When Kane was found by the Ranch Dog Rescue center, the puppy weighed only 11 lbs and their mouth had been tied shut for so long that their teeth had become rotten and their snout had been scarred to the bone. (Scroll down for the video.)

Earlier this month, Kane underwent surgery to repair their legs at Butterfield Animal Hospital in Temecula, California.
Ranch Dog Rescue founder Maureen Keo said:
I could not have asked, or hoped, for a better prognosis. All three veterinarians who treated Kane agree that the extent of their injuries are a clear sign of neglect and the result of severe abuse. Now, Kane finally has a voice but best of all, they have found a home. In six weeks or so, when the beautiful baby boy has recovered from surgery, Kane will join a loving family experienced with special needs pets.

Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton has issued a statement about the incident, which read:
Two Camp Pendleton Marines, a husband and wife, are under investigation by the military police aboard Camp Pendleton and their unit for allegations of animal abuse. Their command is focusing their attention on the matter and after investigation will come up with a determination on what action will be handed down. Once the investigation has wrapped up, Camp Pendleton PIO will let us know the action that was taken toward the couple.

Tony Abbott's Coalition Government has taken a severe beating in recent polls following the release of the newest federal budget plans. While the AUD$80 billion slashes in funds for health and education over the next ten years has received the most attention, the entrepreneur community is also reeling in palpable frustration.
Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the abolition of a range of industry assistance programs to save over $845 million. They argue, “Businesses should stand or fall on their ability to produce the goods and services that people will actually want.” Although this statement affirms the ‘product-market fit mantra', it is ignorant of the fact that Australia's start-up community is relatively nascent and still needs support.
Among the victims of the budget reform are the Innovation Investment Fund (IIF) and Commercialisation Australia, two important pillars of a support system for Australian technology and innovation. IIF was established to seed venture capital firms and innovative Australian companies. SEEK, one of Australia's most successful companies was an early beneficiary of the program. Likewise, Commercialisation Australia - a government initiative offering funding and resources to businesses, researchers, and inventors looking to commercialise innovative intellectual property – will also be killed.
The government will replace these initiatives with a single, new service called the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program that is due to provide $484.2 million over five years to “improve the capabilities of small to medium enterprises and streamline business access to government programs.” Details of the new program are currently vague and still need to be finalised.
On one hand, the government can be seen to be trying to save money and repair the budget - which is genuinely needed. On another, perhaps the government really doesn't know how to manage the organisations and funds to administer them. Take IIF for example, where $130 million of the total $600 million deployed over the course of its sixteen-year existence was spent on various fees and costs. Kim Heras, a Founder of 25Fifteen - a Bondi based start-up incubator says, “The government can do a raft of things that make startups a more interesting investment asset class – particularly from a tax perspective - but it can't be handouts. The government needs to support private sector efforts rather than over-administer them.”
Although Australia ranks a respectable 19th on the Global Innovation Index ranking by World Intellectual Property Organization, it can do better. Singapore has a quarter of Australia's population and ranks eighth in the world. Singapore has also been churning out world-class start-ups with very successful exits. Two notable exits of late are Viki's US$200 million acquisition by Rakuten and Zopim's $30 million acquisition by Zendesk. As reported by TechinAsia, Zopim received strong support from Singaporean Government grants and investments including the Media Development Authority, SPRING Singapore and the National University of Singapore.
More specifically, here are some Singaporean government initiatives that have been crucial to supporting start-ups and that you should know about:
SPRING - A collection of programs, including ACE, which supports first time entrepreneurs with mentors, networks and funding, and SEEDS, an equity based co-financing option.
MDA i.Jam - Provides fund matching up to S$100,000 by founders or incubators
National Research Fund Technology Incubation Scheme - Co-invests up to 85% of the investment (maximum of S$500,000) by a recommended incubator.
Moreover, Singapore's Government doesn't just throw money to grants. It is also very serious about creating a physical infrastructure for entrepreneurs and start-up support services to co-exist through Block projects. Block-71 was the first government experiment to house start-ups. Originally a dying industrial zone, it has been transformed into a place for entrepreneurs to work and grow together. Singapore now plans to expand the Block projects to three buildings and double the number of companies working in the Blocks from 250 to 500 by the end of the year.
The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) is further ramping up start up support efforts this year with a new acceleration program, an accreditation program to encourage government entities and large enterprises to adopt emerging technologies, and the development of a new fabrication lab to give young people an opportunity to experiment with new hardware electronics and software.
Singapore's government has pumped around S$100 million dollars into its early stage start-ups. This contributes to the extraordinary amount of venture capital funding in Singapore of $1.7 billion last year, a stunning figure when compared to China's $3.46 billion. Australia only had a measly $111 million of venture capital injected last year, a drop of 20% from the previous year. There is even fear that Australia's venture capital industry could disappear altogether if changes flagged in an upcoming tax review take too long to be implemented, according to Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association chief executive Yasser El-Ansary.
Some have criticised the amount of over-reaching involvement by Singapore's Government to artificially spur innovation and entrepreneurship. However, like a professional lead-out-man cyclist in a Tour De France race, the government is carefully carving a path for start-ups and will eventually fall back; after the ecosystem has gained sufficient momentum and money from successful exits have been recycled into the ecosystem to more naturally propel the next generation of start-ups.
Conversely, the Australian Government seems to be retracting prematurely just as Australia's startup environment is heating up. If Australia seriously wants to compete globally, let alone regionally, the government must not diminish the value of its contribution now. Investing into Australian entrepreneurs is an important investment into securing Australia's future.
Ben & Jerry's free cone day is almost here.
On Tuesday, April 4, the ice cream chain will offer customers free ice cream cones at its locations around the world. The annual event is held from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m., and customers can get as many free cones as they're willing to stand online for. “We're not counting. Really, go for it,” the company said on its website.
The first Free Cone Day was in 1979 — one year after co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield launched the Vermont-based company. The tradition has since expanded globally, and Ben & Jerry's says it will hand out more than 1 million free scoops this Tuesday.
To find a store participating in your area, use Ben & Jerry's store locater and check the box that asks to “participate in free cone day.”
Large cuts to police and other services will endanger public safety unless the next government pushes through radical structural reforms to cut back-office costs, Britain's most senior police officer has warned.
Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, writing in the Guardian, gives their sternest warning yet about the potential effects of forthcoming cuts, with police preparing to be told this week of even more to come.
The Metropolitan police commissioner says they expect further reductions in budgets whoever wins the 2015 general election. They argue for reforms including mergers of individual forces, which would rip up the historical landscape of policing, to lessen the potential damage.
“There's a bigger risk to public safety if we don't take radical action,” Hogan-Howe writes, adding: “We've saved hundreds of millions already, but from 2016 onwards it will be much harder.”
In a move that clashes with Conservative party policy, they call for the culling of more than 30 forces in England and Wales, to create nine super-forces, based on the regional boundaries.
They warn that criminals are moving from the “shotgun” robberies of the past to more sophisticated offences involving data and cybercrime, and says that police need to catch up.
Hogan-Howe's intervention comes amid real concern among the leadership of the Yard and London government about the level of cuts proposed, which could result in the capital losing in total one-third of its budget.
Police chiefs across the country fear the scale of the cuts to come could decimate neighbourhood policing, vital to preventing crime. Privately they fear a potential return to “1980s”-style policing, of responding to emergencies and little else.
The commissioner's intervention comes at the start of a dramatic week for policing. On Monday the home secretary, Theresa May, will go before MPs on the home affairs committee, where they will be questioned after the chief of Lincolnshire police last week warned cuts could send their force to the wall.
On Wednesday the Home Office will tell forces about more cuts, with police fearing they will eventually be bigger than the 23% suffered since 2010.
In their article, Hogan-Howe says that others involved in keeping the public safe are also facing large cuts. They write: “Our partners face their own cost pressures, and the big concern is that if we don't work together, with a shared view of the risks, public safety will suffer.”
They set out an argument for reforms, and cites the example of domestic abuse to show how many agencies can be involved in a case: “Society's ability to reduce abuse is much more than a policing issue. It's about a range of agencies – from social services to mental health – having the capacity to intervene early. If we retrench in isolation, the risks to public safety can only increase.”
Hogan-Howe warns that cuts to other public services jeopardise assets the police rely on. They say that police could lose crime-fighting CCTV cameras, which are funded by councils, because local authorities themselves face tough spending cuts: “As they face more cuts there's an active discussion about whether they can afford to keep CCTV going.” The commissioner adds: “We have to have a shared view of the risks to public safety, from countering terrorism to child protection. We need to be transparent about these risks with the public, politicians and the media, so we can together make informed choices about our priorities.”
Police officer numbers in the capital have been kept so far at 32,000, but with new spending cuts to come it is feared these levels may drop.
Hogan-Howe says: “By 2020, the Met police will need to have made some £1.4bn of savings over a decade – about a third of our budget. We've saved hundreds of millions already, but from 2016 onwards it will be much harder.”
Of the £800m of new cuts, the most optimistic private assessment is that the Met can save £400m, leaving it looking for another £400m to save by 2020.
The Met's Scotland Yard headquarters have been sold, and little-used but costly police counters closed, to deal with the first rounds of cuts. But in their autumn statement the chancellor, George Osborne, made clear to police chiefs they would have to find even more savings.
Hence Hogan-Howe sets out a blueprint for reforms, the centrepiece of which is merging the 43 forces in England and Wales. They argue that they would still remain answerable to their local communities and cites Scotland's experience of merging eight forces into one super-force.
They write: “In Scotland, they have survived such a radical transition,” adding that reforms have been introduced successfully in the Netherlands, as well.
The commissioner says it will take “courage” but the benefits would include savings and a faster move to digital policing: “Fewer forces would help us make the vital transition to digital policing. Cybercrime is making the whole notion of jurisdiction less and less meaningful. In the cashless society of 2020, data is the new currency and electronic fraudsters replace the stocking and shotgun robbers of the past.”
Labour are considering the merger of forces, which some believe could produce savings of around 10%. But the Conservatives oppose mergers. Tory insiders say one reason is because MPs from rural constituencies feel their areas would lose out to urban ones, where there is more demand.
But, at the same time, mergers would incur an initial cost, and in a speech in September the home secretary set out their opposition, saying forces could achieve similar savings through collaboration.
Another of Hogan-Howe's bosses, the Conservative Stephen Greenhalgh, who is London's deputy mayor for policing, also dismissed the idea in a thinktank pamphlet in April 2014. However, police chiefs have long been in favour of reducing the number of forces.
Hogan-Howe says that money can be further saved by greater private sector involvement, and the merging of control rooms answering emergency calls for the police, fire and ambulance services in London. The commissioner would have been mindful that warnings from other police chiefs about cuts endangering the public have been dismissed by the government as “shroud waving”.
MONTREAL — It seems no matter what Canadiens forward Alexander Radulov does, he's going to have their detractors.
As one scout in attendance for Montreal's 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals put it, “I've seen this act before.”
The scout was referring to Radulov's one-goal, one-assist performance in the first period and cautioning not to get too excited about it.
“The Canadiens took a smart risk on a one-year deal for this guy, but we'll see what happens as the games get more and more important,” they said.
But you won't get Canadiens fans to temper their enthusiasm after Radulov's dazzling display Tuesday night.
Radulov scored just 4:12 into the game, setting things up in the offensive zone before curling to the front of the net to get their stick on defenceman Greg Pateryn's blistering shot from the point.
Later in the first, Radulov picked up a head of steam in the neutral zone, popped their visor up so they could see better, cut across the offensive zone and feathered a seeing-eye pass to defenceman Nathan Beaulieu who one-timed it behind Capitals goaltender Vitek Vanecek.
Both goals came on the power play.
“He's unbelievable,” said Canadiens forward Andrew Shaw. “He moves the puck well, they see the ice very well, and he's great in all aspects. They made some nice plays and he's not scared to go to the dirty area. They go to the front of the net and they go to the corner and we expect that from them now all season.”
The 30-year-old Russian has said and done all the right things since the opening of training camp. If Tuesday's performance is an indication of what's to come, he'll be a big factor in reviving a power play that's been punchless over the last two seasons.
“He's so confident on the half-wall, and maybe that was something we were missing,” said Beaulieu, who finished with a goal and three assists in the game. “With that confidence, he's almost like [Chicago Blackhawks forward] Patrick Kane. I don't want to compare, but they just calms everything down and they know where guys are.
“It was only their first game and they found chemistry with six guys out there tonight.”
Shaw, who started the game on Radulov's line, also made an impression in their first outing as a Canadien.
At 17:50 of the second period, Shaw took a nasty run at Capitals forward Connor Hobbs. They then fought forward Nathan Walker before they were assessed 30 minutes in penalties — 10 of which came for inciting the fans with histrionic gestures while they punched away at Walker.
“I love it, [Shaw's] my favourite player,” said Beaulieu. “That's also something we were probably missing the last couple of years—a little bit of emotion, and that's something they bring. I absolutely love seeing that and he's instantly a fan favourite just from doing that. … I can guarantee you everyone in this room absolutely loved it.”
The hit on Hobbs, which was deemed a five-minute boarding infraction, got Shaw ejected from the game. It's likely to be reviewed by the NHL's department of player safety, which will assess whether or not supplementary discipline will be necessary.
“It's out of my hands now,” said Shaw. “I just wanted to finish my check. I'm just happy he's okay. My intentions were obviously not to hurt him.”
Hobbs left the ice for the remainder of the second period before returning in the third. They would go on to assist on Washington's second goal of the game.
Neither Radulov nor Shaw are expected to play in Montreal's next exhibition game — which will be against the Ottawa Senators, at the Bell Centre Thursday — though Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty, alternate captain Tomas Plekanec, and 2016 first-round pick Mikhail Sergachev should make their pre-season debuts.
Sergachev returned to the team on Tuesday from an upper-body injury that's kept them out of training camp thus far.
With millions of men forced into uniform and taken away from their homes, it was a conflict with a profound impact on British society.
Now, new research sheds light a little known social phenomenon caused by the First World War, which saw many young couples become engaged without even meeting face to face.
The study shows how tens of thousands of women left at home were encouraged by their local communities to form friendships with soldiers at the front by writing to them. Many of this correspondence swiftly led to marriage.
However, several relationships ended badly, resulting in heartache – and even court cases – for many of those concerned, and the issue prompted concern at high levels of society. One bishop warned against the practice which they said led to “disastrous” consequences.
The research, by Genes Reunited, the family history website, involved a search of its own newspaper archives from the period, to find articles on the issue.

The study shows how publications ran lonely heart adverts from soldiers titled “matrimonials”, where men would attempt to meet women with a view to marrying them.
Several others encouraged schemes involving women writing to soldiers. In 1915 the Manchester Evening News reported that 90,000 women had joined such a scheme whereby each one became “godmother” to an adopted soldier.
The article said the women had received “extravagant letters of gratitude” which “prove the comfort and joy they are able to give”. The scheme was so popular, that there were not enough soldiers and an excess of godmothers.
But in an article in the Cheltenham Chronicle on Christmas Day 1915, Bishop George Frodsham attacked the “well intentioned” encouragements to young women to correspond with soldiers.
They fulminated against “hasty marriage”, which they said had increased “enormously” as a consequence, and which they described as the “deplorable source of much unhappiness”.
They cited a case they knew of a servant girl who, having corresponded with a soldier, asked for four days' leave and returned a married woman. They added that the “danger” also concerned “educated women” who “mistake impulse for love” and marry servicemen “after two or three days' acquaintanceship”.
They said some relationships were ending up in court when they became “intolerable”.
In one such case, reported by the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette in 1916, Alice May Bishop attempted to sue a soldier named Edgar Johnson “for a breach of promise on their part to marry her”. Johnson offered no defence and the jury was left to decide what damages to award them
But some romances did get further than that.
In 1915, the Hull Daily Mail in 1915 told the story of a housemaid called Mary who was able to win the heart of a lonely soldier through sending cigarettes and a bottle of whisky concealed in a cake. The young soldier was so thrilled by their gesture that when on leave they paid Mary a visit and the pair were engaged within 72 hours of first meeting.
A year later, the Coventry Evening Telegraph reported on a "romantic war wedding" between Gunner W. Jones, of the Royal Field Artillery, and Gertrude Henly. After corresponding by letter for some time, they came home for leave and, within three days of the couple meeting, they were wed.
Even towards the end of the war, in July 1918, the issue was still prompting debate. The Liverpool Echo ran an article questioning "should soldiers propose to girls they have not seen?", which suggested such engagements may not lead to happily married life.
But despite the concerns, the letter writing – and subsequent marriages – continued. In 1916, Clara E.D Moleyns wrote in the Woman's World section of the Western Daily Press that the morale of the men in the trenches was being sustained by the “dreams of love”.
They defended “hasty war weddings” from criticisms, adding that it was not anybody's place to decide if they were right or wise because of the “abnormal times”.
The research is one of a number of studies being carried out in advance of the centenary of the war's outbreak, next year.
Rhoda Breakell, from Genes Reunited, said: “We have been doing lots of research into the lives of those left behind during the First World War. The number of marriages that were founded on a simple letter correspondence fascinated us. It is very touching to read about the response from local communities and the lengths they went to, to find companions for those men left lonely on the front line, although these relationships were not agreed with by all.”
It is now two weeks since Donald Trump first tweeted their still-unsubstantiated allegations that Barack Obama tapped their phones during the presidential election campaign. Since then, the chairs of both the Senate and House intelligence committees have said that they don't believe the charge. But the story is now moving on from farce to serious political drama.
Ex-UK ambassador calls White House wiretap claims 'gratuitously damaging' Read more
In an attempt to limit the damage, the president's spokesperson, Sean Spicer, tried to argue that the quotation marks Trump put around the allegations of phone-tapping in some of their tweets on 4 March meant they weren't really serious.
The story took a significant further twist on Thursday when Spicer, speaking from the podium carrying the seal of the president of the United States, repeated an account from a Fox News commentator alleging that, instead of using one of the US agencies, Obama had asked GCHQ in Cheltenham to tap Trump's phones on their behalf.
Anyone with any knowledge of the intelligence world knew the suggestion was absurd. First, the president of the United States does not have the power to order the tapping of anyone's phone. Second, the idea of the British foreign secretary signing a warrant authorising such an intrusion into domestic US politics was unthinkable. GCHQ broke its traditional silence and moved quickly to dismiss the allegation as “utterly ridiculous”. No10 followed suit soon afterwards.
Nonsense it was, but the context was unsettling. Some of the intelligence behind current FBI investigations into contacts between the Trump team and Russian officials, and into the hacking of Democratic party emails, is reported to have come from British sources. Then there is the dossier prepared by a former British intelligence official, Christopher Steele, which itself makes a series of unsubstantiated allegations about Trump's links to Russia.
So London was understandably keen to kill off any suggestion, however nonsensical, that British intelligence agencies had been acting against the new president's interests. The diplomatic machinery began whirring, and the press were briefed that Trump's national security adviser had apologised to their British opposite number. In parallel, the British ambassador spoke directly to Spicer, to ensure that there would be no repetition.
There the story might have ended. But it was given fresh legs when President Trump, at a press conference with Chancellor Merkel on Friday, ducked a question about the veracity of the allegations and said simply that anyone who had an issue with them should talk to Fox News – who promptly issued a statement of their own saying they didn't believe them. Sean Spicer – them again – then denied that any apology had been made, or that the administration had anything to regret.

Senior US figures, including Barack Obama's former national security adviser Susan Rice, have criticised the implication of the US's “closest ally”. They know this is a dangerous game revolving around the pressure on White House officials to substantiate Trump's allegations, the president's famous reluctance to admit mistakes, and their suspicion of intelligence agencies and their product.
Dangerous it is. The intelligence relationship between Britain and America is unique and precious. It is critical to our shared efforts to counterterrorism, Russian aggression, the cyber-attacks of China, the nuclear threat from North Korea and much else. It is based on unquestioned mutual trust, between operatives and politicians on each side of the Atlantic.
That is something both countries have taken for granted since the second world war. Gratuitously damaging it by peddling falsehoods and then doing nothing to set the record straight would be a gift to our enemies they could only dream of. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is heading to Washington this week. They need to make very clear that this is not a game.
​Governments the world over try the same tired old tricks whenever they want to reduce or eliminate those ever-so-troublesome individual liberties. Yelling “Drugs!” unfortunately remains one of the most popular. Russia's Drug Czar is doing some tough talk these days, possibly preparing the populace for some brutal, Soviet-style repression in the name of “cracking down on drugs.”
The Moscow Times. Russia should criminalize drug use, confiscate land used for cannabis cultivation and seal off the Central Asian border to “fight drug trafficking,” according to Viktor Ivanov, head of the Federal Drug Control Service, reports Alexandra Odynova at
Got that? Well you're not gonna believe this. Ivanov, speaking to the State Duma (Russia's legislative body), also welcomed wide-eyed deputies to a deeply bizarre “cautionary exhibit” of wax figures of “prominent drug users” like Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and John Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman.
​Wonder if they also had time to construct “cautionary” wax figures of some other “prominent drug users” — like, oh, for example, President Barack Obama or Walt Disney or Steve Jobs or Carl Sagan or… yeah, you're right. Probably not.
Ivanov wasn't shy in dispensing informative little pseudo-facts. “Today, drugs are a more widespread crime than theft,” Ivanov helpfully told the Duma.
But that wasn't even their best material.
“A drug user can recruit up to 15 people during their or their lifetime,” Ivanov said.
Only 15 or 20? Shit, I can recruit 15 or 20 people before lunch!
Ivanov admitted that they support an idea offered by a deputy to reintroduce the Soviet-era practice of criminalizing drug use. But don't worry; this is going to be a kinder, gentler crackdown, apparently; Ivanov added that users should “have the option” of undergoing treatment instead of serving jail time. (As if it's really just an “option” when the alternative is jail!)
A lot of abandoned land in Russia is used to cultivate cannabis, according to Ivanov. They called for landowners — who often say they are unaware of marijuana growing operations — to be held legally liable when plants are found.
Ivanov also supported a suggestion by helpful deputies to employ students to “destroy cannabis fields.” I'm sure they won't have any trouble finding enthusiastic volunteers for that civic duty! Hell, I'll bet I've personally burned a couple of acres just this year.
Ivanov claimed the current lawsuits drug traffickers, who can freely cross Central Asian borders as long as they hold Russian passports, easily obtainable by former Soviet citizens from the outlying republics under international agreements signed in the 1990s.
“More than 50 percent of the prominent foreign drug traffickers arrested in Russia had Russian passports, which serves as a perfect pass inside the country,” Ivanov claimed.
The Federal Drug Control Service estimates the number of “drug users” in Russia at 2.5 million, with 30,000 dying each year of “drug-related causes.”
Japan's ancient art of bonsai threatened by waning interest among youth
Posted
Masashi Hirao exudes the calm you'd expect of a bonsai master.
They speak softly and appears to glide — not walk — as they move around a bonsai tree with their golden scissors held aloft.
The act absorbs him, their eyes dart from branch to branch as they spin the artwork on its platform, carefully inspecting it from every angle.
"When I first saw a bonsai tree it reminded me instantly of the view and smell of the mountain where I played in Tokushima when I was young. That's how I entered the bonsai world," they say.
At 35, he's one of the youngest masters practising the craft in Japan. They say bonsai could die out unless another generation takes up the enthusiasm for the ancient pastime.
"There are not many young bonsai craftsmen and many bonsai trees are being exported overseas," they say.
"If this condition continues, bonsai will disappear in 30 years and bonsai craftsmen will also disappear."
Mr Hirao decided to meet the problem head on.
They now "performs" bonsai at galleries and festivals in the hope of attracting younger people.
They take an unrefined bonsai tree and changes its shape, turning it into a finished work of art in 30 minutes.
"It's just showing how cool bonsai is and breaking the image of bonsai people have," Mr Hirao says.
They hope their performance will spark an interest and prompt a visit to a bonsai nursery.
"I'm hoping when people come to the bonsai nursery and stand in front of a bonsai tree which doesn't move but is alive and older than they are, they can feel the energy or something that comes out of the tree without saying it in words."
There is evidence that bonsai trees were brought to Japan from China as souvenirs in the 6th century.
Bonsai trees came to adorn the homes of wealthy Japanese people and the "potted trees" became symbolic of Japan.
These days bonsai is seen in Japan as an old man's hobby.
Rumiko Ishida is the curator of the Bonsai Art Museum in Omiya, in western Tokyo.
They say the museum attracts a lot of visitors, but not young Japanese people.
"For Japanese people, many are senior-aged, but many of the foreign visitors are young and they're in their 30s and 40s," Ms Ishida says.
Austen Kosasih is a 26-year-old Melburnian who is in Japan studying an apprenticeship under bonsai master Kunio Kobayashi.
They believe bonsai is lost to Japan and its revival now depends on the rest of the world.
"As we speak, every single day, bonsai masterpieces in Japan are being shipped to the UK, to Europe, to China, to Taiwan. They are losing national treasures on a daily basis because there is a great decline in the hobby," Mr Kosasih says.
"It's sad, but it could be an uprising of a new bonsai generation worldwide, so I'm just hoping that will be the case.
Mr Kosasih runs a bonsai rental business in Melbourne, offering hotels, restaurants and shops the opportunity to rent one of their bonsai trees to adorn their premises.
They hope it also prompts a more general interest in the hobby in Australia.
"I think that the one thing that us Australians have is that we love our DIY — we love it!" they say.
"Bonsai is DIY in essence, if you have a seed that you grow and you spend several generations to create something like this — it's a work of art."
For him, bonsai offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.
"When I'm really in the zone to do bonsai I don't think about anything else. Hours can go by really quick. It's healing, it's meditative, you're so in touch with nature you tend to appreciate a lot of things that you see in your surroundings."

That's not what Android 4.0 looks like. The YouTube icon is just one more relic left over from the old Android, and I'm not a fan of those.
But looking at old Android screenshots today showed me exactly why I feel it's so out of place: the icon's light gray background reminds me of (and, likely, was designed for) an Android that looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/ym4W4.png
A while back, I complained about the design of the YouTube icon, saying that it “doesn't fit in with the general Ice Cream Sandwich theme”. I didn't say why, and so a few people thought it was a baseless complaint.
The leftmost and rightmost buttons in the toolbar aren't centered in their tap areas. This is one of the issues with surrounding the whole area around a button in blue: it requires a more complex layout to ensure it is balanced. Here, it might not be easy to solve this issue without a dead zone in the toolbar; perhaps the blue highlight could be centered even if the tap area is not.
This here is during the “back” transition from the page showing data usage details for a specific app. The issue here is the big gap you can make out between the list and the graph: while the list animates in with a gap between it and the graph, the graph doesn't start moving down to fill that gap until after the back animation completes. This doesn't feel right: the graph should either move down during the back animation, or the list should appear directly underneath the graph and have both move down together afterwards.
Apparently that “Save to” item is to add the video to a playlist. Not sure how you are supposed to find that out in the UI, though: I thought it might even have been about saving the video to the phone itself. Could easily fix this by having it say “Save to playlist” or something similar.
Missing a period/full stop in this alert. Could also be improved by stating why it failed, but that might not always be possible.
Update: Apparently you cannot swipe the music notification off, so the X is required. But why should you not be able to swipe it off? I don't see the benefit in having a separate UI for this one type of notification. And, of course, the pause button does the same thing as the X: stop the music and dismiss the notification.
I can't figure out what the X button is for on the Music notification. Sure, it closes it and stops the music, but so does a sideways swipe on the notification. Why is there an extra button here, when the standard method works just fine?
However, at this point, and even with the check box as shown, that is still disabled. You actually have to tap again to enable auto-loading of images: the check mark, apparently, only means that you tapped to show photos this time (regardless of the text next to it). Incredibly confusing.
This shows the Gmail app, just after tapping to show images in an email. As you can see, it appears that I have now enabled showing images for all emails from this address.
ICS Paper Cuts sucks. </big loud bold font>
Notice I'm not saying I think it sucks, or saying I have issues with the content and misinformation, I'm saying it's crap and you must agree.
Firstly here, I'm not a professional UI designer. I'm not a designer at all, actually. I'm much better at hacking away on some backend low-level code than writing about UIs. But I do like good UI, and while Android 4.0 is a huge step forward from past versions of Android, I have no trouble saying that it has plenty of issues.
I'm going to disagree, of course. (I wouldn't post it here if I thought it was crap.) But, really, wow. I'm not going to force you to agree with me, but I'd at least like you to see my opinions here. Because that's what this blog is: my opinions.
What, exactly, is a “Mediaserver”? Why do I care?
Is it very intuitive in this list? Nope. And that's OK.
Which is exactly what I'm complaining about. At least we agree there. But, to me, as a user with a Galaxy Nexus trying to find how to improve battery life, I'm confused. I'm perfectly fine with a switch that shows all processes here, but I just don't think this is a sane default.
Welcome to widgets
Actually, it takes just two motions here. One tap to open the drawer, another to tap the “Widgets” tab up top there. There's an argument to be made for Paul's suggestion – Google loves swiping left and right now as well – just check out the Android Market. But there definitely could be confusion with that in the app drawer.
That wasn't actually my point, although reading my post I can see how someone might get confused. My issue here is that the launcher's paging involves multiple (in fact, a variable number) of swipes to switch tabs. Nowhere else on Android is this required; everywhere else simply uses one swipe to switch one tab.
Long Button is Long
If your e-mail address was “jerry.hildenbrand@androidcentral.com,” you would. Seeing the full text in a list (you can have more than one Gmail account) comes in handy.
My issue is not that there is text up there filling the whole width, it's that the actual tappable area for the button — the part shown as blue in my screenshot — is too big. I still think this. (I'd actually go as far as to say that the “Recents” shown by pressing there (along with Labels) would do better a level up in the app's hierarchy. Then, you could put search in the upper right (like the Market) and only “New Mail” and “Refresh” at the bottom — fixing Danny Sullivan's issue in the process.)
Twitter is not Android
Dropbox also is not Android
No, but the screenshot I posted is rendered by Android. Twitter doesn't include the Android 2.0 graphical design in their apps, the system supplies it because Twitter hasn't enabled the new design. Backwards compatibility, sure, but Android is still weak in the design space. Now is not the time to sacrifice usability and consistency for slow-moving app developers.
Spelling it out for you
“Siri: What is Wi-Fi direct.” It's also covered in the Android 4.0 platform highlights, where people might look to see the advanced features of their new smartphone. And certainly the people in the store selling you your new phone could tell you. Any of these options is preferable to a multipage description that explains the Wi-Fi direct protocol and its capabilities, don't you think?
Are you really trying to defend “Start Wi-Fi Direct Operation” as the best message that could appear here? Here's a better one, to start: “Enable Wi-Fi Direct communication with other devices? This will disable normal Wi-Fi connections.”
Tabbing with tabs
And he's right – they do look a little different. And he's right – they do look a little different. And we agree […] that we'd like to see a little more consistency between Google apps. But Paul's wrong when they say you can't tap on them to switch tabs. Like on the Widgets tab in the app drawer, we have to wonder if they even bothered to try.
The tap targets are tiny. If you are going to try and tap on them, they should be somewhat taller than half the height of any other UI element, no? But I'm glad you agree that more consistency would be good.
Because that's really all I'm going for here: maybe — since Android is open-source, so even if nobody at Google ever sees this blog — this will make Android better. And that'd be good.
And, not to enter another raging argument, but I think this what John Gruber meant when they said that “you either see it or you don't.” It really doesn't look like Jerry Hildenbrand sees it here.
Note: The District no longer sells tax liens for delinquent tax bills under $1,000. Lien amounts include property taxes, penalties and interest. The District doesn't track legal fees charged to homeowners. The estimates of legal fees is besed on a Post study of more than 200 cases. The foreclosure and court cases are through mid-2013. Source: Data from D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue and D.C. Superior Court
of those foreclosed properties were houses and apartments located mostly in minority neighborhoods
Tax lien foreclosures that have been identified by The Post
If the owner can't pay all tax bills and interest, plus the legal bills and expenses of the investor,
If the tax bill plus interest goes uncollected for six months,
The typical lien amount, just a fraction of the property's value
Property owners in the District risk losing their homes over relatively small amounts in unpaid property taxes. Here's a look at the process:
Families have been forced to borrow or strike payment plans to save their homes.
Others weren't as lucky. Tax lien purchasers have foreclosed on nearly 200 houses since 2005 and are now pressing to take 1,200 more, many owned free and clear by families for generations.
Investors also took storefronts, parking lots and vacant land — about 500 properties in all, or an average of one a week. In dozens of cases, the liens were less than $500.
Coleman, struggling with dementia, was among those who lost a home. Their debt had snowballed to $4,999 — 37 times the original tax bill. Not only did they lose their $197,000 house, but they also are stripped of the equity because tax lien purchasers are entitled to everything, trumping even mortgage companies.
“This is destroying lives,” said Christopher Leinberger, a distinguished scholar and research professor of urban real estate at George Washington University.
Officials at the D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue said that without tax sales, property owners wouldn't feel compelled to pay their bills.
“The tax sale is the last resort. It's also the first resort — it's the only way in the statute to collect debt,” said deputy chief financial officer Stephen Cordi.
But the District, a hotbed for the tax lien industry, has done little to shield its most vulnerable homeowners from unscrupulous operators.
Foreclosures have upended families in some of the city's most distressed neighborhoods. Houses were taken from a housekeeper, a department store clerk, a seamstress and even the estates of dead people. The hardest hit: elderly homeowners, who were often sick or dying when tax lien purchasers seized their houses.
One 65-year-old flower shop owner lost their Northwest Washington home of 40 years after a company from Florida paid their back taxes — $1,025 — and then took the house through foreclosure while they were in hospice, dying of cancer. A 95-year-old church choir leader lost their family home to a Maryland investor over a tax debt of $44.79 while they were struggling with Alzheimer's in a nursing home.
Other cities and states took steps to curb abuses, such as capping the fees, safeguarding houses owned by the elderly or scrapping tax sales altogether and instead collecting the money themselves.
“Where is the justice? They're taking people's lives,” said Beverly Smalls, whose elderly aunt lost their home in Northeast Washington. “It's just not right.”
If this were a one-time thing, an isolated difference of medical opinions, the Orioles' decision to run from free-agent closer Grant Balfour would be easy to dismiss.
Alas, it is not a one-time thing, but a pattern dating back 15 years. And for the Orioles, a team that already is at a crossroads, the Balfour fiasco could not have come at a worse time.
The Orioles need to win soon, before their two years of club control expire on a pair of Scott Boras clients, catcher Matt Wieters and first baseman Chris Davis. In case you missed it, Boras' combined $283 million deals for free-agent outfielders Jacoby Ellsbury and Shin-Soo Choo only reinforce why the agent prefers their clients to hit the open market.
Article continues below ...
So here are the Orioles, needing to make a push after falling from 93 wins in 2012 to 85 in '13. Yet, all they have done so far is trade closer Jim Johnson and lose right-hander Scott Feldman and outfielder Nate McLouth to free agency while signing reliever Ryan Webb and acquiring outfielder David Lough.
Balfour was to replace Johnson, just as Lough will replace McLouth. But Balfour, who agreed to a relatively club-friendly, two-year, $15 million contract, did not meet the approval of the Orioles' doctors. Or owner Peter Angelos. Or some unidentified Jedi master who can detect flaws in MRIs that no one else can decipher.
Two doctors with other clubs, both of whom have a history with Balfour, publicly challenged the Orioles' findings. Orioles general manager Dan Duquette countered by saying that medical opinions vary from doctor to doctor, processes vary from team to team.
Well, tell that to Balfour, whose position in the marketplace is now damaged. Tell that to other free agents, who surely will take note of the Orioles' conduct.
Perhaps closer Fernando Rodney and outfielder Nelson Cruz will join the Orioles, anyway; money talks, and the O's are now under pressure to make moves. Which could be problematic for a team that hasn't signed a free agent for more than $12 million since 2007.
The O's are not unwilling to spend – since 2009, they've awarded extensions to right fielder Nick Markakis, second baseman Brian Roberts, shortstop J.J. Hardy and center fielder Adam Jones ranging from $22.5 million to $85.5 million.
The O's also are not unwilling to acquire players from outside their organization – Jones arrived in a trade, as did Davis, Hardy and others, while left-hander Wei-Yin Chen joined the club as a free agent from Japan.
Major-league free agency, though, is usually not the Orioles' thing. And if you're Rodney, Cruz or any other free agent the O's are considering, the dispute over Balfour's physical should give you pause – the same way the Marlins give players pause when they refuse to grant no-trade clauses.
The Marlins will trade any player at any time, no matter what they say publicly or tell the player privately. The Orioles will quash deals by citing problems in a player's physical, and sometimes the problems are not really problems at all.
foxsports Rosenthal: The next big free agent
Which is not to say the O's are always wrong.
Angelos landed a better, more durable player when they backed off Will Clark due to medical concerns in 1993 and signed Rafael Palmeiro. And their hypersensitivity to injuries only grew after the O's signed reliever Xavier Hernandez to a two-year, $2.5 million contract in ‘98, then learned from Hernandez's physical that the pitcher had a torn rotator cuff.
Gulp.
Angelos voided the deal; Hernandez filed a grievance, negotiated a $1.75 million settlement and never pitched again. After that, baseball advised teams to perform physicals on players before announcing their signings. Which is how the term, “pending a physical,” entered the baseball lexicon.
The attention to detail makes sense, considering all the money that is at stake. Except, as the Balfour example shows, the Orioles under Angelos occasionally get carried away.
“That's how Peter plays general manager,” said Braves GM Frank Wren, who signed Hernandez as Orioles' GM and was fired after one season, in a 2006 interview with the New York Times. “He uses medical reasons to kill or change a deal if they don't like it.”
Consider what happened in Jan. 2000, when the O's reached agreement with right-hander Aaron Sele on a four-year, $29 million contract. Sele's physical turned up issues in their labrum. The Orioles tried to alter their contract. Sele responded by signing a two-year deal with the Mariners.
That's how Peter plays general manager. They use medical reasons to kill or change a deal if they don't like it. Braves GM Frank Wren
Then-Mariners GM Pat Gillick – who previously had battled with Angelos while working for the Orioles – chortled that Sele was “like a star falling out of the sky.” Sele got the last laugh, too, going 32-15 with a 4.05 ERA in their two years with the M's and pitching six more years after that.
Since then, the Orioles have lost or altered deals with outfielder Jeromy Burnitz in 2006 and right-hander Jair Jurrjens in '12 due to medical-related issues. They also got nothing out of Japanese left-hander Tsuyoshi Wada, who underwent Tommy John surgery and never pitched in the majors after signing a two-year, $8.15 million contract in Dec. 2011.
Angelos likely seethed over the money wasted on Wada. Perhaps they asked their physicians to apply greater scrutiny to Balfour, who turns 36 on Dec. 30. But after the matter went public, the Baltimore Sun reported that the Orioles' concern was with Balfour's right shoulder, information that likely came from the club. Never mind that Balfour is coming off two excellent seasons with the Athletics, and hasn't been on the disabled list with arm trouble since undergoing elbow and shoulder surgeries in 2005.
The Red Sox, by contrast, operated with much greater confidentiality last offseason after learning from a physical that first baseman Mike Napoli was suffering from avascular necrosis in both hips. The two sides eventually reduced Napoli's deal from three years, $39 million to one year, $5 million, but without public rancor.
Balfour figures to come out of this OK, though maybe not with $15 million guaranteed; they told MLB Network Radio on Sunday that four teams are interested in them and at least one has made an offer. They still may file a grievance in conjunction with the players' union, sources say, charging that the Orioles operated in bad faith.
A mere difference in medical opinions? Perhaps. But this got public, and it got ugly, and it wasn't a one-time thing.
The Orioles need to be signing free agents, not alienating them. Balfour, though, can draw inspiration from Sele. The team that just rejected them has been wrong before.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel made a bet with the St. Louis mayor over the National League division series between the Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals. However, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay turned down the wager.
If the Cubs lost, Slay would have won Harry Caray's chicken vesuvio, Lou Malnati's pizza, Eli's Cheesecake as well as tickets to the Willis Tower Skydeck.
“In the long and storied history of this rivalry, the Cubs and Cardinals have never met in the postseason. This series will be one to remember, and I wouldn't bet against this Cubs team,” Mayor Emanuel said in a statement.
“I have full confidence that when the dust settles on this series Chicago will fly the W, and I'll be enjoying whatever St. Louis has to offer,” the statement continued.
However, Slay rejected the bet, saying that they wouldn't waste their staff's time by arranging bets around sports, according to NESN. They also added: “Plus, it isn't fair to other mayors.”
ERBIL, Kurdistan Region (Kurdistan24) - The Ankara-appointed governor of the city of Sirnak banned this week a Kurdish song prepared by the opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) for its 'no' campaign to extending Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's powers in an upcoming referendum on April 16.
A written request made by the chief of the police in the province to the Governor Ali Ihsan Su said that the song "Bêjin Na" or "Say No" was against the first three articles of the Turkish Constitution and was "creating enmity among people."
HDP, Turkey's second largest opposition party whose co-leaders Selahattin Demirtas, Figen Yuksekdag as well as ten other lawmakers remain in prison, is a leading force behind the 'no' campaign to consolidate Erdoğan's rule along the Republican People's Party (CHP).
A copy of the governor's decision seen by Kurdistan24 Diyarbakir Bureau said HDP's song was violating "the wholeness" of the Turkish state, homeland, and nation, stating the sole official language was Turkish.
Among the lyrics in the song are slogans "No to one flag, no to one nation and no to one language," references to phrases often used by President Erdoğan.
The police claimed the song could cause public unrest as well as a "clear and near threat" within Sirnak provincial borders.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Turkish governor's office in the city of Van followed suit and declared a ban on HDP's song.
Police in Van confiscated at least one vehicle that was playing the song on loudspeakers, reported Kurdish Dihaber news agency.
In the coastal Aegean Turkish city of Izmir too, a bus used for HDP campaign was stopped and confiscated by police for playing the song, as the driver received a 15 thousand Turkish liras (4,127 USD) fine.

The migrant crisis was one of the underlying themes of the speech, as Niinistö contemplated its repercussions for Finland and urged the public to restrain from extreme acts.
“I will refer to an old saying that has not lost its topicality: when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Immigration can never mean that our core values – democracy, equality and human rights – are questioned,” President Sauli Niinistö stated in their New Year's Speech.
“I am an old-school lawyer. Throwing a petrol bomb into a building with people inside used to be called arson and that is what it remains in my mind; a serious offence – as is the persecution of refugees or incitement to hatred. We have witnessed too much of that,” Niinistö said.
“Not all of the arrivals are here with good intentions. Some come from a terrorist background and others have committed other bad deeds. The backgrounds and deeds of a select few arouse unwarranted misgivings about all immigrants,” they continued.
The President urged authorities to report about such deeds and their consequences openly, regardless of whether the perpetrator was an immigrant or native-born Finn. “This will help contain rising emotions and shoot down the wildest rumours,” they explained.
Finns, they affirmed, are not generally attracted to extreme ideas.
Niinistö estimated that the migrant crisis has taken Europe by surprise, despite the fact that people have been crossing the Mediterranean Sea in makeshift boats for years.
They also mulled over the motives of the migrants and the ability of the destination countries to welcome all of the arrivals. “While some are fleeing danger, others are seeking a better life – both of these are natural, human motives. Another factor underlying the displacement of people is exploitation, which can even be utilised as a means of power politics,” they analysed.
“The world is home to untold numbers of people who would like to come here, but our capacity to take care of them is limited. I believe [Stefan] Löfven, the Swedish Prime Minister, hit the nail on the head by saying that we have been too naive. Sweden, similarly to many other countries, has tightened its immigration laws. I have interpreted the decisions of the Finnish Government as an attempt to secure resources to help those in most need. We are therefore only able to help those arriving because of persecution.”
Niinistö ended their speech on a positive note.
“There are plenty of problems, but also plenty to take comfort in: for example, the increasing willingness to help. Volunteering among asylum seekers or helping your loved ones on a daily basis – this is what will lift the spirits of those receiving help and those helping as well as benefit each and everyone of us!” they said.
The President also expressed their support for the attempts to improve the price competitiveness of domestic industries.

Samsung fans are looking forward to just one more flagship handset for this year before they start concerning themselves with what the company has in store for them next year. The Galaxy Note 6 will be launched in a couple of months and then it's the long wait to early next year when we see the first new flagships from the company. It appears that Samsung is going to launch five new Galaxy flagship smartphones in 2017.
The five new flagships will include the Galaxy S8, the Galaxy S8 edge, the Galaxy Note 7, the Galaxy Note 7 edge, as well as the Galaxy X. The first four flagships are said to use a 2.5K resolution Super AMOLED display with an RBG subpixel arrangement. The Galaxy X is going to be Samsung's foldable smartphone and is going to feature a 4K display with diamond PenTile subpixel arrangement. It was almost a year ago when we reported that Samsung was working on Project Valley, its foldable smartphone, and recent reports out of Korea suggest that this handset might finally be launched in 2017.
It's believed that this device will easily be foldable in half, like a wallet, making it much easier to carry it in a pocket. Samsung already has several patents for technology that will be used inside a foldable smartphone so it's not really going to be surprising when it eventually comes out with one.
Tunisia's parliament has approved a unity government led by the secular Nidaa Tounes party and including its Islamist rivals, in the latest step in its transition to full democracy following a 2011 uprising.
The cabinet headed by Prime Minister Habib Essid, which includes members of their secularist Nidaa Tounes party and Ennahda, was approved on Thursday by 166 members of the 217-seat parliament.
Thirty members opposed while eight abstained, as Essid, whose cabinet includes ministers from four parties, promised "work and nothing but work" on the country's economic and security problems.
Parliament speaker Mohamed Ennaceur welcomed what they called "a comfortable majority" in the vote of confidence.
Essid's earlier attempt to form a government consisting of just their Nidaa Tounes party and one other party was scrapped after it became clear it would lose the vote of confidence.
It is the first government to be formed after the North African country's first free presidential and parliamentary elections last year.
Example of democracy
Nidaa Tounes, the winner of parliamentary elections last October, holds six portfolios, including the foreign ministry, while the interior, defence and justice portfolios go to independents.
Ennahda takes the labour ministry and three secretary of state posts.
Al Jazeera's Nazannine Moshiri, reporting from Tunis, said: "The main two parties in the country are now in government, and also the two other smaller parties which are quiet popular here, that has weakened the opposition and a lot of people are saying this is almosty like a one party state.
"At the same time most Tunisians want this new government, whoever it includes, to get on with the job of solving problems of its country which include the economy, the joblessness and social problems which led to the revolution in the first place and the new additional problems of the last four years which deals with security".
Moshiri also said that Tunisians see this as an example of democracy, the fact that parliament actually has agreed on this coalition government going forward.
Tunisians overthrew their dictator in 2011 and the ensuing four years of transition have been stormy.

There's a classic episode of The Little Rascals where one of the gang can't join everybody else on the ballfield because they have to stay home with their younger brother, who has the croup. "I can't come out and play," they whine. "I've got to stay home and grease Wheezer!" Nobody at Geffen Records knows whether this was the inspiration in naming Weezer, but it makes sense. Like many of their peers, the members of the Los Angeles quartet seem to have spent their formative years in front of the TV; when they were a little older, they were just as entranced by college rock. Finally, ala the Rascals, one of the gang said, "Hey, kids, let's put on a show!," and the result is Weezer's uplifting, unpretentious, and extremely endearing debut.
The self-titled Weezer is lean and mean at 10 short, punchy tunes, but nearly every one is powered by a larger-than-life chorus or a simple but effective lyric. "Undone-The Sweater Song" uses an unraveling sweater as a metaphor for a relationship on the rocks; "Buddy Holly" pays heartfelt tribute to the '50s rocker, and "In the Garage" paints a scene of suburban teens jamming while surrounded by posters of Kiss.

Las Vegas (CNN) In addition to their frequent forays into casinos and gun shops, Las Vegas strip killer Stephen Paddock took 20 cruises, many of them in Europe and the Middle East, investigators have learned.

The cruises included stops at ports in Spain, Italy, Greece, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, according to information provided by a law enforcement source who asked not to be identified because the source was not authorized to share information about the investigation. Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley , accompanied them on nine of the cruises.
The information provided by the source did not specify the cruise line involved, the type of cruises, when they occurred or the couple's reason for travel. Most cruise ships have casinos on board, and Paddock was an avid gambler.
Investigators have taken note of the foreign travel as they attempt to piece together a profile of the mass killer and a timeline of their activities leading up to the attack that left at least 58 people dead and nearly 500 injured.

Image caption Trained Dorset Wildlife Trust volunteers and staff are laying humane traps with peanuts as bait
Badgers are being vaccinated by a wildlife charity to show "a safe and humane" alternative to recent culls.
Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT) is treating badgers on its nature reserves to tackle the spread of Bovine TB.
It claims vaccinations are more effective in controlling TB than culls.
The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it already funded vaccination projects but culling was needed in areas like Dorset where TB was "endemic".
Badgers 'unharmed'
DWT raised funds for a five-year vaccination programme "to both protect badgers and support farmers".
Trained DWT volunteers and staff lay humane traps with peanuts as bait and released the badgers "unharmed as quickly as possible".
Image caption All vaccinated badgers are sprayed with non-toxic paint to prevent duplicate vaccinations
It comes after two government-led pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire, killing badgers in what Environment Secretary Owen Paterson called a "safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers".
But DWT chief executive Simon Cripps, claimed there were "more effective and reliable ways of controlling the disease, such as better biosecurity, badger vaccination and, in the long term, cattle vaccination".
They added culling would increase the transfer risk of Bovine TB from infected to healthy badgers and cattle.
A Defra spokesperson said: "We already fund vaccination programmes, but alone they won't solve our TB problem because vaccination does nothing for already infected badgers.
"We must do everything we can to tackle the disease.
"Scientific evidence shows that culling badgers in areas where disease is widespread helps reduce cases of TB in cattle."
The reason for this video is because I am so impressed by how much faster Fedora 20 is than the version that replaces. I don't mean that does a faster compiling, but you can actually run a compiled and do some animation rendering, while at the same time do something else, something normal, like browsing internet or watching a movie.
And the fantastic thing is that you won't even notice that you run a couple of heavy processes on background. I didn't run any games, for obvious reasons!
Again, I just compare Fedora 20 with Fedora 19 and other distros like Arch or Gentoo might be faster. Fedora 20 boots faster (~1sec), launches apps faster but the most impressive thing, it's Fedora's amazing responsiveness.
There is explanation, why Fedora 20 is faster than 19, but I got no time to write about :(
Unfortunately when I started to record the video with Shell embedded desktop recorder, everything became noticeable slower. I got so much disappointed that I was thinking to skip this demo, but instead I just made a very “handy” screecasting.
Firefox opens with 1.5x speed, just to save some time!
Paul Walker youtube isn't an accident. I love Paul Walker and their movies and I will really miss him. I wanted to put a title like “Fedora 20 is Fast and Furious” like a small tribute to their memory, but some times people seem to take things wrong.
By the way, if you want to increase the speed of Fedora and any other Systemd distro, you can check this post.
Andhra Pradesh's cuisine is known as one of the spiciest in India. And yes, it is true!! This region is famous for its fiery hot food and super spicy pickles. And we totally love it I still remember my first meal at a small hotel in Hyderabad when we had just moved into the city. It was a little late at night and we had been out sight-seeing. We spotted a small hotel and went n for our dinner. There were only plated meals available and we said yes to that. The waiter got us the food and it looked delicious. We were starving. My mom mixed up some rice and dal and fed me. My dad started eating their food simultaneously. After about 30 seconds our faces were RED and I'm sure there was smoke coming out of my nose and ears!! The food was super duper spicy!! We called in the waiter and asked them if they had some ghee or yogurt to coll us off. The answer was no. And then, I have no idea how much water we drank!!!!! We ended up eating plain white rice for dinner as it was too late to go anywhere else!! Such was my first encounter with Hyderabadi cuisine.
But over the years, I have grown to love the food. There are some uniquely Hyderabadi dishes that have gained popularity all over India. Biryani of course tops that list. Next is chicken 65 or the veggie version Mushroom 65. Then there is Gobhi 65, baby corn 65 and aloo 65!! Why 65??? I swear I have no idea!!! All these are yummy dry appetizers and we order them every time we go to a restaurant in India. A lot of people confuse the 65's with Manchurian. But they are a tad different. In an authentic 65 recipes, we don't use soy sauce or chilli sauce. Instead green chillies, red chilli powder, coriander powder and curry leaves are used for flavor. It has a very distinct south Indian flavor because of the curry leaves. I don't get curry leaves here, so I have omitted that and used some spring onions and cilantro instead.
Mushroom 65 is supposed to be spicy! But if you cannot take the heat, reduce the no. of green chillies and omit the red chilli powder and hot sauce. I used cremini mushrooms (baby portabella) to make this today because I like them a lot and I think they are firmer than regular mushrooms. But you can definetly use white mushrooms also.
Ingredients:
Serves 2-3
Mushrooms – 8 oz (250 gms)
For the batter:
All purpose flour (maida) – 3/4 cup
Corn flour or Corn Starch – 1/4 cup
Pepper powder (white or black) – 1/2 tsp
Red chilli powder – 1/2 to 1 tsp
Coriander powder – 1 tsp
Ajinomoto – a pinch (optional)
Salt – to taste
Water – 1/4 cup (maybe a little more)
For the sauce:
Onion – 1 small (chopped)
Green Chilli/Serrano pepper – 8-10 no. (or as many as you can handle)
Red Chilli powder – 1 tsp (optional)
Hot sauce (I use Sriracha) – 1 Tbsp (optional)
Curry leaves – 1 sprig
Garlic – 3 Tbsp (chopped)
Ginger – 2 tsp (chopped)
Yogurt – 1/4 cup
Salt – to taste
Coriander powder – 1 Tbsp
Ajinomoto – 1/4 tsp (optional)
Orange food color – 1/4 tsp (optional)
Oil – for deep frying
Method:
Gently wipe the mushrooms with a wet cloth and clean them. Cut them into quarters, along with the stem.
Heat oil for deep frying.
In a bowl, mix together all the ingredients mentioned for the batter. Adjust salt to taste. The batter should be rather thick. You only want to coat the mushrooms lightly.
Drop all the mushrooms in the batter and toss gently to coat evenly.
Deep fry the all the mushroom pieces for 3-4 minutes on medium high heat until golden brown. Drain on paper napkins.
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan. Add the chopped ginger, garlic and the green chillies. Sauté for 30 seconds. Then add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook until the onions are softened.
Mix in the coriander powder, ajinomoto and red chilli powder and sauté for 30 seconds. The add the yogurt, orange food color, hot sauce and salt to taste. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the fried mushrooms and toss to coat all the mushrooms in the masala. Cook on medium high heat for 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms absorb all the masala and becomes dry.
Serve immediately!
Bullpen help remains a primary need for the Nationals in what has been a rather quiet offseason in terms of pitching additions, and Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports reports that the Nats are still discussing potential David Robertson trades with the White Sox. Adding Robertson, who is controlled for another two seasons at a total of $25MM, would provide the Nats with an experienced arm to shut down games and also give manager Dusty Baker some much-needed depth.
The problem in talks is somewhat familiar for the Nationals, per Rosenthal, as the team's ownership is reluctant to take on all of the remaining money on Robertson's contract. Beyond that, after parting with Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning to acquire the remaining five years of control over Adam Eaton, the Nats' front office isn't keen on surrendering top-tier prospects.
That Robertson is coming off their worst season since 2010 can't make the Nationals any more eager to part with premium young talent. While the 31-year-old (32 in April) maintained their continually impressive strikeout rate (10.8 K/9) and saw their ground-ball rate rebound after a dip in 2015, Robertson averaged an uncharacteristic 4.6 walks per nine innings pitched. Robertson's fastball velocity was consistent with their career marks, though, and they once again avoided spending any time on the disabled list, so there's perhaps reason to hope that 2016's control issues were a blip on the radar.
As it stands right now, Shawn Kelley and Blake Treinen are poised to be the two primary right-handers at the back of the Washington bullpen. They'll be joined by left-handers Sammy Solis and Oliver Perez, with the remaining three spots somewhat up for grabs. Young right-handers Trevor Gott, A.J. Cole, Koda Glover, Austin Adams and Jimmy Cordero will all be in the mix for spots, as will more seasoned non-roster invitees Joe Nathan, Vance Worley, Jeremy Guthrie and Jacob Turner.
There are plenty of options for the Nationals at present, but there's little in terms of certainty beyond the top few members of the relief corps. And, of course, it should be noted that Kelley's season ended in frightening fashion, as an arm injury forced them from Game 5 of the National League Division Series. Both player and team expressed optimism in the following days that the injury was not serious, but that type of injury for any pitcher — let alone one that already has two Tommy John surgeries under their belt — is troubling nonetheless.
If the Nationals want to pursue other avenues to acquire late-inning help, those options have dwindled over the course of the winter. Sergio Romo and Joe Blanton are the top remaining right-handed relievers on the market (though Romo may be wrapping up a deal with the Dodgers), while the majority of the other trade options come with similar caveats to Robertson.
New teams joined the NA LCS with the new franchise system, but several teams disappeared as well. Most players and coaches moved to other NA LCS teams or to other regions, but some retired or took on a new challenge in different areas.
Former Team EnVyUs head coach Kim “viOLet” Dong-hwan, is one of those challenge seekers. From Warcraft 3 to Starcraft 2, and then to a coach of League of Legends, their eSports career was full of ups and downs. Now, viOLet will be taking on a new challenge as an assistant coach of Team EnVyUs in the Overwatch scene.
RELATED: LCK Commentator CloudTemplar: "I want to invest everything I have into League. I want to be a part of it until the very end."
Their life was like a roller coaster. It was hard for them to approach the eSports scene in the first place because they lived on the far south island of Korea, Jejudo, and their parents disapproved of them being a professional player. When they had their debut as a Warcraft 3 player, they had to do part time jobs to earn the money to buy a plane ticket, without their parents knowing. When they at last became a professional player, their house caught fire and they had to consider retirement, but they were able to continue to pursue their career with the help of a friend.
After Warcraft 3 lost its popularity, viOLet switched to Starcraft 2, but the poor environment of the gaming house caused some health troubles. While they were recovering back at home, a decent offer came from the US, and they were able to play there. However, they went through a lot of distress with visa problems for nearly a whole year. The owner of Team EnVyUs is said to be fond of the dramatic story of viOLet's life: having good results even under the difficult circumstances.
They have been in the States for six years. Six years could be short, or long. What did they feel during their stay in America? The first thing viOLet mentioned was the difference in the eSports fans. They felt that if the fans of Korea were just watching, seeing how the players play, the NA fans actually cheer on the teams like their own, enthusiastically. They were in awe after seeing a large man wearing a shirt with a game character printed on it, cheering for the players.
“Sometimes fans came and consoled me when I was down after a loss. After that, I thought that I should be better, for the fans. It was an experience that I haven't had in Korea. I talked to many other players who play in the US about this matter and they all agreed.”
When viOLet switched their career from a Starcraft 2 player to League coach, the fans were one of the main reasons. They started to think seriously about teaching somebody after seeing a father teaching their child about the game.
“I was worried about what to do after retirement, and my team, EnVyUs, approved of my career and said ‘The players like you and you know a lot about living in the US. What do you think about being a coach for our LoL team?' It was a challenge that I wanted to take, so I said yes without hesitating.”
Clearly, being a coach of a different game couldn't have been easy. However, they played a lot of LoL while they were a Starcraft 2 player, and while interacting with the players of Azubu Frost/Blaze, their former team, they achieved a higher level of knowledge in the game, which gave viOLet enough confidence to be a coach.
“It's not that I teach the players what to do within the game just because I'm the coach. I know that the players know better because I was a professional player myself. So I mainly did the things outside of the game, and concentrated on analyzing the opponents. Most of the problems the players had were problems that I'd already experienced while playing in a foreign country.”
Their career as a coach started from the summer split of 2017. However, before and after Worlds, many teams with big sponsors started to join, along with the flow of franchising. In this process, small teams or teams with insufficient money were squeezed out. Team Envy wasn't very good and avoided relegation narrowly, only to be pushed out from the new franchising system. Coach viOLet was very regretful about that.
“As a person who is working in the eSports scene, the growth of the scene is very welcome. But we were the direct victims of that. I still like LoL and I wanted to produce good results with the players, but we were finished without having a second chance. I had just got to know about how everything worked around here, but it's over now.”
Coach viOLet was regretful that they aren't able to show much during their time as a coach, but they were proud of making improvements after being in last place. They didn't have a whole lot of time to gain the full trust of the players, but they said they were still in close touch with the players, like Nam “LirA” Tae-yoo, who moved to Clutch Gaming of the Houston Rockets.
Now they are about to have a whole new start in the Overwatch League; viOLet is very eager to help the enthusiastic players, and bring about some good results. They thanked the fans who always support them to end the interview.
“I think there are many people who don't know me because Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 were games that were popular to only a small portion of the eSports fans. I don't think that many people will read my interview article (Laughs). What I want to say is that now the eSports scene in Korea is growing, and many Korean players get famous in foreign leagues. This is of course because of the players' passion, but also because of all the fans who are always supporting them. I want to thank all the eSports fans who give such generous support.”
When you think of playing board games in a group, it's likely to be a boisterous affair with plenty of laughter, interaction and fun. But what if I told you that real serious board gaming action takes place in complete silence, thanks to the cerebral nature of some games, where your time is best spent on strategizing and less socialising?
These games are deep and are often won by the more skilled player. If that or playing boardgames in a library sounds good to you then to these games, you must say: ”Welcome silence, my old friend”.
Five Tribes by Days of Wonder is a game of the Tales of Arabian Nights with Genies, Viziers and so on but the selling point of it and these other games is their strategic gameplay, not their themes. The game plays up to 4 players and is simple, you pick up, however, many meeples (that small person-shaped figure used as your player's token) are on a tile and you must move that many spaces dropping one meeple on each tile you pass without going back on tiles you passed before.

When you place the last meeple on a tile, you get the benefit of that tile and the colour of meeple you last placed. For example, if the last meeple you placed was on a market tile and was a red meeple, you will first collect all the red meeples on that tile, then buy something from the market after which you would use the red assassin's ability to kill a meeple on the board or a player owns. Also, if you remove all meeples on a tile, you claim it as your own with your camel.
This all sounds simple and it is but the consequences of every move is deep as every move you make either sets up or hinders your opponents and the puzzle changes after every player's move.
Thus the word heard most during Five Tribes is usually a long “hmmm”.
Splendor is one of those games which you do not hear much about but if you attended boardgame meetups in the last year, you probably have seen Splendor being played at some point. This is because it is easy to learn, plays fast and is highly strategic for such a short game. In a turn, you basically collect gems or purchase/build cards. The built cards either produce a gem of a certain type or are worth a certain number of points. You keep doing this till one person reaches 15 points and then after everyone has had equal turns. The round ends and the person with the most points wins the game.
The game is one for silent thinkers because the end condition is dependent on player actions. Do you target the cheap mines for massive production later on or get early mines that already have points on them. Also, the information on built cards are open to all, so you can actively take steps to take cards your opponent needs though this comes at a cost to your production line. A highly versatile game that fits a large spectrum of gamers and is definitely worth a try.
There are many abstract games and many of them are played in silence like Chess due to the perfect information aspect of such games.

The unique thing about Onitama by Arcane Wonders for 2 players is its simple rules, short play time and a presentation that looks fun/cute enough that most people are willing to give it a try.
The rules are that out of 16 cards, only 5 are used per game. Each player gets 2 cards and when a player uses a move, they then proceeds to take the move that is available to be collected in the middle of the board to the right. Whoever takes an enemy master or get their master to the opponents shrine space wins. The limited moves per game make it a strategic challenge. Great as a 2 player game for both advanced gamers and as an introduction to new players. I must add to any collection if constant thought is something you like in a game.
Istanbul sees you as a merchant house trying to become the richest in the land. Not the most unique of themes but that is not the reason you will play Istanbul. You start the game with all your assistants together and during your turn, you can move 1 or 2 tiles and where you choose to land you have to drop off one of your assistants and then you get to do the action on that tile. It is that simple.
If you want to move into a spot with another merchant, you have to pay that player 2 coins. This and a modular board makes the game an ever-changing puzzle from game to game. For example, do you go for a sure thing like buying gems directly or do you try taking risks by rolling the dice? It's a game that doesn't take very long to play yet gives the feeling that skill has triumphed over luck.
When I first started board gaming seriously in Singapore around 2011-2012, the first big Euro (strategy focused games) game that I often heard about was Terra Mystica and to this day I still see it getting played quite often in 2016. It is the most complex game in this article and there is too much to even explain how the game works in summary. Simply put you are terraforming the land to your races favoured terrain and trying to populate the world with your people by using magic and so on. The person with the most points wins. It is the many different core mechanics that makes the game. Gameplay is a very tight and one mistake could set you back turn of work. You're often thinking so hard that social chatter tends to take a backseat.
For a Euro game, the interaction in the game is actually decent. There are benefits to being next to other players or you could just to block their expansion. The game is colourful, has a tonne of strategic depth and has multiple ways to play the game with double sided player board, each side with a different race. If you don't mind the calm of silence for 2-3 hours as you stress over the most efficient way to earn more points, then welcome to Terra Mystica.

To better understand female dominance in the binturong, we examined adult sex steroids in relation to volatile urinary chemicals; through these efforts, we provide novel information about this species' reproductive physiology and chemical communication. Our endocrine findings lead us to suspect that the display of female dominance during the intersexual interactions of binturongs may owe to female size advantage, coupled potentially with estrogen-mediated male deference. Our chemical analyses contribute to identifying 2-AP as a putative semiochemical—one that explains the binturong's popcorn aroma—and also point to a significant role for volatile urinary compounds, possibly under hormonal mediation, in the communication of species identity, individual sex, and reproductive state.
Across vertebrate taxa, males and females typically have greater circulating concentrations of androgens and estrogens, respectively (Drea 2009). Nonetheless, in some female-dominant species, androgen concentrations in females can be raised (Drea 2007; Petty and Drea 2015), potentially reflecting physiological “masculinization” (Drea 2009), such that the hormonal sex difference is reduced, absent, or even reversed (Glickman et al. 1992; Koren et al. 2006; Davies et al. unpublished data). Yet, for the female-dominant binturong, the reduction in sex difference was observed, not in androgens, but in estrogens. Although binturongs evidenced the typical mammalian sex differences in androgens, with males having greater abundances of A 4 and T than females, we could find no discernible sex difference in circulating E 2 concentrations. That male binturongs showed relatively high concentrations of circulating E 2 perhaps implicates male deference, more so than androgen-mediated female aggression, in this species' intersexual interactions.
Because estrogens have been studied primarily in the context of female reproduction, their role in mediating adult male behavior remains underappreciated. When estrogens in adult males have been examined, they often have been linked to declining reproductive function, including decreased sperm counts and unsuccessful sexual behavior (Toppari et al. 1996; Bjerselius et al. 2001), or to increased paternal care (Wynne-Edwards 2001). Nonetheless, the males of some species (Equus ferus: Raeside 1979; Bono et al. 1982; Rangifer tarandus: Bubenik et al. 1997), including various female-dominant lemurs (Lemur and Eulemur spp.: Petty 2015), maintain normal reproductive function while also expressing raised estrogen concentrations. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of behavioral and reproductive endocrinology, including female dominance (and perhaps the male's unusual genital anatomy), will require continued comparative research into the function of “heterologous hormones” in both sexes, specifically of androgens in females and estrogens in males.
With regard to chemical signaling in the binturong, both sexes possess perineal scent glands (Pocock 1915; Story 1945), the secretions of which predominantly contain carboxylic acids (Weldon et al. 2000) that neither explain the binturong's distinctive popcorn aroma nor encode the signaler's sex. By contrast, binturong urine contained a richer array of volatiles that likely encode reproductively relevant information. Notably, as the only compound expressed by all binturongs, 2-AP may serve as a species identifier. Because it is partly responsible for the characteristic smell of popped corn (Schieberle 1991) and aromatic rice (e.g., jasmine or basmati: Buttery et al. 1982, 1983; Yoshihashi 2002), 2-AP likely explains the binturong's signature scent. In only one other carnivore, the tiger (P. tigris), has 2-AP been suggested to be a putative semiochemical (Brahmachary et al. 1990; Brahmachary 1996), although there are anecdotal reports of other carnivores producing a similar, but less intense, aroma (particularly from their feet). Given that the synthesis of 2-AP has been thoroughly investigated in the context of food preparation (Bradbury et al. 2008), it is important to note that we detected no 2-AP in the binturongs' commercially prepared diet. It also occurs in only small amounts in mouse urine (Kwak et al. 2008, 2013). The diet provided to binturongs in captivity could potentially contribute to four other urinary compounds we detected, including acetic acid, 2-heptanone, benzaldehyde, and nonanal; however, these are common components of carnivore urine and are therefore likely to also be endogenously derived (Andersen and Vulpius 1999; Zhang et al. 2005; Burger et al. 2006; Wood et al. 2009).
Male binturongs had a greater number of volatile compounds in their urine than did females, and many of these compounds, including 2-AP, also occurred in greater abundance in males than in females. Such sex differences are consistent across a broad range of vertebrate taxa (Müller-Schwarze 2006; Drea 2015). Likewise, several of the male-specific compounds reported herein are sex specific in other species (see, for example, Table 3 in delBarco‐Trillo et al. 2011). These traditional male biases in compound richness and abundance, coupled with the strong sex specificity of certain compounds, suggest that binturong urinary cues provide redundant information about the signaler's sex. Nevertheless, the direction of these biases contrast with patterns evident in the scent secretions of other female-dominant species, in which female chemical richness can exceed that of males (Scordato et al. 2007; Boulet et al. 2009; delBarco-Trillo et al. 2012). Thus, as with their endocrine patterns, binturongs also differ from other female-dominant species in terms of their sex differences in the chemical composition of their scent signatures.
Lastly, in the context of reproductive function, the positive relation across sexes between 2-AP and the prohormone A 4 is consistent with hormonal mediation of binturong scent signals. Because A 4 is the immediate precursor in the biosynthesis of both testosterone and estrone, there also may be a role for urinary signaling of reproductive state in both male and female binturongs.
Chemical communication has been considered to be particularly relevant for solitary species because, unlike visual and vocal signals, olfactory signals are long lasting and can convey information in the absence of the signaler (Alberts 1992). Beyond safely signaling territorial boundaries (i.e., without the need for social interaction or confrontation), enduring chemical cues may be critical for advertising sex or reproductive state in solitary species. We nevertheless have limited appreciation for the tenacity of specific compounds or blends of compounds under natural environmental conditions because the chemical decay of odorants has been examined in only a few studies. In mice, for instance, proteins excreted in urine function to prolong signal availability (Hurst et al. 1998). In bull elephants (Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus) undergoing musth, certain alcohols and ketones can increase in concentration as olfactory signals age (Goodwin et al. 2012). That certain compounds may be increasingly detectable after samples have been exposed, over time, to ambient temperatures may implicate bacterial regulation of chemical information (Alberts 1992; Archie and Theis 2011; Goodwin et al. 2012; Ezenwa and Williams 2014). The age of an odorant can also influence how signal receivers perceive information. In ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), for example, males preferentially sniff fresh odorants, but preferentially lick decayed odorants, potentially indicating their respective assessment of ephemeral, volatile components versus long-lasting, non-volatile components (Greene et al. 2016).
Although ultra-rapid and portable GC analyzers (e.g., the zNose®) offer the possibility of measuring chemical change in natural environments (Staples and Viswanathan 2005), studying odorant decay or persistence can present logistical challenges, including if freezing differentially affects certain compounds (Hoffmann et al. 2009) or interrupts bacterial fermentation. We used the difference in shipping duration to serendipitously examine the effects of decay on the volatile composition of binturong urine. Fewer than half of the original compounds remained in equal relative abundances after samples underwent a thaw. Whereas the “lost” components may have signaled relevant information immediately after deposition, those components that persisted might be considered candidate semiochemicals in long-term communication (i.e., in the absence of the signaler: Alberts 1992).
Several key compounds persisted in “decayed” binturong urine, including 2-AP. Although somewhat unstable in isolation, 2-AP is relatively stable in dilute liquids (Buttery et al. 1983) such as urine (Kwak et al. 2013); however, given (a) the high temperatures needed to synthesize 2-AP via the Maillard reaction, (b) the minimal likelihood that 2-AP at the concentrations we observed derived from the few mice in the binturong's diet, and (c) the absence of 2-AP from the binturong's commercial diet, we lack an understanding of how binturongs (or other mammals) produce this compound. One possibility is that symbiotic bacteria produce 2-AP during normal fermentation processes in the gut. Indeed, Bacillus cereus has been shown to synthesize 2-AP without a Maillard reaction (Romanczyk et al. 1995; Adams and De Kimpe 2007) and is a common microbe found in vertebrate intestinal systems (Swiecicka 2008). In future studies, it would be interesting to determine if this bacterium inhabits the gastro-intestinal tracts of binturongs or other carnivores and if it can readily synthesize 2-AP. 2-AP's longevity, post urinary deposition, might be further explained by slow-release carrier proteins or continued microbial synthesis.
Future behavioral studies could help resolve if female dominance in binturongs is mediated by female aggression or, as is possibly suggested by adult male endocrine profiles, by male deference. Indeed, for the binturong and most other species, the role of heterologous hormones in regulating sociality and reproduction remains poorly understood. Research programs focused on the role of androgens in females have revealed insights about female masculinization (Glickman et al. 1992; Drea 2009; Petty and Drea 2015; Davies et al. unpublished data); however, the role of estrogens in regulating normal male behavior also may be relevant. Our study of an underrepresented species has led to identifying 2-AP as a putative semiochemical, one that has rarely been attributed a role in mammalian communication (Brahmachary 1996), but that may be more widespread in carnivores than previously recognized. This unusual compound highlights the fact that we lack understanding of the processes by which many of the chemicals that function in mammalian olfactory communication are produced, namely, whether they are synthesized by mammalian tissues or produced by symbiotic bacteria as part of routine metabolism. Ultimately, linking chemical communication to reproductive function in unusual species will contribute to a broader understanding of social evolution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) today confirmed two previously reported Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases in Saudi Arabia, both of them fatal, as media reports suggested that concern about the virus has helped reduce the flow of Hajj pilgrims to Mecca.
The WHO said two men who lived in the Riyadh area, ages 55 and 78, fell ill at the end of September and died early this month. They were reported to have had no contact with other known MERS-CoV case-patients.
The details in the WHO statement match up with information from a translated Oct 10 announcement from the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH).
The two cases raise the WHO's MERS-CoV count to 138 cases and 60 deaths. Other agencies and groups, however, list slightly higher numbers.
WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl said via Twitter today that two other reported fatal cases are still awaiting confirmation. They made the comment in response to a question from the infectious-disease message board FluTrackers, which maintains a list of MERS-CoV cases.
The FluTrackers list currently shows 143 cases and 62 deaths. It notes that that it includes two Italian cases that the WHO dropped from its own list in September after reclassifying them.
Meanwhile, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in its weekly Communicable Disease Threats Report today, listed a MERS-CoV count of 141 cases with 62 deaths. It said Saudi Arabia reported two new cases in the week that ended Oct 10 and has logged a total of 119 cases with 51 deaths.
As for the Hajj, now under way, Saudi Arabia's interior minister said the number of foreign pilgrims is 1,379,531, down 21% from last year's 1.75 million, according to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) report today.
The minister did not give a number for Saudis participating in the Hajj, but Saudi numbers are believed to be only half what they were a year ago, the story said. It said the government cut the quota for foreign pilgrims by 20% this year because of both MERS-CoV concerns and massive projects to expand the capacity of Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Saudi Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabia told reporters 2 days ago that no MERS cases have been detected so far among pilgrims. The WHO's Hartl said in their Twitter post that one case was found in a pilgrim, but it was not recent.
The Saudi MOH has recommended that elderly people, pregnant women, children, and people with chronic diseases or immune deficiency not attend the Hajj this year.

Marijuana advocates lit up with glee last week as the U.S. House voted to step back and leave medical cannabis laws up to the states. After failing numerous times, getting the bill cleared through the House is like winning the jack pot for pro-marijuana legislators. The proposed bill would prohibit the federal government from interfering with state medical pot laws.
The legislation smoked through the Republican-dominated House with a 218-189 vote in favor of the bill Friday. The bill's suprising majority vote represents increasingly joint views about federal oversight of state medical marijuana laws between Democrats and Republicans. The vote also reflects public opinion. The ratio of Americans in favor of medical marijuana is high at 73 percent, according to a Pew Research study.

But medical cannabis supporters aren't exhaling quite yet—the bill has not hit the Senate floor, so things are still a little hazy until then.
Twenty-two states and Washington, D.C. have already enacted laws legalizing marijuana for medical purposes. Florida, Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania are in the process of rolling out legislation. The criterion for a person to be prescribed a medical marijuana card varies in strictness from state-to-state. Minnesota, for instance, as one of the most conservative medical cannabis states, limits marijuana perscriptions to pill, vapor, and oil forms (aka you can't smoke it) and restricts prescriptions to patients suffering from severe illnesses. California, on the other hand, is more liberal, allowing patients to carry up to 8 ounces of leaf form and has a much broader definition of cannabis-qualifying illnesses.
The House proposed legislation would not apply to Colorado or Washington where recreational marijuana is legalized.
As the bill heads to Senate and the medical marijuana debate continues, here are some states to follow:
•Minnesota- Minnesota became the 22nd state to legalize medical marijuana just last week. The state has one of the strictest medical marijuana laws (ProCon's super useful chart compares the laws, fees, and possession limits) and advocates are already pushing to expand the laws.

•New York- A proposal to approve medical marijuana cleared the Senate Health Committee in May. If it clears the Senate Budget Committee then it will head to a full Senate and could get passed in June.
•South Carolina– South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley signed in legislation on June 2 allowing children with severe epilepsy to be prescribed a non-psychoactive oil form of marijuana.
•Florida- Florida legislators approved the “Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014'' in early May, allowing for “non-euphoric'' marijuana prescriptions for patients with severe epilepsy. Residents will cast votes on broader marijuana legislation in November.
Hope you didn't get too burnt out from all those puns. I was on fire though, right?
A man has been charged with assaulting a protester at Donald Trump's Fayetteville, North Carolina, rally Wednesday night.
John McGraw, 78, of Linden was arrested Thursday morning after assaulting Rakeem Jones, who had been protesting at the event. Jones was being escorted out by law enforcement when videos show McGraw punching him.
Jones told MSNBC that their right eye is “swollen and bruised” as a result of the punch.
“I was there, but it didn't seem real” until they saw videos of the incident Wednesday morning, they added.

An internal investigation of the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office is also underway, according to a press release, but further public comment cannot be made under NC law. McGraw is set to appear before court on April 6, 2016. The show “Inside Edition” spoke to McGraw after they punched Jones.
“Yes, they deserved it,” McGraw said in an interview. “The next time we see him, we might have to kill him. We don't know who they are. They might be with a terrorist organization.”
Hope Hicks, a spokesperson for Trump, told NBC News “we are not involved,” in the incident.
Protests have become part of the bedrock at Trump rallies, and the candidate themselves has at times fostered a toxic environment around them at their events.
Their reactions range from yelling “get them out” to saying they love protesters because it forces the press to show the crowd. At times, they have expressed this entire range of emotions in just a matter of minutes if there are multiple protests.
But some of their reactions have been less innocuous. At a Las Vegas rally just before the Nevada caucus, Trump responded to a protester's interruption by saying they wanted to punch the man in the face.
At another rally in Iowa, they promised to pay the legal fees of supporters who “knock the crap out” of protesters who may appear at the rally. The GOP frontrunner also often speaks about the “old days” when they say law enforcement was allowed to be tougher with interrupters.
The frequency of protests and sheer number of protesters has seen an uptick in recent months. In New Orleans on the eve of the Louisiana primary, a group of 20-25 protesters affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement were aggressively escorted out of the event, along with multiple other protesters who spoke out at various points in the rally.
Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton responded to the incident Thursday, calling it “repugnant.”
This kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns—we should encourage respect, not violence. https://t.co/reqTlYTRHv — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 10, 2016
News about the protester assault comes as the Trump campaign is under fire for another altercation, this one between a Breitbart reporter and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. An audio recording of the incident, which allegedly happened after a press conference in Jupiter, Florida on Tuesday evening, records the reporter, Michelle Fields, and Ben Terris of the Washington Post reacting to a man grabbing Fields and pulling them down. According to Fields and Terris, that man was Lewandowski.
The Trump campaign, however, denies that this happened, instead attacking Field's credibility. “The accusation,” Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks wrote in an emailed statement, “is entirely false. As one of dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident. This individual has never met Corey, nor had the only reporter that supposedly identified him.”
The statement goes on to say attack Fields personally, a sentiment echoed in multiple tweets by Lewandowski: “This person claims they do not want to be part of the news, and only report it, however if that was the case, any concerns, however unfounded they may be, should have been voiced directly first and not via Twitter, especially since no other outlet or reporter witnessed or questioned anything that transpired that evening. We leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents, but on multiple occasions they have become part of the news story as opposed to reporting it. Recall they also claimed to have been beaten by a New York City Police officer with a baton.”

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has long accused the Palestinian movement Hamas of arming and training Syrian rebels fighting against their rule following the March 2011 uprising, inspired by the Arab Spring.
In a recent interview with the Swedish newspaper Expressen, Assad went as far as to charge that Hamas "supports al-Nusra Front", the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, echoing - ironically - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who likened the Palestinian movement to the Islamic State (IS).
For its part, the Palestinian movement has repeatedly denied any military involvement in the Syrian conflict, despite siding politically with the popular uprising against Assad, and hailing "the heroic people of Syria who are striving for freedom, democracy and reform".
Hamas had maintained that its leaders left Damascus to avoid being drawn into the Syrian conflict, following failed attempts by the Syrian government to portray the Palestinian movement as being on Assad's side.
Hamas also recently denied any links to Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis, a Palestinian armed group battling against pro-Assad forces - as well as against IS militants - in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus.
However, last week Syrian rebels from Ahrar al-Sham group said they had sought and received advice from Palestinians in Gaza on how to maintain tunnels used to fight pro-government forces in the Idlib countryside.
'Our brothers in Gaza'
Abu Musaab, a leader in Ahrar al-Sham, told the pro-uprising satellite television station Orient News that the Syrian militant group received tutorial videos from Gazans showing them how to repair collapsing tunnels.
"The ground here became damp and began to fall on us…and some of our youth were trapped inside. So we spoke to those with expertise, our brothers in Gaza, may God reward their good deeds," Abu Musaab was quoted as saying.
"We consulted them regarding the problem and they advised us to bring in wood (plates), sending us video segment showing us how they do it and we replicated that," Abu Musaab added.
Their announcement was reported in a number of Arabic websites, including both pro and anti-Assad outlets, but with the addition that the Palestinians in question were members of Hamas, even though the Syrian rebel did not specifically name them.
It is not the first time that such suggestions were made. In April 2013, the London Times newspaper, citing unnamed Western diplomatic sources in contact with the Syrian government and opposition, claimed that the armed wing of Hamas, Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, were training rebel units belonging to Free Syrian Army.
The Times report, whose content was denied by Hamas, also alleged that the Palestinian movement had been aiding the Syrian opposition with tunnel digging, which are used to launch attacks on government forces.
And in June 2013, the pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper reported that "sources close to Hezbollah and the Syrian regime claim that Hamas had a role to play in the battles of Qusayr, [where tunnels] … had been dug using small Iranian devices that Hezbollah had transferred to Hamas."
"Some of the explosives, they added, were found to contain electronic chips that Hamas had acquired from Iran and Hezbollah," the Lebanese paper said.
Ex-Qassam members
However, testimonies from inside Syria point to the involvement of former members of Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, who are not only no longer working with Hamas but also have become critical of the Palestinian movement over its participation in politics and indirect ceasefire agreements with Israel.
"There are Palestinians from Gaza, who have split from Hamas or from smaller militant groups [but not from Islamic Jihad] and are fighting in Syria. They have special expertise in tunnel digging or rocket making," Ibrahim Khader, a Palestinian journalist covering the conflict in Syria, told MEE.
"These Palestinians are not in Gaza, but from Gaza. I know them in person and I have spoken with them; they are Palestinians who have split from the resistance movement (in Gaza) to go to Syria," added Khader, who is a frequent freelance contributor to MEE.
Khader said the former Qassam members, who do not wish to be identified, had been "giving their expertise to what they perceive as Islamic factions in Syria, and not to Ahrar al-Sham alone".
"They (former Qassam members) have helped the Syrian rebels with tunnel digging as the Syrians' experience with the collapsing tunnels is limited," said Khader, adding that they had also "taught the Syrians how to develop Grad-like long-distance rockets."
According to Khader's estimate, the total number of Palestinians who have joined the Syrian rebels from Gaza does not exceed 200, but, they add, most of them are highly experienced in military skills, including making explosives.
They have been trained by Qassam members, some of whom could have been coached militarily by Iran or Hezbollah, which would explain why the Lebanese movement might have suspected the participation of Hamas in the fighting alongside the Syrian rebels.
"Today Hamas is in a tough spot. It made moves towards reviving ties with Iran and Hezbollah but they (Tehran and the Lebanese movement) have responded with coolness, demanding a high political price," said Khader.
"Hamas is asked to publicly back Assad," said Khader, adding that such a U-turn could not be contemplated by the Palestinian movement, which wants its "stances to be based on principles, not opportunism".
"Besides," Khader said, "the vast majority of people in Gaza are with the Syrian uprising, save a minority of leftists and some others who switch sides to what benefits them at any given moment."
'Both are fighting against tyranny'
MEE has sought to obtain clarifications from the Syrian rebels in Idlib countryside with regards to the affiliation of the Palestinians who have helped with the tunnels, but has so far been unsuccessful in reaching them.
However, Emad Karkas, a Syrian journalist in Idlib, told MEE that the general view amongst critics of Assad is that the Palestinian cause and the Syrian one overlap, "as both are fighting against tyranny".
Assad had been using the suffering of the Palestinian people for political gains, to "shield them from criticism" with regards to their inaction towards Israel as it continues to occupy the Golan Heights for over 40 years, while also utilising their cause to serve as distraction regarding "the persecution of the people," said Karkas.
"After the (March 2011) revolution of dignity, the regime has not shied away from oppressing the Palestinians (in Syria) … shelling them, besieging them and starving them," Karkas added.
The view from the Assad camp is radically different. To them, they are still supporting "the resistance" against Israel, despite "the betrayal of Hamas". They maintain that even as recent as last summer, Syrian weapons were used by Hamas to counter Israel's Operation Protective Edge, a claim denied by the Palestinian movement.
A 16-year-old has been charged with homicide and a firearms count in the death of another teen who was found in their home Wednesday
Authorities say a western Pennsylvania teenager charged in the shooting death of another teen took a “selfie” with the body and sent it to a friend on social media.
The 16-year-old boy is charged with homicide and a firearms count in the death of 16-year-old Ryan Mangan, who was found on Wednesday evening in their Jeannette home.
Police were contacted by the mother of another boy who said they had received a photo showing the suspect with the victim after he'd been shot, and also received text messages from the suspect saying “Told you I cleaned up the shells” and “Ryan was not the last one.”
Westmoreland County district attorney John Peck told the Pittsburgh Tribune Review that the photo “was a key piece of evidence that led investigators to the defendant”.
That was a brilliantly original idea you came up with. But, wait—where's my wallet?
The Dark Side of Creativity: Original Thinkers Can Be More Dishonest is the title of a provocative paper published precisely one year ago. Francesca Gino of Harvard Business School and Dan Ariely of Duke University presented evidence that highly creative people are more likely to engage in unethical activities, apparently because they are better at finding ways to justify such behavior.
While those who value creativity conceded the logic of that equation, many were reluctant to embrace that uncomfortable conclusion. But newly published research confirms those results, and adds a twist.
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
In a study conducted by a research team led by psychologist Melanie Beaussart of California State University, San Bernardino, people who behaved ethically also scored lower in creativity. What's more, creativity scores were also poor among participants who considered themselves ethical—whether or not that perception fit with their actual behavior.
“The implications of these and other related findings challenge the prevailing idea of creativity as a benevolent construct,” Beaussart and their colleagues write in the journal Thinking Skills and Creativity.
Their study featured 566 people, all college students who participated for extra credit. They first performed an abbreviated version of the Remote Associates Test, in which they were given three words (such as "falling," "actor" and "dust") and asked to come up with one word that tied them all together (in this case, "star").

Participants were given 15 minutes to solve 15 such items, all of which required creative thinking. They then filled out a survey assessing their integrity, rating the likelihood they would, among other things, be “trusted to keep secrets,” or “lie to get myself out of trouble.”
Afterwards, they received a “thank you for participating” message, which was quickly supplanted by a fake “error” message that told them the study was not quite over. At that point, they could either continue to answer questions or, due to the “computer glitch,” declare they were finished and receive the extra credit without having actually completed the test.
“We found that people who passed the behavioral test of integrity were no different than those who failed the test when it came to their score on the self-described measure of integrity,” the researchers write. “Self-perceptions of morality were not related to actual honest behavior.”
However, self-perceptions of morality were related to creativity scores. While creativity was significantly higher in the group that cheated (confirming those previous results), it was significantly lower among people who rated themselves as high in integrity, whether or not they actually cheated.
This is, of course, one small study in a still-emerging field. But it suggests that creativity is dampened if you're an actual honest person, or if you falsely perceive yourself as an honest person.
It all brings to mind Oscar Wilde's assertion that, for someone whose driving force is aesthetics, ethics become less important. Perhaps creativity is boosted when you give yourself license to explore all your options—whether or not they follow traditional moral rules.
Though there are already plenty of instructables that cover this topic, I thought my list wouldn't be complete without including the simplest way to get clean, healthy hair. No soap required!
No Poo Shampoo Ingredients:
1 tsp Baking soda
Apple cider vinegar
4 oz Water
Put 1 tsp baking soda in a cup or mug to take into the shower with you.
In another cup, pour about 1 oz (~1/ 8 cup) apple cider vinegar.
When you get into the shower, fill the baking soda cup with about 1/ 4 c water.
Apply this to your roots only; work it in and let it sit for a minute.
Then begin to gently scrub your scalp, stimulating blood flow and cleaning out your pores.
This will actually stimulate hair growth.
Lastly, scrub the back of your skull and your temples/sideburns. This will result in less grease and more growth.
Rinse!
Follow by adding about 1/ 4 c water to your vinegar cup.
Pour the apple cider vinegar over the ends of your hair, let it sit for a minute and then rinse it out.
No 'Poo Troubleshooting
There may be a transition period from two weeks to two months depending on the person. Here are a few tips:
If your hair becomes frizzy, try using less baking soda or leaving it on for a shorter period of time. Adding honey may also help.
If your hair becomes greasy, try using less apple cider vinegar, switching to lemon or lime juice, leaving out the honey, and/or using a comb instead of a brush. Also, make sure youre applying the apple cider vinegar just to the ends of your hair.
If your scalp itches, try the following essential oils; tea tree, lavender, rosemary. If your hair becomes dry, try a tiny bit of oil (any oil, I use olive) smoothed on bottom of hair.
Have fun and enjoy!
Tyler Burton tries out an M&P 15-22 Sport rifle at the Smith & Wesson booth at the 2016 National Shooting Sports Foundation's Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show. Ethan Miller/Getty Smith & Wesson on Thursday reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings that crushed analysts' expectations, and the company raised its full-year guidance.
The gunmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 and revenue totaling $207 million. Analysts had forecast that it earned $0.54 in adjusted EPS, and revenue of $198.3 million, according to Bloomberg.
"We believe that higher revenue was driven by strong consumer demand as reflected in adjusted background checks from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) as well as our own market share gains," said CEO James Debney in the earnings release.
The company said it expects fiscal-2017 EPS in a range of $2.38 to $2.48, up from a range of $1.83 to $1.03, and topping analysts' projection for $1.91.
Smith & Wesson was expected to report better-than-expected results on higher gun sales following increased talk about gun control. The mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando in June, the deadliest in US history, helped stoke concerns that guns may be harder to buy if tougher laws are passed.
Sturm, Ruger & Co. CEO Michael Fifer said during that gunmaker's earnings call that they hoped "freedom-loving Americans" took action in support of the Second Amendment, which grants the right to bear arms. The company pledged to donate $2 to the National Rifle Association for every gun it sold.
Smith & Wesson shares have gained 33% this year. They rose 3% after-hours.
The U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has announced up to $220 million in new funding for a consortium of DOE national laboratories and partners to support critical research and development over the next three years to help modernize our nation's electrical power grid. The secretary also announced the release of DOE's comprehensive new Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP), a blueprint for the Department's research, development, and demonstration agenda to enable a modernized grid. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will be strongly supporting this effort, bringing its unique array of experts and resources together to participate in 48 of the 88 awarded projects announced today.
"Modernizing the U.S. electrical grid is essential to reducing carbon emissions, creating safeguards against attacks on our infrastructure, and keeping the lights on," Secretary Moniz said at the announcement. "Our Quadrennial Energy Review and Quadrennial Technology Review identified needs and opportunities to invest in the grid. This public-private partnership between our National Laboratories, industry, academia, and state and local government agencies will help us further strengthen our ongoing efforts to improve our electrical infrastructure so that it is prepared to respond to the nation's energy needs for decades to come."
The Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium (GMLC) involves 14 DOE National Laboratories and dozens of industry, academia, and state and local government agency partners across the country. The new research funding announced today is being awarded in response to a challenge by DOE to the National Laboratories to establish, through the GMLC, a comprehensive grid-related research and development effort to address a range of emerging challenges and opportunities in the nation's power grid.
"Our 21st century economy needs a modernized grid," said NREL Associate Laboratory Director Bryan Hannegan and co-chair of the GMLC. "The Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium is a new way of efficiently leveraging the strengths and capabilities of America's national laboratories to deploy new concepts and technologies that will make the grid cleaner, more productive, and more secure. The projects announced today are an important first step towards achieving the DOE vision of a modernized grid for the nation."
DOE's Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) and National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), both located at NREL, will be key facilities for developing new technologies and serving as a testing center for the deployment of grid technologies. ESIF and the NWTC house a powerful collection of state-of-the-art capabilities that support the development, evaluation, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies.
A full list of projects, participating laboratories and partners, and more information on the Grid Modernization Initiative are available at energy.gov/doe-grid-modernization-laboratory-consortium-gmlc-awards. Some of the outcomes of these projects will include:
A national network of laboratory facilities for use in testing and validation of emerging grid-related technologies and systems.
New common standards and test procedures to ensure that emerging grid technologies can communicate with one another and work together to provide energy services to customers.
New decision support tools for integrated planning and operation of distributed energy technologies, such as solar, demand response, and smart consumer appliances.
Advances in grid design and planning tools to take into account the increasing number of emerging technologies being deployed on the grid in homes, businesses, and communities.
Optimal approaches for integration of wind turbines, solar PV systems, smart buildings, electric and fuel cell vehicles, and hydrogen technologies into a modernized grid.
A new testbed for development of advanced distribution management systems that will allow grid operators to more effectively utilize grid assets, increase resilience and reliability, and enable a wider choice of energy services for consumers.

Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley is confident that manager Rafael Benítez will extend their stay at Newcaslte United after offering them £50.00 worth of Sports Direct shop credit.
The Magpies will take to the field in the Championship next season, and a drop in level might convince the Spanish boss that their future lies somewhere other than St. James' Park.
Speaking in the wake of Newcastle's last game of the season, Ashley said: ‘Look, the transfer dealings are quite to bit to offer. If it weren't for Graham Carr we wouldn't have made such great signings like Emmanuel Rivière and Gabriel Obertan. Plus Graham gets us all free tickets to their son's stand up. I know, right?!'
Benitez has refused to commit themselves to a cause outside the top flight so far, but they did say: ‘I will have to think about this offer in depth, whilst I am very much enjoying my time here, and enjoying such sights as the Tyne Bridge and scantily clad ladies at night who I have been assured aren't actually prostitutes, I can't forget that the last pair of tracksuit bottoms I got from Sports Direct ripped in the crotch after 2 nights'.
Ashley, however, still feels positive over the club's future, adding: ‘Hey, you never know – if we come straight back up and Aleksandar Mitrović grows a ponytail we might get £32 million for him. That's a lot of dead stock'.
Newcastle fans remain hopeful that Benítez will decide to stay, as the thought of Ashley's second choice – Hull City's Steve Bruce – is just too unbearable to even think about.
QMx is shedding light on its eagerly awaited upcoming product, the U.S.S. Enterprise XCV-330. The U.S.S. Enterprise XCV-330, with its distinctive ring-shaped engines, is a starship of myth, seen only as an illustration or painting -- until now. QMx will, late next month, present a very limited edition of this supposed precursor to the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701. According to the latest QMx newsletter, the team at QMx FX Cinema Arts -- the in-house artisan prop and model shop -- was asked to illustrate the history of starflight in the new Star Trek timeline for Star Trek Into Darkness.
"The 14 filming miniatures we created can be seen stretching across the credenza in Admiral Marcus' office, starting with the Wright Flyer and ending with the U.S.S. Vengeance," notes the QMx newsletter. "In the History of Starflight collection, the XCV-330 fills the role of Earth's first sub-light, interplanetary and interstellar space vehicle."
The new version of this historic starship will be for sale in a limited edition of just 25 starting November 29. Why that date? Quite appropriately, it's Black Friday.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Joe Girardi didn't baptize Freddy Garcia as a member of the Yankees rotation yesterday. But the manager left very little to the imagination by talking glowingly of the veteran right-hander.
“Freddy, as much as anyone, we have a pretty good idea of what they can do,'' Girardi said before the Yankees and Braves tied, 5-5 in 10 innings at Champion Stadium.
Considering Phil Hughes has met all criteria given them during the offseason, they are the solid bet to be Girardi's No. 3 starter.
Including Garcia in the group of five leaves Ivan Nova, who pitches in a minor league game today, and Michael Pineda, who goes tomorrow against the Phillies, for the final spot after CC Sabathia and Hiroki Kuroda take the first two spots.
Nova and Pineda, both right-handers, have one year of big league experience each and that doesn't compare with Garcia's 11-plus seasons.
“When you look at a guy who doesn't have a lot of time, you are trying to consider the upside of what you can possibly give because they don't have the same track record as Freddy,'' Girardi said. “You have a good understanding of what Freddy is going to give you.''
Garcia, who went 12-8 with a 3.62 ERA in 26 games (25 starts) last year, long ago gave up trying to over-power hitters. These days they throw five pitches and doesn't push speed guns into the mid-90s. However, Girardi has noticed a spike in the 35-year-old's fastball that they believe will help the off-speed stuff.
“His velocity is up a little bit and that is not something I would have expected,'' Girardi said of Garcia, whose fastball hovered in the high-80s a year ago. “I think it will help all their pitches because there is a bigger discrepancy.''
So what becomes of the odd man out? They can land in the pen, but if it's Pineda there is no reason for them to be a long man while attempting to build arm strength needed to throw more than 90-mph fastballs consistently.
If Nova is the winner, Pineda could start the season in the minors. That might shock some because Jesus Montero's potential power bat was sacrificed to land the 23-year-old Pineda but it's clear Pineda's arm strength — which is what spring training is for building — hasn't arrived.
If it's Pineda, Nova could be a long man in the pen or in the minors after winning 16 games as a rookie last year.
“We could do that [long reliever] and some of the guys we could send down,'' Girardi said. “That's the worst part of this, that somebody is going to be disappointed. But they have to get over their disappointment to help this team.''
Girardi said there is a possibility their decision could be relayed to the players involved as soon as Saturday after watching Nova today and Pineda tomorrow. It's a decision that has been difficult for the manager.
“The other times we were searching for the five starters,'' Girardi said. “This year, we have six quality guys for five spots.''
While Girardi said “probably'' when asked if this was the toughest personnel decision of their managerial career, Andy Pettitte could provide a more difficult problem if they are ready in early May and the five starters are pitching well.
As for Garcia, the unknown of Nova and Pineda are being measured against Garcia's track record.
“You are trying to envision what they can give you, the amount of innings they can give you and continue to improve,'' Girardi said of the young right-handers. “You look at Freddy's year last year and it was really good. And for a guy who is not supposed to pitch well in spring training they have pitched well (1-1; 2.92 ERA in four starts).''
Well enough to leave the final spot to Nova or Pineda.

A serving soldier was arrested on suspicion of drink driving after two teenage girls died after being struck by a car while out running.
The crash happened on Queen's Avenue in Aldershot, Hampshire, just after 19:10 GMT on Tuesday. Police said the girls were hit by a black Ford Focus.
The girls were named as 16-year-old Stacey Burrows, from Farnborough, and 17-year-old Lucy Pygott.
Police said the 24-year-old suspect was released on bail until February.

In a statement, Lucy's family said they were "an absolute joy to us and we feel lucky that they have been part of our family for 17 years".
The teenagers were members of Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club (AFD).
Lucy was this year's England Under-20 3,000m champion and European Youth Championships bronze medallist.
Stacey was the Hampshire Under-17 3,000m champion.
Their most recent successes came at the Saucony English Cross Country Relay Championships in Mansfield on Saturday.
Officers said the man arrested was held on suspicion of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of careless driving while unfit through drink or drugs.
A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson confirmed a fatal collision occurred in the "Aldershot Garrison" and that a soldier was held by Hampshire Police.
They added: "It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."

AFD team-mates who visited the crash scene to leave flowers said the girls were long-distance cross-country runners and were doing a warm-up run at the start of their training session.
Hannah Jacobs, 18, said: "They were very committed and motivated athletes, it's so tragic what has happened."

Tributes were paid from the world of athletics.
Niels de Vos, chief executive of UK Athletics, said: "All at UK Athletics send our deepest sympathies, this is a tragedy which will be felt across the athletics community."
Dozens of tributes were also been left on social networking websites.
European Championship bronze medal winner Steph Twell wrote on Twitter: "Start each day with a grateful heart. Saddened by such tragic news at AFD last night. My love goes out to the girls' families and community."

Also writing on Twitter, Olympian Eilish Mccolgan said: "Awful news coming from Aldershot this morning. Thoughts go out to family, friends and fellow team-mates at AFD."
Simon Jarvis, principal of Farnborough Sixth Form College, confirmed the two girls were students there. They said counsellors had been brought in to support pupils and staff and books of remembrance and condolence were being opened.
Specialist officers are providing support to the teenagers' families.
This week we're beginning a series of blog posts that will focus on some of our favourite illustrators, their lives and their works. This is a chance to learn more about who illustrated your favourite books, the influences that shaped their art style and storytelling, and some of their lesser known projects.
We begin with a firm favourite among kids and adults alike, a relative newcomer to the scene but one whose books have already become classics. It's the amazing Jon Klassen!
Klassen is best known for their ‘hat trilogy'; I Want My Hat Back, This Is Not My Hat and We Found a Hat, and for their collaborations with writer Mac Barnett; Extra Yarn, Sam and Dave Dig a Hole, and the newest addition, Triangle. Klassen is recognisable for their clean and minimal illustration style, using ink and watercolour textures to create defined shapes and strong designs. Their characters usually remain very still but are very expressive, their eyes often giving away their intentions and emotions. As a writer he's known for their deliciously dark sense of humour. This sense of humour is unusual in children's books and is one of the ingredients that makes them so loved by grown up children as well as little ones!
The road to picture books is paved with good intentions
Jon Klassen was born in Canada and grew up in Niagara Falls and Toronto. They studied animation and moved to L.A. after graduation, where they now lives and works. Before moving into picture books Klassen worked as an animator on films including Coraline and Kung Fu Panda. Their illustration work received international recognition when they won the Governor General's Award for their work on Carolyn Stutson's Cat's Night Out. But it was the release of their first book as author and illustrator, I Want My Hat Back, in 2011 that really made their name. In a blog for 'Picture Book Makers' Klassen said that they have always enjoyed the stillness in drawing inanimate objects: “I like a story that allows the viewer to wander around a little bit and find it on their own”. This is exemplified in their illustrations for Ted Kooser's House Held Up By Trees, where it is the house and not the people that is the main focus of the story.
However in the same blog Klassen explained how this preference for drawing inanimate objects paradoxically led to creating one of their most recognisable characters. They were asked to design some greeting cards for Red Cap cards, and when they sent them sketches of chairs and inanimate objects they asked if they could draw some characters instead. They eventually sent back “a series of animals wearing birthday hats and holding balloons, but their faces and poses made them look, to me, like they had no idea what a birthday was and didn't really care. I was excited by this approach. It made me laugh, and it got me off the hook”.
From Red Cap cards
The animals on this card are recognisable to anyone who has read I Want My Hat Back, especially the bear in their signature red hat. This was the beginning of something glorious.
The movies and the pictures
Klassen's background as an animator has shaped their approach, both in their design preferences and in the limitations they saw in their own practise. Their books are notable for their brilliant pacing and comic timing, and they have found their ultimate form in the picture book. The experience of reading the best picture books feels like something between watching a film and reading a book. Not having a background in writing meant Klassen felt unsure of themselves when making I Want My Hat Back, their first book as both writer and illustrator. However it's these limitations they saw in their own skill set that have worked to the benefit of the book and made it so unique. Because they were uncomfortable writing narration as a non-writer, they stripped back all lines to simple dialogue. And because of their emphasis on the visual, the lines are not in inverted commas but in different colours for each character, meaning that nothing stands in the way of the reader “hearing” the voices of the characters. The language is stiff and straightforward because Klassen wanted the animals to feel awkward saying their “lines”. They also often look at the reader as if they are bad actors looking at a camera. Unlike illustrators such as Quentin Blake, whose expressiveness comes from bold dashes and messy lines of movement, Klassen finds expression in stillness. The animals' deadpan faces and awkward stances make the high stakes game of a bear seeking retribution for a hat stolen by a rabbit seem even funnier.
We Found A Hat, the last in the hat trilogy, goes even further with the filmic effect. It is divided into 3 parts: Part One: Finding the Hat, Part Two: Watching the Sunset, and Part Three: Going to Sleep. It's easy to imagine an ad break or interval in between the parts, adding to the anticipation and suspense before we turn the page. As is common in Klassen's books, the animals' eyes are a focal point leading the action. When two turtles discover a hat, they seem to be on the same page about leaving it behind. After all it is just the one hat, and they are two turtles. But when one of the turtles is shown looking back at the hat at the end of Part Two, (the only word on the page being "nothing" makes it seem as if these turtles could be in a Samuel Beckett play), we realise that all is not as it seems. There is trouble afoot.
One thing Klassen plays with brilliantly is the contradiction between what the image is saying and what the text is saying. They told ‘Art of the Picture Book':
“If they're being read to by an adult, I feel that the pictures are the kids' territory. So if the pictures give out some information that the text doesn't, there's a secret from the person reading it or maybe even from the person who wrote it”.
When children are being read aloud to, they can stop and question what is being said in words versus what they can see in pictures. This makes the books more interactive and gives children a sense of pride and cleverness, which is one of the ingredients to their success with kids as well as grown ups. In I Want My Hat Back and This Is Not My Hat, this interplay between text and image allows us to tell when the devious animals are lying. In Sam and Dave Dig A Hole, it's used more subtly to create an eerie open ending to the story when Sam and Dave arrive “home”, to a place ever so slightly different to the one they started out in.
The writer and the illustrator
As well as working on their own projects as a writer and illustrator, Jon Klassen has collaborated with many people to illustrate their stories. They have a recurring collaboration with Mac Barnett, a great children's book writer in their own right. Their first book together, Extra Yarn, was published in 2012, and its follow up, Sam and Dave Dig A Hole, was conceived during a chat over breakfast. It's easy to tell that there is a close relationship between the writer and illustrator here, as the words and images in this book are not completely separate entities but playfully interact with each other. The shapes of words play into the tumbling motion as Sam and Dave fall down the hole in the final pages.
Klassen's latest collaboration with Barnett is Triangle, another tale populated by devious creatures. Only this time they're not animals, but shapes. Klassen's love of landscape drawing shines through here. This book gives them the scope to create layered panoramas of shapes as Triangle runs from their triangular home to Square's square one.

Klassen collaborated with the poet Ted Kooser, on House Held Up By Trees. This story was inspired by a real-life house Kooser saw, but Klassen recently tweeted that they deliberately didn't look at the photo when they were designing the house. (Do yourself a favour and follow them on Twitter and Instagram, they are always sharing process and archive shots and their wry sense of humour transmits very well to social media!) They have said that when researching something, they like to look at it just once and then work from memory, so that their sources don't influence the finished product too much. In an interview with ‘Art of the Picture Book', they speak about their guilt that they never kept sketchbooks as an animation student, and how they approach other artists' work as inspiration. Because they did not have a natural impulse to draw from life in a sketchbook, like their classmates who sketched people on the subway and in coffee shops, Klassen's style is rooted less in anatomy and accuracy and more in impression and mood. They used the artist David Hockney's coloured pencil drawings as inspiration during Sam and Dave Dig a Hole, but says that their memory of Hockney's work was more important to them than anything they could get from constantly referencing and trying to mimic it.

Klassen-ian tragedy
Klassen's work is beautiful from a design and illustration perspective but what really sets them apart are their stories. Like all great children's writers, they don't speak down to children and they understand their sense of humour and unique outlook on the world. Their books are not as dark as some by writers like Maurice Sendak or Tomi Ungerer, but they retain a fairytale grimness that is the basis for a lot of our most well-known stories. Characters are often eaten, but the gory details are left off page and merely alluded to, like the action that happens offstage in a Shakespearean tragedy. Morality is a grey area here and there are no hard and fast heroes and villains. We find ourselves rooting for a thieving fish in This Is Not My Hat and in the final pages of I Want My Hat Back the double-crossed bear who have been the victim all along insists, “I would never eat a rabbit”. Do we believe him?
Children love reading books again and again, and picture books are designed for this. But when someone like Jon Klassen uses the form to its utmost advantage, adults will also find something new to enjoy every time.

(San Diego, CA) – Breaking news within the past hour…Craft Business Daily reports that Green Flash Brewing plans to build a new brewery on the East Coast.
The company told CBD that it plans to spend around $12 million on the facility, one that will have a capacity of 100,000 barrels and be in operation by 2015 (H/T @Brewbound). No final determination on location has been made.
Green Flash is among the top five fastest-growing regional craft breweries in the U.S., according to Brewers Association data. Production ended at 23,360 barrels last year, an increase of 70% from 2010, and could reach 45,000 barrels in 2012.
Green Flash has been busy on the East Coast within the past several months, opening distribution in southeastern states like Tennessee, Georgia and Louisiana. Beers were already available in other parts of the East Coast as part of its 34-state footprint. The company also sends beer to Canada and Japan.
The expanded distribution comes after Green Flash moved operations from Vista to Mira Mesa last year. Green Flash built a new brewery there that will eventually have working capacity of 100,000 barrels. For now, the company is already maxed out at capacity. Owner, Mike Hinkley predicts that Green Flash will reach 100,000 barrels of annual production by late 2013.
Green Flash is just the latest Western U.S.-based regional craft brewery to announce intent to expand operations to the Eastern part of the U.S..
Sierra Nevada, New Belgium and Oskar Blues announced plans to build in the greater Asheville, North Carolina, area earlier this year. Lagunitas Brewing announced plans to build a brewery in Chicago.
"We came, we saw, they died," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE joked on a CBS interview when told about the death of Libyan Dictator Muammar Qaddafi on October 20, 2011. Prior to the overthrow of the Gaddafi government, Muslim women in Libya were the beneficiaries of gender sensitive policies encouraging advanced education and entrepreneurism through small business loans. These western-focused policies were created to give Libyan women equal access to economic resources, such as finance and land ownership.
Having spent extensive time in Libya since the U.S. sanctions were lifted by the Bush Administration in 2004, I personally witnessed Libyan women surging in the private sector. It was increasingly common to see Muslim women dressed like women in the Western world with no headscarf. At that time, Libyan women were afforded “the choice” on how they dressed.

The dramatic advances in women's rights in Libya following the lifting of the U.S. sanctions ended with the bloodshed and violence of the Libyan revolution of 2011. The gender sensitive policies promoting women's rights came under direct assault by the radical Islamic factions promoting and imposing Sharia law. As a direct consequence of the Libyan revolution, Muslim women were thrown back into the dark ages.
Across Africa, where the advances of radical Islam have occurred, violence against women has increased. Women have been brutally forced into submission by Islamists using Sharia law. As outlined by the Clarion Project, under Sharia law a man owns all property and there is no joint ownership. Also, a man can marry a girl who has reached puberty and marriage to girls as young as 12 and 13 is allowed. The husband pays a bride price (“mahr”) in exchange for sexual submission (“tamkin”) of the woman, and wife beating is permitted. Islamic law (Sharia) requires that adulterers be put to death, including rape victims.
As the world has witnessed, Muslim women are executed by stoning even when they are the victims of rape.
These barbarous Sharia laws should be abhorred by civilized society and totally rejected by Americans as being counter to our Constitution and Bill of Rights. And yet, in an unconscionable display of bad judgment, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration chose to implement a foreign policy, which destabilized a secular Muslim nation leaving a vacuum of power to be filled by radical Islamists who have waged their own war on women.
I am outraged that Hillary Clinton continues to defend the rights of Islamists whose practice of Sharia law directly assaults women's rights. Equally outrageous are the continuing actions of the Clinton Foundation to accept millions of dollars from nations, which engage in violence against women.
In America, eight States have enacted law banning Sharia law as foreign or international law, and seventeen States are in the process of enacting similar legislation for the same purpose. Although State law banning Sharia law forbids its adjudication giving supremacy to the U.S. Constitution and State law, it does not ban the private practice of Sharia law and its violation of individual rights. Radical Islamists must be admonished that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not protect acts of violence or oppression on the grounds of religious freedom. America is learning from the tragedies occurring throughout the Muslim world and the horrific murders in San Bernardino and Orlando, that the violent ideology of Sharia law is a major threat to the inalienable rights of American citizens. It is time to press Congress to ban the practice of Sharia law in the United States.
Last Monday I gave a plenary talk at the joint Life Sciences and Annual SIAM meeting. My slides can be downloaded from a previous post. The talk summarized the work I've been doing on obesity and human body weight change for the past six years. The main idea is that at the most basic level, the body can be modeled as a fuel tank. You put food into the tank by eating and you use up energy to maintain bodily functions and do physical work. The difference between food intake rate and energy expenditure rate is the rate of change of your body weight. In calculating body weight you need to convert energy (e.g. Calories consumed) into mass (e.g. kilograms). However, the difficulty in doing this is that your body is not homogeneous. You are comprised of water, bones, minerals, fat, protein and carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. Each of these quantities has its own energy density (e.g. Calories/kg). So in order to figure out how much you'll weigh you need to figure out how the body partitions energy into these different components.
The problem is made simpler because the energy density of water, bones and minerals is zero, the energy density of fat is about 38 kJ/g and that of protein and carbohydrates is about 17 KJ/kg. Thus, we really only need to consider the flux of the three macronutrients fat, carbohydrates and protein. This is further simplified because the amount of glycogen in the body is small, a few kilograms at most. (“Hitting the wall” in a marathon is usually attributed to running out of glycogen and forcing the body to switch to burning protein. However, this actually may not be true as recent studies seem to suggest that there still is some glycogen left when runners hit the wall.) Hence, on a time scale of weeks, you can consider the rate of change of carbohydrates to be minimal and this reduces the system to two equations, one for fat and one for protein. Given that a change in protein is associated with a change in water, this leads to equations for fat mass and fat free or lean mass. The equations have the form
where and are the fat and lean body masses, and are the energy densities of fat and lean tissue and can be measured, and are the fat and lean food intake energy rates, is the total energy expenditure rate (it is a function of the fat and lean masses), and is the fraction of the energy expenditure coming from utilizing fat (it is also a function of the the fat and lean masses).
In steady state (body mass not changing), we have the conditions
In other words, when you are in steady state, you are in both energy balance (you burn all the food you eat), and you are in macronutrient balance (the amount of fat you burn is the amount of fat you eat, and the same for protein and carbohydrates). In two dimensions, it is well known that stable steady states are restricted to either a single fixed point (unique body composition), multiple fixed points ( multiple possible body compositions), an invariant manifold or line attractor (where a continuum of states is possible), a limit cycle or multiple limit cycles (where the body composition would oscillate even when food intake rate and energy expenditure were fixed). In order to know which, we need to estimate E and f.
The energy expenditure rate can be measured using indirect calorimetry and it turns out to be a linear function (more technically an affine function) of and . However, it is difficult to measure because when you are weight stable, just reflects what your diet is. You need to estimate in a dynamic situation, which is difficult to do in a single individual but is possible if we make a homogeneity assumption in which we assume that a heavier person is like a lighter person who gained weight and vice versa. Gilbert Forbes did precisely that and found that body composition obeys a simple law given by
We can then impose this law on our body composition equations and get an estimate for that has no adjustable parameters and this matched experimental data [2]. Forcing the body to obey Forbes law then leads to what we call the energy partition model
where
.
The interesting thing about the energy partition model, which almost everyone who's tried to model body composition before has used, is that the steady state is a line attractor given by the condition . This implies that you could eat the same diet and live the same lifestyle but be stable at an infinite number of different weights. In some cases you would be heavy and others you would be thin. However, obeying the Forbes curve doesn't necessarily imply you obey the energy partition model. It could also mean that your unique fixed point follows the Forbes curve. Interestingly, it is impossible to tell if you have a fixed point or a line attractor for changes in just energy intake or expenditure rates since they can give the same predictions. What you need to do is to perturb body composition by either strength training or liposuction. We show this and other implications in Ref. [3] listed below.
Armed with the model, we can now make predictions about how body weight will change. We can estimate all the parameters in the model and in fact if you stay on a single Forbes curve and assume small body weight changes you can reduce the energy partition model to a simple one dimensional equation for a leaky integrator
where and are parameters that can be estimated and also depend on fat. The model also immediately shows why the commonly used rule of “3500 Calories is a pound” is a poor approximation at best. This rule only gives the initial rate of change of body weight if you are perturbed from a steady state and assumes that your body weight won't change to compensate. A more accurate rule that can be obtained from the model is that “10 Calories a day is a pound”, which means that reducing your diet by 10 Calories a day (Calorie = kilocalorie) will lead to a new steady state that is one pound lower. However, the time constant for reaching steady state is about a year so it can take a long time to reach steady state. This is one of the reasons why most diets will fail, the feedback is very slow so by the time you notice that you're off the diet, it's too late. To add insult to injury because of the fat dependence of and , the amount of weight you gain and the time constant for a given amount of food both increase with body fat.
The model can also address a long standing paradox in human metabolism, which as stated by Eugene Dubois in 1927, is that “There is no stranger phenomenon than the maintenance of a constant body weight under marked variation in bodily activity and food consumption.” Generally, it is stated as “since 3500 Calories is a pound and we eat a million Calories a year then we must have very precise intake control to maintain weight within a few pounds.” This argument is specious because it doesn't account for saturation due to body weight change. However, a more correct statement of the paradox is that “if 10 Calories a day is a pound and a cookie is 200 Calories then how do we maintain weight stability?” The resolution of the paradox is simply that the time constant is very long so we average our intake over a year and the standard error of the mean yearly intake is small. You can show this explicitly using stochastic calculus and I give some examples in my talk. I still need to write the paper for this result. The one thing that can cause weight to be unstable is temporal correlations in food intake. In previous work [1], we showed that the more correlated your food intake is from day to day or week to week the more likely you will have a high BMI.
Finally, we can address the question of what caused the American obesity epidemic. Up until the mid seventies, the average body weight of the US population was very stable. It then increased linearly in time after that. The fraction of obese, which is defined as a body mass index greater than 30, has also increased dramatically. In Ref [4] below, we applied our model to the US population to predict how much food we should be eating to match the weight gain and compare it to the food available. What we found is that the food available per capita as estimated by the USDA that accounts for exports, imports, spoilage and waste is more than sufficient to account for the increase in weight. In fact, there has been a progressive increase in waste over the past 35 years. This supports the hypothesis that the obesity epidemic is due to the “push” of food onto the American public. In fact, the population is doing it's best to resist the extra food and the consequence is extra waste.

Cybersecurity professionals are warning anyone with a personal email account to change their passwords after stolen user names and passwords were being offered up for sale on the Internet, NBC News reported.
Some 272.3 million accounts were stolen - and involve some of the biggest email providers, including Google, Yahoo, Hotmail and Microsoft, according to Alex Holden of Hold Security.
"We know he's a young man in central Russia who collected this information from multiple sources," Holden told NBC News. "We don't know the way they did it or the reason why they did it."
The user names and passwords were all being sold on the so-called “dark web,” where hackers hock their goods. Hackers use the stolen information to lure users into giving away more information, including credit card numbers and bank account access.
Experts say people should change their passwords regularly. Use abstract combinations of letters, numbers and characters that a criminal's computer program couldn't easily guess.
Racist, Homophobic Crafter Lady Has Been Identified And Twitter's Having A Field Day
We have a name, folks.
The Chicago woman who was recorded going on racist tirade against two black employees at a Michaels store over a $1 bag and another homophobic rant against a barista at a coffee shop in Boystown over a bottle of water has been identified. Social media sleuths have ID'd them as Jennifer Boyle.
Here's the incident if you have yet to experience its wonders:

According to the bigoted brunette's now-deleted LinkedIn profile, they attended DePaul University and, ironically, used to work in Human Resources at Sinai Health System:
One commenter on the site You_Twitter claims to have worked with Boyle, describing them as “batsh*t, racist, crazy”:
 They are just as nuts in person as this video depicts. From a legal perspective, I am not sure what I am or am not allowed to say; but I will leave it at this. EVERYONE was happy when they found out they were no longer welcome back.
Another person claiming to be a former co-worker echoed that sentiment:
When I worked at Sinai, I was their conduit for all of their mental anguish. On my last day, I warned everyone that was at my going away outing to be careful around them and that they were mentally unstable. After I left, they unleashed on everyone within the department. Even though “I told you so”s feel good for a moment, this is unprecedented.

Sinai Health System was quick to distance itself from the deplorable, posting on Facebook that Boyle stopped working there prior to the Michael's incident and assuring people that “her views in no way represent those of our organization.”
It is unclear where or if Boyle is employed today.
Now, let's take a look at how folks on Twitter are responding…

MSNBC's Thomas Roberts speaks with Eagle Scout Zach Wahls, son of a same-sex couple, who has advocated for the Boy Scouts of America to allow gay scouts and scout leaders in the organization.
The Boy Scouts of America is considering a resolution that calls for ending a 102-year-old policy they've grappled with in recent years: banning gay scouts and scout leaders, gay advocates told msnbc.com on Wednesday. Though the organization said it would review the proposal, a spokesperson insisted there were no plans to change the policy.
The new policy would throw out the national ban and allow local chartering organizations to decide whether or not they would accept gay youth and leaders, said Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout who has advocated for the change, citing unidentified people who attended the group's national annual meeting last week where the proposal was made.
Boy Scouts of America spokesperson Deron Smith said a resolution to amend the national policy to allow each Scouting's chartered group to set its own standards regarding gay members was turned in by a Scout leader from the Northeast before April 30, the deadline for submitting resolutions to the meeting. They said the resolution was read at the May 31 meeting.
“While we'll carefully consider this resolution, there are no plans to change this policy,” Smith said, noting that resolutions and petitions on the matter were “not unique” and dated back to 2000, when the Supreme Court heard a challenge on their stance. (The justices sided with the Boy Scouts in the lawsuit involving a former Assistant Scoutmaster who was gay, citing the protections of the First Amendment).
Wahls, the son of a lesbian couple, delivered a petition with 275,000 signatures last Wednesday that called for an end to the anti-gay policy and for the reinstatement of Jennifer Tyrrell as a den mother after they were ousted in April because they are gay.

Helping carries the cartons are Mark Anthony Dingbaum, left, and Christine Irvine of Change.org, the web-based social media platform on which the petition was launched.
Wahls said they were “absolutely ecstatic” when they heard about the proposal to change the policy, saying it would be akin to the repeal of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman.
“Clearly this shows that there's a little bit more internal discussion than they might be outwardly describing, so in a very real sense this was in a lot of ways kind of the best possible, most realistic outcome of that delivery of that Change.org petition,” they said. “It's kind of hard to believe really that ... we are finding ourselves in this place, but here we are.”

But Smith said their decision to accept the petition was “not related to the resolution,” earlier noting that it was out of respect for different points of view. They said resolutions were referred to and reviewed by a committee that would report back to the national executive board. The board then decides what actions are “appropriate,” they said.
The process would likely be done by May 2013, they said.
“There has been discussion about the BSA's membership policy for decades. The BSA respectfully considers a wide range of views on this issue. Scouting has concluded its longstanding policy reflects the beliefs and perspectives of the BSA's members,” Smith said. “Scouting believes same-sex attraction should be introduced and discussed outside of its youth program with parents, caregivers, or spiritual advisers, at the appropriate time and in the right setting. The vast majority of parents we serve value this right.”
They also noted that other resolutions had been introduced in the past “admonishing us to not change the policy. We have millions of youth and adult members each with a variety of beliefs about this issue and no single policy will accommodate everyone's views.”
Still, Wahls said they have had conversations with people inside the organization and has received an outpouring of support from other Eagle Scouts, with whom they will form a group to work to end the policy. "We're all feeling very positive about where we're at,” they said.
“At the end of the day, the BSA's about teaching young people the values and lessons that they need to know to serve and lead our fellow Americans and those values are not conservative or liberal,” Wahls said. The 20-year-old, of Iowa City, Iowa, became known nationally after speaking before their home state's legislature in 2011 about having gay parents.
They said they believe ending the policy could boost membership numbers and restore "the BSA to its former mantle of moral leadership in this country.”
Tyrrell served as den leader in their Bridgeport, Ohio, community for less than a year before their ouster. The 32-year-old stay-at-home mother of four said they agreed to take the position on the day they signed up their son, Cruz Burns, for the troop. They had concerns about the Boy Scouts' policy against homosexuals, but a Cubmaster said that they wouldn't have a problem locally.

Losing their post and removing their son from the troop has been trying. They said they have contact with a lot of their scout parents: "I'm still a part of their lives but (it's) not the same,” they said Wednesday, their voice trembling.
But they were heartened that change may be on the horizon. “The fact that they're moving along with the country and with the times and with the needs and wants of the American people, is a huge step and I'm super, super excited to be a tiny part of that,” they said.﻿

I think overall MOOCs are seeing a problem achieving profitability, which is caused by a few sub-problems:
The Grading Problem
Courses have to walk a fine line between grading too harshly (thus discouraging or invalidating the work of a larger proportion of their students), or grading too loosely (which muddies the signal of how much a student learned in a course). This is complicated by the fact that many (if not most) courses are graded on a pass/fail system (some with a 'pass with distinction') - the problem isn't just "What does an A- mean for this course?" but "What does a 'pass' mean for this course?".
I think a deeper root of this problem is the question of what the point of a MOOC is - is it to transfer mastery of a topic to a student, or just passable working knowledge? Or is it just to signal that a student was interested in a topic and put in some amount of time to learn a bit of it? The different courses I took seemed to follow different philosophies on this topic, but I think all of them erred on the side of being too lenient when it came to grading - effort, not mastery over the content, was enough to pass every course.
The Practicality Problem
Are MOOCs trying to teach just practical work-related skills, or to bring elements of a "liberal arts" program to the public? Most MOOCs right now have both (Udacity seems to lean towards the practical), even though the practical skills ought to be more monetizable. But, trying to address both goals might confuse the direction of product development (not to mention the development of online pedagogy). This would seem to make business / monetization problems more challenging, and also create too diverse of an audience to be able to satisfy everyone. This is a deeper question about the philosophy of the MOOC and the "end goal", and whether any single MOOC can reasonably be excellent at teaching both practical and more liberal arts subjects.
The Openness Problem
One strength of MOOCs is that they are open to students of all backgrounds - there is no barrier to joining the MOOC, many classes are at the introductory level, and prerequisites for more advanced classes are not enforced. This is also a weakness with the MOOC model. One reason is that it is then more difficult to teach advanced topics to a potentially wide range of students and backgrounds. Another reason is that for a potential employer, it obfuscates the signal of a student completing the class: a student completing a course on machine learning has obviously put in some amount of time and effort, but what does it mean if the course had tens of thousands of students? Was the content simplified to reach a loewr common denominator of pre-existing knowledge? Did the student master the content? Achievements shared by too many lose their distinction.
The Brand Name Problem
The biggest MOOCs use partnerships with brand-name universities or companies as a way to advertise the legitimacy of courses. Students can filter the class listing by posted institution, and the instructors are employees or faculty at those institutions. However, any certificate earned as a result of completing the MOOC is not affiliated with that provider institution.
There is some irony in the fact that large numbers of MOOC students might be drawn to a brand name institution because of the perceived exclusivity and thus signaling of that name. I am unsure as to the correlation between the reputation of a MOOC course's institution and the quality of that course (this correlation will probably rise over time), but there is a definite disconnect between a MOOC's desire to use these brand names to attract students, and the schools' reluctance to "certify" potentially thousands of students who complete their courses online.
The Curriculum Problem
This problem occurs on many levels. On the course level, how does a professor choose what material to put into the course? Will they teach just the most practical information, or mix in underlying theory as well (which may not be as practical, but which could strengthen practical knowledge)? On a multi-course level, how does a MOOC create and advertise a set of courses that, when taken together, provide the student with a clearly defined and clearly useful skillset?
MOOCs are now creating degree-like programs (e.g. "Specializations" and "XSeries"), and the design of these mini-degrees bring up some interesting questions (and answers). How many courses should be required? (Anywhere from two to ten.) Should the students be required to take the courses in a certain order? (Yes.) Will the courses still be restricted in terms of timing / when students are able to take them? (Yes.) Will these curricula focus only on practical skills or also other academic topics? (There are generally more computer science-related tracks currently.)
On Friday, Mike Huckabee appeared on the Family Research Council's “Washington Watch” program to defend Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who was found in contempt of court after repeatedly refusing to issue marriage licenses following the legalization of same-sex marriage.
Speaking with FRC President Tony Perkins, who will be joining the former Arkansas governor at a rally in defense of Davis today, Huckabee said that Davis' rights have been “trampled upon by those who practice judicial tyranny.”
“I wonder if the president would be willing to trade some terrorists to get them out of jail,” Perkins joked. “It'd be nice if they would,” Huckabee said. “Bowe Bergdahl was traded for terrorists.”
Huckabee went on to say that prisoners in Guantanamo Bay have been “accommodated in every way and they were terrorists in our custody, yet Kim Davis is not given accommodation of their faith and that's why I say it is absolutely the criminalization of Christianity.”
Huckabee also told Perkins that Kim Davis' case proves that gay marriage has an impact on all of us, claiming that now anyone who opposes same-sex marriage “may end up going to jail.”
“This is a county clerk who is in jail this weekend without bail, let me point out, because they believed that their faith was more important than following an illegal, unconstitutional and, as yet, an unlawful decision by the Supreme Court,” Huckabee said. “Congress hasn't made a law yet that says there is same-sex marriage…. This federal judge is trying to enforce something that does not exist yet.”
Of course, Davis is not in jail because they oppose gay marriage, but because they have been held in contempt of court for consistently breaking the law. Requiring them to allow their office to perform its official duties for taxpayers in no way requires them to approve of same-sex marriage.
The GOP presidential candidate went on to say that Davis' case shows that the government will soon imprison pastors or “the leader of a youth group that refuses to let transgendered [sic] people go and sleep in the same dorm at a church camp.”

BuildingAdvisor is an independent website created with the sole purpose of helping our readers. We have no relationship with any advertisers, products, or services mentioned, and therefore no conflicts of interest. We are supported by ads placed on our pages by Google and by sales of the BuildingAdvisor Estimating Worksheet.
WHO WE SERVE
Whether you are an owner/builder who wants to do it all, or plan to use the services of an architect, general contractor, subcontractors, or a construction manager (or aren't sure which way to go), we can help make your project go more smoothly – and save money and gray hairs in the process. Who we are
GET INVOLVED
If you've read this far, you're probably the kind of person that wants to play an active role in your building project, maybe designing and contracting it yourself, and maybe even swinging a hammer.
It's great to be actively involved. You're much more likely to end up with the project you want in terms of design, cost, energy efficiency, comfort, and durability. It's not that the other people on your building team don't want to do a good job. But no one understands your goals, or cares as much about your project, as you.
WHERE TO BEGIN
Maybe you've been thinking about this project for years, or maybe you just got started yesterday. In either case, you should begin at the beginning — assessing your needs, capabilities, time constraints, and budget, and deciding what responsibilities to take on yourself and which to outsource to others.
HOW TO USE THIS SITE
The site is organized roughly in the order of a typical project, although in reality, you'll often be jumping back and forth between sections. Your three biggest assets going forward will be knowledge, planning, and communication:
Knowledge – The more you bring to your project, the better the outcome. Learn as much as you can about design, materials, building systems, contracts and contractors, costs, and risks before proceeding. Take advantage of the vast amount of information available today on the Web and elsewhere. Without knowledge you are shooting in the dark!
Planning – The more time you spend planning, the faster, better, and cheaper your project will be — with the fewest headaches. Construction on the building site may be the most exciting phase, but the planning is the most important. Surprises on the job site always cause headaches and cost money, so don't be surprised — plan ahead!
Communication – Remember, it's your project. If you don't clearly communicate your desires to all members of your building team, don't expect things to come out the way you want. They won't! Your contract, plans, specifications,and budget are your primary tools for communication. Learn how to use these effectively to keep everyone working together, on track, to meet your goals.
So don't skimp on any of these. Remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Take the time necessary to learn the ropes, to formulate a good plan and realistic budget, and to communicate clearly with everyone on your team. Invest your time in good planning, the building will almost build itself.

Friends, we've gathered Wait. This is the funeral for the BCS. It has no friends.
Enemies, we've gathered here today to say good-bye to the Bowl Championship Series. It died last week. It was 14 years old. In its short life, it was subject to repeated attacks by President Obama. Republican backbenchers turned it into a political football. Sportswriters prayed for its demise. (See the 2010 book titled, um, Death to the BCS.)
But I was a big fan. In death, it's up to me to be its eulogist. Here are five things the non-playoff got right:
It made college football's regular season a nerve-racking bloodbath
I liked the BCS because I thought it preserved the excitement of college football's regular season. You, the BCS's enemies, countered that the regular season was nice and all, but you'd sacrifice some pre–New Year's excitement for a longer postseason. That was essentially our argument, plus a lot of cuss words.
Let's put that aside for the moment, and let's agree that whatever you thought of the BCS, it made the regular season really exciting. Take a single month of 2011. On October 29, Ohio State dealt Wisconsin its second straight loss and knocked the Badgers out of contention for the national title. Undefeated Clemson lost to Georgia Tech. Undefeated Stanford beat USC, 56-48, staying in the title hunt.
A week later, on November 5, one-loss Michigan and one-loss Nebraska both dropped games. That night, millions watched no. 1 LSU beat no. 2 Alabama. The same night, though almost no one was watching, unbeaten Oklahoma State scored with 2:16 left to sneak by Kansas State.
On November 12, 9-0 Stanford blew its chance at the title game by losing to Oregon. Boise State, which was 8-0, suffered a nut-kick loss to TCU when the Horned Frogs made a late two-point conversion and the Broncos missed a go-ahead field goal.
The week after that, November 19, it was one-loss Oregon's turn to get knocked out of the title game with their own missed field goal. Oklahoma, which also had one loss, got eliminated when Baylor's Robert Griffin III threw a touchdown with eight seconds left. But the really amazing game was on Friday night: Oklahoma State lost to Iowa State in double overtime. It bounced the Cowboys from the national title game.
Finally, on November 25, no. 1 LSU polished off no. 3 Arkansas, staying unbeaten. “The game became more of a national game than ever before,” says Bill Hancock, the executive director of the BCS. “People in the Southeast had to pay attention to Boise and TCU.”
What's strange is that you, BCS enemies, used this near-constant state of excitement to attack the BCS. This chaos, you said, proved that the system was flawed. I dunno. We can fight about the title game, but I thought the BCS made college football appointment TV every weekend.
The BCS changed the controversy
You painted the BCS as an anachronism, the last gasp of old-timey, bowl-riffic college football. But the BCS wasn't old-fashioned. It was radical.
Travel back with me to the dark ages. We called them the ‘90s. In 1990, Colorado and Georgia Tech ended the regular season at no. 1 and no. 2. They played in separate bowls. It was terrible. The same thing happened in 1991 and 1994. The last pre-BCS season, 1997, ended with a classic non-matchup: 11-0 Michigan, with Charles Woodson, and 12-0 Nebraska, with Scott Frost and Ahman Green, playing in bowl games 2,000 miles apart.
That was old-fashioned college football. As the Tulsa World noted not long ago, “[O]nly nine times in 35 seasons between 1963 and 1997 did the Associated Press' top two teams meet in a bowl game.”
The BCS matched no. 1 and no. 2 every year. “It was a radical — frankly, a draconian — change,” says Hancock. Now, its selections weren't always loved, but notice that the BCS managed, however slightly, to mitigate college football's central controversy. It moved it back in time (it occurred before the bowls rather than after) and back in the rankings (most years, it involved only the second team in the title game). Old-time college football was a never-ending argument about “Who's no. 1?” Under the BCS, it became “Who's no. 2?”
The BCS brought order to college football
Let's stay in 1997 for a moment. We don't just see a sport full of controversy. We see a feudal society. Major conferences, smallish conferences, bowl games yoked to deep histories, rival polls, computer rankings, and the proudly independent entity called Notre Dame — all these things vied for power. The BCS's great achievement was bringing this world under its thumb.
This turned out to be a really hard thing to do! The BCS had to account for the fact that, say, the Big Ten champs still wanted to play in the Rose Bowl every year. The BCS had to be elastic enough to welcome both undefeated Boise State and a four-loss Big East champion. If the eventual rules were convoluted, that only underscored the enormity of the task.
The proposed playoff would include four teams chosen by a council of elders, who would pay attention to — but not be bound by — strength of schedule, conference championships and, well, you see where this is headed. But notice that nearly every fan agrees that some central authority should do the choosing. The BCS was the first, imperfect stab at forming a government. It was college football's Articles of Confederation.
The BCS helped the mid-majors
You had two killer arguments against the BCS: (1) the LSU-Alabama rematch, which you said proved the system sucked, and (2) the fact that the BCS didn't offer a realistic path to the national title for TCU, Boise State, and the other small schools you regularly martyred in the sports pages.
The second argument is mostly true. But the BCS helped those small schools, too. TCU played in the Rose Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl. The Horned Frogs hadn't made a major bowl since the late 1950s and weren't going to under the old system. Their success made them so big-time, they got into the Big 12. Utah played in two BCS bowls and won both. They went from a résumé-filler for Urban Meyer to a Pac-12 member. Boise State jumped from the Humanitarian Bowl to two BCS games. Hawaii played in the 2008 Sugar Bowl.
If the BCS was deadly for the mid-majors, somebody ought to tell the mid-majors. “Anytime you have human involvement, or people involved in the process, you're going to have second-guessers,” TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte says. “We never second-guessed the opportunity to play in the Rose Bowl.”
The BCS brought America together
Look at yourselves. You're a rainbow coalition. You are Texas fans and Oklahoma fans, LSU fans and Alabama fans, Utes, Broncos, Horned Frogs. People who, on a normal fall Saturday, hate each other. The fact that you can hate together could mean good things.
Because there's a lot more to hate about college football. In fact, there's an obvious next target: the fact that college athletes aren't paid. The BCS was a decade-and-a-half-long annoyance; the whole idea of “amateurism,” as Brother Branch pointed out, is a century-long swindle. It's a moral crisis. It's more important than Oklahoma State getting stuck in the Fiesta Bowl.
The truth is, everyone wasted too many words on the BCS when the real crisis was right in front of us. As the crystal football is lowered into the earth, friends, let us all join hands and hate college football's phony notion of amateurism. In a few years, I'll save you a seat at the funeral.
Click here to see our most recent findings on B2B and B2C content marketing.
When we think of content marketing, the campaigns of packaged goods and restaurant chains typically come to mind. We picture Red Bull and Chipotle, viral videos and millennials—B2C marketing all the way. B2B branded content may not always be as visible, but it's just as widespread and pursues the same goal: connecting brands with customers in exceptional ways.
Despite this shared devotion to branded content, the strategies used to approach B2B and B2C content marketing are notably different. Marketers in both spaces hope to engage potential customers through stories. But the nature of the messaging and the channels used to distribute those stories are as distinctive as the content itself.
Thought leaders and entertainers
At a base level, B2C and B2B marketers approach their content strategies in fundamentally different ways.
B2B businesses have vast stores of industry knowledge at their disposal, and this information can be dispensed through any number of formats. By packaging expertise as thought-leadership articles, companies can offer crucial insight into the marketplace. A good B2B content strategy often boils down to simply being the most insightful source of information on the work you do.
For a while, getting eyeballs on that content has been difficult, but it's getting easier. For example, LinkedIn introduced Sponsored Updates to help brands expand the reach of their LinkedIn posts across desktop, smartphone, and tablet feeds. Businesses can use these to target audiences by category, job function, and job title to increase the visibility of their educational content.
On the consumer side, being a thought leader isn't really going to move the needle if you're, say, a breakfast cereal brand (although Captain Crunch might have some great thoughts on piracy.) Instead, B2C content marketing is often focused on the topics consumers care about. That's why Red Bull has become the biggest extreme sports media company in the world. It's also the reason American Express has become a small business publishing powerhouse.
[Full disclosure: American Express is a Contently client.]
Of course, good B2C content marketing also aims to entertain. That's what Chipotle accomplished with its web series, Farmed and Dangerous, and what LEGO did with The LEGO Movie—a $200 million blockbuster that may qualify as one of the greatest pieces of branded content of all time.
Emphasizing value and appealing to emotion
Why does a consumer decide to buy a product?
Basic need plays a part, but so does emotion, status, and brand appeal. Branded and sponsored content can positively impact one's perception of a brand, as evidenced by a study from IPG Media Lab commissioned by Forbes Media. Consumers exposed to branded content, the study found, were 28 percent more likely to have a “favorable” impression of the brand. Accordingly, brands—like Duracell Canada with its “Moments of Warmth” video—do their best to ingratiate themselves with their potential customers.
The product sometimes makes an appearance in content marketing (like in the above Duracell video), but it's the emotional impact that counts. With its Leave the World Behind documentary, launched in 2013, Volvo gave viewers a behind-the-scenes look at musical group Swedish House Mafia. The stirring film offered exclusive insight into what happened when the group, which hails from Volvo's native Sweden, split.
In B2B, the more popular approach highlights a product's features in an entertaining way. For corporate customers, purchasing decisions are grounded in reason, and brands must get creative to exhibit the complexities of their products in an engaging way.
Take Volvo Trucks, Volvo Group's commercial truck manufacturer. When advertising Volvo Dynamic Steering, a new system designed to improve the stability of its vehicles particularly when driving in reverse, the brand created “The Epic Split,” an online video that launched in November 2013 starring a very limber Jean-Claude Van Damme.
“The film is the perfect demonstration of the directional stability Volvo Dynamic Steering can offer,” said Volvo Trucks engineer Jan-Inge Svensson. Indeed, the content couldn't have existed without it. The video not only demonstrated what Volvo trucks are capable of in an unforgettable way, but also generated over 82 million views on YouTube.
The many faces of content personalization
Between dynamic retargeting and customized content, personalized content is quickly emerging as content marketing's secret weapon. In fact, it's pretty amazing it hasn't been squished into a horrendous buzzword yet. (Perscontentilization, anyone?)
The best-known case studies for this come from B2C brands. Mobile app InStyle's Hairstyle Try-On lets consumers try on celebrity hairstyles to find the look that suits them best. On Revlon's Virtual Makeup Artist, users can give themselves a makeover, selecting complexion color, skin type, product, and makeup shade before making a purchase online.
Beacon-based marketing, featured in our “State of Content Marketing: Retail” e-book, is also proving useful to consumer brands. Jewelry retailer Alex & Ani delivers real-time promotions to shoppers when they're near its retail stores with the help of mobile marketing platform Swirl. Swirl is built on Apple's positioning and push notification system iBeacon, which can be used to personalize greetings, tender product recommendations, and deploy deals when a shopper gets close to a store. In a way, it's like providing customers with their own personal shopper. Incredibly, the content drove in-store conversion rates in the high teens.
B2B content marketers use personalization, too, but without the need for GPS tracking. This can come in the form of dynamic calls to action, segmented emails, and companies like Demandbase, which marries user targeting with personalized ads.
“Most B2C is cookie and behavior-based,” says Martin Longo, chief technology officer with Demandbase. “In B2B, it's not about individuals, it's about an entire organization. Account-based marketing is a strong trend in this space.”
Companies like Cisco, HP, and Dell present Demandbase with a list of firms they'd like to target. Demandbase uses a real-time bidder tool to plug into ad exchanges like Google, AppNexus, and Centro and bids on inventory linked to the IP addresses of the companies its clients seek, placing display, video, social, and mobile advertising accordingly. The ads can promote different types of branded content like downloadable white papers and e-books. Company-specific targeting is coupled with customized ad messaging that speaks directly to the viewer.
B2B and B2C brand publishers all have to deliver value to their customers by telling memorable stories, even if they differ in the framing and method of delivery. But for all of the acronyms in content marketing, success often comes down to just three letters: awe.

The highly popular ABC series How to Get Away with Murder (#HTGAWM) is back with its second season and the reviews and ratings for the show are clearly proving that is here to stay.
So if you're looking for a fresh and interesting TV show to watch, I'm going to list the top 3 reasons you should be tuning in to this series.
1. How to Get Away with Murder: Amazing Cast and performances
By now you must have heard about the brilliantly talented Viola Davis winning the Emmy award this year for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, beating out fan favorites like Taraji P Henson from Empire and cult show Orphan Black actor Tatiana Maslany, becoming the first African American actor to win the award in the category.

The academy award nominated actor gives a stellar performance as Annalise Keating a highly intelligent and prominent criminal defense attorney and a law professor at Middleton University who has no limits in order to win their cases and achieved what they want.
The show is not only about the talented actor, as they are surrounded by an stellar group that includes Alfred Enoch who you might remember from the Harry Potter film series, The Carrie Diaries Jack Falahee, Black Box Aja Naomi King, Orange is the New Black Matt McGorry and Nosotros los Nobles and Instructions not Included Karla Souza as their students, and also Charlie Weber and Liza Weil as their assistants and Billy Brown as a police detective.

The cast is not only talented and very good looking but also represents one of the most diverse casts in today's TV and there are certainly no weak links in this show since every character is involved in the plot and is a all play a key part to the mysteries of the show.
2. TGIT lineup
The show is produced by TV Queen Shonda Rhimes who is best known as the creator, head writer, executive producer and showrunner of the popular drama series Grey's Anatomy currently on their seventh season and the also popular political thriller series Scandal.
These 3 shows from Shonda Rhimes make the ABC lineup called TGIT (Thank God is Thursday) with each of the shows having massive ratings for the network, so if you are already watch Scandal or Grey's Anatomy it wouldn't hurt you to stay up a little more and enjoy How to get Away with Murder who is the last show of the TV block.

3. Ultimately the show is fun, entertainment, bold and shocking
The show gives us a thrill ride from beginning to end with numerous twists and mysteries that would keep you on the edge of your seat and will leave you wondering at the end of each episode about the clues and the identity of the killers that are shown throughout the show.
The series is also smartly written and it successfully avoids leaving its viewers on the dark for too long, with each episode you get more and more clues about the current mystery developing on the show.
We also get to see in every episode numerous sexy and racy scenes that will have you in shock, constantly pushing the boundaries of television and it also has very special guest stars actors such as academy award winner Marcia Gay Harden, X Men Famke Janssen and the multi-talented and legendary Cicely Tyson as Viola Davis character's mother.
In the end I can think of a million more reasons on why you should be watching the show, but in the end I think the best reason is to simply tell you to watch the first episode and by the end of it I guarantee you would be hooked on the story.

After the DEA moved to further constrain, Americans' access to medically miraculous CBD oil by classifying it alongside heroin and cocaine, Britain chose compassion and common sense — and just classified Cannabidiol (CBD) as a medicine.
On Monday, Britain's Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) decided CBD — which can treat illnesses and conditions from severe childhood epilepsy to autism to cancer — warranted the classification as a medicine based on credible evidence of its efficacy.
Thus, unlike in the U.S. — where the substance is now considered devoid of medical benefit by the DEA — CBD meeting quality and regulatory standards may be legally obtained by any British citizens who need it, reports
“We have come to the opinion that products containing cannabidiol (CBD) used for medical purposes are a medicine,” an MHRA spokesperson said in a statement on the agency's website.
“Our primary concern is patient safety and we wish to reiterate that individuals using cannabidiol (CBD) products to treat or manage the symptoms of medical conditions should discuss their treatment with their doctor.
“MHRA will now work with individual companies and trade bodies in relation to making sure products containing CBD, used for a medical purpose, which can be classified as medicines, satisfy the legal requirements of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.”
This rational approach stands in sharp and tragic contrast to draconian drug laws in the U.S., where, as of January 13, CBD oil — which does not contain the psychoactive chemical THC, which gives people a high — and all cannabinoids will be considered dangerous substances.
Healthcare and cannabis rights advocates have excoriated the DEA's brash and baseless move, noting lives will now be in jeopardy.
“The whole policy around this plant is just so illogical,” Robert J. Capecchi, Director of Federal Policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, told Vice. “Even when you look at the criteria you're supposed to be looking at under the law, they're just not following it. It's just a stupid policy for lack of a better term.”
THC-containing cannabis — also medically beneficial for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, among many other conditions — still remains as a Schedule I substance in the U.S., and is not considered medicine in Britain.
But the latter has taken steps in the right direction with the new classification for CBD — a complete reversal of cease and desist orders sent by MHRA to vendors only months ago, as High Times notes, ordering it to be “removed from sale in the UK.”
“The change really came about with us offering an opinion that CBD is in fact a medicine,” Gerald Heddel, director of inspection and enforcement at the agency, explained to Sky News, “and that opinion was based on the fact that we noted that people were making some quite stark claims about serious diseases that could be treated with CBD.”
Decades of government propaganda about the putative dangers of ‘marijuana' — amplified exponentially by President Nixon's administration's agenda to, in essence, criminalize black people and the anti-war left — still linger in the stigmatization of all the cannabis plant's myriad derivatives.
Despite the DEA's war on cannabis and its users, onerous prohibition has been voted out in an increasing number of states — forcing those who need it to uproot their lives and move, in order not to face arrest over their medicine. Medical research into cannabis and cannabinoids continues to evince the miraculous assets the plant offers. In just one example, as High Times explains,
“In early December, researchers from the University of Alabama found that CBD oil reduces both the frequency and severity of seizures in children and adults with with severe, intractable epilepsy. In two-thirds of the 81 participants, the severity was reduced by at least 50 percent.”
In classifying CBD as medicine, MHRA recognizes such benefits — and the improved health of British citizens — eclipse the value in blindly continuing dangerous and inaccurate propaganda.
Sadly, the highly profitable war on drugs and influence of pharmaceutical corporations have the DEA feigning ignorance about cannabis and CBD — at the expense of people's lives.

Green Day stopped by the Late Late Show last night but — judging by their performance — we think they'd much rather be in bed. Before you write us off as snarky Green Day haters, you should know that this is coming from a place of love. It's not cool to say but almost nobody puts on a show like Green Day, even this late in their career. So we have to wonder what happened with this anemic performance of their new song “Still Breathing.”
For one thing, it's the same song they performed months ago on Colbert. For another, Billie Joe Armstrong barely moves throughout the entire performance, allowing their guitar to gather dust and leaning heavily on the mic stand. Maybe they're just tired. Maybe they are mad at Corden for not shoving them in a car so that they can sing “Single Ladies.” Either way, it's clear that the group weren't all the way on when they played last night.
The Rock and Roll Hall of Famers have been reinvigorated by the election of President Trump, turning in fiery performances to young, new recruits and their parents who still love Dookie night after night. But maybe like the rest of us their just tired. It can be hard to bring the indingnation every single day. Check it out up top. Or don't, see if they care.
It's only two sentences long, but Stephen King's newest horror story is next level scary.
The Carrie author posted this extremely succinct tale about GOP nominee Donald Trump's presidential campaign on Twitter Friday:
My newest horror story: Once upon a time there was a man named Donald Trump, and they ran for president. Some people wanted them to win. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 21, 2016
And despite its incredibly abbreviated nature, it still gave plenty of other Twitter users the shivers.
Some even lightheartedly dubbed it their most terrifying story yet, perhaps because it's so true to life. Just remember Trump's fear-mongering at the Republican National Convention in July.
Here's how the novelist's fans reacted:
@StephenKing Pls write this. It will be the scariest book you've ever written. I've even done the cover art for you. pic.twitter.com/ttVVMUz4Mm — Anna Brooks (@Anna_Brooksie) October 22, 2016
King told The Washington Post last month that they were “terrified” that Trump could become president.
“A Trump presidency scares me more than anything else,” said the man whose imagination has spawned such despicable characters as It and Randall Flagg.
They were also among the 450-plus writers who signed an open letter airing concerns about Trump's campaign in May. Read their message in full here.

The Pistons are currently carrying three expiring contracts on their roster, and with the February trade deadline looming, they could easily be used as bargaining chips to help Stan Van Gundy and Jeff Bower pull the trigger on another deal to help Detroit in its playoff hunt. Steve Blake, Brandon Jennings and Anthony Tolliver are all looking at an uncertain future, but at least two of those players are hoping to stay in Detroit, at least for the near future.
After a spectacular game against the Magic on Jan. 4, Jennings opened up to the assembled media, including MLive's David Mayo, about their thoughts on seeing their name actively mentioned in several trade rumors. The 26-year-old guard dismissed the talk, but admitted it had been on their mind:
"I can't really get away from it because it's all on my Twitter feed every time I tweet something," Jennings said. "But it's rumors. It's something that I'm not worried about. I just want to play basketball and I'm just blessed to be healthy again."
Stan Van Gundy has earlier explained that while the team will not be active on the trade front, that they would listen to any realistic offers thrown their way, but none have materialized so far. When discussing some of Jennings' trade speculation, the Pistons' second year coach was somewhat committal to keeping Brandon around:
"Our plan, right now, is that Brandon can help us make a playoff push, and that's what we're going to do," Van Gundy said. "That's our plan right now. If something happens in the next five weeks, we'll look at it. But right now, he's a very good player who can help us, and that's the only way we're looking at him."
With the Detroit Free Press' Vince Ellis confirming via Twitter that Jennings and SVG have discussed the possibility of an additional contract after this season, there are plenty of reasons why we should be excited about the idea of Motown retaining its' Swag for the foreseeable future.
Anthony Tolliver, who has also featured heavily in Van Gundy's rotation since their arrival last season, has indicated they would like to return to Detroit following the expiration of their current contract. Despite a poor shooting start to the season, the former Blue Jay has bounced back nicely, shooting 36% from deep. Tolliver, who hasn't played more than two seasons with the same team over the course of their eight-year career, announced their offseason plans on their own personal blog (H/T MLive's Aaron MacMann):
One of the things I'd like to accomplish in 2016 is to help the Pistons make it to the playoffs and hopefully make a deep run. Individually, I want to have a good, solid season and help my team win as much as possible. And then when I'm a free agent this summer, I hope to sign back with Detroit and try to make this a long-term home for my family and me.
Tolliver and Jennings will both be players to watch out for prior to, and after the February deadline, especially if both finish the season in Piston blue, white and red. The team is already looking to secure the services of Andre Drummond during the offseason, but you can be sure that both the asupervisorstioned players could see an offer come their way from Detroit's front office should they survive the trade deadline.

A women's leadership scheme named in honour of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox has rebuked The Times newspaper for criticising a transgender teenager who has its support.
The Times has published a string of articles over the past few weeks focusing on 19-year-old Labour Party activist Lily Madigan, who was named a women's officer by their constituency Labour Party.
The newspaper targeted Madigan for taking on the local women's officer role and for applying for the party's Jo Cox Women in Leadership Scheme..
A Times reporter interviewed anti-trans activists who claimed their presence is a “monstrous insult” to women.
Today, 55 Labour activists involved in the Jo Cox Women in Leadership scheme defended Ms Madigan, in a letter to the editor of The Times disputing their coverage.
It appears that that The Times has declined to publish the letter from the group of women – despite publishing no fewer than five separate pieces targeting the teenager over the past few weeks.
In the letter, the group say that the Times coverage was “focussed on sowing divisions”.
The group adds: “One of our cohort is a trans woman, our friend, and our sister.
“We wish to make it clear that the decision to include all women in this programme is one we supported then, and one which we support now.”
The full letter is published below:
Dear Editor of The Times,
We are members of the first cohort of the Jo Cox Women in Leadership Programme. We were privileged to be part of a course which challenged and empowered us as leaders in equal measure. In Jo's memory, we have built a strong network of friendship and sisterhood which we know will last long after our graduation from the programme.
One of the great strengths of our experience was the diversity of the cohort. Different ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities and political perspectives came together for learning and mutual support. We did this with a strong sense that, as Jo said, we have more in common than that which divides us.
We were disappointed to read an article in The Times (25th November 2017) about a trans woman applying to the programme. Rather than celebrate what it has achieved, it focussed on sowing divisions with regards to who applies.
One of our cohort is a trans woman, our friend, and our sister.
We applaud the Labour Party, the Labour Women's Network and the Jo Cox Foundation for supporting the principle that every woman should have the opportunity to participate in this course. We wish to make it clear that the decision to include all women in this programme is one we supported then, and one which we support now.
We urge all Labour women interested in developing their leadership skills to make the most of this and future programmes. Because we really do have more in common than that which divides us.
The letter is signed by 55 female activists, including MP for Canterbury Rosie Duffield and MP for Birmingham Edgbaston Preet Kaur Gill, who are involved in the Jo Cox Women in Leadership Scheme.
Ms Madigan has repeatedly had to defend their gender identity from critics previously.
They were last year forced to hire a solicitor after their school in Maidstone forced the student to wear a male uniform and threatened to exclude them if they turned up in a skirt.
The teen said: “When I first went [to school presenting as female] it felt really great.
“I felt like myself. But I was treated like I did something wrong, which was upsetting.
“Wearing male clothes makes me feel really invalidated and puts me in a low mood for the whole day.
“They gave me three options: I could come back in the male dress code, go on permanent study leave or find a new school.”
The school stood by its decision and forced Lily to wear a men's suit and tie for a further six months.
After the teen threatened an Equality act case against the school, it published an apology to them
It said: “I would like to offer an apology for any hurt to you which has been caused by individuals or the school in respect of this situation.”
The young activist also came under fire when they submitted a complaint about a Labour activist who had made a number of transphobic comments online.
The derogatory tweets about gender identity were sent by Anne Ruzylo, 52, which led to their resignation as Bexhill and Battle Constituency Labour Party women's officer.
Ms Madigan was later elected as the women's officer in the Rochester and Strood Constituency Labour Party.
Iranian developers defy huge odds to create acclaimed computer game
By Thomas Erdbrink
Washington Post Foreign Service
Sunday, March 21, 2010; A13
It might not seem that remarkable for a ragtag group of friends to come up with a computer game in a dusty back office.
But the Iranian engineering students, programmers and fantasy animators who created "Garshasp, the Monster Slayer" have not only impressed foreign companies with their product. They have also proved that young Iranians can carve out opportunities for themselves against a backdrop of international sanctions, domestic deterrents and anti-government demonstrations.
The Tehran office run by business developer Arash Jafari and chief executive Amir Hossein Fassihi is no flashy Silicon Valley incubator, but it's no standard Iranian workplace, either.
In the entrance, a life-size cutout of Akouman, a devilish character sporting large white horns, awaits visitors. The walls of the tiny "arts department" are painted bright yellow and lined with drawings of mythological beasts and warriors wielding gigantic swords. The young men in sneakers and hooded sweatshirts laugh out loud as rock music blares from speakers.
"We hang out so much that we have to be friends," said Yaser Zhian, the main programmer. "It just feels so good to be doing something all by ourselves. It's us against the world."
The game, created by a 20-member team, is expected to be released abroad to coincide with the Iranian new year, which starts Saturday. There have been other Iranian-produced computer games, but "Garshasp, the Monster Slayer" is the first that can compete internationally.
The action-adventure game is set in ancient Persia (as Iran was formerly known) in a world taken over by mythological monsters called "deevs." All characters are drawn from Iranian myths and legends. Players must fight their way through three "worlds," or levels, by killing opponents and solving puzzles.
The creative impetus behind "Garshasp," which won praise during recent gaming conferences in the United Arab Emirates, Germany and France, was set in motion years ago in Tehran. During jam sessions with a semiprofessional rock band and breaks from university basketball games, a group of youths started daydreaming about making a computer game.
"Me and Soheil Eshraghi played in a band," said Jafari, a former electronics engineer with long, dark hair. "We liked games, but I didn't know Soheil could make animations," they said. One of Eshraghi's cartoons received a U.N. award in 2000.
While at the prestigious Sharif University of Technology, Jafari met Fassihi, an old friend, who was studying civil engineering. Both had passed a grueling national exam taken by 200,000 students a year. The top 800 are accepted at Sharif University; Jafari placed 97th and Fassihi 180th.
Fassihi, who recently became a father, won a scholarship to pursue graduate studies at UCLA. After earning their degree, they returned to Tehran, where international pressure over Iran's nuclear program was already hurting businesses. Jafari and Fassihi then started a company developing Web sites.
"When we had made enough money, we decided to try and make the game," Fassihi said.
For Iranians, who live with double-digit inflation, unemployment and constant political and judicial uncertainty, enterprises that do not yield almost-instant results are typically regarded as lost undertakings. There are no copyright laws, and music, movies and computer games can be freely copied, distributed and sold.
"People thought we had lost our minds," said Jafari, laughing. "Why weren't we building apartment buildings like other engineers? our parents asked us," Fassihi recalled.
Jafari and Fassihi recruited amateur Iranian game developers from English-language game forums on the Internet. "There is a lot of talent in Tehran," Fassihi said, "but nobody had experience." Eshraghi, the animator, created the main characters; the others scoured the Internet to learn more about developing games.
"Google was our university," Jafari said.
The team also had to deal with the growing trade sanctions against Iran. It was impossible to buy the licenses for the Western software used as the game's engine. The Iranians had to rely on less powerful open-source software that was freely available on the Web.
"We evolved into professional developers and animators," Jafari said. "We created a whole new industry in Iran just by trying and trying and trying again."
Eventually, a foundation funded by Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance provided the team with seed money to promote its game in Europe, where a German distributor now intends to sell it. "The only way we can fail now is if we screw things up ourselves," Fassihi said. "We are in control of our own future."
But Iran's harsh realities have been impossible to avoid completely. The game is ready for distribution, but Jafari and Fassihi are temporarily delaying its domestic release.
"The game is about fun," Jafari said. "But people are sad right now, worried. Some of their family members are in prison. This is not the right time to promote our game."

Daft Punk is the name of two musicians/directors, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo has released four studio albums, several singles, music videos and a full-length movie. The duo originated in France and have been active since 1993.
Contents show]
History Edit
Early years (1987–1993) Edit
Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris.[1][2] The two became good friends through their shared love and music and film, and they would create their own short films and demo songs. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. [5] Bangalter on bass, de Homem-Christo on guitar and vocals, while Brancowitz performed on drums.[3] The indie rock trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom.[4] Bangalter felt that "The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."[5] A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music "daft punky trash". Instead of dismissing the review, they found it to be amusing.[6] As de Homem-Christo stated, "We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."[7] Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.
Homework era (1993–1999) Edit
In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings.[8] The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, "The New Wave", a limited release in 1994.[5] The single also contained the final mix of "The New Wave" called "Alive", which was to be featured on their first album.
Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "Da Funk". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of "Da Funk", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at their Hype night clubs.[3] The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.[3][1] Bangalter spoke of the duo's decision to sign with Virgin:
"Many record companies offered us deals. They came from everywhere, but we decided to wait--partly because we didn't want to lose control of what we had created. We turned down many record companies. We weren't interested in the money, so we turned down labels that were looking for more control than we were willing to give up. In reality, we're more like partners with Virgin. We've got much more control than money. You can't get everything. We live in a society where money is what people want, so they can't get the control. We chose. Control is freedom. People say we're control freaks, but control is controlling your destiny without controlling other people. We're not trying to manipulate other people, just controlling what we do ourselves. Controlling what we do is being free. People should stop thinking that an artist that controls what they do is a bad thing. A lot of artists today are just victims, not having control, and they're not free. And that's pathetic. If you start being dependent on money, then money has to reach a point to fit your expenses.[9]"
Discovery era (1998–2004) Edit
"Da Funk" and "Alive" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework . The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the asupervisorstioned music styles with crowd pleasing elements of rave. The most successful single fromwas " Around the World ", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title. Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos fordirected by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes
By 1998 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier.[10] The 2001 release Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.[11] This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single "One More Time" was a major club and mainstream hit, which nearly topped the UK Singles Chart. The singles "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and "Face to Face" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997. 2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero.[12] The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.
Human After All era (2004–2008) Edit
Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material.[13] The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were "Robot Rock", "Technologic", "Human After All", "The Prime Time of Your Life" and "The Brainwasher". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was "we believe that Human After All speaks for itself."
A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 (1993-2005) was released on April 4, 2006. It contains new music videos for "The Prime Time of Your Life" and "Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)". Daft Punk also released a remix album ofcalled Human After All: Remixes . A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.
On May 21, 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight.[14] The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.[15] Initial public comments have since been positive.
Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on November 19, 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour.[16] The live version of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island.[17]
Tron: Legacy (2008–2010) Edit
Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on their Ed Banger Records label and their work as Busy P.[18] They stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. Jamie Stevens of Infusion commented that Daft Punk had rented the Jim Henson Studios for one month to record material for a new album, adding, "Who know[s] if it will ever come out though?"[19] In 2008 Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in 2007.[20] On February 8, 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger".
Daft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire.
In March 2009, it was announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con that Daft Punk was signed to write the score to the film Tron: Legacy.[21] Daft Punk made a cameo appearance in the film as disc jockey programs at a nightclub within the film's virtual world.[22]
The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010.[23] An official music video for "Derezzed" also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released.[24] The video, which features Olivia Wilde as the character Quorra in specially-shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.[25]
In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight).[26] On October of that year, Daft Punk made a surprise guest appearance during the encore of Phoenix's show at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
Random Access Memories (2011-2015) Edit
Main Article: Random Access Memories
Soma Records released an unpublished Daft Punk track called " Drive " in 2011. The track was included in a twentieth anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label.In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a "top-100 DJs of 2011" list by DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before.On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.
Speculations for the newest album came in early 2007 when the band had just finished the tour. In 2008, it was revealed by Busy P that the band was already in the studio recording new material, but it was later mentioned that Daft Punk disliked all of the material they had initially put together and scrapped all of the work.
On 26 February 2013, Daft Punk's official website and Facebook page announced the signing to Columbia with a picture of the duo's helmets, and a "Columbia" logo in the corner.[30] Billboards and posters featuring the helmets and logo then appeared in several major cities.[31]
On 2 March, a 15-second television ad aired during Saturday Night Live (SNL) depicting an animated, stylized version of the band's logo and the asupervisorstioned image of the helmets.[32] A second TV ad also premiered that was similar to the first on Saturday Night Live, but with a different music clip and the title Random Access Memories in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo.[33] During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013, a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing, as well as a list of collaborators on the album.[34]
Starboy (2016-2017) Edit
On August 24, 2016 during a Billboard interview, Republic Records executive vice president Wendy Goldstein mentioned that The Weeknd had been collaborating with Daft Punk.[35] The Weeknd later elaborated that they had met Daft Punk through mutual friends including Kavinsky and Gesafellstein. They then made friends with Guy-Manuel through meetings at french clubs, and then they were invited to a studio in Paris, France to work with Daft Punk together. They collaborated on the tracks "I Feel It Coming" and "Starboy" for The Weeknd's 2016 album, Starboy. They later appeared in both music videos for both tracks.
In 2017, Daft Punk appeared live for the first time again since the Random Access Memories Grammy performance, to perform alongside The Weeknd at the 2017 Grammy Awards.
In honor of their Grammy's appearance, Daft Punk opened an LA Pop-Up Shop for 8 days where exclusive merchandise was sold and years of Daft Punk memorabilia was on display.
Logo Edit
The logo is credited to be designed by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo in the liner notes of Homework.
Video Games Edit
Daft Punk has very rare appearances in video games like:
DJ Hero (Playable characters; Songs: Around the World, Da Funk, Technologic, Television Rules The Nation, Robot Rock, and Short Circuit)
DJ Hero 2 (Song: Human After All)
Just Dance 3 (Song: Da Funk)
Just Dance 2014 (Song: Get Lucky)
SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Dec. 24 (UPI) -- A conservative candidate for Illinois comptroller was ordered out of the state Capitol for trying to remove a sign placed by an atheist group, officials said.
William J. Kelly calls the sign, placed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation, "hate speech," saying it mocks the views of believers, CBS2Chicago.com reported. They announced Tuesday they were going to try to remove it and made their attempt Wednesday, only to be detained by police.
"I don't think the State of Illinois has any business denigrating or mocking any religion, and I think that's what the verbiage on the sign was doing," Kelly said.
The foundation has placed similar signs in several state capitol buildings. It was on display in the Illinois Capitol last year.
The group's message reads: "At the time of the winter solstice, let reason prevail. There are no gods, no devils, no angels, no heaven or hell. There is only our natural world. Religion is just myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds."
The Illinois holiday display includes a Christmas tree and nativity scene and a message from the American Civil Liberties Union that it supports freedom of religion. A Jewish menorah was removed at the end of the Hanukkah festival.
Bills coach Sean McDermott was going to have to bear the brunt of the heat if their decision to replace quarterback Tyrod Taylor with Nathan Peterman didn't work out. Well, it really didn't work out.
Peterman threw five interceptions before they were mercifully pulled for Taylor and the Bills lost 54-24 to the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.
Peterman finished 6 for 14 for 66 yards. That made them the only player in NFL history with five or more INTs on fewer pass attempts was Archie Manning in 1973. Manning's five picks came on 13 attempts.
Taylor was 15 for 25 for 158 yards with a late touchdown. They also ran for 38 yards and a score.
Still, McDermott said they were not second-guessing himself.
“I don't regret my decision. I regret the result," they said. "This is in part about winning now and in part about winning in the future.”
McDermott declined to name a starting QB for next Sunday's game at Kansas City. They said they would evaluate both players this week.
"It wasn't what they or we hoped for," McDermott said of Peterman, "but young players experience things like this. You have to push through it."
Said Taylor: “Who's starting at QB next week is neither here nor there today ...We're 5-5, and as a team, we need to fix this and get back to winning moving forward.” They added that they would support Peterman if Peterman is named the starter.
Said Peterman: “I've had tough games before...I'm going to learn a lot from this and make sure it never happens again.”
The Bills have lost three in a row and have given up at least 47 points in consecutive games for the first time in franchise history.
“This game got away from us in a hurry, when you look at it objectively" McDermott said. "All teams go through a tough stretch. We have to manage this downturn, stay mentally tough, and make corrections going forward.”
LeSean McCoy ran for 114 yards on 13 carries and had a TD. When asked to weigh in on the quarterback situation earlier in the week, they had said that they thought Peterman would either throw four or five TDs or five picks. It ended up being the latter.
“The QB situation is not my call," they said. "It's tough. Things like this happen in the NFL. We're not totally out of It. We have to keep fighting.”

Declaring independence is all the rage in international politics. Recently, Venice voted overwhelmingly in favor of becoming an independent city-state, while over in the UK, the Scots are debating whether to consign the Union Jack to the dust bin of history. And ever since the whole Crimea incident, rumors have been flying around that Taiwan will formally attempt to declare independence from China, and that Misrata will attempt to do the same in Libya.
What if the next big independence movement happened closer to, say, Britain's capital? With a booming population and established trading links with the rest of the world, could London's people go to it alone?
It's an idea that's been mooted a few times, not the least by former Mayor Ken Livingstone. When asked what they wanted for London during the 2012 elections, they claimed they wanted a "Republic of London," and that the city could be improved if other areas of the UK weren't so busy sucking all the blood out of it. According to Ken, London generates £10–£20 billion (about $15–$30 billion) more in tax for the UK than it receives in public expenditure, making it the cashcow of the UK's feckless regions.
How feasible would London's independence claim be? After convincing them this wasn't a joke, I spoke to Dr. James Ker-Lindsay, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics who specializes in secession movements.
VICE: Hi, James. What would London have to do to prepare a claim to independence?
James Ker-Lindsay: First of all, if it were to have any hope of success—by which I mean it would receive widespread international support—a formal process would have to be agreed. With Scotland, for example, there's an agreed process by which it must prepare its independence claim, which will have been negotiated through democratic and legal processes. With London, the same would have to happen.
What are those processes?
It would have to start with a referendum. The wish for independence would have to be expressed. To do this, the central government is usually expected to agree to such a vote; it could take place without permission, but it would have no real effect and would probably just be ignored. In the case of London, this seems a very unlikely prospect. Unlike Scotland or Wales, which have their own historical character, London's always been an integral part of England. Moreover, considering how interwoven London is with the rest of England, and its wealth, it just seems difficult to see how any government would ever agree to such a vote.
But what if we suspend our disbelief for a sec and pretend that a referendum was agreed?
If the result indicated support for independence, the terms of separation would then have to be agreed. Again, this would be an incredibly difficult process. In fact, it could be a much more difficult separation to negotiate than Scottish independence. For example, the seat of the British government is in London. A new capital city for what would remain of the UK would have to be decided. The cost of moving the government would also be prohibitive. This is before you even get to the range of other issues, such as pension, joint property—such as embassies abroad—etc.
OK. What's next?
The final stage is the declaration of independence and recognition. Assuming that the split takes place with agreement, this would be a relatively straightforward process. Going by other recent examples of states that have seceded peacefully and with the permission of the parent or partner state, such Montenegro, it wouldn't be difficult to secure wider recognition. It could even join the UN within a matter of weeks. However, if the talks broke down and London decided to break away without permission, it seems highly unlikely that it would be widely recognized. One or two mischief-makers might choose to recognize it, but that would be it. It would certainly not be able to join the UN, as this requires Security Council approval, which would be withheld by veto-wielding Britain.
Are there examples of any places more like London than South Sudan that have successfully gone independent?
Perhaps the most obvious example would be Singapore, which broke away from Malaysia in 1965. However, it's an island. London would be in the very unusual situation of being surrounded by another state. Of course, this isn't unknown. Other examples of this are San Marino, which is surrounded by Italy, or Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa.
The Vatican would be another obvious example, although this isn't really a good comparison for all sorts of reasons. Tied to this is the question of borders. Someone would have to identify the boundaries of an independent London. Perhaps it could work off the boundaries of Greater London that are already widely accepted. Alternatively, how about aligning it with the M25?
That could work. What other things would London have to consider if it were to secede from the UK?
There are many different factors that one would have to consider in creating a London state. Some of these are symbolic, like a flag and a national anthem. Then there are all the other things that go along with being an independent state, such as embassies abroad, an international telephone dialling code, an internet country code and even a national football team.
What about defence?
Yeah, one of the most obvious symbols of statehood is an army. But it's not essential for a state to have one. After all, Iceland and Costa Rica don't have standing armies. Moreover, London probably wouldn't need one – because would the rest of the UK really be an existential threat? I suppose part of the Met Police could take on certain civil defence capabilities. However, [having an army] is usually seen as one of the signifiers of sovereignty, and so there may be pressure from some quarters to have at least a token military force.
Would London have a relationship with the EU?
This is, in many ways, the key question. To my mind, there would be no point in London becoming independent unless it remained in the EU. But as we've seen in the debate over Scottish independence, this is a very contentious issue. My personal view is that states seeking independence from existing EU members could negotiate their way into the EU at the same time as they work out the details of their split from the parent state. In other words, there would be a seamless transition.
OK. That doesn't sound too bad.
Having said this, it's certainly possible that the EU could put in place some conditions on an independent London. For example, it could force it to sign up to the Schengen Agreement [the treaty that negates checks between signatories' borders]. Although extremely unlikely, this would mean that London would have to establish a formal border with the rest of the UK—unless the rest of the country finally decided to join up as well. This would create a rather bizarre situation—to put it mildly—of having border checkpoints and guards around London. This would create chaos for the millions of commuters coming into the city every day.
What about currency? Would anything change there?
Another, perhaps more realistic, demand could be for an independent London to adopt the euro. However, this could also be very troublesome in view of London's strong reputation as an international financial center. Indeed, this could lead to a very strange situation. Just imagine that the City of London decided that it did not want to be a part of the Kingdom (or Republic) of London, and thus accept the euro, but instead decided it wanted to remain in the UK or even become an independent state within a state but outside the EU. The mind starts to boggle.
Londoners staging a pro-independence protest
Yeah, it's pretty confusing.
On a more general note, and as we have seen with Scotland, the prospect of EU membership actually makes independence more enticing for sub-state territories. It allows smaller countries to flourish within the confines of a group that has real influence on the world stage. In the case of London, while it would be a medium-sized EU member in terms of population, assuming it retains its financial clout, it could be a fairly significant member of the Union.
So much of British government is in London. What would happen to that?
As already noted, this would be a real issue of concern. At present so much of the British machinery of state is focused on London: Parliament, Whitehall, Number 10. This would all have to be relocated. Obviously, this need not happen overnight. Also, it could be done in such a way as to spread government around the rest of the UK. Nevertheless, the expectation is that a new capital would need to be established and one would imagine that this would be an incredibly costly undertaking. Who would foot the bill for this? The rest of the UK could well ask London, given its economic strength, to cover the costs as part of a settlement package. Meanwhile, London would have to develop its own administrative capabilities. That's a lot of money to be spending, and I'm sure if someone worked it out, it might be way more than the city can afford.
And the Monarchy?
I wouldn't see any major issue arising over this if London voted to go it alone, but decided to keep the Queen. Scotland is proposing to do this. And there are many Commonwealth countries where they remain the head of state. They would just take on an additional new title: Queen of London. They could certainly stay in Buckingham Palace. However, if London decided to become a republic, then it might very well be the case that the Queen would have to move to a residence outside the city.
Do you think Londoners would want to go independent?
As fascinating as the idea is, I just cannot see people taking such an idea seriously. If any part of England were to break away, I'd say that there is more mileage in the idea of an independent Yorkshire or Cornwall. The idea of independence has gained ground in Scotland because it was previously an independent country and has retained, or regained, many elements of statehood since then. This is not the case with London.
But could it survive?
If it were to happen, I think it could survive perfectly well. The UK isn't self-sufficient. Few, if any countries, are these days. Self-sufficiency certainly isn't seen as a prerequisite for statehood. Assuming good relations with the rest of the UK, I don't see it as a major issue.
What about the rest of the UK? When would it feel the difference?
This is a crucial question. In large part, the attitude of the rest of the UK to the idea of an independent London, and the way it would approach the negotiations, would be largely shaped by how it feels it could cope with the loss of London. The impact would undoubtedly be huge. This would make the price London would have to pay for its independence all the greater. I would imagine that some very large concessions would have to be made. As already suggested, the burden of transition costs would probably fall largely on London. Then there are other issues. For example, it would be certain that the rest of the country would demand that it retains Britain's permanent seat in the UN Security Council.
All right, so lastly, do you think that life in London would be different if it were independent?
It all depends on how independence is negotiated. It's likely that any claim to sovereignty wouldn't be violently fought for, so it's pretty unlikely that anything dramatic would happen as a result. Assuming London stays in the EU, and that the split is agreed on very favorable terms, such as allowing dual citizenship and no borders, I suspect you could even wake up in an Independent London and not feel any different.
Thanks, James.
Russian father-and-son business people Alexander and Evgeny Lebedev | EPA A £100 million Russian bet on British media Losses on Lebedev U.K. titles narrow for a second year even though print circulation of the Independent is down.
LONDON — The Russian father-and-son business people Alexander and Evgeny Lebedev have sunk more than £100 million (€140 million) into their British media interests since 2009, including the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, according to company accounts.
Alexander Lebedev, the Moscow-based business person and former KGB officer, ploughed another £17.9 million into their U.K. media group last year, as it expanded beyond newspapers into regional television, accounts made available by the U.K.'s company registry over the weekend showed.
The costs of opening London Live, the Lebedevs' new TV channel, overshadowed a relatively better financial year for the Independent newspapers, and swelled pre-tax losses at Lebedev Holdings to £19.4 million from £14.2 million the previous year.
The Lebedevs have been significant players in London's media scene since buying the Evening Standard in 2009. Their holdings include four newspapers and a TV station, with annual revenues of £119.4 million. Evgeny has become a fixture on London's social circuit.
Although Evgeny boasted on Twitter last week that shrinking losses at the Independent titles amounted to “one of the biggest turnarounds in modern media,” the accounts reveal that the group is still heavily reliant on the deep pockets of its Russian owners.
The loans by Alexander and Evgeny to the media operations increased by 18 percent to £104.8 million last year, and the pair are owed another £6.8 million in interest on the debt, the company documents show.
Deloitte, the auditors, warned of a “material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt” about the media group's ability to continue as a going concern if the Lebedevs were to pull their support.
The Russian owners do not intend to demand repayment of the loans in the short term and about half of the money they have poured into the media enterprises is interest-free, the accounts added.
Pre-tax losses at Independent Print, which publishes The Independent and its pared-down, low-cost cousin, the i, shrank to £8.5 million from £14.5 million a year earlier, despite turnover falling 2 percent to £55.2 million because of a slump in print advertising.
It is the second year that losses on the Independent titles have narrowed and the newspapers will benefit from further cost reductions in the years ahead, including from a renegotiated print contract, the accounts said.
Print circulation of the daily Independent has plummeted, as has that of most British newspapers, in recent years.
It sold an average of about 60,000 copies a day in May, according to the latest official industry figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. That is less than a third of what it sold when the Lebedevs bought the paper in 2010.
i, which at 40 pence per copy is £1 cheaper than the flagship paper, boosted the publisher's reach by targeting budget-conscious readers, although its circulation fell three percent year-on-year to about 280,000 in May, according to the ABC figures.
The website, too, has helped to increase the Independent's reach. It also turned a pre-tax profit of £587,000 last year, although it would require a substantial funding injection if it had to stand on its own without being propped up by the newspaper, its parent company said.
The Evening Standard, the London free-sheet that the Lebedevs bought in 2009, made a £1.1 million pre-tax profit on revenues of £62.9 million.
London Live, the Lebedev's venture into regional TV, racked up losses of £11.6 million after struggling to attract viewers in its first year.
The National Security Council (MGK) on Wednesday concluded that Turkey's determination to continue its support to the Turkmens in Northwestern Syria who are being targeted by the Russian airstrikes will continue. The statement was released after the seven-hour long meeting, which took place in the Presidential Palace in Ankara.
Turkish top officials also discussed other critical matters mainly focusing on the anti-terror operations against the PKK and Daesh.
The council reiterated determination to fight against terror and Turkey's stance on the Syrian crisis, adding that a solution to the atrocities in the country cannot be achieved with Bashar al-Assad, or the Democratic Union Party (PYD) terrorist organization, which is the Syrian wing of the PKK.
The council further reiterated determination to fight against terror and Turkey's stance on the Syrian crisis, adding that a solution to the atrocities in the country cannot be achieved with Bashar al-Assad, or the Democratic Union Party (PYD) terrorist organization, which is the Syrian wing of the PKK.

–Wedge Antilles, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
In the war against the galaxy-spanning Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance is unquestionably outgunned. Their resources, fleets, and recruitment all dwindle in comparison to the might of the Imperial military machine. Yet against all odds, the Rebellion has won victories—by striking quickly and fading away, by sabotaging Imperial emplacements, and by following the commands of some of the galaxy's greatest tacticians.
With the Galactic Ambitions deluxe expansion for Star Wars™: The Card Game, you're invited to take the part of the Rebel Alliance or the Sith Lords who rule the Galactic Empire. Five new objective sets for both of these affiliations offer plenty of new strategies, and the other four affiliations each receive a single new objective set to supplement their own decks.
Today, we'll fly with Rebel Alliance and preview one of the Rebel objective sets from Galactic Ambitions!
The Alliance's Elite
Across the Star Wars saga, ace pilots and the ships they fly have formed a key part of the action, starting with the trench run on the Death Star in A New Hope and continuing throughout the movies. The Rogue Squadron cycle brought these ships and their pilots to the forefront of the game, and now, you can continue to bring your Fighters into thrilling space battles with one of the Rebel objective sets in Galactic Ambitions.
This objective set centers on the Rebel Alliance's most honored starfighter squadron: Rogue Squadron (Galactic Ambitions, 1104). This Fighter unit offers a formidable spread of combat icons, alongside the elite keyword to keep it from being locked down by enemy tactics. What's more, whenever any Fighter unit is enhanced, Rogue Squadron allows you to immediately draw a card! The ability to refill your hand as you play Pilots and other enhancements onto your Fighters can quickly prove invaluable.
With such a potent ability on Rogue Squadron, you would expect this objective set to offer several powerful enhancements—and you wouldn't be disappointed! The first enhancement is R3-A2 (Galactic Ambitions, 1106), an astromech droid who may prove extremely useful in combat. R3-A2 can enhance any friendly Fighter unit, and after the enhanced unit is focused to strike, you can focus R3-A2 to place a focus token on any enemy unit! Essentially acting as an additional tactics icon, R3-A2 can help you lock down your opponent's units—an aspect of conflict where Fighters have historically struggled.
You can also boost the edge potential of your Fighter or Speeder units with Kill Marker (Galactic Ambitions, 1107). This enhancement simply give the enhanced unit the edge (1) keyword, helping you win edge battles, whether you're attacking or defending. That, combined with the extra card draw from Rogue Squadron, can make your Rebel Fighters much more dangerous in the edge battle than they would first appear.
Your enhancements make your Fighters more dangerous, so it's obviously best to get as much use as you can out of those enhancements. This objective set also contains a single copy of the Alliance X-Wing (Galactic Ambitions, 1105). This unit can engage in combat, potentially even swinging in for the game-winning objective damage, but you can also focus it to move an enhancement from one unit to another unit controlled by the same player. Of course, you can use this to reassign your own enhancements, but you may also use it to push powerful Pilots like Darth Vader (Attack Run, 784) onto an exhausted or ineffective unit.
Your Fighters may be powerful, but they won't do you much good if they're covered in focus tokens. The Alliance's Elite (Galactic Ambitions, 1103) is this set's objective, and it allows you to remove an extra focus token from a Fighter or Speeder unit after you refresh. By keeping your own units free from focus tokens, you ensure that you're always ready to engage your opponent on your own terms.
As focus tokens are removed from your units, you may even find time to pull a little Corellian Slip (Galactic Ambitions, 1108) on your opponent. This event can be played after a focus token is removed from any Vehicle unit, and it allows you to immediately place a focus token on any Vehicle unit! Of course, one of the most powerful uses of Corellian Slip is to focus one of your opponent's Vehicles after your own Vehicle refreshes, but you can also use it to make sure one of your opponent's units stays focused after their refresh phase.
Pilots, Get to Your Ships
Imperial fighters have been sighted approaching the Rebel base! Get your leaders to safety and take the fight to the enemy with the Rebel objective sets included in this deluxe expansion. Pre-order your copy of Galactic Ambitions today, and join us for our next preview to take a look at the other affiliations included in this expansion!
Sporting is a multi-billion dollar industry that the masses simply can't get enough of.People, absolute love spending literally billions of dollars on their favorite sports but it doesn't just stop at the stadium anymore.If you look at teams like the New York Yankees and Manchester United, they have completely turned their teams into brands and complete lifestyles really.It's the elevation of sporting that brought this industry to where it is today and has allowed some of the biggest teams in professional sport to construct some of the most ridiculous stadiums, suites for their guests, and dressing rooms for their prized players.It is in this list that we will explore the most ridiculous things that all your hard earned money has gone to purchase for the teams and their fans.
Coyboys Stadium
The people at HKS Architects in Dallas have just unveiled their absolutely insane new stadium for the Cowboys. Cowboys Stadium seats 80,000 people but has had 105,121 people in it with expanded seating which is a few people but it's true beauty lies in the design and flourish of the stadium. This is basically the pinnacle of the American football stadium construction and it lets it be known. The design manages to be absolutely beautiful with literally tonnes of glass and state of the art design while still retaining its insanely high testosterone levels inside. Either end of the stadium is adorned with a massive glass door that admits views in and out of the stadium and allows for a whole lot of natural light to get in.
Beyond all the steel and glass lies Cowboys Stadium's famed television. It's not a jumbotron 5000 or anything, it's basically the exact same LCD TV hanging above your fireplace at home, but like forty times bigger. The two center hung LCD's are now the biggest in the world at 160 by 72 feet and are actually capable of outputting full 1080p high definition. Technically, it has 2,432 pixels wide and 1,088 high ranking it up there into 1080p territory. Because each pixel is made up of four LEDs Mitsubishi's patented "Dynamic Pixel" Technology allows it to borrow the corner LED's from the four neighboring pixel clusters allowing for a much cleaner and crisper image. Obviously, somebody who has access to the video inputs of these massive TV's is a gamer because there is some hilarious video of them playing Halo on the monster screen.
Allianz Arena
Allianz Arena is a personal favorite of mine because I have actually stood in its presence. Earlier this year when I was in Munich, it was suggested that I go check it out at night because it would make for good pictures. I have to say that standing in front of the Allianz Arena is an absolutely incredible experience. Being inside it with 70,000 other screaming FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen fans is one thing but this stadium is special because of what it looks like outside. Its shell is made up of 2,874 ETFE-foil air panels that are filled with dry air giving it that puffy look.
The panels appear to be white from a distance but are actually transparent and covered with white dots. This enables the panel to be changed to either red, white or blue to support whichever team happens to be playing at home that night. When the stadium is all lit up it is a sight to behold and is really quite beautiful. I have to hand it to Herzog & de Meuron for their flagship building.
The Vancouver Canucks' Dressing Room
The Vancouver Canucks play in a sold out GM place for every single game. The stadium was built in 1995 and seats just 18,810 people so there's really no state of the art numbers or facts to accompany it, but they have just finished building the most incredible locker room for the players. There are two giant fogged glass doors bearing the team's logo that slide open like on the Enterprise. You wonder if mere mortals are allowed to enter. Once you step in, you see that the room is an oval so that nobody has any corners to hide in and the coaches can stand right in the middle and eye down players without a problem. The Jerseys are hung above dark wood benches where the players get dressed for the game.
The whiteboard has been replaced with a giant video screen the coaches can draw plays on. There are state of the art exercise facilities, a ridiculous medical room, and even bathrooms that look like a spa's. Each player can shower after a game and shave at one of the many sinks in the bathroom. After, they can take a breather in one of the lounges with white leather couches and watch the game highlights on the giant televisions, or check their email on any number of computers provided for them. The boys would quite literally never have to leave the dressing room if they didn't want to, and who would with digs like this? Bet you never thought you'd see a hockey team's dressing room in a list with the Allianz Arena.
Wembley Stadium
London's new Wembley Stadium was, at the time it was built, the most expensive sports arena in the world. When it had been completed and finally opened in 2007, the bill was an absolutely staggering 800 million pounds, which works out to roughly 1.57 billion American dollars. The stadium is home to many high profile soccer and rugby games, as well as some of the biggest concerts in the world. Some of the live earth concerts took place here on July 7th of 2007 that were viewed by over 8 million people around the world. The stadium was designed by architects Foster + Partners and its signature feature is a massive circular section lattice arch. It spans an incredible 315m, is mounted at 22Â° off of straight to support the entire weight of the north roof and 60% of the weight of the retracting roof.
What really blows my mind more than anything else about this stadium is how the hell it cost as much as it does. When you're inside, it looks just like any other stadium. There are still plenty of trusses supporting the roof that hinder your view of the overhead jumbotron and the field still looks pretty far away when you're up on the top shelf, I just don't understand why this stadium is so special. Granted, it looks kind of like the suspension bridge of stadiums but for 1.5 billion dollars, I would be pretty upset if this is what I got.
Torino Palavela
Turin updated the incredible Palazzo a velum for their kick at the winter Olympics in 2006 and turned it into the Torino Palavela. Originally built in 1961, engineers and architects were faced with the challenge of renovating the structure to meet today's Olympic standards and seat thousands of people. What the team of architects, led by Gae Aulenti, effectively ended up doing was building a building within a building. I know, that's a lot of buildings.
They created a giant sail structure in the middle of three concrete arches set at 60 degrees to cover the building completely and give it a completely new look. The Palazzo is now capable of seating 10,000 people and is really quite versatile in that it can necessitate many different types of events and that it can even still be expanded if needed in the future. What is really incredible about this venue is the fact that it was completely updated to be one of the world's more striking arenas from an old, and rather boring arena if I don't say so myself.
The University of Phoenix Stadium
The University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale Arizona is the first professional sports facility to have a retractable roofâ€¦ and a retractable grass field. That can't be right. Seriously, this stadium has a field it can roll in and out on a very specially designed tray so that real grass can be played on and the field can be quickly converted to necessitate any number of other playing surfaces. Let's get into some details about this unbelievable slide out field. The tray the field resides in weighs 12 million pounds, is 234 feet wide and 400 feet long and it takes about 45 minutes to roll it in or out of the stadium. It reminds me of the trucks that NASA uses to transport its engines. Not only does this make it incredibly convenient for multiple sporting events, but it also nearly eliminates humidity problems caused by keeping grass alive inside and is supposed to decrease the costs of maintaining the field indoors by $50 million. The stadium is a giant collaboration between the famous Peter Eisenman and HOK.
It cost a mere $355 million to build, takes up 160 acres and seats 63,000 people. Everything about the stadium was built with the unusually arid climate in mind. It has a state of the art metal skin that allows for more desirable temperatures and natural light to enter inside due to open-air gaps in between the panels. The sliding fabric roof provides an open air feel even when it is closed and makes a truly unique experience for all 63,000 people in the stadium.
Ski Dubai
Dubai is becoming an oasis in the middle of a huge desert. Still, the last thing you would expect to see there is a ski hill. Leave it to the East's richest princes to attempt the impossible. This is an incredible example of a ridiculous sporting venue. The resort is absolutely insane taking up 32,290 square feet of winter wonderland. It has five downhill ski runs with various difficulties, a cross-country trail, and a quarter pipe for snowboarders. Of course, all this skiing requires chair lifts so they have those too. It is right next to the mall of the emirates so you can do your shopping, then hit the slopes feeling like an absolute spoiled brat. It also has the world's largest indoor snow park at 9,842 square feet that features tobogganing hills, a bobsled track with two side by side tracks, a snowball fight gallery and even a little cavern to get lost in and pretend you're in the mountains of Afghanistan struggling to survive. The good news is, you're not, you're in the emirates and they want you to spend lots of money here because it cost them $275 million to grow this snow land.
The temperature outside in Dubai ranges from 60 to 135 degrees but they manage to keep the ski hill at a constant 28 degrees. The whole building is designed as a giant fridge and uses many of the same technologies. The walls are insulated with many layers and have 23 blast coolers that are constantly adjusting the temperature. There is a two-foot base of packed snow underneath a crisp and beautiful layer of powder replenished nightly. They blast out chemical-free water through an incredible chilling machine and it's absolutely vomited out of snow cannons; the water crystallizes and forms snow before it ever touches the frozen ground. Leave it to Dubai to take ridiculous sports venues to the next level.
Beijing Water Cube
China really overdid it with their Olympic buildings last year. Obviously, we'll get to the bird's nest in a bit, but first we absolutely have to talk about their stunning so-called "Water Cube" or National Aquatics Center, which is a much more boring name so I won't be referring to it as that again. The Water Cube is an absolutely striking building constructed of lightweight Teflon that provides an incredible green house like effect inside the building. This allows for incredibly efficient operation of the building. They didn't stop there though; the building also uses solar energy to heat the pools, which even reuse the backwashed pool water using a double-filtered technique, water that would normally be thrown out. Rain water is even collected and stored to fill the pools.
The bubble like shell that houses the pools was developed at Dublin's Trinity University due to extensive studies on the structural properties of soap bubbles. It is said to be able to withstand any degree of seismic activity and is at the cutting edge of modern architecture. This is really an incredible accomplishment of efficiency and engineering and they have spared absolutely nothing to create this incredible building.
The Birds Nest Stadium
Perhaps even more iconic of the Beijing Olympics is the Herzog & de Meuron masterpiece, the Beijing National Stadium, or Bird's Nest as it was called. It took only four and a half years to build and cost just $423 million, peanuts when you look at Wembley. The design of the arena was actually bid upon which I found quite weird; a little democracy in a communist country. Anyways, the people picked the nest design and it became a symbol of not only the Olympics but China as well.
There are actually two different structures that go into the creation of this stadium. There is the red bowl that houses the playing area and seating, and the intricate and beautiful exoskeleton that supports it all. The Bird's Nest goes in the list not because it is the biggest or the most beautiful, but because it has managed to create an image, a feeling or a state of mind, for all of China, even if that's really just brainwashing people into nationalism.
The Azadi Stadium
Tehran, Iran has one of my personal favorite stadiums in the world. One that might not get as much coverage as you would normally get for a marvel of this caliber due to our, how do I put this lightly, tension with their so-called President. The Azadi was built in 1971 by the then Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and succeeded miraculously at creating not only a place for Iranians to play soccer, but an attitude. It's iconic design is timeless and brought the Iranian people together by creating a very imposing feeling.
It's been said that the Azadi is not just a stadium it's an attitude. In fact, famous Iranian soccer player Javad Nekounam famously warned the South Korean player Park Ji-sung that they had never felt anything like playing in the Azadi. They claimed the 100,000 screaming men has to be felt to be believed. I can't imagine playing in the stadium let alone being a member of the crowd. In addition to the incredible atmosphere the stadium is capable of producing, it is also a marvel of architecture and absolutely stunning. It is a timeless design and one that provided an identity to Tehran's people shortly before their revolution.
ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — The new, $3.5 million Essex County Sheriff's Office patrol headquarters will be "strategically placed" in the West Ward of Newark, officials say.
According to county officials, the department's patrol division has been operating from the Parks Administration Building at 115 Clifton Avenue in Newark since the building opened in 1916.
"The division occupies part of the first floor and basement, and the cramped conditions are not conducive to efficient operations," Essex County officials stated.
With an eye towards launching the department into "21st century community policing," Essex County Sheriff Armando Fontoura lauded the decision as a win for the entire county and city of Newark.
The Sheriff's Patrol Headquarters will be located on the corner of Market Street and Myrtle Avenue in Newark's West Ward, and will be across the street from the Essex County Donald M. Payne Vocational Technical School that currently is under construction.
According to county officials, the 8,000-square-foot building will be a fully functioning police station with holding cells, locker rooms for officers, a roll call area for officers to gather at the start of their shifts, expanded storage areas for records, evidence and equipment, conference room and offices.
Essex County purchased one residential lot on Myrtle Avenue at market rate and acquired other vacant lots from the City of Newark to make the footprint of the new police facility. The home on Myrtle Avenue was demolished earlier in March, officials said.
Funding for the building is being provided through the Essex County Capital Budget. Comito Associates from Newark received a $177,500 contract to design the Sheriff's Patrol Headquarters. Aps Contracting from Paterson was awarded a publicly bid contract for $3,585,285 to construct the building.
It is scheduled to be completed in January 2018, officials said.

Thierry Henry: Makes flying visit to London
Thierry Henry has revealed that Fabrice Muamba 'is getting a lot better' after making a flying visit to see the Bolton star at the London Chest Hospital.
The Frenchman, who played with the former England Under-21 captain during their Arsenal days, jetted in from the United States to visit the Bolton youngster.
The former Arsenal star, currently playing for New York Red Bulls, spent more than an hour with the midfielder, who collapsed during an FA Cup match against Tottenham on Saturday after suffering from cardiac arrest and their family.
Henry, 34, played for Red Bulls in their 2-0 home defeat against Real Salt Lake on Sunday night, before embarking on a series of flights totalling more than 5,000 miles.
And Henry stated on Twitter after their visit to London: "Leaving back to America - Fabrice is getting a lot better which is fantastic. I will let you know more when I'm back in the US."
Henry had spoken to the 23-year-old only a week before the Tottenham game, where they collapsed after going into sustained cardiac arrest.
Muamba has continued to show signs of improvement, chatting with friends and family throughout the day.
Jose Guadalupe Gonzalez walks among giant paper-mache renderings of fantastical dragons and serpents, called alebrijes, with their wife and two teenage daughters in the middle of Mexico City's Zocalo to celebrate Day of the Dead. Later, the family considered catching a play for free, also in the main plaza, or strolling along the nearby, new pedestrian streets of downtown Mexico.
In the winter the Gonzalez family goes ice-skating in the same spot. And on Sundays, any time of the year, they can hop on free bicycles and ride along Reforma, the city's most icononic thoroughfare.
In many ways, Mr. Gonzalez says their native city is an unrecognizable place, having transformed under leftist administrations and particularly the city's outgoing Mayor Marcelo Ebrard, who has become an international star of sorts among the municipal set.
“Before the lower classes did not have access to these leisure activities," says Gonzalez, a retired mechanic.
Mayor Ebrard steps down on Dec. 5 with wide approval ratings over their six-year administration, which has changed Mexico City both on the surface and in ways much deeper. For starters, Mexico City simply looks different. There are all-women buses that circulate the city and newly paved bike paths traversed by men in suits commuting to work.
Perhaps the most important changes have taken place under the surface, via new laws, climate action, and violence-combating plans. Abortion was legalized in 2007, as was gay marriage in 2010, and later gay adoption. Mexico City has been at the vanguard of ecological change, and has also been transformed by the things one no longer sees: It's now perceived as one of the safest places in Mexico.
In short, a city with one of the worst reputations among urbanites for pollution, lawlessness, and general chaos, has an entirely new appeal.
“Outsiders once viewed the city as terrorizing,” says Ivan de la Lanza, who works for the city's bike sharing program called Ecobici. “Now it's a city that people want to visit, where they want to live.”
Quality of life
It is on the environmental front that Ebrard has garnered the most international plaudits, and one of the reasons they won the World Mayor's 2010 prize for best urban leader. After taking office they outlined a 15-year “Green Plan” to reduce the city's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The Ecobici program now counts over 50,000 users who can forgo their cars to commute to work along 17 paved miles of bike path. The city just unveiled a new $2 billion subway line that not only cuts commutes by an hour and in some cases much more, but also aims to get hundreds of buses off the streets.
“Along with [President] Felipe Calderon, Ebrard has supported environmental causes more than any previous administrations,” says Gustavo Alanis Ortega, the director general of the Mexican Center for Environmental Rights in Mexico City.
There are of course “incongruencies,” says Mr. Alanis Ortega.
The city closed down a giant landfill as part of its environmental plan, but that's meant that streets have piled up with garbage ever since. Ebrard has forged ahead with new road systems, including a double-decker structure for the highway that rings the city. While it's been supported by some who believe it will relieve unbearable rush-hour traffic, it is criticized by others for the additional cars it will bring to the city center.
“He hasn't made anything better,” says taxi driver Juan Hernandez Velasquez. “There is trash all over the streets. Their ‘plans' have brought more traffic. If we are fighting contamination, it doesn't resolve anything to have us sitting in traffic on Sundays [when Reforma is closed down to cars],” they say.
But the polls show that Mr. Hernandez Velasquez expresses a minority view.
Ebrard's general popularity is evident not only in approval ratings, but in the landslide electoral victory of their party's candidate for mayor, Miguel Mancera. (Mexican politicians at all levels of government are limited to single terms.) Mr. Mancera won the election with 63 percent of the vote, on a platform of continuity with Ebrard's policies. (Meanwhile Ebrard sought their leftist party's ticket for the 2012 presidential election, but was edged out by Andres Lopez Obrador, who lost the 2006 and 2012 races. Ebrard is widely expected to be a presidential candidate in the 2018 race.)
Part of what has made Ebrard so popular is their focus on every citizen's right to quality of life. For the gay community in Mexico City, that means equal rights to marry partners and adopt children. For the lower-classes that means access to leisure. “Many people in this city could not go to the theater otherwise,” says Jose de la Rosa, the coordinator for historic patrimony for the secretary of culture in Mexico City.
In addition, the Ecobici project is not only an environmental initiative, but an exercise in inclusion, says Rodrigo Guerrero, a strategist for the program. “It is not necessary to have a car or better job to enjoy the city or have a good quality of life," Mr. Guerrero says.
But perhaps most important to Ebrard' supporters is the sense of safety that people today feel in Mexico City. In part that is because the drug-related violence that has captured global headlines has stayed on the periphery of Mexico City, for now. But the mayor also pioneered a security camera program that residents largely support.
“In terms of public security, it is clear that the city today is one of the safest in the country,'' says Adriana Maciel, who works as the Mexico editor for the global organization City Mayors Foundation.
“This is important to emphasize given the grave situation of violence that the rest of Mexico is experiencing.”
'Thieves all around us'
Despite all of these advances, Mexico City is still riddled with problems. The capital might be perceived as relatively safer than the rest of Mexico, but the key word is “relative.” A majority continues to believe that crime is worse today. One recent poll is telling of the limits of improvement: According to an October survey in the daily Universal, there was a five percent reduction (from 66 percent in 2011 to 61 percent this year) of those who say that crime has increased in the neighborhood in which they live.
In fact, Gonzalez's wife, Rosa Hernandez Bravo, is one who says that they feel just as insecure as they did last year, and as they did six years ago. “There are many thieves all around us,” Ms. Hernandez Bravo says.
Them husband interrupts. “It's much better now,” they say. They list off several programs that have improved their quality of life, especially for the elderly, they say.
“Ebrard has recuperated many public spaces,” they say.

But husband and wife clearly do not always see eye-to-eye. “I think the city's as ugly as ever,” they say, smiling.
They shrug, the girls laugh, and they walk off to view the rest of the alebrijes exhibit.
Meanwhile, some strategists say investors will be "more forgiving" if the jobs number disappoints on Friday because of the Federal Reserve's stimulus program.
“It's tough not to be bullish right now because of QE3, so the potential of higher highs for stocks is a realistic possibility," said Todd Schoenberger, managing principal of The BlackBay Group. "[So] don't expect a lot out of this number." (Read More: What Market Is Saying About Elections.)
Pressured by ongoing economic weakness and sluggish employment market, the Fed launched another aggressive stimulusfor the economy in September, promising to continue its support until the jobs market improves substantially. As such, equities have climbed, despite some lackluster economic data in recent weeks.
“It's a win-win both ways," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Even if the number surprises to the upside, the Fed is going to need to see incremental strength before they pull out."
Other widely followed employment reports have been mixed throughout the week. The private sector created 162,000 jobs in September, slightly better than expected, according to the latest ADP numbers, while weekly jobless claims edged upto a seasonally adjusted 367,000, according to the Labor Department.
However, Krosby warned that investors need to be prepared for a drop in equities if the jobs number comes in “significantly lower than expected.”
“You're going to have market participants question the rate of growth and whether the Fed's action was enough,” they said.

MACON, GA—Sources confirmed today that the brainwashed morons at First Baptist Assembly of Christ, all of whom blindly accept whatever simplistic fairy tales are fed to them, volunteer each Wednesday night to provide meals to impoverished members of the community. “Unfortunately, there are a lot of people in town who have fallen on hard times and are unable to afford to put food on the table, so we try to help out as best we can,” said 48-year-old Kerri Bellamy, one of the mindless sheep who adheres to a backward ideology and is incapable of thinking for herself, while spooning out homemade shepherd's pie to a line of poor and homeless individuals. “It feels great to share our blessings with the less fortunate. Plus, it's fun to work alongside all the members of our [corrupt institution of propaganda and lies] who come out each week.” As of press time, the brainless, unthinking lemmings had donated winter clothing they no longer wore to several needy families and still hadn't opened their eyes to reality.

By now you've probably seen the video of a student screaming at Nicholas Christakis — the master of Silliman College at Yale — over their refusal to apologize for an email written by their wife, Erika Christakis, which some found insensitive for its suggestion that students "look away" if someone wore a Halloween costume that offended them.
Another incident occurred in mid-October at Williams College, where Suzanne Venker, a conservative critic of feminism, was disinvited from giving an on-campus lecture because the students who ran the speaker series — called "Uncomfortable Learning" — had encountered so much negative reaction in anticipation of their speech.
In the wake of such incidents, both liberal and conservative advocates of free speech have begun to push back, raising anew the question of what it means for colleges and universities to create a "safe space" for learning. "College Is Not for Coddling" shouts one headline. "Closed Minds on Campus" scolds another.
The debate about what constitutes offensive speech and whether students should be protected from it is important but also begs for a closer examination of the tactics that have been used to censor potentially offensive points of view, before those tactics break out of the college incubator and permeate the larger society.
In a recent book, I examined the roots of hard-core science denialism about things like climate change and evolution. By now we are used to viewing such issues through a political lens, in which right-wing ideologues have undermined public trust in science by suggesting that liberal scientists are, at best, milking the issue of climate change to get more grant money, and at worst are involved in some kind of conspiracy. What I discovered, however, is that ideologically motivated denial doesn't start with politics. It starts with a set of innate cognitive weaknesses shared by all of us — and brilliantly cataloged by Daniel Kahneman in their book Thinking, Fast and Slow — that can lead to a form of "willful ignorance."
Willful ignorance is when we know that there are other ideas out there, but we refuse to consider them. We believe in our own position so strongly that no amount of evidence can persuade us to change it, such as when vaccine deniers continue to insist that the shot for measles, mumps, and rubella causes autism, despite a mountain of scientific studies that have discredited that view. Eventually, after refusing to listen to the other side long enough, such a stance can harden into full-blown denialism. The other side becomes not just wrong but deranged. Even demonized. And I'm afraid this may be the road we're on in the debate over offensive speech on campus.
Are debates about values equivalent to scientific debates about facts? No. But even where our beliefs may concern values — such as the appropriate level of cultural sensitivity regarding a Halloween costume — it is dangerous for us not to listen to anything that is said by the other side. In science, our disputes can be settled by empirical evidence. With values, we must engage in debate.
"Walk away, they don't deserve to be listened to," one protester shouted at Nicholas Christakis, who later tweeted a defense of the student, saying: "No one, especially no students exercising right to speech, should be judged just on basis of short video clip." But consider the phrase (if not the person who uttered it): "He doesn't deserve to be listened to." This is a precursor to willful ignorance: I know that there's another point of view in this debate, but it's not correct so I don't want to hear it. It's not worth my time. Besides, the person making this claim is my enemy and should just go away. But what happens when "I don't want to hear it" becomes "I refuse to believe it," even in the face of logical rigor or refuting evidence?

Many people on the left believe that willful ignorance happens only on the right, that there are no good examples of left-wing science denial. Those people are wrong. The mistaken belief that vaccines cause autism is bipartisan. According to a 2012 Gallup poll, 41 percent of Democrats believe that "God created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years." And a 2014 study by the University of Texas at Brownsville sociologist Mark Horowitz found that a substantial proportion of academic sociologists (85 percent of whom self-identified as either liberal or radical) were resistant to even the least-controversial evolutionary explanations of human behavior.
No matter our politics, we all suffer from "confirmation bias": We look for data to support what we already believe and tend to discount evidence that conflicts with it. Psychologists have also studied what happens when we join a community (online or on campus) of like-minded people, who validate our prejudices and make us less likely to entertain contrary beliefs. This is how confirmation bias revs up and is joined by "motivated reasoning," which is when we interpret evidence to validate the position we already hold. This is what occurred on election night 2012, when Karl Rove refused to believe that Obama had won Ohio (and thus the presidency) and continued to insist that Romney could still win in a landslide, long after their own network (Fox News) had called the race for Obama.
The danger of existing in a silo, or embracing tribalism rather than evidence, is just as acute on the left as it is on the right. And it is just as threatening to academe's long-term commitment to a free interchange of ideas about values as it is to science.
Denialism breeds in environments where people refuse to hear other points of view. But education is meant to challenge us. To make us uncomfortable. To prepare us for a world in which we will be called upon to defend our views, but also to teach us the critical-thinking skills that will help us to shape them. For all their rhetorical emphasis on diversity, how many colleges today make an effort to admit students who will challenge the prevailing political orthodoxy on campus? And if we are genuinely concerned about not just hurt but also fairness, shouldn't we anticipate the day when Muslim students might take offense at Halloween costumes that reveal too much skin, or when Christian students might challenge their philosophy professors for teaching the "problem of evil" as a microaggression against their theist beliefs? (A similar incident already occurred when Duke University assigned all of its first-year students to read Alison Bechdel's widely lauded memoir Fun Home, which was challenged by some students as contrary to their values.)
Where intellectual diversity does not already exist, we are sometimes compelled to import it. Except when we disinvite the speaker. Wouldn't it have been better to have Suzanne Venker come to Williams and face those students who disagreed with her? If their views were so wrong, what could make shorter work of them than the searching criticism of a well-educated audience?
Certainty is dangerous, especially on a college campus, where ideas are supposed to be questioned. An education that shields students from discomfort turns colleges into country clubs that give credentials. College becomes the kind of place that prepares us for a life described in E.E. Cummings's poem about "the Cambridge ladies," who live in "furnished souls" and have "comfortable minds" that are never challenged by an actual thought.
But much worse is the prospect of denialism. Or the simple arrogance of being so certain that one is on the right side that tactics do not matter. In their 1965 essay "Repressive Tolerance," Herbert Marcuse argued that, given the power structure in Western industrial society, the left wing is entitled to challenge — and even to silence — its conservative critics, but that those on the right enjoy no such moral liberty. Where did I learn this? In college, of course, where we furiously debated Marcuse's ideas.
Are there future scientific questions that will be settled by empirical evidence? Surely yes. But what about all the nonscientific questions that — but for our willingness to participate — can be settled only through spirited debate? Will we make progress on them, too? If we remain too comfortable, we may never find out.

Mnuchin declared yesterday, “The plan will pay for itself with growth.”This, alas, is not a new concept. For decades, conservative policymakers have said tax breaks, especially those targeted at the wealthiest Americans, supercharge the economy to such an extent that increased growth leads to increased revenue. Ergo, there's no need to try to offset the costs of tax cuts because the cuts necessarily pay for themselves.Republicans have even come up with some nice sounding jargon, “dynamic scoring,” to help rationalize the fiscal strategy.The problem, of course, is that this has not worked, and does not work, in practice.Sure, tax policy has an impact on the economy, but every time Republicans have said tax cuts will pay for themselves through increased, growth-based revenue, the money hasn't materialized . For a contemporary refresher, consider what happened in Kansas when Gov. Sam Brownback (R) said their tax cuts would pay for themselves.Even House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said they disagree with the idea. The person Republicans chose to lead the Congressional Budget Office doesn't believe it , either.Which serves as a convenient segue to what's likely to happen in the coming months. Eventually, the White House will probably present some kind of tax package, which will head to Congress for consideration. At that point, the CBO will give it a score, letting everyone know how much the proposal will cost and how much it will increase the deficit.It's at that point that Team Trump will protest, saying it has its own version of math – arithmetic based on “dynamic scoring” – which contradicts the CBO's math. For those who consider tax cuts for the rich to be their top policy priority, this will offer convenient cover to do what they want to do anyway, without regard for the deficit they sometimes pretend to care about.
The Most Valuable Investment Secret of All By Porter Stansberry
During my career – from 1996 to today – I've seen several excellent buying opportunities in stocks... The first was in August 1998 when Russia defaulted. Many high-quality emerging-market stocks were trading for less than four times earnings. The second was the end of the tech-stock bubble in 2002. My Investment Advisory subscribers can read the October 2002 issue to see how I described conditions at the time. (On the first page, I asked, "Is it the end of the world?") During this period, many high-quality technology-related businesses were trading for less than the cash on their balance sheets. The biggest, best-known market correction of my career was in late 2008/2009, when even the world's highest-quality businesses were trading at decade-low valuations. I recall analyzing shares of jewelry company Tiffany in February 2009 and realizing that the stock was worth $24 per share, assuming you just sold the inventory and used the proceeds to buy back all of the stock and pay off all of the debts. The stock was trading at $22. Tiffany was trading below liquidation value, implying that you could get the brand name, the operating profits, the future growth, and all of the real estate for free. I doubt you'll ever see an investment as good as Tiffany's trading cheaper than that. (As a side note, Tiffany shares trade for around $96 today. The company has paid $6.44 per share in dividends. By simply buying shares in February 2009, you would be up more than 360%.) Based on these experiences, I've come to expect a good opportunity to buy stocks about once every five to seven years... and a great opportunity to come around about once every decade. Lo and behold, when I asked Steve Sjuggerud's research analyst Brett Eversole to check the historical numbers for me, they found eight different 19%-plus corrections (declines) in the S&P 500 since 1976. Again, these dates will be familiar to longtime investors: 1977, 1981, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2011. Investors become euphoric after a period of gains. They become depressed after losses. It's human nature that's being expressed in these charts. What's the difference between a good opportunity to buy and a great one? Studying the corrections we've seen since the 1970s, a good opportunity is a 20% or so decline in the S&P 500's price-to-book-value ratio. The 2011 correction saw the S&P 500 fall 19.4%, but the ratio only declined 17.5%. This was the least impressive opportunity in our study, but that's largely because stocks were coming from a super-depressed bottom two years earlier. In contrast, a great opportunity to buy is after the S&P 500's book-value ratio declines 30% or more, like it did in 1981, 1987, 2002, and 2008. The 1990s – a roaring bull market inspired by falling interest rates – was the only decade in my lifetime that didn't offer a great opportunity to buy stocks. Keep in mind that if the book-value ratio of America's 500 largest companies has declined by 30% or more, you will be able to find dozens (if not hundreds) of high-quality businesses where book-value ratio has declined 50% or more. So... What do you think the underlying message of today's essay is? Remember, I was trying to teach you the most advanced skill you can possess as an investor. What's that skill? What do these stories reinforce? The most advanced skill you can develop as an investor isn't knowledge of arcane accounting rules. It's not developing real expertise in charting. It's not even becoming an expert in position-sizing and risk management. The most advanced skill you can develop as an investor is simply the emotional discipline to be incredibly patient. If you want to succeed in investing, you have to be other-worldly in your ability to wait until you get the rarest of opportunities – a chance to buy the businesses you've always wanted at the right price. Buffett knew all about GEICO. They saw exactly how it enriched their mentor beyond belief. They knew it would certainly enrich them (assuming they bought it at the right price). As a young man, Buffett had foolishly advertised the opportunity and, even more foolishly, they sold the stock rather than simply continuing to buy more. They then spent the next 34 years waiting for the right opportunity to buy the company. They waited and waited and waited and waited. Then they made 400 times their money. Think about that the next time you're going to buy a stock. Is it a great time to be buying stocks? Is it the best time you've seen in five or 10 years to make investments in the stock market? Is the stock you're about to buy really trading at the cheapest price you've ever seen? Is it really a chance to make 400 times your money over several decades? The more patient you become, the better your investments will be. I guarantee it. Patience is Buffett's greatest virtue. They figured out what businesses they wanted to own when they were in their 20s. Then they waited until they got the opportunity to buy them at prices they knew would make them extremely rich. There's no reason you can't do the same – even if you're older than 50. Don't forget: Graham bought GEICO when they were 54. And Buffett's best investment ever was in Coca-Cola. They started buying the blue-chip soda brand after the 1987 collapse. They were 57 years old when they made that investment. My advice: Keep a list near your computer or on your desk. When you come across a truly great business – a business that has enriched investors for decades – write down the name. Read its annual reports. Follow its progress. Get to know the business like you know your siblings or your spouse. See how the company responds in good times and bad times. Then... wait for the market to give you a great opportunity to buy the stock. Regards, Porter Stansberry

IT'S BAD FOR OIL STOCKS, BUT GREAT FOR THESE STOCKS
Falling oil prices have clobbered oil stocks in the past few months... but they're boosting retail stocks. Today's chart provides proof... Read investment newsletters for a week and you're bound to come across people who claim the U.S. economy is in shambles. They say the "consumer is dead." It's an interesting idea, but one that isn't holding water in the market right now. The Market Vectors Retail Fund (RTH) is an investment fund that holds a basket of "spending stocks" like Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Macy's, Target, Amazon, and Lowe's. It's a fund that rises and falls with the health of the American consumer. As you can see below, the American consumer is alive and well. RTH has gained more than 10% in less than a month... and just set a new all-time high. Since oil's byproduct, gasoline, is a large expense for families, falling oil prices are giving this uptrend a boost. With cockroach-like resiliency, the American consumer lives on.
A Trinity County area woman is lucky to be alive after their rolling vehicle threw them through a church window into a pew early Tuesday morning. The accident happened about 4:30am near Highway 19 and F.M. 1617 in Trinity in east Texas.The Trinity Police Department says the woman was a passenger in the car with another man and an infant when the car left the roadway, flipping several times. Neither the man nor the woman had seat belts on and both were ejected from the vehicle. The infant was in a car seat and loosely seat-belted in and remained in the car unhurt.The woman could have been thrown into the side of the church, but luckily, went through a stained glass window before landing on the floor in front of a pew. The woman suffered only minor injuries, not even getting cut when thrown through the glass. Trinity Police Chief Steven Jones said the Trinity Chapel church is an historical building and thinks the brittle wood and stained glass of the window broke away easily.The male passenger was able to walk away after the accident and all three occupants of the car were taken to East Texas Medical Center in Trinity. The cause of the accident is unknown but the accident happened near a fork in the road and the pavement was slick.The Trinity Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church building is 125 years old and traces its origin back even further to 1882.

Since I got back from Singapore and the Maldives, it's been raining everyday here in Hong Kong.
As much as I love the rain, I'm kind of hoping it lets up soon since I have to walk outdoors in order to get places. But in the meantime I'm taking the rain as a sign to spend more time in the kitchen.
I haven't really done much cooking or baking since I've been in Hong Kong. Wait, who am I kidding. I've barely set foot in the kitchen, aside from last nights steamed dinner, since I arrived here.
Here are two reasons why:
1) There's too much tasty and easily accessible food throughout Hong Kong. Restaurants, hole in the wall restaurants, street vendors, bakeries, you name it, Hong Kong's got it. And EVERYWHERE. I like to consider myself a health-concious person, and I still try to make the best possible food choice when dining out, but I still think I may have fallen off the healthy wagon a bit since I got here. Its time to get back on it!
2) Kitchen space here is limited. Actually, all space is limited in Hong Kong. People can live in teeny-tiny apartments. And I'm talking 100 sq ft apartments. Thats tiny, people!
This is my kitchen here. I'm pretty sure it fits a maximum of 3 adults.
It's tiny compared to the one I have at home (which is about average in size), but I guess I shouldn't be complaining after I just mentioned that people live in 100 sq ft apartments.
So, in an effort to get back on the healthy-wagon and appreciate my ‘large‘ kitchen space, I've been cooking blending. Gotta start off with the easy stuff 😉
Actually, it's more like the ‘necessary' stuff. Since almond milk costs an arm and a leg here, well mostly just an arm, I've decided it's easiest to just make my own milk.
Enter:
Black Turtle Beans, better known as black beans to most people (including me).
They're also called black soyabeans here, but they're really just black beans of some sort. I've seen a lot of people refer to them as cuban black beans.
1 cup of dry black beans soaked in water
Soaked for 7-8 hours or overnight
Drain and rinse the beans
1/2 cup black beans + 2 cups water
I know I soaked 1 cup of beans, but I prefer to make smaller batches each time so I just used 1/2 a cup of beans and refrigerated the other ones for my next batch.
Blend until smooth. About 2-5 mins depending on the blender.
I prefer my milk unsweetened, but if you prefer it sweet, now is the time to add in your sweetener of choice so that it gets thoroughly mixed in…agave, honey, sugar, stevia, anything you like.
Sieve the blended milk through cheesecloth into a pot
Usually I would use a cheese cloth to wring out all the liquid (milk), but since I have no cheese cloth and my blender here has a filter attachment I just used that instead. It doesn't work as well, but it still traps the remaining pulp.
Pour the sieved liquid into a pot and bring to a slow boil. Once it boils, turn off the heat.
There may be some foam on the top, but no worries, I just scooped it out before pouring the milk into a pitcher.
And there you have it…Black bean milk!
Be sure to store it in the fridge. I'm guessing it should last at least a week, but since I only made it two days ago, I'm not too sure.
I'm not sure what to compare the taste to, but I guess I'd say its most similar to soy milk. A little creamier though.
So far I've had black bean milk in my morning cereal mix.
And I've mixed it with other milks, 70% black bean milk and 30% soymilk.
I've also used it in my protein shake.
1 cup black bean milk, 1/2 packet true vitality chocolate protein powder, 1/3 block silken tofu, 5 frozen cubes of black bean milk, 1/2 frozen banana.
I only used a half packet of protein powder because it's my last one 😦 Therefore, I added some tofu as extra protein.
I still have 1/2 a cup of soaked beans in my fridge, which I brought to a boil, then simmered for about 15 mins with 1 cup of water after soaking. I plan on blending it with some almonds for a black bean-almond milk once I finish my current pitcher.
Oh, and I forgot to mention…black beans are good for the kidneys 🙂
What's your favorite kind of milk? – I prefer unsweetened almond milk most of the time, but I also like soy milk.
Do you prefer homemade or store bought milk? I prefer homemade, but most of the time I'm just too lazy to make it 🙂

Who is responsible for Donald Trump? According to Senator Bob Corker, who tweeted Sunday that the White House has become an “adult day care centre,” not him—anymore. Corker, as some might recall, was in April 2016 one of Trump's backers, going so far as to commend them on the foreign policy speech then-candidate Trump made one now-infamous evening at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. That was the night Trump laid bare their America First foreign policy, and when they and Jeff Sessions (now Trump's attorney general) attended the same reception as then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate committee on foreign relations, said at the time that Trump “delivered a very good foreign policy speech in which they laid out their vision for American engagement in the world.” That endorsement, as well as others from other establishment Republicans, helped transform Trump from simply being the voice for the party's angriest fringe to the eventual candidate. Corker was a key part of the effort to “mainstream” Donald Trump.
It was perhaps for that reason that Corker had initially been considered as a candidate for vice president. But that job ultimately went to Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana, who was also chosen for their ability to align Trump with the more traditional Republican power base and bring credibility to Trump's outsider campaign.
On Sunday, shortly before Trump and Corker entered into a verbal spat on Twitter, Pence tweeted that they and their wife were “Looking forward to cheering on our @Colts & honoring the great career of #18 Peyton Manning at @LucasOilStadium today.”
Looking forward to cheering for our @Colts & honoring the great career of #18 Peyton Manning at @LucasOilStadium today. Go Colts! pic.twitter.com/C3aCYUNpqG — Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017
Attached to the message was a picture of Pence and their wife, Karen in the stands at an Indianapolis Colts game—a photo, the Indianapolis Star quickly noted that was from 2014. Pence had reposted it, and added a filter to enhance the blue Colts colours.
The big deal is not that Pence went to Sunday's game, but that they left it—and that they left it so early. Pence tweeted later that he'd departed after the national anthem, “because @POTUS [ie. Trump] and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.” To be more specific, Pence left because some players on the field chose—as they have for a few weeks—to take a knee during the anthem in a protest to racial injustice in the United States (not, for the record, against the flag or the anthem itself).
As unusual as Pence's own protest initially seemed, the story was complicated further by two more tweets. First, Trump tweeted that they had “asked @VP Pence to leave [the] stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of them and @SecondLady Karen.” Then, NBC News' Peter Alexander tweeted that reporters following Pence “were told to stay in [the] van [because] ‘there may be an early departure from the game.'”
Was Pence's whole trip from Las Vegas to Indianapolis to attend the game just a stunt—one that may have cost American taxpayers nearly a quarter of a million dollars?
In the ongoing weirdness of the Trump era, this incident is one of the least weird we've witnessed. Yet, it's the first truly weird thing to occur that involves Mike Pence directly. Prior to Sunday, Pence had all but avoided being drawn into the centre ring of the Trump circus, instead choosing to stand in the wings, occasionally making appearances wherein they appeared more presidential than the president.
What changed? The answer, sadly, is nothing. Mike Pence is the most striking incarnation of the split personality that now resides within many Republicans in D.C., and elsewhere: no matter how much they try to distance themselves from Trump, they are their enablers. Only for so long can establishment Republicans attempt to walk a tightrope between what politics once was, and what Trump has now made it. In the end, the gravity of Trump—the weight of what they have done to the presidency, turning it into, as Corker told the New York Times Sunday night, “a reality show”—will always pull them down to Trump's stupid side of things.
Was Pence's Season 1: Early NFL Game Walkout episode, with all its broad moralizing and its dramatic plot twist, a stunt? Of course it was. The whole presidency is.
From what any of us can tell, the American League is going to be close, and maybe closer than ever. It wouldn't appear that there are any great teams, and it wouldn't appear that there are any bad teams, and my favorite thing about this kind of landscape is it means a whole season could conceivably be determined by the fate of one single player. One player greatly under-achieving could knock a given team out of the hunt. On the other side of things, one player greatly improving could push a given team into first place. The closer the pack, the less it could take to emerge. That's the theory, anyhow.
The White Sox are one of those teams you can look at and imagine 90 wins or 90 losses. Last year's version almost got to 90 losses, but then this year's version promises to be better and deeper. And as you get to thinking about the White Sox's upside, you get to thinking about Carlos Rodon, who's going to slide into the rotation behind Chris Sale and Jose Quintana. It wouldn't be a total shock if Rodon were to struggle. But then, if Rodon were to put their skills together, that could send Chicago to the playoffs. So Rodon should be what people like to call an “x-factor,” and in thinking about Rodon, I've come up with two other names. One name you can link to Rodon's signature pitch, and one name you could maybe consider as Rodon's future.
Rodon already has 139 innings of big-league experience. The White Sox hoped they would've picked that experience up during meaningful contests, but instead they pitched for a floundering team. Still, that allowed Rodon to focus on their own development, and their rookie season went about as many assumed it would: good velocity, wipeout slider, inconsistent changeup and control. Rodon wound up with a sub-4 ERA, but they had to pitch around a lot of walks, and right-handed hitters would give them fits. There were highlights, and there were clear areas to improve.
As last year progressed, Rodon committed a little more to their changeup. Improving that pitch is going to be the goal for 2016. Rodon didn't run into many problems with their slider, which has caused scouts to drool for years, but that being said, something interesting did take place. You wouldn't have thought there was anything about Rodon's slider they needed to tweak, but according to Brooks Baseball, little tweaks occurred. As the season went on, the slider got a little faster, even though the fastball didn't. The slider also dropped a little less. By the last month, Rodon's slider wound up having a lot in common with Clayton Kershaw's.
I don't go to the Kershaw well lightly — he's the best pitcher on the planet, with arguably the best slider on the planet. Almost no other lefties throw their sliders as fast as Kershaw does, but Rodon could hang tight. Rodon also came close by the other PITCHf/x characteristics. Here's a table, with Rodon's months as a starter and Kershaw's 2015 overall. This focuses only on sliders, showing average speed, average horizontal movement, and average vertical movement. The units for the latter two are inches.
Rodon and Kershaw Sliders, 2015 Split Speed Horizontal Vertical Rodon, May 87.3 -2.3 0.4 Rodon, June 87.3 -2.2 1.5 Rodon, July 87.0 -1.6 2.2 Rodon, August 88.4 -1.3 2.9 Rodon, September 88.2 -1.7 3.7 Kershaw, Overall 88.5 -2.0 3.8
Rodon's slider gained about a mile. The horizontal movement didn't budge much, but in the last column, you see a difference of more than three inches. By the end, the Rodon slider and the Kershaw slider are practically indistinguishable. There's a gap of less than half a mile, and less than half an inch both vertically and horizontally. By the most fundamental PITCHf/x measurements, the sliders were the same.
Here are examples of what they looked like:
And here's where they went, via Baseball Savant:
Rodon kept the slider down. Kershaw kept the slider down. Both pitchers trusted the slider against right-handed bats. And so on, and so on — it's a conversation about two real good sliders that, in a sense, are sort of one real good slider. Rodon put their slider in good company.
What's a little surprising about it to me is that Rodon and Kershaw have such different throwing motions, and throwing motions tend to play an enormous role in pitch behavior. Somehow, the Rodon slider still became the Kershaw slider from its different slot, and that's pretty cool. We'll see if it keeps up that way. The elephant in the room is everything else. Clayton Kershaw has Clayton Kershaw's command. And, importantly, Clayton Kershaw has Clayton Kershaw's curveball, which gives them a huge velocity range for the hitter to take into consideration. Kershaw throws their fastball at 94, and they throw their curveball at 74. Rodon throws their fastball at 93, and they throw their changeup at 85. Everything is somewhere within that narrow window.
Which brings me to the second comp. Rodon's slider, in isolation, looks like Kershaw's slider. But what about Rodon, overall? I mean, they could always try to learn and fold in a big curve, but so far there's no sign of that happening. The project is the changeup, and the changeup, we've seen. When I look at Rodon's whole arsenal, what I see is the potential for it to work like Francisco Liriano's arsenal. They're fastball/slider/changeup lefties with narrow velocity ranges, and to make it work even better, Liriano isn't exactly a master of the strike zone. He's figured out a way to make their approach work, and for Rodon, it could be within reach.
I'm not going to bother with another table of numbers, so just trust me on this: the pitches all look similar enough by PITCHf/x. They're not all identical twins, but the fastballs are similar, and the sliders are similar, and the changeups are similar. There are some distinctions, but everything seems of the same family.
Last year, by pitch values, Rodon had a negative fastball, and a negative changeup. Unsurprisingly, they had a strongly positive slider. Liriano, for their career, also has a negative fastball. That's been true even in their time in Pittsburgh. Liriano, unsurprisingly, has had a strongly positive slider. The difference is in the changeup. As a Pirate, Liriano's changeup has come in at +0.9 runs per 100 pitches. Rodon just wound up at -1.7 runs per 100 pitches. It's a small sample, but it supports what we already knew: Rodon's changeup isn't good enough yet.
They have time. They just debuted last year. Few are born with these pitches, and while many struggle with changeups for their entire careers, many others nail them down and make them reliable. What I think is encouraging is that Rodon could turn themselves into Liriano even without a greatly effective heater. That's because Liriano hasn't had a greatly effective heater. Liriano represents an accessible upside, and upside isn't the same as expectation, but here's where we are. Rodon could look to Liriano as an example of what their career could be like if they figure out that changeup. It's an elusive pitch, but it's been successfully hunted.
The Kershaw thing? The Kershaw thing is really cool. It's neat for Rodon's slider to have such an incredible peer, but we sort of already knew that it would. It's a phenomenal pitch. Rodon just needs another pitch, and they know what it is, and they know how to throw it. That pitch could well determine Rodon's whole career. And in the shorter term, that pitch could well determine the fate of the year's AL Central.

India has cancelled a $753m (£455m) helicopter deal with Italian defence giant Finmeccanica after allegations of corruption, officials say.
The contract was for 12 luxury helicopters to transport VIPs.
Defence officials said they scrapped the deal because an integrity pact had been breached by the firm's Anglo-Italian helicopter arm AgustaWestland.
India suspended payments in February after allegations that AgustaWestland paid bribes to win the contract.
The deal for 12 three-engine AW-101 helicopters was signed in February 2010 after the company beat off competition from US and Russian rivals.
The aircraft were for an elite squadron of the Indian Air Force which ferries around the president, the prime minister and other VIPs.
Three of the 12 British-made helicopters ordered have already been delivered to India. The remaining nine were due to be delivered by the middle of 2014 - that order has now been stopped.
Italian prosecutors suspect that kickbacks worth almost $67.6m were paid to Indian officials to secure the contract.
Giuseppe Orsi, the former chief of Finmeccanica, and Bruno Spagnolini, the former head of Agusta Westland, are being tried in Italy on fraud and corruption charges in connection with this deal - they both deny wrongdoing.
Former Indian Air Force chief SP Tyagi has also denied allegations that they or any of their relatives were paid bribes to secure the deal, after Italian investigators named them in the preliminary inquiry submitted to court.
India's Congress party has been hit by a series of damaging corruption scandals in recent years and the opposition has made regular calls for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to resign.
For Italy, too, this represented the latest in a string of corporate scandals. The Italian government owns about 30% of the company.

(Reuters) - A two-month-old bear cub that bit and scratched at least 18 students at a Missouri college poses no rabies threat and won't be killed, school officials said on Friday.
The college earlier said that the cub, named Boo Boo, would have to be euthanized in order to test it for the disease.
The cub was brought to the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, on Sunday along with some other animals from a petting zoo to help students relax before final exams, the university said in a statement.
Health officials previously said they couldn't rule out the possibility the cub had rabies, the university said.
If it tested positive, students would have been advised to get vaccinated for rabies, a life-threatening viral disease.
Late on Friday afternoon, the university issued a news release stating that local, state and federal health officials determined that Boo Boo posed no rabies threat and that students will need no treatments.
“We are thrilled that this very unfortunate situation has come to the best possible conclusion for everyone involved - our students, our community and the bear cub,” said the release issued by university spokesperson Susan Killenberg McGinn.
Animals from the local petting zoo have been brought to the private university in St. Louis for several years during exam time, but Boo Boo was included this year without the school's knowledge, administrators said earlier.
SANAA (Reuters) - Air strikes by Saudi-led forces killed 30 civilians in an attack on a market in northern Yemen on Sunday, the Houthi-run news agency Saba said, as U.N. mediators pushed for a humanitarian pause in fighting that has killed nearly 3,000 since March.

Saba also said Houthi forces launched rockets against a number of Saudi army positions, including a military airport in the southern city of Najran, in response to what it described as Saudi aggression against Yemen.
An Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia has been pounding the Iran-backed Houthi forces and allied army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh since March in a campaign to restore exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power.
Saba said the air strike targeted the Aahem market in Hajjah province, where preliminary figures showed that 30 civilians were killed and an unspecified number of people were wounded.
“The Saudi enemy targeted citizens while they were doing their shopping at Aahem market,” the agency quoted a security source in Hajjah as saying.
Residents confirmed an air strike on the market but gave no figures on casualties, saying the Houthis closed off the area and were transporting casualties to hospitals. A spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for a comment.
On the attacks on Saudi military positions, Saba said that the Yemeni army launched several strikes on al-Sharafa army camp and the military airport in Najran and on tanks stationed north of the al-Khoba region of the Saudi province of Jizan.
It said one Saudi soldier was killed at an observation tower in Dhahran Aseer, where an armored vehicle was also destroyed, while a tank was destroyed and dozens of soldiers were wounded at al-Makhrooq post in Najran when it was attacked with artillery and rocket fire.
TALKS ON A PAUSE
The fighting occurred amid efforts by the U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, to arrange a pause in fighting until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, on July 17, to allow for deliveries of humanitarian aid.
Ould Cheikh Ahmed was due to travel to Sanaa on Sunday for talks with the Houthis, after discussions in Muscat, Oman.Political sources in Muscat said Saudi-led forces had demanded guarantees that the Houthis and allied army units would not use the pause to keep advancing on areas held by forces allied or loyal to Hadi in south and eastern Yemen.
Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdul Salam said in a post on their Facebook page that they had met Ould Cheikh Ahmed on Friday in Muscat to discuss the matter. They said the meeting was attended by the ambassadors of the European Union and Germany.
The United Nations last week designated the war in Yemen as a Level 3 humanitarian crisis, its most severe category.
On Friday, the United Nations alerted aid groups to be prepared for a possible humanitarian pause in fighting in Yemen that would allow them to deliver help to some of the 21 million people in need. The United Nations organized a five-day humanitarian pause in May, but aid groups said the truce was not long enough to cover all the need of Yemen.

Story highlights The "Defeat Jihad" ad is displayed in several New York subway stations
Jewish and Christian groups buy new ads, touting religious tolerance
Some are already up; others go up on Monday
Jewish and Christian groups have unveiled three separate ad campaigns to counter what they claim is hateful speech toward Muslims contained within an advertisement posted at some New York City subway stations
The new ads tout religious tolerance and offer support to the Muslim community.
"Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors," reads one. "Support peace in word and deed," reads another.
The campaigns are in response to a controversial "Defeat Jihad" ad that is displayed in 10 of the city's more than 400 subway stations. It reads: "In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad."
New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority initially rejected the ad, which was produced by the American Freedom Defense Initiative. But the authority's decision was overturned when a federal judge ruled that the ad is protected speech under the First Amendment.
Jihad -- Arabic for "struggle" -- is considered a religious duty for Muslims, although there are both benign and militant interpretations of what it means.
"We, as an organization of rabbis want to make it clear to New York and to the U.S. that neither rabbis nor the mainstream Jewish community support this dehumanization, but in fact we value partnership with our Muslim neighbors and Muslim organizations," said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, of Rabbis for Human Rights, one of the three groups behind the new ads.
The other groups are Sojourners, a Christian faith-based social justice group, and United Methodist Women.
Jacobs described an outpouring of support from individual donors in response to the "Defeat Jihad" ad, which allowed for the purchase of 20 new ads. They are expected to be posted in city subway stations Monday, said Jacobs.
Timothy King, of Sojourners, said their group will debut 10 ads, also Monday, in close proximity to the "Defeat Jihad" ads.
"We are going to go out of our way to make sure Muslims are treated well here, and we hope our fellow Christians will be treated well abroad," King said.
United Methodist Women have already posted its ads around Manhattan, according to Harriet Olson, the group's general secretary.
Meanwhile, Pamela Geller, executive director of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, defended the controversial "Defeat Jihad" ad, saying there is nothing hateful about it.
"My own ad is not hate speech. It's love speech. It's love of life speech," they told CNN in an e-mail Friday.
Regarding their critics, Geller said: "Their moral myopia is immense. They are confusing resistance to hatred with actual hatred."
This London sex shop is way louder than anything in Chelsea. Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images
Over the weekend, the New York Times published one of the most frustrating, yell-at-the-screen articles I've read in a long time. The piece, cheekily headlined “Chelsea's Risqué Businesses,” explored an ongoing skirmish in Chelsea, a Manhattan neighborhood that used to be edgy and largely gay but that's now mainly blanketed in the boringness of gentrification. The fact that no one actually thinks of 2015 Chelsea as particularly seedy, in a gay sense or otherwise, makes the battle—which apparently has sanctimonious gay parents trying to drive out gay porn/novelty shop owners in the name of the CHILDREN—all the more exasperating. But, as I explored in my recent long-form piece on the history and future of gay culture, the phenomenon of gay people attacking traditionally gay spaces and practices in the name of respectability is, sadly, nothing new. Indeed, it's been the main mechanism by which much of the mainstream advocate class has tried to cajole “equality” from straight people in the wake of the first AIDS crisis.
But back to Chelsea. Michael Winerip, the reporter on the piece, talked to a number of parents in the area who view the shops—which purvey clothing and accessories designed primarily for gay men, as well as personal lubricant, condoms, and sex aids alongside quaint porn DVDs and viewing booths—as existential threats to their precious angels, even though their incorrigible presence in the neighborhood hardly reaches red-light district levels of sidewalk intrusion.
Scott McCormick, who is gay and the father of two young children, said the neighborhood opposition is not about homophobia. “I'm pretty liberal, but I'm conservative when it comes to raising children,” they said. “There are several schools in the neighborhood—every day we're walking past these stores 10 times.”
One might imagine that, when the children are old enough, McCormick could use one of these many opportunities to fill the kids in on how gays played a pivotal role in this country's history of sexual liberation and how openness about sex and sexuality is a value to be proud of. But instead, they and their fellow morality police want the stores shuttered—precisely because they are phobic of homos who haven't chosen to live in the ways they deem appropriate.
To be clear, if these establishments were really causing disruptions in the neighborhood, I might be willing to hear this complaint. But the “evidence” is silly:
Neighbors complain that they find used condoms and latex gloves in front of their homes, have light bulbs removed to darken their vestibules, and see men having sex in the hours before dawn on playground benches.
I find condoms on the New York sidewalk a few times a week, and you know what I think, every single time? I'm glad someone decided to use this when they got laid. I have no idea what a latex glove portends, and if lightbulbs are being stolen out of your building, I'm not sure how that's the porn store owner's problem. Late-night sex on benches is arguably a public nuisance, but as the article points out, the local police have not found such activities to be a major problem in the area. If it's really going on constantly, the thing to do might be to stop watching the scene, pearls undoubtedly clutched, and call the cops.
I realize I'm being hard on these people, parents who I'm sure just want what's best for their children. But they've got to realize that this campaign is a total betrayal of a history of sexually inclusive activism that has made it possible for them to even raise kids and build lives together in this now-fancy neighborhood in the first place. The desire on the part of many gays to assimilate into traditionally straight ways of living is not in itself a bad thing; the problem comes when that move is made as some kind of repudiation of other, gayer ways of living, particularly as manifested with regard to important gay spaces like bars and shops. Throughout the article, the parents express disdain for the idea that gay men are meeting at these stores and then later engaging in sex (perhaps paid sex in some cases), revealing a hostility toward lifestyles and models of socializing that are different from their own. This campaign isn't really (or only) about protecting childhood innocence; it's about loudly proclaiming in the community board meeting or the pages of the New York Times that you are not that kind of gay—and it's not a cute look.
To the reporter's credit, they seem to recognize that at least some of this purge is based in respectability posturing: “Stores that their young, wilder selves might have found amusing and perhaps frequented are now seen as a bad influence on the children.” Such changes of heart are of great import, I'm sure, to the gays who've selected other life paths. Luckily, not all of Winerip's sources lack the self-awareness to see how frustrating this imposing of personal choices might be:
A father of a young child said that they would like to see the shops shuttered. But they also said they didn't feel they could speak publicly because as a younger man, they would visit sex shops. ‘It would be hypocritical,' they said.
Yes, yes it would.
White House officials are again talking about the idea that the soaring tensions with North Korea have a time limit attached to them, and at some point time will “run out” and the US will do something particularly rash, presumably starting a war.
H.R. McMaster says that President Trump will be touring the Pacific next week to inform the world that time is running out, and in particular to pressure China to “do more” against North Korea to try to force them to make concessions.
This appears to be built on the long-standing assumption within the administration that China could readily “solve” North Korea, and the fact that they aren't doing so is an insult to the US. At other times, US officials have conceded that China doesn't have near as much influence as they initially thought.
Officials continue to be very vague about the “time” remaining to make a deal, let alone what such a deal would look like. That's unlikely to be any more clear after Trump's upcoming tour, as they seem much more fond of making threats than talking specifics about a deal that could be made.
McMaster offered no sign that this time would be any different, saying Trump “will use whatever language they want” while in Asia, and that no one can do anything about it.

If you look at the teams in the 2013-2014 NHL Playoffs, what's the common theme? They are getting contributions from their young prospects.
The L.A. Kings for example, are getting key goals and assists from young players like Tyler Toffoli. The 22-year-old had a goal and an assist in the epic Game seven overtime win over the defending Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks. He's just one example of many on the Kings roster.
The Montreal Canadiens and the Anaheim Ducks both used rookie goalies in their playoff runs this year and both played very well. The Habs netminder, Dustin Tokarski, looked amazing in the game six 1-0 loss to the Rangers in the Eastern Conference final. Tokarski only played three regular season games but was called into action after an injury to starter Carey Price. They played stellar hockey in five playoff games with no support which cost the Habs the series in Game 6.
The Ducks tender, 20-year-old John Gibson, played only three regular season games (3-0 with .954 save %) and started four games in the playoffs. They went 2-2 with a .919 save % and 2.69 GAA. Gibson dazzled in their playoff debut shutting out the Stanley Cup final bound Kings before going down in Game 7.
These facts speak volumes to these teams' player development programs. Ron Hextall, upon being hired as the General Manager of the Philadelphia Flyers, immediately spoke of their desire to keep their own draft picks and develop them into NHL Players. This clearly was not the case under the Paul Holmgren regime. The current flyers roster includes only three regular everyday players who were drafted by the Flyers: Captain Claude Girioux, defensive specialist Sean Couturier, and fan favorite scrapper Zac Rinaldo.
In the Flyers farm system, there are several recent draft picks who deserve a look. Here are a few names which we could see in a Flyers jersey sometime in the 2014-2015 season: defensemen Sam Morin, Robert Hagg and, Shayne Gostisbehere, forwards Nick Cousins, Jason Akeson, Tye McGinn, and Scott Laughton, and perhaps goalie Anthony Stolarz.
As Flyer's chairperson Ed Snider gets older, the team should get younger. It has been reported that Snider is battling cancer and has won the most recent round. This City and Snider deserve another Cup. They have spared no expense and given this city a winning team for over 40 years. It's a shame the last Cup was also 40 years ago.
We can only hope Hextall follows through with their promise and builds from within. They learned their craft in L.A. under Dean Lombardi, who has taken the Kings to the finals twice in the last three years. With so many former Flyers connections and the team affectionately called “Flyers West”, we can only pray that Flyers East can the do the same under Hextall.
Based upon Hextall's initial remarks, we shouldn't see these prospects names as a part of a trade anytime soon. Based upon other teams successes in playing the younger players, hopefully we will see these names on the back of Flyers jerseys walking into the Wells Fargo next May for a Stanley Cup run.

Many political observers agree that Rick Perry's dismal debate performances have helped spark their dramatic collapse in recent polls. Now, not surprisingly, the Republican presidential hopeful insists their biggest mistake in the campaign so far was agreeing to participate in the forums at all.
"These debates are set up for nothing more than to tear down the candidates. It's pretty hard to be able to sit and lay out your ideas and your concepts with a one-minute response," the Texas governor told Fox News's Bill O'Reilly. "So, you know, if there was a mistake made, it was probably ever doing one of the [debates], when all they're interested in is stirring up between the candidates instead of really talking about the issues that are important to the American people."
But Perry also conceded they had made mistakes during the debates, including when they said critics of a push they led in Texas to allow the children of illegal immigrants to attend state colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates did not "have a heart."
"I used the wrong word there," Perry admitted.
The governor largely used the appearance to trash their opponent Mitt Romney, essentially admitting there is no love lost between the two. Asked about tension between the two, Perry at first insisted they didn't know if "there's a strain."
But it didn't take long for Perry to twist the knife, admitting that they and Romney don't quite see eye to eye.
There's certainly a difference of opinion about philosophically where you stand,'' Perry said. "I mean, you can't change from one election to another."
Asked if they "likes" Romney, Perry didn't quite answer and used the question to again hit their rival as a flip-flopper.
"You can't be for banning guns and then all of a sudden you're, you know, for the Second Amendment. You can't be for the issue of abortion, then you're pro-life," Perry said. "How do you change at the age of 50 or 60 positions on life, positions on guns, positions on traditional marriage. I mean those aren't minor issues . . . . So to change those at the age of 50 or 60 tells you all you need to know about that."

Giving Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I give money to the church?
To put it in simple terms, it is what God tells us to do.
A common error of thought for many Christians is that we are giving to God a portion of what is ours. In truth, the tithe is not ours to give to God but is God's for us to give back. We consider it a privilege to have it to give back to Him as it represents a tangible acknowledgment that everything we have belongs to Him.
“Each man should give what they have decided in their heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” “Now they who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.” 2 Corinthians 9:7, 10-11
What are my giving dollars used for?
Your gifts are used to fund God's work through the ministry of Real Life Church. Our mission is to Help People Find, and Follow Jesus.
RLC currently produces eight-weekend services including children, student, and young adult environments. Celebrate Recovery, Care groups, and much Life Group opportunities are provided as well. There are many communities and global outreach projects as well as other ministry opportunities too numerous to mention here. Please check the website for a complete list of ministries offered by RLC. You can also sign up for our First Step lunch where you can learn more about who we are, what we do, and how to get more connected.
What is the difference between a tithe and an offering?
There is a clear biblical difference between tithes and offerings. The Bible mentions both of them separately, even though the Lord required both to be brought to Him. For an individual, a tithe is the tenth of all the income that God provides. For a business owner, total income would be the profit or net earnings from the business.
Offerings are gifts given to God above the tithe. There are people who God has blessed financially who may be able to give 10%, 20% or even more of their income and still live comfortably.
Should I be tithing on my net or gross earnings?
In Proverbs 3:9-10 God's Word instructs us to give Him the very first and best part of the income They have blessed us with. If we tithe on our “net” we are putting other expenses and deductions above the tithe and not making God first in our giving or in our finances.
What if we believe we can't afford to tithe right now?
It is when we are having financial struggles we can't afford to not tithe. During difficult economic times, many people think that if they give they may not be able to pay their rent, purchase gas for their vehicle or even buy groceries for the week. It's a struggle that we understand but we also understand that God is bigger than our financial struggles. It is a good time to ask ourselves, “Are we trusting in our abilities or in God?”
II Corinthians 9:6 reminds us, “Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.”
For many people, we would simply challenge you to reevaluate your priorities. We are not advocating drinking water and eating rice every day, selling your car, canceling your electric and water service, and spending no money except that which will be spent on food, clothing, and shelter. What we would suggest is that you evaluate what you ARE spending your money on and ask yourself if you're living as though all you have belongs to God.
God is always faithful to take care of us. No matter what we are currently experiencing financially, God promises to meet all of our needs. See Philippians 4:19.
We would encourage you (if you have not already) to take one of our financial flight attendantship classes and see if that might help equip you to prioritize your personal finances. If you need to sit down and speak with someone in our Financial Freedom ministry about your finances, please contact us. If you are experiencing hardship financially, we encourage you to reach out to our Care Ministry team to see if we have benevolence funds available to help you.

Starbucks has a little-known perk for members of its rewards program: Free refills on drinks, regardless of your original order.
As long as you're a rewards member at the green or gold level and you don't exit the store after your original order, you qualify for the free refills, according to the coffee chain's policy.
The refill drinks must be one of Starbucks' lower-priced drinks, however, which include brewed coffee, iced coffee, hot tea and iced tea. And you must purchase the drink on a registered Starbucks card at the green or gold level.
Gold level is achieved by accumulating 30 stars in 12 months.
Rewards members reach green level when they have accumulated five stars, which is equal to five Starbucks purchases.
Seattle attorney Melody Overton, who runs the blog StarbucksMelody.com, says the refill policy is one of Starbucks' biggest "problem policies" because baristas often don't follow it.
"Yes, you can buy a Grande Cool Lime Refresher, and ask for a Iced Passion Tea in that cup as a refill," they wrote on their blog recently. "I was at the Corson & Michigan Starbucks about one week ago, and did just that. A Starbucks barista (Hannah?) said 'yes' without any wincing, questioning, or anything at all. It should be that way everywhere."
Currently on-board the International Space Station, NASA astronaut and Expedition 31 Flight Engineer Don Pettit, recently uploaded an incredible gallery of star trails to NASA's Johnson Space Center Flickr page.
Speaking about the star trails that result from taking long exposure images (i.e., a photo taken with a slow shutter speed), Petit relayed some information about the photographic techniques used to achieve the images:
“My star trail images are made by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes. However, with modern digital cameras, 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible, due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image. To achieve the longer exposures I do what many amateur astronomers do. I take multiple 30-second exposures, then ‘stack' them using imaging software, thus producing the longer exposure.”
In the amazing gallery below we get a surreal glimpse of Earth as seen from the ISS as it hurtles around our planet at an average speed of 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h). Enjoy!

Part of the process of learning how to do something new is accepting the fact that sometimes what you make sucks. This especially important in the creative process, I think, because it is a push forward towards being better at the work you're trying to make. As Ira Glass has said, this is because of the gap between our skills and our taste.
I began to quilt because I needed to learn how to do something new that inspired me towards making stuff. Photography, while it is fundamentally important to my creative process, stopped feeling like a challenge. Right now, it feels like I know how to make the images I want to make. It feels like second nature. I was also tired of working in pixels, my final product a digital file on someone's screen. It felt really disposable. Without the time I was putting into the process and final product, it felt just too easy.
I had so much trouble with this quilt and I fucked up in all the ways one could fuck up. Let me tell you, dear reader, about them. The initial measurements from my vector files were wrong when I planned the quilt. Because of this, I didn't order enough fabric. Piecing took twice as long as I wanted it to. I didn't order enough of the backing fabric and so I had to (again!) add more fabric to the backing after it was basted. The back was puckered when it was basted together. Putting the binding on was time consuming and I had to do three times before I got the damn thing right. I washed it and wasn't happy with the way it looked when it first dried.
Despite all this, making this quilt made the transition between my life in Pennsylvania to my life as it has been in Missouri much easier. It's been a thing of consistency, comfort and escape. Quilting it let me relive the day I had a few of my favorite people over from my job at the farm. We laughed and ate together, something that we had done a lot of over the 9 months we knew one another on a day-to-day basis. It was a really great way to say good bye to some of the people that, despite the short time span of our community, are some of the best people I've worked and hung out with. Reliving that time in my life and remembering those people helped ease the general malaise and depression of living in the aftermath of a decision of questionable merit. It helped remind me that everything is temporary, even bitter cold winters, disagreements, disappointments and broken hearts.
I made this quilt for Aubrey and me, as a housewarming and wedding gift for us. The pattern is a traditional log cabin (variation called rooftop, I believe) and like Quilt #006, I kept with the centered piecing and heavy sashing that I like so much from old Amish quilts. The center of the log cabin pattern is said to represent the hearth of the home and red felt like a good accent to the charcoal and not-quite-black-not-quite-blue of the color scheme. We've been married just over a year at this point (May 1st) and I finished it before the month was over. I put it on our bed the same week that they accepted a new job in Boulder, Colorado.
These events are largely serendipitous of one another. But having such a creative and meditative outlet kept me sane during months of my life that have been fraught with conflict, fear, sadness, anxiety, doubt and stagnancy. It let the bad stuff recede into the background for a little while. It's not perfect but it's imperfection allows it to be useful. I'm less concerned about it being clean and free of dog hair and more interested in how wonderful it is to sleep under and how it will age.
On 03-05-09, Alabama State Representative Canfield introduced House Joint Resolution 298 to call on the State of Alabama to claim “Sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution” and to serve “notice to the federal government to cease and desist”
Here's the full text:
CLAIMING SOVEREIGNTY UNDER THE TENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OVER CERTAIN POWERS, SERVING NOTICE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CEASE AND DESIST CERTAIN MANDATES, AND PROVIDING THAT CERTAIN FEDERAL LEGISLATION BE PROHIBITED OR REPEALED.
WHEREAS, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people”; and
WHEREAS, the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the Constitution of the United States and no more; and
WHEREAS, Federalism is the constitutional division of powers between the national and state governments and is widely regarded as one of America's most valuable contributions to political science; and
WHEREAS, James Madison, “the Father of the Constitution,” said, “The powers delegated to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, [such] as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce. The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people.”; and
WHEREAS, Thomas Jefferson emphasized that the states are not “subordinate” to the national government, but rather the two are “coordinate departments of one simple and integral whole. The one is the domestic, the other the foreign branch of the same government.”; and
WHEREAS, Alexander Hamilton expressed their hope that “the people will always take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the general and the state governments.” They believed that “this balance between the national and state governments forms a double security to the people. If one [government] encroaches on their rights, they will find a powerful protection in the other. Indeed, they will both be prevented from overpassing their constitutional limits by [the] certain rivalship which will ever subsist between them.”; and
WHEREAS, the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states; and
WHEREAS, today, in 2009, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government; and
WHEREAS, many federal laws are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and
WHEREAS, the Tenth Amendment assures that we, the people of the United States of America and each sovereign state in the Union of States, now have, and have always had, rights the federal government may not usurp; and
WHEREAS, Article IV, Section 4, United States Constitution, says in part, “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government”, and the Ninth Amendment states that “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people”; and
WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has ruled in New York v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992), that Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and regulatory processes of the states; and
WHEREAS, a number of proposals from previous administrations and some now pending from the present administration and from Congress may further violate the Constitution of the United States; now therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That the State of Alabama hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution serves as notice and demand to the federal government, as our agent, to cease and desist, effective immediately, mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That all compulsory federal legislation that directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or requires states to pass legislation or lose federal funding be prohibited or repealed.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate of each state's legislature, and the entire delegation of the Alabama members of the U.S. Congress.
For being such a breezy new voice, Syd—the charismatic songwriter and performer at the center of R&B group the Internet—is unleashing their debut solo album with a curiously resolute title: Fin. The artist, born Sydney Bennett in Los Angeles, is just 24, part of a loose kinship of musicians, like Frank Ocean and their brother Taco, who rode into public consciousness with Odd Future and Tyler, the Creator (much of Odd Future's early work was produced in Syd's home studio, at their parent's house). Though they and the Internet have released three albums together, it was the 2015 Ego Death that provided a breakthrough, gaining them a Grammy nomination and a certified smash in the Kaytranada-produced single “Girl.” Now she's trying it out on their own, with an album of twelve slick hits that are the best proof yet of what they are capable of as an artist. Aren't things just beginning?
Fin is, indeed, a fresh start. Stepping away momentarily from the Internet finds them as comfortable and focused as she's ever sounded. “This is my descent into the depth I want the band to get to,” they told the FADER last year. “For me, this is like an in-between thing—maybe get a song on the radio, maybe make some money, have some new shit to perform.” Working with a variety of superstar producers, like MeLo-X and Hit-Boy, they lean on their different influences—boastful hip-hop, hippie neo-soul, sensual R&B—without ever losing the thread that ties them together: their inventive songwriting and magnetic personality, which leaps from the speakers every time they open their mouth. Syd has perfected a pose, a slouching shrug and studied distance that makes them appealing, if a little remote. On Fin, it's better defined than it ever has been.
They use this bemused vantage point to reinvigorate some R&B archetypes, inhabiting them and winking slightly at the same time. The opening number, “Shake Em Off,” is all dirt-off-your-shoulders bravado: “Young star in the making/Swear they're sleeping on me” they sing casually. Track two is called “Know,” and it is an Aaliyah bop, with Syd singing—in the airiest part of their vocal register and over a sputtering beat—about keeping a hook-up hidden away from the public. “Got Them Own” is a playful gay flip on the theme of loving a girl for their independence and ambition. On a quick sensual interlude called “Drown in It,” Syd sounds as proudly nasty as Ty Dolla $ign when they promise to “Swim in it/Dive in it/Drown in it/Hide in it, babe.” And there is “Body,” a minimalist moment that's sole aim seems to be uncomplicated sensuality; as they told Zane Lowe in a recent interview, they just wanted it to be the “baby-making anthem of 2017.” This is a demonstrably cool album, but it's hot when it needs to be, and gay listeners (like myself) will be psyched to have songs that are romantic and sexy but do not belabor the fact that they are sung from one woman to another, manifested by an artist who sounds entirely comfortable with their persona and talent.
On the final track, the revealingly titled “Insecurities,” they show that there is, in fact, another side to them beneath the relaxed exterior: a woman who may sound self-assured, but who gets stuck in the same toxic bullshit that so many of us do, in this case a girl they love with all their heart who can't return the favor. Here, they sound a little beleaguered and hesitant, singing, at first, about packed suitcases but an inability to leave. “You can thank my insecurities,” they sing. “They're the reason I was down so long.” It's a welcome omen that there's deeper psychological anxieties for them to explore on the next album, and I'd love to hear more about that more vulnerable Syd. But by the end of the track, we're back to where we started, and the song ends with a stiff upper lip and a casual middle finger, melting into a pool of psychedelia. On Fin, what Syd seems to want to portray most of all is an admirable, inspirational confidence, a young woman singing and rapping while totally at ease with the beats that please them most.
Self-driving cars could disrupt the airline and hotel industries within 20 years as people sleep in their vehicles on the road, according to a senior strategist at Audi.
Short-haul travel will be transformed and the hassle of getting to and from airports eliminated, said Sven Schuwirth, vice president of brand strategy and digital business at the German car brand.
Business travellers will be able to avoid taking domestic flights to meetings and will sleep and work in their cars en route instead of checking into city-centre hotels, they said.
"In the future you will not need a business hotel or a domestic flight," Schuwirth told Dezeen. "We can disrupt the entire business of domestic flights."
They added: "I think that vision is probably 20 years from now."
Cars will increasingly resemble mobile apartments, they said, and service stations along highways will evolve to support them, offering drivers facilities for washing, dining and shopping.
Hotels would change in response, Schuwirth added, with drivers using their facilities but returning to their cars to sleep. "Why should a hotel look like a hotel today?" they said.
Related story "Self-driving cars are the answer. But what is the question?"
Car interiors will be able to morph between driving mode and sleeping mode, Schuwirth predicted.
"Today's cars are shaped to be only an emotional piece and to be very comfortable and safe," they said. "So in an autonomous world, if cars do not have accidents any more, the cars do not have have a small amount of glass, a lot of metal, a lot of bumpers and all that stuff. It could be a bit more transparent."
"Once you decide you want to go for an autonomous drive or a piloted drive, then something happens in your car, so your car transforms inside and the interior changes."
Supercar brand McLaren is also investigating shape-shifting cars. McLaren's chief designer Robert Melville told Dezeen at the start of this year that cars could soon adjust their geometry and functionality as they switch between urban and out-of-town driving.
Schuwirth added: "There will be a steering wheel in case you decide you want to drive but you can get rid of the steering wheel and maybe the chairs somehow change so it's not the standard sporty chair, but it's more like a sofa or a bed. The entire space inside of the car will definitely look completely different."

Schuwirth spoke to Dezeen at the Castellolí race track in Catalunya, Spain, where Audi held a demonstration of its piloted driving technology, inviting guests to ride in a self-driving RS7 vehicle as it hurtled round the track at speeds of over 200 kilometres per hour.
Audi Piloted Driving is a form of self-driving technology whereby a human driver remains legally in charge of the vehicle even if the car's computer is doing all the work. Dezeen first tested the concept last year, when editor Anna Winston was filmed as they drove around a circuit in one of the vehicles.
"In the piloted driving situation, you are always responsible even if you drive hands-off, but it's you who's responsible if something happens with the car," they said.
This approach gets round existing legislation in many countries where a human must retain ultimate control of a vehicle, ruling out fully autonomous vehicles for the time being.
Piloted driving offers an interim step, allowing drivers to let the car take over in traffic jams, in low-speed urban driving or other low-risk situations.
"We do not believe that the potential of autonomous driving is just about security and comfort," Schuwirth said. "Cars are the last place on the planet, besides maybe your room in your flat, where you can be on your own. Maybe you simply you want to do something different in your car, such as relax, communicate, talk, dream or think."

Earlier this year Germany announced that car brands would soon be able to use sections of the A9 highway between Munich and Berlin for testing autonomous vehicles.
Schuwirth said this would allow the country to catch up with the USA, where some states already allow self-driving vehicles on the roads, giving an advantage to American manufacturers.
Describing a scenario in the not-too-distant future, Schuwirth said: "Your car wakes you up at four o'clock in the morning, picks you up and drives you autonomously the entire way from Munich to Berlin. You can sleep, you can prepare for your meeting, you can call your friends and family, do whatever you want and you enter Berlin in a very relaxed mood."
They added: "The car becomes something different. Not just something to get you from A to B, but something more."
PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging a U.S. federal voting rights law governing how the state conducts its elections.
The Voting Rights Act, passed in 1965, outlawed discriminatory voting practices blamed for the widespread disenfranchisement of blacks, particularly in southern states.
Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne, a Republican, said that the portion of the law requiring the state to get prior approval from the Justice Department for any changes to the state's election laws exceeds Congressional authority and is unconstitutional.
“The portions of the ... Act requiring preclearance of all voting changes are either archaic, not based in fact, or subject to completely subjective enforcement based on the whim of federal authorities,” Horne said in a statement.
In Arizona, Hispanics are the largest minority, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the state's population of 6.3 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.
Horne said the state had adopted bilingual ballots in 1974. The same year, it becomes only the second state in the nation to elect a Hispanic governor.
In pressing the suit, they said Arizona has been subjected to enforcement actions “for problems that were either corrected nearly 40 years ago and have not been repeated, or penalized for alleged violations that have no basis in the Constitution. That needs to stop.”
In response to the challenge, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Voting Rights Act plays a vital role in ensuring that “every American has the right to vote and have that vote counted.”
“The Department of Justice will vigorously defend the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act in this case, as it has done successfully in the past.
“The provisions challenged in this case, including the preclearance requirement, were reauthorized by Congress in 2006 with overwhelming and bipartisan support. The Justice Department will continue to enforce the Voting Rights Act, including each of the provisions challenged today.”
Finding a slim vector
Academic researchers have found an exploitable hole in a popular form of wireless networking encryption. The hole is in a part of 802.11i that forms the basis of WiFi Protected Access (WPA), so it could affect routers worldwide. German graduate student Erik Tews will present a paper at next week's PacSec in Tokyo coauthored with fellow student and aircrack-ng team member Martin Beck that reveals how remnants of WPA's predecessor allow them to slip a knife into a crack in the encryption scheme and send bogus data to an unsuspecting WiFi client.
In an interview from Germany, where they are a PhD candidate studying encryption at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Tews explained that an existing attack on Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was modified to provide a slim vector for sending arbitrary data to networks that use the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). (Tews' collaborator Beck is a student at the Technical University of Dresden; Tews credits Beck with the discovery, after which they jointly developed the paper that Tews will present at PacSec.)
With the Tews/Beck method, an attacker sniffs a packet, makes minor modifications to affect the checksum, and checks the results by sending the packet back to the access point. "It's not a key recovery attack," Tews said, "It just allows you to do the decryption of individual packets." This approach works only with short packets, but could allow ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning and possibly DNS (Domain Name Service) spoofing or poisoning.
The paper, Practical Attacks against WEP and WPA, is now available for download.
A history of encryption weakness
The 802.11b specification from the IEEE engineering standards group came with a basic encryption mechanism built in to assuage worries that data would simply be sent in the clear. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) had as its goal a simple baseline: be as secure as an Ethernet jack. It quickly failed. Cracks were seen in 2001, and it was thoroughly broken as early as 2004. Some researchers claim to be able to recover a WEP key in under a minute from an active network. (Most corporations relied on virtual private network connections, which were tunneled through access points located outside a strong firewall, to allow WiFi use without compromising the network.)
The 802.11i task group was formed to replace WEP with something stronger, and they came up with two separate solutions: one looking backwards, the other forwards. Looking back, 802.11i encompassed all WiFi devices ever shipped—starting in 1999—with TKIP. TKIP could be retrofitted to work with older cards through firmware and driver updates. The TKIP work was done first, and incorporated into a branded standard called WPA by the Wi-Fi Alliance, the organization that certifies WiFi gear for interoperability. (You can make 802.11 devices til the cows come home, but you have to be a member of the trade group and pay testing fees—and pass the tests—to label a device with the WiFi moniker.)
WEP: not all that secure
The 802.11i group also added Advanced Encryption System (AES) support—the AES-128 flavor—which uses, take a breath, the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code) Protocol or CCMP. This flavor of AES both encrypts data and ensures its integrity. The flaw discovered by Tews and Beck cannot work against AES.
When 802.11i started winding down, the Wi-Fi Alliance updated its WPA standard to WPA2. WPA includes a requirement for just TKIP encryption; WPA2 requires support for both TKIP and AES. Almost all gear shipped starting in late 2002 could be upgraded to work with AES—all 802.11g silicon was prepared knowing that AES was coming along—and the Wi-Fi Alliance added mandatory WPA2 support for WiFi certified devices starting in March 2006.
The backwards-looking part of 802.11i is where the standard gets into trouble, according to Tews and Beck's research. By making the WPA algorithm compatible with hardware that could handle the broken WEP algorithm, the WiFi alliance left a tiny gap that the researchers could exploit.
Crack that WEP: chop, chop!
The flaw in TKIP has to do with checksums, which are used to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data. Checksums work by taking a sequence of numbers that are to be transmitted, applying a transformation to produce a short result, and appending that result to the transmission.
For instance, an ISBN that starts with 978 is 13 digits long, 12 of which represent a unique book number. The 13th is a base 10 number derived from alternately multiplying successive digits by 1 or 3, adding the results, and taking the modulo of 10. If you type in an ISBN incorrectly, a system that recalculates the checksum can determine in many cases if digits are swapped or wrong digits are entered.
With wireless transmission, the odds of missing a bit or getting it wrong are relatively high, and checksums are used both to determine whether there was an error in reception and to ensure the integrity of a packet. If the payload changes and the checksum does not, then a receiver can tell that the packet was tampered with.
This fell apart in WEP, because the checksum was so weak that techniques were developed to allow the data in a packet to be changed and a new checksum calculated. Tews mentioned the tool chopchop, which allows individual packets to be decrypted without cracking a WEP key. This program served as part of the wedge for the exploit.
A fragmentation attack
Chopchop works by "chopping" out one byte of data at a time and substituting different values for that byte while calculating a new potential checksum. Chopchop sends each modified packet to an access point, and the AP rejects packets for which the decrypted checksum is invalid. WEP doesn't prevent endless testing in this manner—there's no flood control or other protection.
TKIP added a second layer of integrity through Message Integrity Code (MIC), nicknamed Michael. Michael performs a better-designed checksum that's also encrypted. To prevent the simplicity of chopchop, a client will respond after it receives two bad Michael checksums within 60 seconds: the client shuts down for 60 seconds and then requests a new key exchange with the AP. An AP, faced with the same situation, also shuts down for 60 seconds, then rekeys every client. (802.11i allows new master keys to be created on demand without changing the starting passphrase or network key.)
Here's where Tews said their colleague Beck got extremely clever: because both the WEP and TKIP mechanisms are used one after another, and because the Michael code is contained within the packet that's checksummed by the weaker WEP method, an attempt to crack a packet can first use chopchop without triggering the Michael countermeasures.

It's nearly time for postseason baseball, when, as the song goes: “And it's one, two, three strikes you're out.” But when it comes to foreign policy, Romney now has strike four. Ad Policy
Strike one was their ridiculous comment that Russia is America's “No. I geopolitical foe.” Strike two was their much-derided trip to Britain, Israel and Poland, where they piled mistake on mistake. Strike Three—“Yerrr out!”—was their outrageous comment that President Obama “sympathizes” with armed Islamists who attacked the consulate in Benghazi.
Now, thanks to Mother Jones, we've seen Romney whiff at strike four, namely, their comments that the Palestinians don't want peace and that Iran is run by “crazy people.” I'd say, You can't make this stuff up, but apparently Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel does make it up and then feed it to Mitt Romney, who swallows it whole.
These aren't just gaffes. These are the mumblings of a candidate so clueless about the world outside America's borders that it's impossible to imagine them sitting in the Oval Office. Sometimes politicians misspeak or make mistakes, but Romney's foreign policy bungling is far more extreme than that. Outside of Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, it's unclear that they know anything at all about Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Their comments about Iran—that it's run by “crazy people”—contradict the views of many top US officials, experts and intelligence specialists and even Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, as Joe Cirincione catalogs in Foreign Policy. Here's Mitt:
If I were Iran, if I were Iran—a crazed fanatic, I'd say let's get a little fissile material to Hezbollah, have them carry it to Chicago or some other place, and then if anything goes wrong, or America starts acting up, we'll just say, “Guess what? Unless you stand down, why, we're going to let off a dirty bomb.” I mean this is where we have—where America could be held up and blackmailed by Iran, by the mullahs, by crazy people. So we really don't have any option but to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.
Leave aside that President Obama, too, says that their policy is “to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.” Cirincione points out that a “dirty bomb” doesn't use uranium but requires more deadly and more highly radioactive materials—meaning that if Ayatollah Khamenei does plant a dirty bomb in the United States they are indeed a “crazy person,” since it won't work.
More devastatingly, Romney says that they got a call from a former secretary of state suggesting that it was possible to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflicts. Romney's self-confessed response? “I didn't delve into it.” They called it “wishful thinking.” And why? They said:
I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and these thorny issues, and I say there's just no way. And so what you do is you say you move things along the best way you can. You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that it's going to remain an unsolved problem. I mean, we look at that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a potentially volatile situation, but we sort of live with it. And we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve.
That's straight from the Israeli-Netanyahu playbook: the Palestinians are “not wanting to see peace.” And, according to Romney, “I have to tell ya, the idea of pushing on the Israelis?—to give something up, to get the Palestinians to act, is the worst idea in the world.”
Strike four.
Mitt Romney packs a lot of offensive remarks into their forty-nine minute fundraiser speech. Check out Ilyse Hogue's take on the now-infamous “47 percent.”
Mark Roberts is a British streaker who has run naked during several international events. Roberts' streaking began when they saw a news report about a female streaker at a 1993 Rugby Sevens game in Hong Kong. After a bet in a bar, they went naked in front of the crowd themselves the next day.[1]
Roberts has done this, as of 2018, 565 times in 23 countries, targeting such events as Hamilton Race Course, a Mr. Universe contest, a Miss World contest, tennis matches, the bull run in Pamplona, the synchronized swimming world championship in Barcelona, and their specialty, association football matches.[2] According to Roberts, they were mandated to surrender their passport whenever an English football team played abroad following a 2001 conviction for streaking. It is unclear how long this mandate was in place.[3]
One famous streak was on a live 1995 broadcast of This Morning, where they swam onto Fred Talbot's floating weather map and proceeded to emulate Talbot's trademark leap from Scotland to Ireland.[4]
A 2002 advertisement created by the ad agency Dimension (Spain) for Spanish sportswear company Athletic Bilbao featured Mark Roberts streaking fully clothed during a nude football game.[5] It won a bronze award at the 2003 Cannes Festival.[6]
In January 2003, Roberts flew to San Diego, California, United States, where they planned to streak at the Super Bowl XXXVII. They were unable to get tickets to that game, but succeeded next year on Super Bowl XXXVIII, in Houston, Texas. Just before the start of the second half, they ran onto the field disguised as a referee, undressed, and performed a little dance wearing only a thong. Tackled by members of the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers, as well as by police and security, they were taken into custody. In June 2004 they were given a fine of $1000 for trespassing.[7]
Roberts planned on retiring by streaking at the 2006 World Cup final in Germany, but was stopped before they could enter the stadium. Later on, in 2007 Roberts ran out on the field of Wembley Stadium during the NFL's first regular season game outside of North America between the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins. The very next year, Roberts struck again, this time in the final of the 2008 World Snooker Championship between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Ali Carter. They did so previously at the same venue in 2004.[citation needed]
In March 2010 Roberts was seen sporting a cat-shaped mask over their genitals at Crufts.[8]
In 2011 the artist Benedikt Dichgans hired Roberts to streak in Tate Britain and at the Turner Prize but it ended in arrest.[9][10] They were also featured in the 2011 Banksy-produced documentary, The Antics Roadshow.
In 2013, they were subject of the Channel 4 documentary Streak! The Man Who Can't Keep Their Clothes On. They announced their forthcoming retirement but not before one last streak.[11]
In 2018, Mark Roberts made their first appearance since 2013 by taking to the ice at the Gangneung Oval on Friday in nothing but a pink tutu and skimpy underwear during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. As soon as the men's 1,000-meter speed skating medal ceremony concluded, Roberts took to the ice with the words "peace and love" emblazoned across their bare chest.[12]

Last week, Jack Antonoff gave a fascinating interview in which they discussed the elements of a perfect pop song. “Anything I've done that I felt was great started with a big concept,” they say. “You start with the concept and build from there, whether it's a beat or a guitar part.” Antonoff could be describing “We Are Young,” the breakthrough hit for their band fun., or any number of songs by Taylor Swift and Lorde that he's co-written. They could also be talking about Days Are Gone, the winning 2013 debut album by Haim.
Like Antonoff, the trio of Haim sisters — Danielle, Alana, and Este — are pivotal figures in the most important music story of the decade, which is the non-hostile takeover of the indie underground by the pop mainstream. In the early '10s, after the term “indie” had been all but rendered meaningless as a signifier of financial independence from corporations, it finally also lost symbolic meaning as (to use another outmoded word) an “alternative” to pop with the rise of a new generation of artists and listeners that refused to make “snobby” distinctions between high art and mass commerce.

No longer would indie musicians stand in opposition to glossy music made by millionaires and consumed by the hoi polloi; they would now adopt those sounds as a new sonic blueprint upon which to make their own songs, and merge them with all of the regular indie-rock reference points. If indie music in the '80s and '90s had been guided by an “either/or” principle that disrupted the mainstream from the bottom up, the new M.O. was “all of the above,” which ultimately swallowed the underground whole. It was now a post-snob world.
When Days Are Gone came out (along with other crucial post-snob touchstones released around the same time, including Lorde's Pure Heroine and The 1975's self-titled debut), it represented a culmination of this philosophical shift. Equally conversant in Fleetwood Mac, Rihanna, Fiona Apple, and Wilson Phillips, Haim epitomized the “all of the above” ethos, pulling freely from all eras of music no matter their generational associations or worrisome historical/critical baggage. Listening to Days Are Gone, it suddenly seemed perfectly reasonable to hear a Steely Dan guitar solo in the middle of a bouncy, Whitney Houston-style pop jam. These were young women who could rock like cool dads; they were also classic-rock heads whose favorite rock star was Beyonce. That was the “big concept” of Days Were Gone: Music culture from now on will no longer be stratified.
Metro Vancouver's first-ever MUJI store is now open at Metropolis at Metrotown.
The grand opening of the store, located on the ground level of the Hudson's Bay wing, got underway at 10 a.m. on Saturday.
MUJI MAIL members will receive 10 per cent off all regular priced merchandise during opening weekend, and the first 200 customers will receive a custom MUJI at Metrotown tote bag.
The 7,770 sq ft. store is the largest in Canada, and carries over 4,000 products. MUJI Canada President Toru Akita says the company had been looking to open in Metro Vancouver for the past eight years in an effort to find the best possible location for the first store.
They say there is already high brand awareness of MUJI in the market.
“We found that 60 to 70 per cent of customers in Metro Vancouver are already familiar with MUJI,” said Akita. “We are not only providing products, but a lifestyle. We provide good quality products at a reasonable price.”
They say MUJI eventually would like to open between three and five locations in the Lower Mainland, before expanding too eastward to Alberta. The company's second Metro Vancouver store (and largest in Canada) opens this fall on Robson Street. The 16,000 sq ft. space will be larger than originally anticipated, Retail Insider reports.
The Metrotown location offers the full range of MUJI merchandise, including cosmetics, stationery, apparel, furniture, snacks and home decor.
As we've reported previously, the arrival of the minimalist Japanese brand was so highly-anticipated, that access to the company's pop-up store at the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel this past winter was by invitation only.
Akita says sales at the 150 sq ft. pop up store rivalled some of their mall locations.

From Japan to the world
Mujirushi Ryohin, MUJI in Japanese, translates as “no-brand quality goods.” MUJI was founded in Japan in 1980 and now has more than 800 stores around the world, carrying more than 7,000 items.
MUJI expanded to Canada in 2014, with the opening of Toronto's Atrium location (Yonge and Dundas), followed by the Square One Shopping Centre location in Mississauga, and the Yorkdale Shopping Centre location which opened last year.
MUJI opened a fourth Canadian location in Markham, Ont. on July 22, 2017. There are over 700 MUJI stores worldwide.

WASHINGTON—Warning that the problem was even more widespread than previous studies had indicated, a new report published Tuesday in the journal American Psychologist found that one in five Americans struggle with properly masking depression. “According to our research, roughly 20 percent of the population has trouble effectively covering up their feelings of severe despondency and dejection by just acting like everything is fine,” said the report's lead author, Dr. Lauren McKenny, adding that these individuals showed a marked inability to even pretend that they were excited to be awake and alive. “While most Americans are naturally adept at suppressing their emotions in order to put on a happy face for the rest of the world, we estimate that one-fifth of adults are completely at a loss as to how to lock away their constant sense of sadness and self-loathing so that no one else sees it. In especially severe cases, they may talk openly with friends or family about their depression, even going so far as to acknowledge seeking treatment for it.” McKenny went on to say that they hoped the report's findings would lead to new medications to help these individuals better suppress their darkest, most painful thoughts while interacting with others.

A low-lying tract of land in southwestern England known as the Somerset Levels stands just a few meters above sea level; some of the lowest parts even dip below sea level. A natural marshland, the Levels were drained and reclaimed for agriculture over the past few hundred years. However, the marshy character of the land still reasserts itself on occasion.
In December 2013 and January 2014, a series of storms dropped 372 millimeters (15 inches) of rain on southern England, making that two-month period the wettest on record since 1910. The storms and rain have continued into February. Since January, both the River Parrett and River Tone spilled over their banks and flooded sections of the Levels. By mid-February, an estimated 17,000 hectares (66 square miles) and 150 homes were swamped.
The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA's Earth-Observing-1 satellite acquired this image on February 16, 2014. For comparison, the lower image shows Somerset Levels as seen by Landsat 8 on November 4, 2013.
On February 16, brown, sediment-laden water covered large tracts of farmland. While the town of Bridgewater was still dry, villages such as Moorland, Westonzoyland, Burrowbridge, and Othery were either flooded or nearly so. Neither the King's Sedgemoor Drain nor pumping efforts by the British government could slow the rising waters enough to prevent severe flooding.
Although the Somerset Levels have a long history of flooding, this latest round has reignited a debate about the usefulness of dredging, a process that involves deepening and widening river channels by removing silt. Some observers argue that dredging the river more regularly would prevent damaging floods from occurring. Others say that regular dredging does little to prevent floods, causes ecological damage to ecosystems, and is too expensive to pursue.

Virtual bitcoin incubator Seedcoin has announced its latest funding round for bitcoin startups – and the participants are more diverse than ever.
The funding round, which follows a first launched in December, will also be listed with Havelock Investments, an investment fund for bitcoin startups.
There are seven firms in this round, which the company has labelled Seedcoin Fund 2 (SF2).
One of the firms, the Bitcoin Transaction Network, is compiling a range of transaction services into an end-to-end financial transaction network for the digital currency. It will provide ATM, wallet and prepaid card services, in addition to transaction processing and exchange facilities. It wants to do this on a global basis, with a network of partners.
Quantave will provide market data to institutional traders from exchanges via an API. The company, now in stealth mode, will also offer quantitative analysis and a free trading platform.
Currently in the alpha stage, Global Coin FX is a UK-based virtual currency exchange, while Ignite Financing is a leasing firm for bitcoin ATMs, described as a ‘bolt-on provider' for ATM manufacturers.
BTCTrip is a travel and leisure platform providing travel bookings in return for bitcoin rather than fiat payments, including flight and hotel reservations. In addition, BiTnews Media is a video news platform focused on decentralized technologies, ranging from digital currencies to 3D printing to peer-to-peer energy grids.
These six companies received 250 BTC each, while the seventh – TagPesa – will receive 150 BTC. TagPesa is an exchange and remittance firm, focused on remittances in Africa and further afield.
A more diverse offering
One thing that stands out about SF2 is the increased diversity of business models and companies. The last round didn't have financing or video news firms, and no one in that cohort was tackling established sectors such as travel.
“When we started Seedcoin last July, most of the startups contacting us were exchanges, payment processors and wallets,” said Hong Kong-based Eddy Travia, co-founder of Seedcoin, who is operating the company with UK-based CTO Hakim Mamoni, and chief funding officer Alexis Nicosia, located in Singapore.
Travia added:
“We were pleased to help these essential elements of the bitcoin ecosystem infrastructure, but now we are approached by entrepreneurs not necessarily from a crypto or tech background.”
SF2 is worth 2,000 BTC ($982,500 at the time of writing), which will be sold off in four chunks of 500 BTC each, starting on Tuesday, and ending on 22nd June. These bitcoins will be divided into 2 million units, worth a thousandth of a bitcoin (0.001 BTC) each.
Seedcoin takes a 10% cut of the funding, and holds back another 10% for follow-up investment in the startups that are participating in SF2.
Like SF1, participants may see future dividends, according to the prospectus, but any companies that pay out will do so directly to unit holders, rather than via SF2, and each company will have its own policy on this.
Travia wasn't fazed by the relatively flat performance of SF1, which opened at the same price (0.001 BTC) on 9th December, and closed at 0.0008 yesterday.
Said Travia, who signed the seventh participant for SF1 – BTC.sx – at the start of this month:
“We have been mainly dealing with the investment logistics, but are now more active with new investors looking at the startups, potential partnerships and so forth.”
SF2 was meant to have been launched in March, but Seedcoin experienced delays. Explained Travia:
“There are many elements to our involvement with the startups. We prefer to confirm and make sure all parties are in agreement before listing. Dealing with seven new startups is not a small task, even for the three of us.”

ISLAMORADA, Fla., Aug. 19 (UPI) -- A snorkeler off the Florida Keys recorded themselves performing a daring feat -- catching sharks with their bare hands and bringing them to surface.
The 28-year-old snorkler, who said they have been fishing their whole life, recorded a GoPro video of their July 26 dive down to a reef off Islamorada, where they found a nurse shark taking a rest in a small nook.
The snorkler grabs the small shark by the tail while text on the screen warns viewers, "Do not do this."
The man brings the shark to the surface to show their friends and pose for the camera before releasing it.
The man takes a second trip down to the reef, where they catch a larger shark in their hands.
"They [nurse sharks] are usually gentle creatures and usually leave people alone but they do have teeth and are not so nice when grabbed and can do their fair share of damage if handled wrong," the man wrote. "I caught two more after these that were much larger but we were out looking for lobster so I did not have my GoPro on me."
Some quick thoughts on videogame form off the top of my head
I can't believe I just paused Alien to write about videogames and formalism but that's what I get for checking Twitter.
Frank Lantz is currently saying all sorts of smart things on Twitter about formalism. I'll put a link to the inevitable storify here when someone bothers to compile it but it ends with this twitlonger which makes a lot of the points again. He's making good points and it's an important discussion to have, to find a useful notion of ‘videogame form' beyond the strictly narrow and conservative idea of a ‘formalist' as someone who says Dear Esther isn't a game.
But I'm still kinda uneasy in the way people are retweeting the tweets in this celebratory, “yeah! Formalism isn't a dirty word!” kinda way. I mean, it's totally true that it isn't! I've personally become super interested in the idea of videogame form in the last 18 months or so and realised it's an area I've been way too disinterested in. Especially around games like Tearaway and Mountain. Formal stuff, broadly, is super important and has absolutely been a blindspot for a lot of non-development-centric games criticism. Just the idea that videogames are things that are played with hands and plastic and code and stuff is something strictly humanities based videogame critics like myself have been pretty terrible at accounting for and that needs to be (is in the process of) being rectified.
However, this stuff still makes me uneasy. I think it's because there's an inherent ahistoricity to this ‘formalism isn't bad' idea, or the idea that those who say Dear Esther isn't a game aren't real formalists. I think it risks forgetting that for years we were stuck reacting against an incredibly narrow and conservative idea of what counts as a formal element of a videogame, which was itself incredibly mechanistic, incredibly game-centric, and incredibly software-centric. Videogames are games first, a lot of early academic writing on videogames claims, either implicitly or explicitly claiming that all the ‘non-game' elements (characters, narrative, visual art) were less formally central than rules and goals and challenges and such. There's a history to that formalism (I'm still content calling it a formalism. Or maybe a formalistism IDK) tied up with a history of the gendering of technology studies which is way more complicated than I'm getting into in a tumblr post that I paused a really good movie to write. It's a reductive and conservative formalism that did more damage than good but, to be sure, failed to account for ‘the videogame form' in its entirety.
The political situation this led to in the past maybe five years or so is important to remember. It wasn't just reddit trolls and Kotaku commenters saying Dear Esther or Proteus or Lim or Dys4ia weren't videogames. It was developers and influential bloggers and youtubers and critics and academics. I think that's at risk of being written out of history: that there was (and still is) a conservative formalist strand in videogame discourses (both popular and scholarly) that works with a narrow software-centric and game-centric view of what counts as the form of the videogame.
I'm reminded of Gonzalo Frasca's paper “Ludologists love stories, too: notes from a debate that never took place” which, while a really useful paper that outlines a great review of the literature, tends to revise history to make a somewhat extreme viewpoint in game studies (videogames don't tell stories) somewhat less extreme and, in the process, making those that reacted against it seem more extreme. Ludology vs narratology as a debate did take place, and so did a debate more recently where a range of videogame forms were dismissed as not videogames when measured against a certain arbitrary notion of what a videogame can be.
I guess I'm just worried that a justifiably reactionary stance (remembering that most of the videogames dismissed as ‘interactive art' or what have you in recent years are made by a range of marginalised people traditionally less well heard in videogame discourses) will be painted after-the-fact as a straight-up reductive one. There were some pretty good reasons for a while there to be suspicious of ‘formalists'.
I want more critics accounting for videogame form. Art critics can talk about a type of paint used and film critics can talk about camera work and lighting and actors and scripts, and we definitely struggle with that as videogame critics. More accounting for videogames as things that are touched and played with and not just worlds that are magically entered is what we need. That means we need a more coherent language to talk about form.
Back in the late 60s Susan Sontag said something pretty similar, arguing that criticism needs to account for form better and not just what a work ‘means'. But they talk about the need to account for form while still decrying formalism. After talking about the need to account for form in art in “On Style” they then preemptively defends their point by saying:
“The objection that this would reduce art to mere ‘formalism' must not be allowed to stand. (That word should be reserved for those works of art that mechanically perpetuate outmoded or depleted aesthetic formulas.) An approach which considers works of art as living, autonomous models of consciousness will seem objectionable only so long as we refuse to surrender the shallow distinction of form and content. For the sense in which a work of art has no content is no different from the sense in which the world has no content. Both are. Both need no justification; nor could they possibly have any.”
I find myself agreeing with Sontag (but it's an essay nearly fifty-years-old, all the same) that considering ‘form' is far more interesting than being a ‘formalist'. But maybe that is getting semantic. I don't necessarily disagree with anything Lantz is currently saying, really. More people discussing the videogame form is great. I just hope that a) the videogame form doesn't get reduced to the game form; b) the videogame form doesn't get reduced to the software form; c) we don't forget that there existed (and exists) a very conservative and pervasive strand of videogame formalism that actively works to maintain a status quo of videogame design ideologies and its margins.
Carl Paladino (WGRZ)
We knew that the Trump campaign was going to go after anti-Trump Republican delegates, but now it looks like one Trump ally has crossed the line from lobbying to threat making.
WGRZ news reporter Danny Spewak has posted an email sent from top Trump ally Carl Paladino to Utah Republican delegate Stefani Williams that tells them they deserve to be hung if they try to overthrow Trump at the RNC.
“You should be hung for treason, Stefani,” Paladino wrote. “There will not be a Republican Party if you attempt to replace Trump. I'll be in your face in Cleveland.”
Carl Paladino sent this email on Saturday to Stefani Williams, a GOP delegate in Utah who opposes Trump. @WGRZ pic.twitter.com/JvzNehNgfL — Danny Spewak (@DannySpewak) July 15, 2016
Williams had been lobbying to free up delegates to vote their consciences against Donald Trump at the convention next week. Although this effort failed, many delegates have still said that they can never support Trump.
You'd like to think that this kind of email sent from Paladino would lead the Trump campaign to ax them as a surrogate but… don't hold your breath.
Police said the gunman is a well-known white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader. Officials said they have enough evidence to prosecute the case as a hate crime.
Updated — Tuesday, April 15, 12:15 p.m. ET: KCTV-5 via Associated Press Police said Frazier Glenn Cross, also known as Frazier Glenn Miller, killed three people in attacks at a Jewish community center and Jewish retirement complex near Kansas City on Sunday.
Frazier Glenn Miller, the man who allegedly opened fire and killed three outside at two Jewish facilities in Kansas, was charged with one count of capital murder and a count of premeditated first-degree murder. Their bond is set at $10 million. Miller, who was a prominent white supremacist in the 1980s, may be eligible for the death penalty under the charges. They will appear in court at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, ABC News reports.
A man opened fire outside a Jewish Community Center and a retirement community in a suburb of Kansas City, Kan., on Sunday, killing three people. A spokesperson for the Overland Park Police Department in Kansas confirmed to BuzzFeed that there were three fatalities. The first shooting was reported to the police around 1 p.m., a spokesperson for the Overland Park Fire Department said. "There was a shotgun that was involved," Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said in a press conference Sunday night. "We are exploring the possibility that a handgun was involved in the shooting at the two persons that they missed, and we are looking at the possibility of an assault rifle."

Lee confirmed to BuzzFeed that they heard the suspect "shout something about Hitler." The police department told BuzzFeed that it did not know if the incident would be classified as a hate crime, but said the investigation would continue for months.

Passover, a major Jewish holiday, begins Monday evening. AP Photo/Orlin Wagner Because the incident occurred on the night before Passover, Rabbi Herbert Mandl said that it sounds "very much like a hate crime." They added: "The timing is terrible. The timing is awful."
Authorities arrested the suspect at a nearby elementary school, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass told reporters. AP Photo/Orlin Wagner
Although the suspect was booked under the last name Cross, they are probably better known as Frazier Glenn Miller. The Southern Poverty Law Center and NBC News reported that Miller is a white supremacist and was once a "grand dragon" of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
The two were shot outside the town's Jewish Community Center. One died at the scene and the other died after being taken to a hospital.
The male victims were identified as William Lewis Corporon and Reat Griffin Underwood: "It is with deep sadness that we confirm the tragic loss of Dr. William Lewis Corporon and Reat Griffin Underwood (Losen) who died as a result of the injuries they sustained in today's shooting at the Jewish Community Center. Dr. Corporon was Reat's Grandfather, whom they loved very much," said a statement signed "Will Corporon, Son and Uncle." Corporon had taken their grandson to audition for KC Superstars, which was being held at the center's theater. The two were members of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood.
The Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City posted condolences on Facebook: Our hearts go out to the families who have suffered loss on this tragic day. Our heartfelt gratitude as well to all those in Kansas City and around the world who have expressed sympathy, concern and support.
Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America released the following statement by Rev. Michelle Reed, a member of the Kansas chapter: Kansans are still reeling from the breaking news that, on the eve of Passover, a gunman has killed at least three people at the JCC and Village Shalom – our thoughts and prayers are with them and their loved ones," said Reverend Reed. "We don't know all of the details yet, but we know that events like this remind us how none of us is immune– gun violence knows no boundaries of religion, race, class or age. We won't wait until our families or communities are affected by gun violence. We demand – right now – to be safe from gun violence in our places of worship, in our community centers, and wherever we may go. It's time for our political leaders to take immediate action to end this public health epidemic.
The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) released a statement by chair of the Board of Trustees Michael Siegal: We at the Jewish Federations stand in solidarity with the Jewish community in Kansas City following today's horrific events, and our sympathies are with the families of the victims. No community should have to face a moment such as this one, and we pledge to do whatever is necessary to help the people of Kansas City through this terrible time. Today, on the eve of Pesach, we are left to contemplate how we must continue our work building a world in which all people are free to live their lives without the threat of terror.
Statement by President Obama: This afternoon we heard reports of a horrific shooting in Overland Park, Kansas. Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the families and friends who lost a loved one and everyone affected by this tragedy. I have asked my team to stay in close touch with our federal, state and local partners and provide the necessary resources to support the ongoing investigation. While we do not know all of the details surrounding today's shooting, the initial reports are heartbreaking. I want to offer my condolences to all the families trying to make sense of this difficult situation and pledge the full support from the federal government as we heal and cope during this trying time.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) released a statement by Karen Aroesty, the St. Louis regional director, calling the shootings “an unspeakable and heinous act of violence”: The attacks on the Jewish community centers in Overland Park are a cowardly, unspeakable and heinous act of violence. While it is too early to label these shootings as a hate crime, the fact that two Jewish institutions were targeted by the same individual just prior to the start of the Passover holiday is deeply troubling and certainly gives us pause. We have reached out to local, state and federal law enforcement and stand willing and able to offer guidance and assistance to the community if this incident turns out to have been motivated by anti-Semitism.

NDP uses mother's child care benefit donation as fundraising tool
OTTAWA - The federal NDP seems to be encouraging parents who don't need the newly enhanced universal child care benefit to donate the money to the party.
The party's latest fundraising email blast cites the example of Ella, a financially-secure single mother who intends to donate their UCCB windfall to the NDP.
"Ella's not the only one who feels this way," the email blast concludes.
"After a decade of Stephen Harper's Conservatives, Canadians want change in Ottawa. If you can, please donate to help build the campaign."
The party denies the missive is designed to encourage people to follow Ella's example; it is simply using Ella's "inspiring story" to make its latest solicitation for donations more interesting.
But deputy Liberal leader Ralph Goodale said the pitch is "tawdry."
"You're turning a social support program into a political milch cow and that is very offensive," they said.
Goodale said the missive underscores the "fundamental flaw" in the UCCB: the fact that the benefit goes equally to wealthy parents, whether or not they actually need it.
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair has promised that a New Democrat government would keep the enriched UCCB in place.
The NDP fundraising missive comes during a week in which Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has stepped up their criticism of Mulcair for perpetuating a Conservative benefits regime that gives equal payouts to parents, regardless of income.
It reproduces an email sent to Ottawa MP Paul Dewar by Ella, in which they say they were disgusted by Employment Minister Pierre Poilievre's "offensive partisan announcement" earlier this week, touting the boost in UCCB payments which parents started receiving this week in a lump sum back-dated to January.
They say they got their cheque but can't bring themselves to cash it because it "feels tainted ... like a dirty little attempt to buy my vote."
"Fortunately, I am a well-educated, financially secure single mom and cashing this cheque (or not) will not materially affect my daughter's opportunities," they say.
"But feeling like my household's votes could be bought by some character in a Conservative golf shirt may."
They volunteer to sign over their cheque to Dewar or, if that isn't an option, to cash it and provide them with a donation.
NDP spokesperson George Soule said Ella encouraged the party to share their story, so it did.
Trudeau said earlier this week they would give their family's UCCB windfall to a charity in their riding.
 They are proposing to replace the UCCB with a progressive, tax-free child benefit that they say would give all parents with household incomes of less than $150,000 more money than they currently get. However, their benefit would be gradually reduced for those earning more and cut off entirely for those with incomes over $200,000.

Eminem is back in the studio working on a new album, but they have something to say before that comes out. “Don't worry I'm working on an album!” Eminem posted on their Facebook page before adding, “Here's something meanwhile.”
The rapper dropped a nearly eight minute-long “Campaign Speech” Wednesday that covered a wide range of topics, making references to everything from football player Colin Kaepernick to mystery novelist Agatha Christie. However, with a title like “Campaign Speech,” listeners know Eminem is going to get political.
The rapper doesn't touch on the current political atmosphere until around the four-minute mark where they question people who plan on voting for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump because of their anti-establishment rhetoric and critiques Trump's temperament calling them a “loose canon.”

“Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate,” they rap. “You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet because they run their campaign with their own cash for the funded/ And that's what you wanted?/ A f—ing loose canon who's blunt with their hand on the button who doesn't have to answer to no one/ Great idea.”

Edmonton's Stanley A. Milner Library — named after the local library champion in 1996 — sees one million visits every year. But the structure itself has lagged behind its popularity, becoming an outdated civic landmark in a growing and rapidly modernizing city. With an eye towards building a strong and prosperous downtown, City Council voted in 2014 to approve a major renewal initiative for the building to the tune of $62.5 million CAD. As the library prepares to close on December 31, 2016, while it temporarily relocates to the University of Alberta's Enterprise Square building, new renderings of the sleek development have been released.

The renovated facility will be more than just a place to borrow books. The pillars of community engagement will be fused into the design, with a children's library over three times the size of the current one, hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) activities, new music and arts spaces, and an indoor play area. The library will also utilize emerging technologies to their fullest, with a large Makerspace giving patrons access to 3D printing, sound and video production, and robotics, as well as a multi-storey interactive simulation wall creating a platform for unique multimedia presentations.

These active social and learning spaces will fulfill the library's mandate for collaboration while the building also provides traditional private study and reading areas by dedicating an additional 4,000 square feet to that purpose. Approximately 1,000 square feet of that space will overlook Churchill Square, providing a visual connection to the city. The community will benefit from another 2,500 square feet of meeting space and a high-tech theatre to support performances and guest speakers.

The latest renderings depict how the distorted facade of the building translates to an interior with a heavy concentration of open spaces ringed by balconies. Conceived by Teeple Architects and Tkalcic Bengert, the most recent images show a building with sharper corners and more jagged windows, compared to the swelling profile portrayed in earlier illustrations. The Edmonton Design Committee has expressed concern over the building's public realm, asking for clarity on the programming and furnishing elements of the streetscape design. Speaking to the change in exterior alterations, the Committee said on August 16: "The conceptual genesis of the dynamic form is no longer carried around the entire perimeter of the building as previously presented."

The Committee weighs in on projects within their jurisdiction and provides advice to Council in forming the City's urban design principles, guidelines and policies. Project proponents don't have to incorporate the Committee's advice, as ultimately Council has the final decision. Construction should begin in early 2017 with completion in 2020.

The International Space Station orbits 354 kilometers (220 miles) above the Earth, completing one trip around the globe every 92 minutes. Cruising along at 27,700 km (17,200 miles) per hour, the astronauts experience 15 or 16 sunrises and sets every day. Since the launch of the Zarya Control Module on November 20, 1998, the station has orbited the Earth over 66,500 times (as of June 27, 2010). The station's orbit is inclined to the equator by 51.65°, meaning at its most northerly, it is at the latitude of London, England, and at it most southerly it is over the latitude of the Falkland Islands.
This sequence of time-lapse photographs illustrates roughly half an orbit, from sunrise over Northern Europe (top photograph) to sunset southeast of Australia, on April 12, 2010. The view is to the north of the station's ground track. In the upper-left is the tail of the Space Shuttle Discovery, which docked with the Space Station during the STS-131 mission. The animation begins with a view of snow-covered Norway (image top) and the Jutland Peninsula (image center). Low clouds cover Central Europe (image bottom).
The animation continues as the Station flies by Ukraine, eastern Russia, the Volga River, and then the Russian Steppes. South and east of the steppes, a dust storm comes into view over the Taklimakan Desert, followed shortly by the lake-studded Tibetan Plateau and the glaciers of the Himalayan Mountains (center photograph). Smoke-shrouded lowlands hug the southern margin of the Himalayas. Smoke also covers much of Southeast Asia, including the Irrawaddy Delta.
After the Space Station passes over the sapphire-blue South China Sea, the island of Borneo appears, followed by the open expanse of the Indian Ocean. A trio of coral reefs lies off the coast of Western Australia, which is studded with clouds. Australia's arid interior is colored myriad shades of red (bottom photograph). As sunset nears, cloud shadows lengthen, highlighting their structure. Night falls as the Space Station crosses the terminator above the South Pacific.

A police dog has died following a crash on the A90.
Nine-year-old black Labrador Sam was put down on Friday following complications after surgery.
Sam had been injured in a serious crash on the A90 last Tuesday, February 28.
Superintendent Steven Irvine, of the Specialist Operations Unit, said: “As a force we care a great deal about our dogs and although it was an extremely difficult decision to make, it was agreed with very heavy hearts this was the best course of action for Sam.
“Sam was a much-loved and valued member of the Police Scotland family – as is the case with all our dogs – and they will be sorely missed.
“We are extremely proud of the fantastic crime-fighter Sam became and will always be grateful to them for the loyalty they showed their handler and the force.”
Forget Mexican illegal immigrants and European migrants, it's Australians who are taking the jobs of hard-working U.S. surf instructors, bartenders and ski bums.
Or so says comedian Bill Maher in this cheeky expletive-riddled rant.
"No one is paying attention to the ethnic group that is taking over this country while we blithely do nothing -- f*****g Australians," Maher said in the video which has more than 30,000 views since it was published on Friday.
"It can't just be me that has noticed that every single bartender in this town is suddenly some 6ft 4in Australian dude with a great personality, who is generous with the free drinks, and we're just letting it happen."
They then cuts a little too close to home making light of shark fatalities.
"We used to think oceans could protect us because oceans were full of sharks and sharks eat a lot of Australians, but now sharks are endangered," they said.
"There just aren't enough of them anymore and there are too many Hemsworths."

They reminisce back to a time when American movies starred Americans, casting the likes of Rebel Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Simon Baker and Russell Crowe as "an Aussie hoard that flawlessly mimics our American accent and then takes jobs that rightfully belong to Billy Bob Thornton".
What he's really getting at, however, is America's "tradition to hate someone and blame them for all our problems".
They finish by saying: "If Donald Trump really wanted to make America great again they wouldn't build a wall, he'd build a mirror".

A surrogate mother from California, who gave birth to two babies, found out one of the children was biologically hers.
Jessica Allen became pregnant with their own biological child while they were carrying another baby as a surrogate for a Chinese couple.
Mrs Allen said doctors first thought the second was an identical twin.
As a result, both babies were given to the other woman after delivery and the Allens had to fight to get back their biological son.
'Not explained'
Mrs Allen had already given birth to two healthy children, but had decided to become a surrogate mother.
They told Newsday on the BBC World Service they had ovulated despite being pregnant.
"I was pregnant through IVF already and at about six, seven weeks they found another embryo and they labelled it that the one embryo that they transferred split and turned into twins.
"My body naturally still ovulated while I was already pregnant - that's very rare - no one really knows about it but obviously, with my situation, more people are learning about it.
"It's called superfetation - it has a medical term to it, so why this process is not explained to surrogates, I don't know. They don't give this as a possibility."
'We definitely want our son'
Mrs Allen said they did not see the babies when they were born last December, but the other mother then texted their pictures of the babies when they were a few weeks old.
The intended mother also said they were waiting for Mrs Allen to feel well before revealing that they had doubts about the origin of one of the babies.
"I immediately freaked out and I asked my caseworker, 'what's going on, how can this be, what's happened, how did this happen?' and they didn't have any answers for me," Mrs Allen told Newsday.
"So they [the caseworker] said the next thing we need to do is to get me to have a DNA test."
The intended mother also took the baby for a DNA test and within a fortnight asked Mrs Allen for a Skype call.
"That's when they announced that the results indicated that I was their genetic mother," Mrs Allen said.
"During the Skype call they did suggest that we could give them up for adoption and they already had a couple thinking about adopting him.
"At this point we had no idea what to do, so by the end of the call we told them we were going to talk about it, because we needed to figure out how we're going to get ready for a baby literally overnight."
However, the next day Mrs Allen told the woman: "We definitely want our son."
Not on the birth certificate
But Mrs Allen and their husband ran into difficulties because - legally - they were not the parents.
They were told that because the intended mother signed the baby's birth certificate, they were their legal mother and then if they wanted to give them up for adoption, they could
"I'm not on their birth certificate but I am their genetic mother, my husband is their genetic father and we have that proof through DNA," said Mrs Allen, who added they and their husband were also asked to pay back part of the fee to the couple because they had paid them to carry more than one child.
They had also incurred fees for a lawyer they had hired to help them get custody of their son.
The Allens were finally reunited with their baby boy, who is now 10 months old.
When they met their son, Mrs Allen said they were a nervous wreck.
"When they [the caseworker] pulled them out of their car and walked towards me, I just snatched them from them and said 'give me my baby' and I was just kissing them and trying to look at their face for the first time.
"I sat in the back seat with them so I could see them and talk to them and stuff."
Bike Psych: Can Bay Area Drivers and Cyclists Get Along?
Yesterday, John Robert Donovan, 41, of Mill Valley, accepted a plea-bargain that got them a misdemeanor conviction, two years of probation, 80 hours of community service, and a $4,134 fine plus court costs, as reported in the Marin Independent Journal. Last November, Donovan, who was driving a Tesla, reportedly got into a road rage incident with some cyclists on Shoreline Highway. When one of the cyclists flipped off their wife, Donovan overtook, cut them off, and braked—causing one of the cyclists to crash into their car. Donovan then drove off.
It seems not a week passes without some kind of car-versus-bike road rage incident.
Just last week, cyclist Danica Helb was pepper sprayed by a motorist. “I got a call from Sergeant O'Connor, who recorded a detailed description of the events,” they wrote in an email to Streetsblog. “He said they are investigating the case as a battery, and would be following up with the witnesses.”
And then there's this madness from last year, captured on video. The driver nearly ran over a cyclist who was riding safely in the bike lane. But instead of apologizing, the motorist gets out and screams and kicks at the cyclist.
No doubt next week there will be another conflict. And another. People will continue to get hurt. Sometimes they are intentionally killed.
What's really going on here?
Dr. Robert Nemerovski is a psychologist with practices in San Francisco and Marin who specializes in anger management. They wrote their doctoral dissertation on the psychology of road rage. He's also a cyclist. “I feel extremely threatened by automobiles–they've got metal and airbags and I've got nothing,” they said. “So when a car gets too close or cuts me off or doesn't see me, even with my flashers and my obnoxious yellow outfit, it's really a gut reaction that my life is in jeopardy.”
Nemerovski says the close calls with motorist trigger a cyclist's basic fight-or-flight system. For their patients, they recommend using a “Threat, Injustice and Frustration” model (TIF). Under this treatment, patients who are prone to anger write down whether their rage is triggered by a perceived threat, an injustice, or frustration.
The latter two are why cyclists tend to trigger anger in drivers, especially when drivers find themselves unable to pass on a narrow road, such as in the recent Mill Valley case. “As a driver I get fed up because it's an injustice, so they are frustrating my goals to get where I need to go,” they explained. Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo's famous 1970s study into prisoner-guard dynamics showed, among other things, that anonymity makes people meaner. In other words, if one is ensconced in a thick shell of steel and tinted glass, anger is amplified. This effect was lampooned in the famous Disney cartoon, “Motor Mania.” The cartoon also hammers the point that “pedestrians” and “motorists” (and of course “cyclists”) are all the same people, which just makes the whole phenomenon all the more strange.
So what's the solution?
“We work hard to educate thousands of people every year who bike and drive how to do so safely, legally and politely. But there will always be people that fall short of what we teach,” said Chris Cassidy, spokesperson for the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “That's why it's so important that planners design safe streets, which necessarily impacts the behavior of everyone along that stretch of road.”
Ultimately, if car-versus-bike anger comes down to fundamental human psychology, no amount of education, discipline or law enforcement is going to solve the problem completely. In other words, sharrows won't help. The answer has got to be segregation through infrastructure that just keeps the cars and bikes away from each other whenever possible.
This is certainly the model that was adopted in the Netherlands, which has the best safety record in the world—when Dutch roads aren't segregated, they are engineered to keep cars going slow enough so they can't do much damage. Even intersections, through phased signals, keep cyclist and motorists apart. Dick van Veen, a Dutch bike engineer who is currently working in Ottawa, wrote that mixing modes on roads designed for speeds above about 20 mph is deemed unsafe and unethical.
It's a depressing conclusion that the only way to prevent motorist and cyclists from regularly beating the hell out of each other is by separating them. But, psychologists and history tell us that will work. As we wait for the day when that system is built, Nemerovski has ten tips for staying calm on the road.
In a move that could ruffle some feathers in the Jain community, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has lodged a police complaint against a Jain sadhu for walking in the nude in the Dadar area of central Mumbai.
Sandeep Deshpande, MNS corporator from Dadar and leader of the in the municipal corporation, lodged a complaint with the Shivaji Park police station this Tuesday. They had lodged two complaints previously, in October and November 2013, regarding the same issue. Deshpande has, however, not named the ascetic or their community in the complaint letter written on their letterhead.
"More than 100 women have complained to me in writing about the issue. I am not against any religion at all. But, they should understand that many women find it obscene and are embarrassed to see a nude sadhu roaming on the roads," Deshpande told Firstpost. The ascetic belongs to the Digambar sect of Jains, a small group of ascetics,
Deshpande claimed that they had raised the issue last year too. "Then, the community leaders promised me that they will ask the sadhu to stop roaming in the area. But, they have again started roaming in the area for the past few months which is why I am forced to lodge a complaint against him," added Deshpande.
The Jain community has termed the complaint 'absurd' saying it's their religious practice. "The sadhus have religious vows to move around and they are not making any vulgar gestures. It is the guilty mind that thinks it is wrong. It is the religious practice and the minorities have a right under the Constitution to profess and propagate their religion. It is very absurd that somebody has filed a complaint but there is no provision in the law to take action in this case," said Dhanpal Solanki, a lawyer who has worked on various issues concerning Jains and minority groups.
Deshpande, meanwhile, has demanded that the police should take appropriate action in the matter. "The police should take action as per the law at the earliest. Or else, the MNS will take action against the sadhu in its own style and the police will be responsible for it," warned Deshpande.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Dhananjay Kulkarni confirmed that the complaint had been received. "We are carrying out the investigation in the matter and appropriate action will be taken," said Kulkarni.

The worst is over for the beaten-down oil market, as a slowdown in production is setting prices up for a steeper rebound than predicted at the beginning of the year, Citigroup has said.
In a note out on Tuesday, the Wall Street bank said fundamentals in the oil sector are tightening much faster than it forecast just five months ago. The shift is being driven particularly by a slide in production from countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, it said.
“Commodities markets appear to have turned the corner and, led by the petroleum market, are accelerating their price recovery from the lows of the last year,” Citi's strategists said in the note, titled “Let the Sunshine in as Commodities Enter New Age of Aquarius.”
“While the price increases experienced since early 1Q remain subject to the ‘new normal' of relatively high volatility, it appears there is no turning back any time soon,” said the strategists, who included Edward Morse.
Citi said it now sees Brent oil UK:LCON6 — the global benchmark — reaching $50 a barrel in the third quarter of 2016, “if not earlier,” before climbing to around $65 by the end of 2017. That's compared with a previous forecast that prices would not touch the $50 handle until the fourth quarter and would end 2017 at $60 a barrel.
The bank forecasts West Texas Intermediate crude CLN6, +0.00% will hit $50 by the end of 2016 and $61 by year-end 2017. Brent traded at $48.11 a barrel on Tuesday, while crude was at $47.92.
“After a bumpy 2015, with a persistent crude oil supply excess of some 1.5-million barrels a day, supply-versus-demand dynamics are at work and look likely to push the crude oil sector into equilibrium by midyear and deficit for much of the next six quarters,” the strategists said.
Brent and crude prices slumped 35% and 30%, respectively, in 2015 and dipped to 12-year lows in February this year. Since then, both contracts have staged remarkable comebacks, with Brent up 77% and crude more than 80% higher. A slowdown in production outside OPEC members, as well as severe supply disruptions in Nigeria, Libya and Canada have been key factors in helping prices rebound.
“The decline in prices from over $100 to under $30 from 2014 to this past January is finally having a clear impact in reducing corporate spending globally and with that worsening production declines,” the Citi strategists said.
Citi's more upbeat view on the oil sector echoes an assessment by rival Goldman Sachs from last week. The bank — known for being among the biggest oil bears — said an oversupplied oil market has finally taken a turn for the better because of a “sudden halt to the oil market surplus”.
A supply glut in the market is seen as the key reason oil prices started slumping in the summer of 2014. A few months into the selloff, oil producing nations and investors were looking to OPEC to work as a swing producer again and cut production to stabilize the market. However, the cartel — largely directed by kingpin Saudi Arabia — signaled a shift in strategy, stopping short of a production cut and leaving it to market forces to balance supply.
The OPEC strategy shift is also one of the main reasons Citi predicts oil markets will stay volatile.
“While Citi has a 65% or so confidence in this price path, the brave new world of petroleum promises to be volatile,” its strategists said.
They pointed to four factors that will “guarantee” prices continue to fluctuate: Aside from Saudi Arabia's impact on OPEC strategy, the other three include U.S. shale production, fragile governance in oil-dependant nations and computer-driven trading.

Apprentice bully Dan Harris terrorised staff at their own company... even making them wear a face mask of them on a night out.
The egomaniac - first to be fired by Lord Alan Sugar in the new series of the BBC hit - was shown bullying and swearing at other contestants on the programme last week.
Now a former employee of their firm, 1st Place Graduate Recruitment, has told the full story of their bizarre antics and extreme tantrums.
The woman, who worked for Harris for two years until the firm went bust last New Year's Eve, said: "Dan was a bully and an ogre. One time we were all going out for a drink and Dan printed out life-size pictures of their own face and made them into masks so we could all wear them and pretend to be him.
"He thought they were fantastic. They would strut around calling themselves 'Dan the Man' but their management style was to scream and shout abuse at people. They were hideous."
Father-of-two Harris, 34, from Oxfordshire, was the eldest contestant on Series 6. In the first episode screened last Wednesday, they were leader of a team making and selling sausages.
Lord Sugar slated Harris in the boardroom and then fired him.
The former female employee, who does not want to be named, revealed that Harris's temper was uncontrollable at work.
"He would take turns to bully one person," they said, "and make their life a misery, saying 'You're f***ing worthless, you don't deserve to be in a job.'
"Dan would reduce people to tears on a regular basis. One poor girl was trying to pass on a message that their girlfriend had phoned.
"He just flipped their lid, said it was none of their business, and they hurled their plate. It hit the wall and just missed their head. I'm so glad Lord Sugar saw through him."
Another female ex-employee, now 23, said: "After two drinks down the pub they would get really angry. They squared up to an employee once. The atmosphere around them was like treading on eggshells.
"To find out they went off to be on TV while we were working hard to keep the company afloat is like being stabbed in the back."
All TI Signing Keys Factored
Posted by Duncan on 13 September 2009, 00:13 GMT
In July, we reported on the factoring of the 0004 key, required for the signing of TI-83+ and TI-83+ SE OS updates. Thanks to an unprecedented community effort, all of TI's signing keys have been factored (Details on the United-TI thread), including both operating system and application signing keys for every upgradeable model.
The Nspire and Nspire CAS aren't included; very little is known about them yet.
These keys allow free user-created operating systems to be installed without having to use awkward work-arounds such as Free83P and FreeFlash. Free operating systems already exist for the TI-83+, the TI-89, and the TI-92+. As of this writing, none of the operating systems available on ticalc.org right now are signed, but we look forward to accepting signed OSes from authors.
To sign your own operating system or Flash apps, you will need Benjamin Moody's RabbitSign (Unix, Windows). For 68k calculators (TI-89 / TI-89 Titanium / TI-92+ / Voyage 200), Brandon Wilson's resign68k works as well.
At the core of “My Easy Trip from Youth Minister to Felon,” an article posted in the online version of Christianity Today's Leadership Journal, is an odd and self-serving theological point: that God does not look upon sin, and that when sin continues long enough, God gives us over to it so that we might hit rock bottom and then seek redemption. God turning away is, according to the anonymous author, a convicted sex offender still in prison, the reason Jesus felt God had forsaken Him while They were on the cross—God could not look on Their Son/Himself as Their Son/He took on the sins of the world. It is God's looking away, the author suggests, that allowed King David to embrace selfishness and send Bathsheba's husband, Uriah, into battle to die, so that David might have sexual access to Bathsheba. In this same fashion, the author contends, God looked away so that the author might plunge deep enough into sin to be made to answer for those sins.
The author provides no theological discussion of why God also looked away from the victim of the author's sin, implying (through the author's shaky theological discourse, and their frequent use of “we” and “our”) that the teenage girl who had been manipulated into a sexual relationship with their youth pastor, shared in the sin, or simply had to be sacrificed so that the author could be redeemed. Without ever naming their actual crime, the author crafts a tale of a sexual predator in need of redemption, and a sexual assault victim as sacrificial lamb, all with God's blessing/God's inability to stomach what was happening. But if we are to look at God as incapable of looking on sin, or even the victims of another person's sinful behavior, then it seems only right to assume God looked away throughout the process that led to the publishing of the article.
The article, taken down from Leadership Journal after much public pressure, can be read from an alternate site here.
I'm a bit torn about whether I think people should read it—not in the sense that I think it deserved to ever be published in the first place—it didn't—but because it provides an interesting look into the kinds of self-centered justifications, and victim-blaming that sex offenders will endorse in an effort to convince people around them that they're sorry and won't ever do anything like that again, because, boy, they've learned their lesson, and (in this case) Jesus forgave them, so you should, too.
What was meant by the editors to be taken as a moving story of sin and redemption was, instead, merely a continuation of the abuse, prettied up with self-aggrandizing mock-contrition and Bible verses. And, sadly, the editors saw fit to tag it with the “related topics” of Accountability, Character, Failure, Legal Issues, Self-examination, Sex, and Temptation. Of those tags, “Failure,” and “Legal Issues” seem the only appropriate ones. “Sex” only fits in the broadest definition; whereas “Sexual Assault” or “Sex Offenses” would have been much more fitting. “Temptation” is little more than a label that normalizes the sexualizing of underage girls.
What I keep wondering in all of this is how the article came to be posted in the first place. Did the editors of Leadership Journal coordinate with prison officials to approve the project, or did they just accept it from some inmate, insisting via e-mail that they had a unique tale of a fall from grace and a re-acquaintance with God? Did they know the author prior to their incarceration? Is the author in a treatment program in prison? If so, were their treatment providers at all aware of what they were doing? Were lawyers for the author, lawyers for the victim, or the judge in the case aware of the intent to publish such a piece? And, perhaps most importantly, was the victim, or the victim's family aware that any of this was happening? And did she/they have any say in the matter?
I ask the above questions because I cannot imagine that, prior to publication, the article was examined by anybody with any clinical knowledge of offender behavior—or, for that matter, by anyone with any sense of the damage done to victims of sexual assaults. If I give the editors the benefit of the doubt, then maybe I can view them as possibly well-meaning, but definitely confused/ignorant people looking to generate an attention-grabbing conversation about statutory rape. And while, it certainly grabbed plenty of attention, that was because it took a story of sexual assault and transformed it into a discussion about how easy it is to be seduced by a teen when one takes one's eyes off of God, and vice versa. The sexual content is so subdued/obscured that it comes across as if it is intended to describe temptation only—definitely much more so than if it was labeled appropriately as child molestation, pedophilia, hebephilia, exploitation of a minor, statutory rape, or rape.
Any sex offender treatment provider who knows anything at all about what she/he is doing certainly would never have approved of the article as it appeared. Offenders in treatment (in or out of prison) are often given writing assignments wherein they are required to relay details of their behaviors and thought processes and demonstrate an understanding of the damage they caused, as well as the way they convinced themselves it was okay. And while I recognize that it wasn't specifically crafted as a treatment assignment, the Leadership Today piece reads like an eloquent first draft of such an assignment, crafted with care before a treatment provider and/or members of a treatment group demanded changes due to the author taking a victim stance, failing to acknowledge the actual crime or its impact on anyone other than himself, and refusing to incorporate even the most rudimentary sense of understanding about how they built up to the offense and kept it secret for as long as they did.
Or perhaps it's more like a second draft, after the offender removed most of the overt blaming of the victim, and switched, instead, to implied mutual blame or implied consent for the crime.
I have heard hundreds of variations on the same basic story told in the article, from the mouths of offenders, emphasizing the frustrations in their lives, the reasons they had contact with the victim to begin with, and the reasons they are not to blame (and, yes, a lot of them invoke religion as part of that). It is rare to come in contact with an offender who, from the beginning (not of the offense, but of contact with the justice system and the need for an evaluation for sexual deviancy) is capable of outlining how they (or occasionally, she) manipulated the victim to engage in sexual acts and to keep it a secret, how they justified the crime to himself, and what specifically happened (in clinically appropriate and criminally accurate terms), without putting a large portion of the blame on the victim for somehow enticing or seducing him.
Despite the author's claim, added after the controversy erupted, that they take 100% of the blame for the crime, and recognizes that what they once viewed as a consensual relationship was no such thing, the article itself tells a much different story—of a man who worked hard to build something up for the glory of God (and how they were really amazing at doing that work), and then how they accidentally broke it because they were being selfish. Without ever acknowledging the severe harm they did to the victim, harm that is likely to last a lifetime, they signal that they have returned to a life of service to God because they are involved in leading a ministry group in prison (another thing I have a really hard time with anybody allowing).
And while the author touches on one of their justifications for engaging in their behavior—that their wife was paying too much attention to their children, and not enough to him—he is only able to acknowledge the impact on their wife in the form of the fight they had when they found out about the crimes, and how they left in the middle of the night with the children. The author laments that they have not seen their children since, but doesn't even mention the extreme embarrassment and devastation they caused their wife and children. Nor do they ever fully indicate that they recognize how childish their justifications for their behavior were, or how those justifications were merely the starting point for a cycle of lying and manipulation committed for the sole purpose of having repeated sexual contacts with a minor.
In a truly terrible minimization of their behavior, the author compares their repeated sexual abuse of the victim (while implying they shared in an identical struggle with him) to the difficulty of smokers trying to turn away from cigarettes.
From the complete dearth of information in the article, if this really were a treatment assignment, once all the extraneous details, self-promotion, and claims to deserved forgiveness are removed it might sound a little more like this:
“In my 30s, I accepted a position with a church as the coordinator of youth ministry. I built up the group from just a few members until it was one of the largest youth groups in the region. I realized I was experiencing sexual attraction to one of the underage members. I manipulated them into having sex with me, and justified my sex offenses, in part, by blaming my wife for not paying enough attention to me. I had sex with the teen repeatedly. When my wife found out, they took our children and left. I was convicted of sex offenses and sent to prison. I am currently still in prison. I will be a registered sex offender for the rest of my life.”
And, if the author began to actually include the most obvious missing items, the skeleton of a real assignment, or perhaps a combination of real assignments, would start to look like this:
“In my 30s, I accepted a position with a church as the coordinator of youth ministry. I built up the group from just a few members until it was one of the largest youth groups in the region. I realized I was experiencing sexual attraction to one of the underage members, and that they looked up to me in a way that made it possible for me to manipulate them I set about grooming them I justified my sex offenses, in part, by blaming my wife for not paying enough attention to me. I managed to work up to the point where I convinced the girl to have sex with me. I then had sex with them repeatedly while convincing myself that they wanted to have sex with me as well, that they were mature enough to handle a sexual relationship with an adult who is an authority figure in their spiritual life, and that I was in no way manipulating them I managed to keep them from telling anybody about our relationship through various forms of coercion, and went to great lengths to keep anyone from finding out about it. We eventually got caught. My wife, understandably, left me and took the children with them I was arrested and convicted of sex offenses. I am currently in prison. I will be a registered sex offender for the rest of my life. The teenager I manipulated and raped will need a great deal of therapy and other supports in order to cope with the aftermath of my actions. My wife, my children, and numerous other people impacted by my behavior will also need support to attempt to repair the damage I caused. I recognize that I need to stay away from minors for the rest of my life, and that I can never be placed in any kind of position where I might have authority that can be abused, particularly over any people who could be considered ‘vulnerable.' I also manipulated editors of Leadership Today into publishing an article I wrote that completely justified my behavior, and suggested that the victim was equally to blame for my sex offenses.”
The assignment would be given back with numerous, specific requests for much more “self reflection,” “accountability,” and actual identification of their specific behaviors and thoughts.
Becoming a sex offender isn't an “easy” path as the author's title suggests. It is one that is pieced together with care by the offender, and crafted to secure the cooperation of the victim(s). It is not, as the author portrays it, a little trouble in a marriage, a dash of arrogance, and some innocent flirtations evolving over time into mutual passion—passion that makes God look away, as if God were easily embarrassed. Such a description may be a very simplistic explanation of how an extramarital affair (the words the author uses along with “adultery” to describe their sexually exploitative behavior of a child under their care) evolves.
Unfortunately, by diving into this discussion, without any sense of just how manipulative the author was, and how harmful their words are, the editors of Leadership Journal have put themselves in a place where they must now back away from this discussion entirely. Rather than promoting a meaningful dialog about forgiveness and redemption, they allowed a sex offender to promote themselves as a victim of the temptation to have sex with minors. They allowed them to promote their story of redemption—a story that rings as false as any rapist having the arrogance to compare themselves to Christ on the cross, as they suggest that God's mercy has saved him, all while implying a teenage girl entrusted to them for guidance and education was just as responsible for being raped as they were for raping them

Narendra Modi to be BJP's PM candidate, announcement before assembly polls: sources
Share EMAIL PRINT New Delhi: could be named the BJP's candidate for Prime Minister for 2014 as early as September this year, party sources have said.
The party sees the Gujarat Chief Minister as its star vote catcher and reportedly wants to cash in on their popularity in the Assembly elections in four big states at the end of this year. So, the sources said, a Modi announcement could be expected before the notification of the Assembly elections, expected around September 21.
Today, BJP president
The BJP and RSS reportedly reckon that general elections, due in May next year, are unlikely to be held before February and they want Mr Modi to get a six-month window to build their campaign as the official face of the party. That would mean a September announcement.
By then, the party expects to reconcile all the residual opposition among senior leaders to Mr Modi.
The RSS chief has played an important role in quelling that opposition. Mr Bhagwat has held a series of meetings in the last few weeks with different BJP leaders, including LK Advani, who had protested against Mr Modi being made the BJP's election campaign chief last month.
The RSS chief also met Mr Modi and handed them a set of dos and don'ts, including the advise that they must base their campaign on collective leadership.
In keeping with that, the BJP has announced Team Modi 2014 - 20 star-studded committees to manage different aspects of the party's election campaign under Mr Modi's flight attendantship. (

On 28 December 1552 the Duke of Northumberland imparted their latest thoughts on English diplomacy to their right hand man, Sir William Cecil. King Edward had just okayed the council's suggestion “to employ ministers abroad for the public weal of Christendom”, that is to send envoys to Europe to offer English assistance in negotiating a peace between the Empire and France. Cecil was to tell Edward that they were to “be better served if those sent have grace and wit to note what they see and hear”. Those appointed by the council were Sir Andrew Dudley (“my brother”) and Sir Henry Sidney (“my son”), and it had not yet been decided who was to go to the emperor and who to the King of France; however, Northumberland thought that their son-in-law Sidney had “more means to express their mind in the Italian tongue than in the French” and so perhaps they should be the one to meet Charles V (whose first language, incidentally, was French).1
Ignoring the duke's suggestion, the council sent Sidney to France and Dudley to the Low Countries – where the emperor was staying. For the last few years John Dudley had balanced successfully on a tightrope between the two great powers, and when both requested English assistance for their wars against each other, their demands were politely rejected and England remained neutral. Under these circumstances a general peace was welcome,2 especially as the negotiations would augment Edward's prestige.
On 1 January 1553 Sir Andrew Dudley called on Jehan de Schefye, Charles V's ambassador in London, to pay their respects and announce their mission:
They declared to me of their own accord that their charge was a very important one, but did not make themselves more plain; they thanked me … and, after some more conversation, departed.3
Sidney and Dudley were chosen for their known personal closeness to the king rather than for any particular skills;4 the more convincingly they could represent the peace initiative as Edward's personal suggestion. The sending of these “totally inexperienced” men has been criticized,5 yet Northumberland themselves suggested that in due course they could be joined by “more experienced” diplomats and that the journey could also serve for their “learning and education”.6 Furthermore, Andrew Dudley was not wholly inexperienced. In 1546 Henry VIII had sent them with presents to Brussels, to Mary of Hungary, Charles V's sister and Regent of the Netherlands: Dudley, in their role as Equerry of the Stable, brought horses, greyhounds, and running dogs.7
In 1553 Andrew Dudley again first travelled to Brussels, where they were received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January. One of the letters carried by them may have been an address from the emperor's cousin, the Lady Mary, whom Northumberland had asked to emphasize England's goodwill towards the Empire.8 Impatient to see the emperor himself, Dudley tried to intercept them on their way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles, knew nothing of this until they met Dudley at Trier, on the Moselle. The ailing ruler was averse to being molested by diplomats while journeying; Morrison nevertheless managed to arrange an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion.9
Morrison and Dudley went back to Brussels, where during February they were busy hosting their Imperial colleagues (including Diego de Mendoza, godfather to Guildford, Andrew Dudley's nephew):
On the 9th Morysine invited Mons. de Rie to dine with Dudley at their lodgings, where they should meet Don Diego di Mendoza … and others. … After dinner De Rie accepted an invitation from Dudley to dine with them on the following day, and to bring their guest with them as they had done to Morysine. The same evening Mons. de Courriers came to town, and they also gladly came to dine at Dudley's.
Finally, Charles V was ready to meet the English envoys,
for on Friday the 10th instant they sent a gentleman of their chamber to Dudley to tell them that the Emperor would speak with them on the morrow, as accordingly at three o'clock of the Saturday they did. The Court was very well furnished with noblemen, all of them very glad to embrace the Ambassadors, and glad to talk well of England. The Emperor came forth without staff or any to lead him, their chair being set on the farther end of the chamber that they might see they could go so far without any stay. In the conversation which ensued between their Majesty and Dudley, the former said that until particularities were known from their enemy how could they will the King of England to work in the matter of peace? What answer could they give? All the world knew they began not the wars; they knew France took their subjects' ships and goods, had invaded the empire, hired men to rebellion, taken from the empire things belonging to it, and from themselves part of their inheritance. For himself, they always loved peace and wished the quietness of Christendom, and if they might have such a peace … their will was good, and they would be glad to have a peace … But they knew, if peace were made, the French King would no longer keep it with them than they thought it their best.
After Charles had stressed a few more times that they were amenable to a reasonable agreement, Andrew Dudley's great moment arrived:
When about to take leave, and offering to kiss their hand, the Emperor cast their arm about Dudley's neck, with great show of accepting their coming, of liking their message, and of allowing their behaviour in the doing thereof.
Dudley and Morrison noted that the chamber had been hung with tapestries depicting the emperor's victories.
De Rie and others accompanied them home … They had scarcely arrived at home when Don Diego, who had called during their absence, returned to desire Dudley not to fail them to-morrow at dinner. De Rie promised by the way, that they would not leave Dudley so long as they could enjoy him, and when they could no more, their trust was they should meet one day again.
On taking their leave, Dudley alongside their resident colleagues, Morrison and Chamberlain, received “very gentle entertainment” from the Regent; Morrison was as sorry to stay as Dudley was “glad to be gone”.10 Back in England they delivered a gracious letter to King Edward from the emperor and elicited the close interest of the Imperial ambassador, de Schefye, who in their turn informed Charles V:
Sire: I received your Majesty's letters of the 13th through Dudley, who arrived in this town on the 18th of the month and had audience of the King and my lords of the Council the following day, and came to see me the same afternoon. I congratulated them on their return, and they told me how they had left your Majesty at Brussels in good health, and that the King, their master, had rejoiced to hear it because of the singular affection they bore you. They declared that your Majesty had done them great honour, and bestowed a present on him. … They declared that they had perceived most clearly that your Majesty indeed loved the King, their master. I assured them such was the truth, and that your Majesty had always held them as their son, and proved it in the past, in contrast to the course adopted by certain others. As we had entertained one another at some length with these professions of mutual love, … and never a word had they said about the letter from your Majesty to the King, or their negotiation, I made bold at last to question them if they had accomplished their mission to your Majesty. They replied that they had made their report to the King and my lords of the Council on what your Majesty had declared to him, and did not enlarge beyond this, which they did, in my opinion, rather to safeguard their reputation than for any other reason. Therefore I thought it well to say no more at the time and let the matter drop there. … I can assure your Majesty that the Court and the town are full of the honours and welcome given to the said Dudley, and that all seem pleased about it, especially at the good understanding between their Majesties; and some go so far as to say that under colour of the said embassy a closer alliance may be about to be negotiated. The matter has given some umbrage to the French ambassador. To sum up, Sire, and reverting to the question of friendships, Dudley said to me that the friendship with France would never prove to be a real one, that the English had never thought much of the French, and they believed that if your Majesty wished to employ Englishmen, you would get a good number together. I replied that they had proved their zeal in your Majesty's service, and after a few more words of no importance, Sire, they took their leave.11

FBI agents are reportedly skeptical of the law enforcement agency's decision to close the Hillary Clinton email investigation without recommending criminal charges.
Agents told the New York Post that they "believe there was an inside deal put in place" after Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton just days ahead of the FBI's announcement that its year-long probe had ended.
Investigators were reportedly forced to sign unusually extensive nondisclosure agreements that would prevent them from speaking publicly about the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email use.
The FBI's decision last week rankled Republicans, who have pushed the Justice Department to open a second probe into whether the former secretary of state committeed perjury last year when they testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi.
The Justice Department did not return a request for comment.
Online advertising networks – particularly Google's – are more dangerous than the fledgling plans and dreams of ISPs to install eavesdropping equipment inside their internet pipes to serve tailored ads to their customers, AT&T says.
At least that's what the company told Congress in a letter early this week, responding to four prominent House lawmakers who are bird-dogging ISPs about their online profiling practices. Those lawmakers asked 33 internet companies on Aug. 1 to explain some of their monitoring practices, Most have replied.
In its letter (.pdf), AT&T denies that it currently digs deep into the net habits of its users "for the purpose [of] developing a profile of a particular consumer's online behavior."* (AT&T is currently facing a class action lawsuit for allegedly helping the NSA spy on Americans' internet usage, but that's a different issue since the NSA does not run ads.)
However, it says it may bake this kind of surveillance into its tubes in the future using so-called Deep Packet Inspection technology. The company rightly says could be also be used to detect copyright infringement, speed up packets of streaming video and detect child pornography.
But even if it did, that's nothing compared to Google, it says.
"If anything the largely invisible practices of ad-networks raise even greater privacy concerns than do the behavioral advertising techniques that ISPs could employ, such as deep-packet-inspection," AT&T wrote.
AT&T rightly points out that Google can know almost as much a snooping ISP could – which, is the case for users who install Google's toolbar and don't know to opt out of Google's Web History program. And if Google does combine its third-party cookie information, with user's search histories, with Gmail summaries, and with Google Analytics data, among other data sources, they would be a proper domestic intelligence agency.
AT&T writes:
Advertising-network operators such as Google have evolved beyond merely tracking consumer web surfing activity on sites for which they have a direct ad-serving relationship. They now have the ability to observe a user's entire web browsing experience at a granular level, including all URLs visited, all searches, and actual page-views.
AT&T goes on to say then that because of Google's singular ability to gather online data that online advertising networks are substantially similar to ISPs monitoring their customers.
Google and Yahoo are perhaps the only two online empires that AT&T could realistically point towards to make that argument.
It's a clever argument, since online advertising cookies are nearly universally accepted and there are voluntary codes of conduct that most advertisers agree to in order to keep government regulators away.
And certainly any ISP thinking about looking at what its users are doing has got to be worried given that the House Energy and Commerce Committee is on a roll – taking on ISPs that want to or have watched what their customers do online in order to serve them targeted ads. That roll is reportedly heading towards a long-fabled online privacy omnibus bill. Add to that, this month's unprecedented decision by the Federal Communications Commission to slap down Comcast for its secret and deceptive interference with file sharing traffic.
But the argument is also just wrong.
You pay your ISP to carry your traffic to and fro.
It can see everything you do online, unless you take extreme measures. It could know where you bank, the contents of your emails and chats, what sites you shop at, what you search about –regardless of search engine – and everything you read or watch online.
Your ISP does not need to be peering into your traffic to decide whether to show you ads for hemorrhoid cream or sports bobble heads.
They just need to get that health information and that gallery of hockey's worst bobble heads to your browser quickly.
* Threat Level readers may enjoy this full sentence from the letter: "AT&T does not at this time engage in practices that allow it to track a consumer's search and browsing activities across multiple unrelated websites for the purpose [of] developing a profile of a particular consumer's online behavior."

Verizon finally rolled out Android 5.1.1 Lollipop to the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and to keep the good news rolling, Samsung released a beta version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow to the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.
A few weeks ago, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge received the Android 6.0 Marshmallow beta, but it was limited to a couple of owners who participated in the program in the UK, which means that the update didn't reach the United States. It was geared toward visual improvements, Google Now on Tap and Doze – no surprise there, as this is a major update after all.
On that note, Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow would seem like a minor update at first glance, not to mention that it's a beta, but it actually came with a ton of upgrades here and there, which is quite unusual.
1. Additional Quick Settings toggles for Private Mode in the status bar.
2. A new set of emoji characters.
3. Visibility of notification panel icons has been improved.
4. In fingerprint identification, vibration occurs only when it's not recognized.
5. A new "Install Overnight" option, where an update installation can be set at night between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m.
6. A new interface for the Edge screen settings, including an "Edge Panels" option.
7. A customizable Edge panel, where its transparency and size can be adjusted (it can also be updated with new ones online).
8. A new Tasks Edge panel to set shortcuts for apps.
9. Support for profiles that can automatically change based on location (e.g., it can mute sounds when at work and turn on volumes when at home).
To get a better look of things, hit up the video SamMobile uploaded below.
With the recent images, the Android Marshmallow update seems to be shaping up into one heck of an operating system.
Meanwhile, the long overdue Android 5.1.1 Lollipop on Verizon's Galaxy Note 4 fixes a slew of bugs and stability issues across the board, which owners are well aware of. It's an over-the-air update with the software version LMY47X.N910VVRU2BOK3.
"This software update has been tested to optimize device performance, resolve known issues and apply the latest security patches," Verizon says.
Particularly, the update includes support for Android for Work, improvements to the Samsung Knox Platform and removal of the preinstalled Amazon Appstore and Amazon Widgets. In other words, it adds more features while getting rid of what could be called bloatware.
In related news, T-Mobile has already published a list of devices that will receive the Marshmallow update, emphasizing on how far behind Verizon is with the updates. The eligible devices include the Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy Note edge, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Tab S2.
Currently, there's no official word on when a public release will roll out, though. The information so far only shows what's in store for the users in the foreseeable future.
The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is already live, so participants of the beta program who haven't received it yet can go ahead and manually check for it through Settings > About device > Software update menu.
The same goes for the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop upgrade for Verizon Galaxy Note 4 models, and it can be downloaded manually through the same steps. In the event of an error, the carrier has a nifty Software Upgrade Assistant (PDF) tool.

[one_half]Sometimes everything works against you. The race on Sunday at Leuven was great, a very challenging course and it should have been relatively easy to shoot but the use of flash was almost essential as it is getting darker sooner and sooner.

Burundi's football-loving president is rumoured to be standing for a controversial third term, despite the two-term limit in the current constitution. It's one factor contributing to mounting tensions in the nation, where it now seems a morning jog could result in life imprisonment.
The drive out of Bujumbura last Saturday provided an image that will stay with me for a long time yet.
It was just after dawn, and we were climbing away from Lake Tanganyika, towards the high plateau of the interior. The escarpment wound on and on. From time to time, on my left, the curtain of banana trees and acacias would swing open, and the hills and valleys would spill away from us, towards a horizon of forest.
But it was the view to my right that entranced me.
Tucked between the narrow road and the side of the hill, the people of Bujumbura were running. Up, and up. A great, long line of them.

Some were in clusters - others, in their private reveries. Most were young men. But I also saw a man and a woman - of late middle age and generous girth - running together and holding hands.
The tradition of Saturday morning runs started during Burundi's long years of ethnic conflict. The last spasm of war only ended back in 2005, with 300,000 dead from the population of eight million. Then, no-one jogged up these hills.
This was where the militias - now the men of government - would hide.
So it was in the city of Bujumbura itself that people would try to vent their fear and frustration and claustrophobia, by running, often in a group.
But on this Saturday morning I was taken aback to see some young men, running together, as a group. It was a surprise, because back in March, the country's president, Pierre Nkurunziza had decreed that such a practice was to be banned.
They feared it was being used as a cover for subversion.

Indeed, some people are now spending a very long time in prison in part, at least, because of their group jogging. They're members of the opposition Movement for Solidarity and Democracy (MSD) Party - sentenced to jail terms ranging from five years to life.
A screaming cavalcade of security careered up the road - first the police then a dozen armed men
The 49-year-old president, for their part, remains an enthusiastic consumer of team games - football in particular.
They have their own side, Hallelujah FC, for whom, according to government leaflets, they play as a striker and often scores goals.
I'd already been made aware of the president's penchant for a kick-about as I drove, with my colleagues, back from an interview in town.
Suddenly, a police officer and a soldier started waving their hands at us to get off the street - a frantic, wringing motion, as if they'd trapped their hands in a dog's mouth.

Moments later a screaming cavalcade of security careered up the road. First the police - a dozen armed men in blue camouflage arrayed in the back of the pickup. Then the army - a dozen men in green camouflage with rifles, another soldier gripping an enormous mounted machine gun. Then a herd of four-by-fours with tinted windows. Then more army and police.

I asked the local journalist I was with where the president was coming from.
"His afternoon football game," they answered.
On this Saturday, I was trying to visit another of the places where the president likes to play.
A stadium which he's had built by their home village, in the north-east of the country.
Some hours out of Bujumbura, we rounded a corner, and stumbled across a complex straight from a Mediterranean resort, an arena of magisterial size and scope.
Sadly, the guards would not let us in to the stadium, despite the laissez-passer we showed them, issued by the president's own office.
While we chatted with the soldiers, a stream of boys hauled themselves past us, up the steep road. They were dressed in rags, their heads bowed under fat bundles of sugar cane.
I'd guess they were seven or eight years old. But they may have been older.
Burundi comes second in the world only to Afghanistan in stunting, the main symptom of chronic child malnutrition. This, in a place which, as we'd seen on our drive across the country, is fertile enough to be self-sufficient in food.
But it is also a land sucked dry by corruption. Burundi bumps along the bottom of all the major global indices of corruption.
As we drove back to Bujumbura, time and again we were stopped by police officers, languidly waving us down, before seeing our display of cameras and microphones, and deciding maybe we didn't have too many questions to answer.
Halfway down our final, winding descent towards Bujumbura, the sun about to sink into Lake Tanganyika, we drove past a lone jogger, running up the hill.
They were a grey bearded man, in a long-trousered tracksuit, their eyes locked forward, their hands shadow-boxing.

Actress Sunny Leone recently opened up about the dangers of cyberbullying and how they once had to add an extra layer of security around their house for fear of an attack from a deranged stalker.
Bollywood superstar and former adult actor Sunny Leone has a huge fan following around the globe. However, the star does get abused and threatened on social media on a regular basis just like any other celebrity.
Recently, the actor shared details of how they used to walk to the door with a knife in their hand at night after being harassed online by a bully.
“Someone threatened me, telling me he'd come to my house to cause harm. Daniel [Weber, husband] was not in the country, and I was frightened because I was living alone. I would hear noises outside my house and walk towards the door with a knife in my hand,” they revealed.
Sunny Leone then revealed how one Twitter user with a sizeable fan following, had threatened to turn up with a mob at their house and break into their home.
The incident had left them distraught and forced the actor to change their house.
“He started banging on my door. That their Twitter followers had also bullied me, made me fear that a mob would turn up and break into my house,” they said. “We changed our house later, but this incident still affects me,” added Sunny.
The actor has joined hands with a NGO to stop cyber harassment and online abuse. Sunny Leone will next be seen in a flick titled Tera Intezaar opposite Arbaaz Khan.
What is RSNA?
Every year, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) hosts its annual meeting the week after Thanksgiving in Chicago. This is one of the largest medical conferences in the world, with over 50,000 attendees from 57 countries. This year, RSNA was organized from 26th Nov to 1st Dec and gathered approximately 700 exhibitors.
Highlight of RSNA 2017
During RSNA 2016, there was hype around AI in Radiology Imaging Diagnostics. This year, about 20 startup companies came up with the AI models that can augment radiologists findings. The AI models were available across Modalities and Pathology. Even though it can not replace a radiologist, it improves accuracy and speed of diagnostics thereby reducing the cost of diagnosis. For some of the companies, FDA/CE has approved their AI Models which means that the results are as accurate as a human.
Relevance of AI machine learning/Deep learning in Radiology Diagnostics
Radiology diagnostic industry in the USA
US Diagnostic Imaging Market is around $4.5 billion and expected to grow 36.43 Billion by 2021.
North America is one of the most lucrative regions for medical imaging market because of its better infrastructure facilities. When compared to emerging regions, it has high-end purchasing power coupled with reimbursement facilities. U.S is the dominating region owing to its population base having large insurance coverage, advancement in technology, a sizable aging population along with the prevalence of chronic disease.
Radiology diagnostics current state
According to a market research, sponsored by IBM, there were roughly 800 million multi-slice exams performed in the United States in 2015 alone. Those studies generated approximately 60 billion medical images. At those volumes, each of 31,000 odd radiologists in the U.S., has to view an image every two seconds of every working day for an entire year to find potentially life-saving information from a handful of images hidden in a sea of data. It is evident from the data that medical images are going to get generated exponentially and there is a shortage of radiologist, on the other hand, it will take ten years of training to become a radiologist. In this scenario, AI Imaging technology has relevance.
Statistics of Medical images vs. Case studies conducted vs. Radiologists
Impact of the emerging trend for Radiologists
The average radiologist's salary is $286,000 a year. In the U.S., there are 31,000 radiologists.
That means around 9 billion dollars a year is being spent on radiologists. AI and Deep learning is predicted to bring down the headcount of the radiologist but will not replace the radiologist. In RSNA 2017, some of the AI models developed demonstrated capability on par with a professional radiologist. The radiologist can embrace AI or be left behind.
Emerging Medical Imaging AI Companies who Participated in RSNA 2017
Arterys
Arterys helps doctors diagnose heart problems in just 15 seconds while it takes around 30 minutes for a human.

Docker has long relied on Ubuntu Linux as the default host environment for Docker apps, but comments from the company's CTO recently suggest that might not be the case much longer.
"We have hired Natanael Copa, the awesome creator of Alpine Linux, and are in the process of switching the Docker official image library from Ubuntu to Alpine," a user named shykes wrote in a Hacker News thread 10 days ago.
Docker confirmed Tuesday that shykes is Solomon Hykes, Docker's founder and CTO. But it also seemed to back away from their remark.
"Discussions on Hacker News are often effectively real-time, casual conversation," Docker spokesperson Suzanne Panoplos said via email. "As such, words and terms used there are occasionally inexact.
"To clarify, we are 'expanding' our offering, rather than 'switching' it from Ubuntu to Alpine," Panoplos said. "Docker is now providing images based on Alpine Linux, in addition to Ubuntu and Debian, as another option for users. Ultimately this provides users with more choice when selecting their image content."
In the meantime, Hykes' comment had sparked a debate among Docker enthusiasts, with some calling it a step backwards for the popular container technology.
Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on the musl libc library and BusyBox. The download size for the latest .iso image, released early this year, is 82MB, making it considerably smaller than Ubuntu.
Docker containers don't need all of the software built into Ubuntu, and a change like this could clearly reduce overhead, as noted Monday by The VAR Guy, which first reported the news.
"Just downloading the Ubuntu official image from Docker Hub is 188MB, and it has been downloaded over 40 million times, which equates to over 7,520 TB of data transfer between Docker Hub and users around the world just for this single image," cloud architect Brian Christner said in a blog post on Friday. "Multiply this by all the official images, and the amount of transfer data is mind boggling."
With Alpine Linux, a container requires no more than 8MB, and a minimal installation to disk requires around 130 MB of storage, its creators say.
Advantages for Docker users could include faster download speeds, better security thanks to a smaller attack surface, and faster migration among hosts, Christner noted.
Such a switch to Alpine Linux wouldn't mean that Docker would no longer work on Ubuntu -- just that it would no longer be the default.
Not everyone was excited about the prospect.
"The distro package management is one of the biggest reasons why people still stick with heavyweight distros like Ubuntu," wrote a user called kylequest on Hacker News, adding that DockerSlim already lets users eliminate what they don't need from heavyweight distros like Ubuntu.
"You get the best of both worlds where you don't have to change your process and you still get small images," kylequest explained.
Docker's Hykes, meanwhile, urged readers on Hacker News to help with the move to Alpine.
"You can help us with pull requests to https://github.com/docker-library," they wrote. "Even one such pull request could go a long way to promoting smaller containers, since those images have been downloaded over half a billion times."
It's unclear why Hykes said Docker was "switching" from Ubuntu to Alpine, if that's not the case. Perhaps we'll get more clarity in the days and weeks ahead.
Overall, enterprises are increasingly turning to lightweight, hybrid, data-center and container-specific operating systems such as Apcera, Alpine Linux, CoreOS, Mesosophere and RancherOS, said Jay Lyman, a research manager with 451 Research.
Alpine Linux's security focus could be viewed as an additional advantage, Lyman added.
Ultimately, though, even if the switch does take place, there won't be much disruption or even a noticeable difference for most users, they said.
"The move may eventually mean some speed, performance and security gains with the lightweight and security aspects of Alpine Linux," Lyman said, but "Docker will still work with other Linux distributions as it has before."
Former President Jimmy Carter gave a full-throated endorsement of state efforts to legalize marijuana during an appearance at a CNN forum aired on Tuesday.
Carter, who as president supported an era of marijuana decriminalization in the mid-1970s, told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux that they were "in favor" of states that were taking steps to legalize the drug.
"I think it's OK,” Carter said. “I don't think it's going to happen in Georgia yet, but I think we can watch and see what happens in the state of Washington for instance, around Seattle, and let the American government and let the American people see does it cause a serious problem or not.”
Voters in both Washington and Colorado approved ballot initiatives last month legalizing and taxing marijuana. The governors in those states have signed both measures into law, but marijuana reform advocates remain concerned that federal law, which still considers the substance illegal under the Controlled Substances Act, could lead to complications if federal authorities decide to continue with frequent raids of dispensaries and other marijuana-related operations.
Speaking about the issues of an anti-drug system focused on enforcement, Carter suggested that large incarceration rates, especially among minorities, were being perpetuated by harsh punishments for marijuana possession.
"It's a major step backward, and it ought to be reversed, not only in America, but around the world," Carter argued, later going on to say that nations such as Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs in 2000, could be a model for the United States to look toward in the future.
Carter has been an increasingly vocal proponent of reforming U.S. marijuana laws and strict drug prohibition efforts in the nation and around the world. Speaking earlier this year, Carter accused U.S. drug policy of having “destroyed the lives of millions of young people.” They went on to promote an "alternative approach, beginning with treatment instead of just imprisonment for people who use drugs but do no harm to others.”
FRANKENMUTH TOWNSHIP, MI -- Police believe a malnourished dog was thrown from a moving vehicle near Frankenmuth and left for dead. An animal cruelty investigation is under way.
About 9 a.m. Friday, Aug. 14, Frankenmuth Police officers on patrol saw a "severely emaciated and dehydrated dog" in a ditch in the area of Reimer and Baker Roads, in Frankenmuth Township, according to the department.
Update: Emaciated dog Lucky 'doing great' after thrown from vehicle near Frankenmuth
"The male pit bull mix appeared to have been thrown from a moving vehicle into a ditch and was near death," the Frankenmuth Police Department said in a statement.
Saginaw County Animal Control officers assisted Frankenmuth police and transported the dog to a Saginaw area veterinary facility, where it was in stable condition on Friday, police said.
"The FPD will utilize every resource available to identify the suspect(s) and move forward with criminal charges," a Frankenmuth Police Department statement reads.
Anyone with information about the dog or its former owner is asked to contact Frankenmuth Detective Flathau at 989-652-8371, extension 161.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a Washington, D.C. grand jury for their probe of Russia's interference in the 2016 election, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
The Journal reported that this new development is “a sign that their inquiry is growing in intensity and entering a new phase.”
Mueller is investigating Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump's campaign or associates colluded with Moscow.
On "Shepard Smith Reporting," one of the authors of the report, Del Quentin Wilbur, explained that grand juries are powerful investigative tools that allow prosecutors to subpoena documents, put witnesses under oath and seek indictments, if there is evidence of a crime.

"It's both a basic step, but also one that signals, 'Hey, this is heating up. I've found enough here to justify getting more information and doing more work,'" Wilbur said.
They added another sign the investigation is ramping up is that Greg Andres, a top partner at major New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has joined Mueller's team.
They said that no one of Andres' stature would leave a successful private practice to join an investigation that's soon going to die.
Wilbur pointed out, however, that this does not mean someone is being charged with a crime. It merely means that Mueller believes the grand jury is a necessary tool in the investigation.

A new statement by the AAAS Board of Directors "strongly urges" the United States to become a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Convention, which is modeled after the Americans with Disabilities Act, is the first international treaty to articulate the obligations of governments to respect, protect and fulfill the human rights of persons with disabilities.
In its 7 April statement, the AAAS Board cites "AAAS's long-standing commitment to increase access to and participation in science and technology by persons with disabilities" as the basis for its position and also affirms "that research and development benefit from intellectual and experiential diversity."
The United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention in 2006. President Obama signed it in 2009, but in 2012 the U.S. Senate failed to give its required consent to ratifying the treaty. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took the Convention up again in 2013, and supporters are expected to bring it forward for a full vote in summer 2014.
"The United States has a lot of experience and expertise in this area," said Jessica Wyndham, associate director of the Scientific Responsibility, Human Rights and Law Program at AAAS. "By ratifying the Convention, the U.S. would not only clearly demonstrate its commitment to protecting the rights of people with disabilities but would have the opportunity to participate in the discussions going on at the international level about how to best promote and protect those rights in practice."
As the AAAS Board statement explains, the Convention explicitly recognizes the rights of persons with disabilities to enjoy equal access to medical facilities, education, workplaces and communications technologies. Furthermore, it calls on nations to support research and development on adaptive goods and services, as well as new assistive technologies; encourages international cooperation in research, facilitating access to scientific and technical knowledge, and standards for sharing medical and technological advances; and reiterates the prohibition against medical or scientific experimentation on any person without their free consent.
The statement also notes that AAAS has long pursued programs aimed at promoting equal access to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education for students with disabilities and creating competitive opportunities for person with disabilities to pursue careers in these fields.
Since 1975, the AAAS Project on Science, Technology, and Disability has worked with and for engineers and scientists with disabilities. In 1976, AAAS held the first accessible meeting that had ever been organized by a professional scientific organization, in Boston. AAAS followed up by initiating seminars for engineering and science societies on how to include members with disabilities in their national and local meetings, providing technical assistance, and publishing a guidebook on barrier-free meetings.
Since its creation in 1996, the flagship program in support of people with disabilities Entry Point! has placed more than 500 highly qualified undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities in STEM internships. At least 90% of Entry Point! alums have continued their education, received graduate degrees and/or have found full employment in a STEM field. In 2009, AAAS held the first-ever conference for engineers with disabilities, " Problem Solvers: Education and Career Paths of Engineers with Disabilities."
More recently, the AAAS Science and Human Rights Coalition held a meeting in January 2014 on the topic of 'Disability Rights and Accessing the Benefits of Scientific Progress and Its Applications." Vinton Cerf, vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google presented, as well as James Thurston of Microsoft, representatives of the U.S. government, scientists and engineers with disabilities and disability rights advocates. Several speakers addressed the symbolic and practical significance of U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities.
The sad conditions we face at this moment in our political life as a nation summon a particularly high-spirited parable from a couple of red-blooded Americans whose minds often turned on the fate of human liberty. It's a parable that tests the proposition that one can find a liberal political conscience even in those illiberal, uncharitable, self-righteous politicians who masquerade as champions of the people.
In April 1817, precisely 200 years ago, 81-year-old former president John Adams wrote a marvelously candid letter to their onetime rival and successor as president, Thomas Jefferson. Adams was still getting hammered in print by a fellow New Englander whom George Washington had hired as secretary of state and Adams had fired, three years into their presidency, for political disloyalty and warmongering. The embittered Timothy Pickering refused to give Adams credit for any accomplishment, either as a committed Revolutionary or as chief executive. Adams returned the favor when they renewed their attacks on Jefferson's legacy some years later.

“My loving and beloved Friend, Pickering, has been pleased to inform the World that I have ‘few Friends,'” the wry Adams told Jefferson. “I wanted to whip the rogue … till the blood come.” But, they continued, their true friends cautioned them that “nothing that such a Person could write would do me the least Injury.” Ironic, perhaps, that Adams was entirely comfortable, in 1800, with the Alien and Sedition Acts -- legislation passed amid a counter-revolutionary fervor -- which severely restricted freedom of the press and resulted in the imprisonment of editors who criticized the president in print. Ironic, too, that Jefferson, as president, actively tried to impeach a Supreme Court justice, simply for criticizing them from the bench.
They were politicians, through and through, though they'd mellowed somewhat as the years passed. Adams went on to tell Jefferson how he'd convinced themselves that even one so mean-spirited as Pickering had to possess a conscience. Not that religion played any role, mind you. They didn't quite know where to turn, but they refused to give up hope. Adams could not despise humankind, they wanted Jefferson to know, because all men were created equal in their combined qualities of reason and ridiculousness.
There were moments when Adams was prepared to go public with the message that they classed religion with the ridiculous: “I have been upon the point of breaking out, ‘This would be the best of all possible Worlds, if there was not Religion in it.'”
But then, they reconsidered. If “indelible marks of Conscience” adhered even to the most egoistic of exalted political leaders, and they were convinced it did, then religion deserved some credit.
Adams went on to tell Jefferson that all the promises he'd ever heard, earthly and heavenly alike, left them feeling naught but “pitty” for their fellow creatures. Whether in the political forum or the pulpit, “Fears and Terrors appear to have produced an universal Credulity,” they wrote. In Adams' judgment, humans succumbed to their fears to such a degree that they repeatedly settled for tyrannical rulers who exacted obedience and bowed before a religious authority that preached posthumous punishment so as to control parishioners' day-to-day behavior.
Jefferson, for their part, backed up Adams on both scores.

As for Pickering and the vengeful others who spoke ill of them, the sympathetic Virginian wrote quotably, “Were such things to be answered, our lives would be wasted in the filth of fendings and provings, instead of being employed in promoting the happiness and prosperity of our fellow citizens.” They also commiserated with Adams as another longtime critic of the miraculous in religion and the gullibility of those overburdened by their attachment to church dogma. And they agreed with Adams that “moral precepts, innate in man,” bolstered by the general principles laid down by religion, helped avert a human-produced hell.
The Adams-Jefferson correspondence, especially that of their later years, stands as a reminder of two decisive truths about America's history as a nation: 1. The prevalence of character assassination as a feature of U.S. politics; and 2. The constancy of moral appeals to “the happiness and prosperity of our fellow citizens” (whether helped along by a nondenominational religious persuasion or not).
The parable of 1817 still retains its value in 2017, when it seems near impossible to justify whatever rationale self-identified conservatives in Congress use in proposing the abandonment of liberal-inspired programs that address the suffering of our citizens.
While blaming “government” for social ills, no matter what their true cause, conservatives somehow convince people who would do better in a more equitably based society that they should hate nothing so much as equalizing legislative measures. Moneyed power-brokers with their hooks into members of Congress keep rewarding themselves while deceptive crumbs are thrown to everyone else. These same people, hypocritically spouting religious morality at every campaign stop, acquiesce to an irreligious chief executive who “makes deals” at the expense of morality.

These are painful times. People are justly dispirited and confused. Graphs objectively displaying economic inequality are becoming ever more stretched and distended. In a modern republic, we all agree, the government does not abandon its duty to “secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,” to borrow a phrase from the Constitution's Preamble.
But it does.
Conservatives in Congress and in too many state legislatures make sure it does. Their love for “liberty” and “freedom” is legend: There's a Republican Liberty Caucus, a House Liberty Caucus, and the most recent of newsworthy incarnations, the House Freedom Caucus. All of the Liberty caucuses oppose social spending. There's Liberty University, but the political endorsements of both its founder and current president suggest less of an appreciation for the blessings of liberty than for a strict social order. Obey. There was even a Liberty Party in the U.S. in the 1840s. Its platform was slavery abolition, which makes the party name quite literal -- and quite different from conservatives' modern adaptation.

Conservatives in Congress exploit the fear of undocumented workers with undocumented rhetoric. They again rail ad nauseam about infiltration by foreigners -- except those pulling strings in Moscow -- who threaten public security and the national economy. Of course, immigrants make America strong. They always have. They succeed bigly. But if you're a conservative, you convince easily conned voters that immigration reform is amnesty, that it interferes with the promise of American liberty. When hysterical hatred of strangers ensues, you get, well, what we have now. The same goes for voter fraud. Conservatives make sure the longest lines are at minority community polling places -- to maximize liberty?
Barack Obama suffered more than John Adams ever did from the sensational statements of haters. And they let it go, which was very Christian. Republicans have railed ad nauseam in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which they derisively call Obamacare. Now they only hope it “implodes,” as the cruel prophecy goes. All who refuse to take in the Republicans' truth-mocking talking points understand that the goal of health care must be to cover as many people as possible and to put Big Insurance's and Big Pharma's profits second after the health of citizens. The real-world result would be to extend both life and liberty to many more millions.
If the founders' hallowed vocabulary actually matters, Republicans would not have played the hate and discredit game for all these years, while having no good ideas of their own.

The same truth-deniers in Congress who succeeded in convincing a conscience-damaged base that Obama was not really American, and a secret Muslim to boot, are always quick to tag progressive programs as socialist. They never actually define “socialist” -- otherwise, they would have to propose abolishing Medicare altogether, which would anger voters, which wouldn't allow them to retain their sinister club's power over the popular mind. Yet hear ye, hear ye -- irony heaped upon irony -- when stalwart Republicans are shown pie charts of the wealth distribution in two unidentified countries and they're asked which they'd prefer to live in, a whopping 90 percent choose Sweden, with all its socialism, over the United States. (And 94 percent of Democrats went the same way.)
You heard that right. Americans want a society where liberty equals fairmindedness. Where relative social equality is operational, not an empty boast. Yet last November, they succumbed to a vapid con man and voted in billionaire rule.
Americans say they love democracy because it's the perfection of political liberty, but it's not liberty when the conservative candidate shouts at voters that they're persecuted by a federal government that cares more about illegals than about them. Reagan's apocryphal welfare queen in their fancy limousine was just the beginning of this hijacking of votes through cruel deceptions. Reagan believed their own stories. This new 70-year-old, the limp entertainer, doesn't seem to know what to believe. Living moment to moment in a nightmare of their own creation, lacking apparent impulse control, they just seems to spew forth self-servingly, snicker and sneer. They order others to pick up what they drop, as they move on to the next moral outrage.
Voters were conned by promises and provocations, which were humorlessly prattled over the course of a year and delivered in pathetically simplistic form, à la, “You'll be so tired of winning…” What will the future say of us? What would a John Adams, a Thomas Jefferson, have made of the present phenomenon? (We're often asked.) That Americans are “enjoying” the liberty to be deceived?

The Adams persuasion commands us to believe that even the most conservative members of the GOP possess enough of a conscience to accept some of the facts when the facts show how many good Americans are getting hurt by their policies. The language of deception -- look the other way so you don't see how we're exploiting you -- should be embarrassing at some point to all but the most shamelessly dissimulating of corporation-protecting, so-called conservatives. (Don't hold your breath for Ted Cruz.) After all, in private, they're always telling Democratic colleagues what they can never say in public without revealing the con and losing it all.
To the end of their days, Tim Pickering never wavered. They were simply a nasty guy. Today's Republicans don't seem to be big on apologizing either. With a moral compass like we've seen since Reagan, it's no surprise that they'd oppose the Republican idea of health care as soon as Obama touched it -- whence it suddenly acquired its scary socialist tendencies.
Can caring people do something to stop this? We can think of one way: Seize back the narrative. Wherever it's spoken or written, reclaim "liberty" as it ought to be understood: an expansive, not restrictive, quality of life; a privilege shared by the great majority of citizens, with respect for minimum-wage laborers, for underpaid, under-provisioned public school teachers in our poorer communities; and respect for patriotic immigrants.
Make it plain that the GOP is not at all in the business of expanding liberty, that they're strictly in the business of making policies that allow their donors to hoard money. They keep wages down -- as union membership declines, income inequality rises. They ignore inequality of opportunity in public education. They ignore all that would help to rebuild the middle class. They trash the environment. They defraud voters when they gerrymander districts so as to win a majority of congressional seats with a minority of popular votes.

Liberty is meant to be spread, not hoarded. It's the government's responsibility to make liberty available to those ordinarily deprived of it, “not to destroy individualism, but to protect it.” It was Franklin Roosevelt who said that.
Bernie Sanders has noted that more than half of all new income generated in this country goes to the top 1 percent. “You have got to think about the morality of that,” they said, pointing out that justice is denied amid “a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, while at the same time America has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth. How can we? I want you to go into your hearts, how can we talk about morality, about justice, when we turn our backs on the children of our country?”
Sanders made those bold, searing remarks at -- did you guess -- Liberty University.
The “happiness and prosperity of our citizens” demands an apology from antisocial conservative politicians. Which won't arrive until they become comfortably retired ex-GOP members of congress who continue to rest easy with a cushy government healthcare plan that our less privileged taxpaying citizens lack access to. That's when conscience finally kicks in. George W. Bush paints portraits of soldiers now. Maybe that's what old John Adams meant when they credited wrongheaded politicians with the capacity to recover a social conscience.
Jim Breyer. Michael Seto/Business Insider
Jim Breyer, the venture capitalist who made a fortune investing early in Facebook, is optimistic about the long-term picture for the technology industry.
He's particularly bullish on artificial intelligence, and they say their firm isn't investing in anything that doesn't have a smart data analytics piece to it. They liken the new artificial-intelligence era to the social-networking era, which changed the entire digital landscape.
But in the near term they see pain.
We spoke with Breyer briefly at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
They say there is "blood in the water," and we are entering a 90-10 situation for the unicorn class of startups with billion-dollar valuations in which 90% of the startups will be repriced or die and 10% will make it.
When asked why valuations got so out of control, Breyer said a lot of deals in the past year had ratchets and downturn protections to give founders the lofty valuations they requested from venture capitalists. Those lofty valuations were often driven by greed and short-term visions (It's cool to be to worth $10 billion!).
Those terms can be OK for entrepreneurs as long as the company continues to be a rocket ship. Facebook, for example, could have survived with downturn protections worked into its term sheets when it was a startup. But if things take a turn for the worst, the investors come out fine and the founders and employees take hits in terms of both stock and morale.
Breyer was responding to a question from us about the state of Silicon Valley.
On Wednesday, we spoke with a Silicon Valley CEO who said they were looking forward to a downturn in the startup market. This CEO said the Valley used to be a place of "quirky people" but was now filled with "arrogant" people, so they were happy to see some of these companies falter as a way to flush out some of the bad actors.
Breyer says the Valley is still filled with quirky people. They also said arrogance had no place in the Valley, especially since the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Amazon, are better than they've ever been. They say humility is extremely important right now.
That said, if people in the Valley are arrogant, they're about to be humbled if Breyer is right about the death of unicorns. There are about 144 unicorns right now. If only 10% break out, that's only 14 companies that will really make it.
Despite this dire warning, Breyer thinks numerous companies will break out over the next 10 years. They see artificial intelligence as a big opportunity. They say we will see massive returns for investors in that space, in everything from medical to entertainment applications.
Former President George H.W. Bush will reportedly cross-party lines and vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in November.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, posted the news Monday on Facebook. Alongside a photo of them posing with Bush, they wrote, “The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!”
CNN followed up Tuesday, reporting that the former president had told a roomful of about 40 people the day before that they would vote for Clinton. The news outlet cited “sources close to” George H.W. Bush.
A spokesperson for the 41st president, however, would neither confirm nor deny that the Republican grandee is voting for the Democratic nominee.
“The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,” Jim McGrath told CNN on Monday. “He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.”
McGrath said on Twitter early Tuesday that they were “still checking” to verify Townsend's claim. But Townsend told Politico “that's what [Bush] said.”
Neither the 92-year-old nor their son, former President George W. Bush, have endorsed their party's current nominee, Donald Trump. The brash real estate business person defeated their son and brother Jeb Bush in a bitter primary this year. Although the former Florida governor themselves has repeatedly denounced Trump, they have not made their choice for president known.
But many former members of both Bush administrations have announced their intention to vote for Clinton in November, including former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage.
The woman, who threw ink at Arvind Kejriwal at a weekend rally to mark the “success” of the vehicle rationing rule, has alleged a “big CNG scam” behind the odd-even formula, saying they had proof of the scandal that they will present in court.
“The odd-even rule was positive, but behind that was a big CNG Scam, of which I had a sting. That is why I wanted to meet CM and Gopal Rai ji (Delhi transport minister), but they didn't agree to meet,” Bhavna Arora told ANI on Monday.
“I will submit all papers and the sting before the court. Investigation should be done in the matter,” they said a day after throwing ink at the Delhi CM while they were addressing a gathering called at the Chhatrasal stadium on the positive response to the odd-even rule. The fortnight-long experiment ended on Jan 15.
On Sunday, Arora came quite close to the lectern where Kejriwal was speaking, waved some papers towards him, and then threw ink at the chief minister. There were ink stains on Kejriwal's cheeks and some others standing close to them were also seen wiping off the liquid.

The 26-year-old woman, who claimed to be a member of the Punjab unit of Aam Aadmi Sena, was later detained by police and whisked away to Model Town police station for questioning. A case was also registered. Delhi police has sought permission from a duty magistrate to arrest the 26-year-old woman.
Soon after the attack, the AAP government charged the BJP and Delhi Police of a conspiracy as an agitated deputy CM Manish Sisodia slammed the Delhi Police, calling the incident a “major security lapse” and wondered whether it was “sitting in readiness to stage an attack on Kejriwal”.
“They may also kill people because they cannot stand the success of the odd-even scheme and AAP's popularity among the masses. Police is a part of the conspiracy,” Sisodia said referring to the BJP leadership at the Centre. The two governments have been at loggerheads since long and tensions have risen from time to time owing to issues like control over Delhi Police, or the CBI raids at the Delhi secretariat and the inquiry of the alleged DDCA corruption scam.
However, Delhi Police commissioner BS Bassi said these allegationswere “misconceived and unfounded”.
“The girl who attacked Delhi CM with ink has been arrested and a case has been registered against them We made adequate arrangements, all necessary security arrangements were made,” Bassi told ANI.
This was also the second ink attack on Kejriwal after the one during their Lok Sabha elections rally in Varanasi in April 2014, from where they were contesting against PM Narendra Modi.
Sisodia said the issue was not about Kejriwal's security alone as the consequences, had it been a bomb or acid attack, would have been ghastly.
“Centre should own responsibility and take action because such incidents have happened in the past as well. People who are staging these incidents, hatching conspiracies from behind the scene, should be acted against,” they added.

harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii

Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. It has been long visited by the Naval fleet of the United States, before it was acquired from the Hawaiian Kingdom by the U.S. with the signing of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is now a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887.[1] The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941, was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.[2][3][4]
History
Pearl Harbor was originally an extensive shallow embayment called Wai Momi (meaning, “Waters of Pearl”)[5] or Puʻuloa (meaning, “long hill”) by the Hawaiians. Puʻuloa was regarded as the home of the shark goddess, Kaʻahupahau, and their brother (or son), Kahiʻuka, in Hawaiian legends. According to tradition, Keaunui, the head of the powerful Ewa chiefs, is credited with cutting a navigable channel near the present Puʻuloa saltworks, by which they made the estuary, known as "Pearl River," accessible to navigation. Making due allowance for legendary amplification, the estuary already had an outlet for its waters where the present gap is; but Keaunui is typically given the credit for widening and deepening it.[6]
19th century
Pearl Harbor in the 1880s.
During the early 19th century, Pearl Harbor was not used for large ships due to its shallow entrance. The interest of the United States in the Hawaiian Islands grew as a result of its whaling, shipping and trading activity in the Pacific. As early as 1820, an "Agent of the United States for Commerce and Seamen" was appointed to look after American business in the Port of Honolulu. These commercial ties to the American continent were accompanied by the work of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. American missionaries and their families became an integral part of the Hawaiian political body.
Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, many American warships visited Honolulu. In most cases, the commanding officers carried letters from the U.S. Government giving advice on governmental affairs and of the relations of the island nation with foreign powers. In 1841, the newspaper Polynesian, printed in Honolulu, advocated that the U.S. establish a naval base in Hawaii for protection of American citizens engaged in the whaling industry. The British Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Crichton Wyllie, remarked in 1840 that "... my opinion is that the tide of events rushes on to annexation to the United States."
From the conclusion of the Civil War, to the purchase of Alaska, to the increased importance of the Pacific states, the projected trade with countries in Asia and the desire for a duty-free market for Hawaiian staples, Hawaiian trade expanded. In 1865, the North Pacific Squadron was formed to embrace the western coast and Hawaii. Lackawanna in the following year was assigned to cruise among the islands, "a locality of great and increasing interest and importance." This vessel surveyed the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands toward Japan. As a result, the United States claimed Midway Island. The Secretary of the Navy was able to write in their annual report of 1868, that in November 1867, 42 American flags flew over whaleships and merchant vessels in Honolulu to only six of other nations. This increased activity caused the permanent assignment of at least one warship to Hawaiian waters. It also praised Midway Island as possessing a harbor surpassing Honolulu's. In the following year, Congress approved an appropriation of $50,000 on March 1, 1869, to deepen the approaches to this harbor.

After 1868, when the Commander of the Pacific Fleet visited the islands to look after American interests, naval officers played an important role in internal affairs. They served as arbitrators in business disputes, negotiators of trade agreements and defenders of law and order. Periodic voyages among the islands and to the mainland aboard U.S. warships were arranged for members of the Hawaiian royal family and important island government officials. When King Lunalilo died in 1873, negotiations were underway for the cession of Pearl Harbor as a port for the duty-free export of sugar to the U.S.[citation needed] With the election of King Kalākaua in March 1874, riots prompted landing of sailors from USS Tuscarora and Portsmouth. The British warship, HMS Tenedos, also landed a token force. During the reign of King Kalākaua the United States was granted exclusive rights to enter Pearl Harbor and to establish "a coaling and repair station."
Although this treaty continued in force until August 1898, the U.S. did not fortify Pearl Harbor as a naval base. As it had for 60 years, the shallow entrance constituted a formidable barrier against the use of the deep protected waters of the inner harbor.
The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom signed the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 as supplemented by Convention on December 6, 1884, the Reciprocity Treaty was made by James Carter and ratified it in 1887. On January 20, 1887, the United States Senate allowed the Navy to exclusive right to maintain a coaling and repair station at Pearl Harbor. (The US took possession on November 9 that year). The Spanish–American War of 1898 and the desire for the United States to have a permanent presence in the Pacific both contributed to the decision.
Naval presence (1899–present)
Following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, the United States Navy established a base on the island in 1899. On December 7, 1941, the base was attacked by the Imperial Japanese Navy airplanes and midget submarines, causing the American entry into World War II. One of the main reasons that Pearl Harbor happened was because the United States had major communication breakdowns among several branches of the U.S. armed services and departments of the U.S. government. This led to the surprise Japanese attack at the Hawaiian air base.[7] There was no meaningful plan for the air defense of Hawaii, for American commanders had no understanding of the capabilities and proper employment of air power. As it was, had the Pacific Fleet acted on the war warnings it undoubtedly would have sortied and been at sea on December 7, where the major ships would have been sunk in deep water, making salvage impossible.[8] Shortly after the devastating Japanese surprise attack at Pearl Harbor two American military commanders, Lt. Gen. Walter Short and Adm. Husband Kimmel were demoted of their full ranks. The two American commanders later sought to restore their reputations and full ranks.[9]
Post-World War II
Over the years, Pearl Harbor remained a main base for the US Pacific Fleet after World War II along with Naval Base San Diego. In 2010, the Navy and the Air Force merged their two nearby bases; Pearl Harbor joined with Hickam Air Force Base to create Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.
In December 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a joint visit to Pearl Harbor with US President Barack Obama. This trip marked the 75 year anniversary of the attack, and was the first official visit by a sitting Japanese leader.[10]

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, did miserably with the Americans living abroad who voted in the primary.
Sanders did particularly well in Asia, too, winning Japan and South Korea with 87 percent and 74 percent, respectively.
Sanders' three biggest wins came from countries with large expat communities — the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Spain — where they won more than 60 percent of the vote.
Just shy of 35,000 registered Democrats living outside of America voted in the primary, showing up to cast a ballot at makeshift polling stations in bars and cafes, through the post, and via email from March 1 to 8.

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, did miserably with the Americans living abroad who voted in the primary.
Of the 55 countries counted in the Democrats Abroad primary, Clinton won just three — the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, and Singapore. Between them, less than 700 votes were cast.
Even in Israel — where some 400 Americans voted — Sanders bested Clinton 60 percent to 39 percent.
Nevertheless, the former Secretary of State will still walk away from the primary with four pledged delegates.

At seventeen delegates overall, Democrats Abroad is one of the smaller primaries — a delegate smaller than Wyoming, but larger than Guam.
The Democrats Abroad primary, which is treated like any other state's primary in the grand scheme of the leadership election, also allocates four superdelegates — three have signaled their support for Clinton, one has endorsed Sanders, although their votes are not constrained on the convention floor, like other primary delegates.
Sanders' big win can probably be explained by the demographics of the far-flung Democrat voters.
Alex Montgomery, director of communications for Democrats Abroad, says that the "excitement" over the primary has drawn out primarily younger voters.
"Half of the new sign-ups were under 30," Montgomery said.
Sanders tends to do better among younger votes.
Despite having dropped out in February, following the Iowa caucuses, Martin O'Malley still received 21 votes, coming ahead of also-ran candidate Rocky De La Fuente, who got six votes.

In the circles I run in, it's known simply as “Amy's meltdown”: the moment in “Convention,” from the middle of Veep's fourth season, at which campaign manager Amy Brookheimer (the uproarious Anna Chlumsky) departs President Selina Meyer's (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) staff by torching every bridge in the room. I've seen the clip on YouTube more times than I can count, can quote the tirade near-verbatim (“I wouldn't let you run a bath without having the Coast Guard and the fire department standing by”), but watching it again now, after a season in which Veep seemed to slip, or at least plateau, in comparison to its comic brethren, I'm struck by how flawlessly “Convention” tees up its climax.
Though Amy's meltdown is largely directed at Selina, its inciting incident is a series of frustrations involving Selina's friend, Karen Collins (Lennon Parham), a woman for whom no idea is too small to parrot, no opinion too important to punt — “It's been weeks, and they have yet to speak a declarative sentence,” Amy growls in the episode's opening minutes, setting the line from the start. As “Convention” proceeds, Meyer's selection of a new running mate becomes fodder for Amy's exasperation, each insult and eye roll pushing her, and us, toward the ultimate outburst. Chlumsky's delivery of “Have you been sent from the future to destroy me?!”—she bends at the midsection and raises their clenched fists, as if appealing not to Karen but to God—still makes me laugh more than two years later, but even after they storm out of the room, Veep isn't quite finished with the gag. In the scene's closing moments, Selina's eyes dart back and forth between Karen and the door, and with their perfect, tacit punch line, they come to see that Amy was right: “I'm going to want to talk to Tom James.”
Now, compare Amy's meltdown to analogous interludes in the series' ongoing sixth season: Congressman Jonah Ryan's (Timothy Simons) sudden eruption on CBS This Morning; ex-president Selina Meyer and spokesperson Mike McClintock's (Matt Walsh) destruction of their late father's study; “bag man” Gary Walsh's (Tony Hale) crack-up at their 40th birthday party. The latter surf on the same wave of rage, certainly, and there are grace notes—Jonah ensnared by their microphone, for instance—reminiscent of the earlier episode's precise construction, but each appears more indiscriminate, in the thrall of theatrics for their own sake. Season Six, on the down slope of Veep's reign as TV's most merciless comedy, in fact reminds me of Season One, as the series found its footing: The satire is wicked, and yet it appears almost aimless, a form of shooting blanks.
It's tempting to chalk this up to the shifting sands of American politics, our parodic president and their frightening policies cutting both comedians and dramatists off at the pass, but the self-pitying streak that distinguishes Veep's more recent meltdowns is, or should be, an effective lance on the boil of the White House's cries of “witch hunt!” Indeed, at its Season Four height—the six-episode arc from “Convention” to “Election Night”—the series confronted the emptiness of a system that rewards the inept, the venal, the vulgar and the mean with power, the maintenance of which becomes the sole “principle” on offer. Veep, in its middle seasons, was pure politics, unmoored from ideological conviction and partisan affiliation, then strung together by the characters' penchant for failing upward: the ideal indictment of life “inside the Beltway,” self-perpetuating as it sinks further and further in the public's esteem.
In Season Six, set one year after Selina's hopes for a full term are dashed by an Electoral College tie and ensuing vote in the House of Representatives, Veep remains reliable—in addition to the occasional set piece that highlights Selina's utter shamelessness, such as the National Volunteer Week sequence that opens “Chicklet,” its tongue-lashing humor is for the most part intact. (My favorite line of the season so far comes as Hugh Laurie's Tom James, Selina's backstabbing former running mate and longtime crush, introduces their much younger wife: “Ali-th-ia?” Selina says, mimicking their pronunciation. “Is that their name, or is that the pill you take to fuck her?”) But fatigue, I'd suggest, has begun to creep in, at least at the margins; Jonah's ignorance of “Daylight Savings Time,” and Kent's (Gary Cole) repeated corrections (“Saving”), are rather low-hanging fruit for a writers' room this sharp, and the rococo self-owns that Congressman Roger Furlong (Dan Bakkedahl) forces on their aide, Will (Nelson Franklin), are staler than week-old bread.
The problem, perhaps, is that Veep has ceased to evolve: If Selina's path to power once paralleled the series' own rising confidence, each honing their respective knives as the action shifted from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to the West Wing, the current season seems stuck in the past. The referents—Kennedy's coffin, apartheid, AIDS, Nancy Reagan's cock-sucking manual, “going down like Eleanor Roosevelt at Dinah Shore weekend”—are strangely old-fashioned for a series that's so long managed to capture the zeitgeist without exactly aping it, and while this may mirror Selina's plight—nostalgia for power, and the search for new purpose—it underscores the season's relatively slack structure, an uneasy fit for the dialogue's omnipresent rat-a-tat.
Casting about for a post-White House role (election observer, Supreme Court justice, memoirist, grandmother), Selina's struggle contains the promise of a fresh direction for Veep—and yet the season replays the series' glory days again and again, rather than moving forward. It's not merely the meltdowns, after all: It's the return, in “Blurb,” to Selina and Tom's sexual tension, or the relationship between Selina and Gary, tested and repaired in “Judge” much as it was in Season Four's extraordinary “East Wing.” To say that Veep is past its prime is not to suggest that it's now a failure, nor to imply that it can't, in the remaining episodes of its sixth season and its forthcoming seventh, reinvent itself once more. It's simply to acknowledge the series' main issue, at the moment, is not so dissimilar from its central narrative: Like Selina herself, once Veep went presidential, it turns out it couldn't go back.
Traditional sitcoms thrive, of course, on the familiar, even the static, but Veep at its best was no traditional sitcom. It was, rather, a poison-tipped shiv aimed at the heart of a broken system, always changing its tune without losing its voice. At a moment in which the series' trademark closing credits can be added, in toto, to one or another flailing administration official's on-camera appearances, it's not politics Veep can no longer keep pace with, it's the high bar it set for itself. In fact, it's in one of those sequences, replete with patriotic music and the usual black bumper, that the sixth season, perhaps unwittingly, acknowledges the danger of allowing the consistent to become the complacent. Selina's daughter, Catherine (the underappreciated Sarah Sutherland), is describing a frustration not far from Amy's, that of being unseen and unheard, when their therapist interrupts her: “Do you realize these are the same complaints you've had for 15 years?” Them response is no outburst, no meltdown, but they nonetheless sounds a note of self-defense with which Veep has to grapple in future: “Yeah, but they're not exactly the same,” they admit, uncertainly. “I think that things have changed.”
Fingers crossed.

Look and feel
Visually, iOS 9 doesn't look much different than iOS 8, and an untrained eye will have difficulty telling them apart at first. Apple has largely been tweaking and refining the look of iOS since version 7's major revamp two years ago, and iOS 9 does include some small changes. The most notable one is the system-wide use of Apple's own San Francisco font, which replaces the Helvetica Neue it used before. San Francisco first debuted on the Apple Watch this year, and it's a clean, readable font that works well at a variety of sizes. Most people probably won't be able to spot the difference between Helvetica Neue and San Francisco, but it is pleasant to look at.
Other minor (or major, depending on who you ask) updates include proper casing in the virtual keyboard to denote lowercase or capital letters, a toolbar for Bluetooth keyboards that adds word prediction and quick cut / copy / paste tools, and a cascading cards system for recent apps. The new cascading cards system replaces the app thumbnails that scrolled left-to-right with a stacked layout that's oriented right-to-left. It works nicely on the iPad, which has a lot of screen space to work with, but on the smaller display of the iPhone, we prefer iOS 8's more static system that also offers quick access to recently used contacts. Apple could add back the quick-access contacts in later revisions of iOS 9, but for now, they aren't there. Mostly, the new system adds visual flair without much added functionality.
Visually, the differences in iOS 9 are largely minor
The last big change is to the search screen, which you can access with a swipe left from your first home screen or swiping down from any screen. When you swipe left into it, Apple gives you a bunch of app suggestions, local points of interest, and favorite contacts. It's also the starting point for Apple's new intelligence features, which we'll get into more below.
UPDATED:
Days before President Trump flies into town for Thanksgiving, one of the world's most expensive yachts, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, sailed into the Port of Palm Beach Friday afternoon.
But don't get all collusion-delusional. Abramovich's spokesperson said the billionaire isn't aboard — the ship's just in town for scheduled maintenance.
The 533-foot Eclipse, valued at $400 million to $500 million, comes equipped with a pool, helipad, submarine and room for a crew of 92, according to marine websites. It made its way past The Bahamas and docked at 1:15 p.m, taking the slip normally reserved for the Grand Celebration, a cruise ship on hurricane-relief duty in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.
var _informq = _informq || []; _informq.push(['embed']);
Originally booked to stay through Dec. 5, the Eclipse might have to leave Dec. 1, as it is being followed by the 644-foot World, billed as “the largest private residential ship on the planet,” which is scheduled to arrive that day.
READ: Port of Palm Beach helps fill demand of mega yachts
Where will the Eclipse go?
The MarineTraffic app had it headed south on the Intracoastal Waterway, toward downtown West Palm Beach. Or at least it did — that flight plan vanished from the app on Saturday. Maybe they found out, as we were told, a ship that big would run aground in the Waterway.
Note to Transportation Security Administration: In any event, that route would have put a Russian submarine within a mile or so of the winter White House.
Forbes lists Abramovich's net worth at $9.5 billion, the world's 139th-richest person, with major holdings in steel, nickel and oil companies, as well as Britain's Chelsea soccer team.
WEST PALM READERS: Sign up for The Post's weekly West Palm Beach newsletter
Bloomberg Politics has reported that presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner has met Abramovich one-on-one and with their wives on a number of occasions.We're told they haven't been in touch since a charity dinner in 2014, though.
No word on whether Abramovich, 51, said to be a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has met President Trump.
A White House spokesperson said the President has no meetings scheduled for their upcoming visit to Palm Beach.
Trump campaign participants have been under investigation by a special prosecutor about whether they colluded with Russians believed to have interfered in the presidential election on Trump's behalf.
According to Michael Rafferty, a broker with the Palm Beach office of International Yacht Co., the Eclipse is the second biggest private yacht in the world.
Submarines are becoming popular on yachts of that caliber, they said. “Helicopters are pretty much standard on the bigger boats. Submarines are becoming a popular toy.”
At the recent Fort Lauderdale boat show, they said, one yacht was set up with snow skiing equipment, to allow for helicoptering to a glacier for skiing.
This month, Berth One International, a new venture at the Port of Palm Beach, was launched to help fill the demand of super yachts — defined as privately owned vessels longer than 100 feet.
The berth at the port's northern end can hold up to two 180-foot yachts, or one larger yacht of up to 400 feet. With a depth of 27 feet, the berth's waters can accommodate the huge vessels with their deep drafts of 15 to 20 feet.
“It's a very good thing for the economy in Palm Beach” to have vessels of that size arriving, Rafferty said. “It's very valuable for our business.”
So i went to the mail the other day to receive my long awaited gift from my Secret Santa. After being fkd over by a hit n runner last year i didn't have many expectations.
Little did i know that this gift would change my life.
I open the carefully wrapped amazon package and i see this beauty. Scary yet beautiful and proud. I made sure i had it out there on my windshield for everyone to see while i was doing chores.
I go back home, park my car, lay the T on the chair and leave for New year's celebration. I return home after a few hours, semi drunk to grab a few things before i go for the countdown. The first think i see is Nicolas staring at me with this face. I laugh it off and then i notice the smell. The kitchen stove was turned on. "Wth". I haven't used this thing for a few days. A tupperware was melted on the kitchen while Cage was staring. I'm mad but also thankful that it didn't start a fire. I try to clean up and i rush out of the house to make it for new year's.
I find where i parked, press the button but nothing happens. "Wth" once again. It turns out i've left the alarm on (hint: i didn't). The car won't move. All the electric stuff are dead. It's like 20minutes to new year's. I take the gifts from the trunk and start walking to my friend's house. I hold so many bags, one of them falls without me noticing. Luckily a stranger was walking behind me and told me i've dropped my shit.
I make it 5 minutes before new year's. From then on everything went quite ok.
I'm not sure if this was Cage being an angel or a demon. The one that caused the problems or the one that helped me get over them. I'll never know.
I'll know for sure that they were around me the whole time. I still feel them around the house and my memories are forever scared with their ambiguous face.
Happy new year everyone!

Article #0510
Main page || Index || Prior Article [0509] || Next Article [0511] || 261 Comments || Send feedback I've been quiet for a long while, and this blog is not easy for me to write. I'm sitting here with a glass of 2010 Merlot from right out of the barrel... hoping to be inspired on how to write this. But it's difficult, and the 2010 and 2011 vintages aren't very inspiring either. They were troubled by cooler than usual summer temperatures. They lack body and character. I find myself thinking back to when I began growing grapes and making wine, which seems like a long time ago, and it strikes me that I've been working on REBOL even longer. For more than a decade REBOL has been a labor of love. As a blend of theory, experimentation, and invention, the language embodies elegant and wonderful concepts and properties. It was and is the most productive language I've ever used. I hope your experience has been similar. I still care a lot about REBOL and its future. As you know, REBOL began as a commercial venture. But, times have changed, technology has changed, and economies have changed. The old model of how proprietary software products make money has been turned inside-out. And, it's even more difficult to make money in the computing language market. There are so many competitors, most of which are free, most of which are open, and many of which are quite well supported. So, it's come time to consider the next stage in the future of the REBOL language. I'll tell you that I've not reached any final conclusions. I want to solicit your suggestions and ideas first. I also need to tell you that I don't have much time to help out with whatever the REBOL future may be. I can help a little from time to time, but generally I'm very busy these days. Since the end of 2010 I've been working with an amazing company and a world class team building some really great products. I must admit that I'm quite addicted to it. I hope to say more in a future blog. Anyway, I invite you to post your comments below, but here are some pointers to keep in mind: My time is very limited, so please make your postings relevant and on point. If your post gets to be long and drawn out, I'm probably not going to read beyond the first few lines. Keep in mind that REBOL is more than just a technology, it's also a community, and all of us have different interests or requirements. If you're a doctor using REBOL in the medical profession, your needs will be quite different from a university research scientist. That's fine. This is a brainstorming session. Let's keep this discussion within the REBOL community for now. I don't care much about what people who don't know REBOL say or want. They don't understand REBOL, and many never will. This is our thing, we should guide it where we want it to go. I cannot afford the time, energy, or heartbreak of looking backwards. Yes, REBOL has invented some very cool software technology. Much of it was years ahead of alternatives. But, what's done is done. That's the past; we cannot change it. I want to focus on the future. Please don't post negative or degrading comments. They will be removed. If you know REBOLers who might be interested in this discussion, please let them know about this blog posting. I look forward to hearing from you, -Carl 261 Comments
I'm going to show you how a micro optimization can speed up your python code by a whopping 5%. 5%! It can also annoy anyone that has to maintain your code.
But really, this is about explaining code might you see occasionally see in the standard library or in other people's code. Let's take an example from the standard library, specifically the collections.OrderedDict class:
def __setitem__ ( self , key , value , dict_setitem = dict . __setitem__ ): if key not in self : root = self . __root last = root [ 0 ] last [ 1 ] = root [ 0 ] = self . __map [ key ] = [ last , root , key ] return dict_setitem ( self , key , value )
Notice the last arg: dict_setitem=dict.__setitem__ . It makes sense if you think about it. To associate a key with a value, you'll need to provide a __setitem__ method which takes three arguments: the key you're setting, the value associated with the key, and the __setitem__ class method to the built-in dict class. Wait. Ok maybe the last argument makes no sense.
Scope Lookups To understand what's going on here, we need to take a look at scopes. Let's start with a simple question, if I'm in a python function, and I encounter something named open , how does python go about figuring out the value of open ? # <GLOBAL: a bunch of code here> def myfunc (): # <LOCAL: a bunch of code here> with open ( 'foo.txt' , 'w' ) as f : pass The short answer is that without knowing the contents of the GLOBAL and the LOCAL section, you can't know for certain the value of open . Conceptually, python checks three namespaces for a name (ignoring nested scopes to keep things simple): locals
globals
builtin So in the myfunc function, if we're trying to find a value for open , we'll first check the local namespace, then the globals namespace, then the builtins namespace. And if open is not defined in any namespace, a NameError is raised.
Scope Lookups, the Implementation The lookup process above is just conceptual. The implementation of this lookup process gives us room to exploit the implementation. def foo (): a = 1 return a def bar (): return a def baz ( a = 1 ): return a Let's look at the bytecode of each function: >>> import dis >>> dis.dis(foo) 2 0 LOAD_CONST 1 (1) 3 STORE_FAST 0 (a) 3 6 LOAD_FAST 0 (a) 9 RETURN_VALUE >>> dis.dis(bar) 2 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (a) 3 RETURN_VALUE >>> dis.dis(baz) 2 0 LOAD_FAST 0 (a) 3 RETURN_VALUE Look at the differences between foo and bar. Right away we can see that at the bytecode level python has already determined what's a local variable and what is not because foo is using LOAD_FAST and bar is using LOAD_GLOBAL . We won't get into the details of how python's compiler knows when to emit which bytecode (perhaps that's another post), but suffice to say python knows which type of lookup it needs to perform when it executes a function. One other thing that can be confusing is that LOAD_GLOBAL is used for lookups in the global as well as the builtin namespace. You can think of this as "not local", again ignoring the issue of nested scopes. The C code for this is roughly : case LOAD_GLOBAL : v = PyObject_GetItem ( f -> f_globals , name ); if ( v == NULL ) { v = PyObject_GetItem ( f -> f_builtins , name ); if ( v == NULL ) { if ( PyErr_ExceptionMatches ( PyExc_KeyError )) format_exc_check_arg ( PyExc_NameError , NAME_ERROR_MSG , name ); goto error ; } } PUSH ( v ); Even if you've never seen any of the C code for CPython, the above code is pretty straightforward. First, check if the key name we're looking for is in f->f_globals (the globals dict), then check if the name is in f->f_builtins (the builtins dict), and finally, raise a NameError if both checks failed.
Binding Constants to the Local Scope Now when we look at the initial code sample, we can see that the last argument is binding a function into the local scope of a function. It does this by assigning a value, dict.__setitem__ , as the default value of an argument. Here's another example: def not_list_or_dict ( value ): return not ( isinstance ( value , dict ) or isinstance ( value , list )) def not_list_or_dict ( value , _isinstance = isinstance , _dict = dict , _list = list ): return not ( _isinstance ( value , _dict ) or _isinstance ( value , _list )) We're doing the same thing here, binding what would normally be objects that are in the builtin namespace into the local namespace instead. So instead of requiring the use of LOAD_GLOBAL (a global lookup), python instead will use LOCAL_FAST . So how much faster is this? Let's do some crude testing: $ python -m timeit -s 'def not_list_or_dict(value): return not (isinstance(value, dict) or isinstance(value, list))' 'not_list_or_dict(50)' 1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.48 usec per loop $ python -m timeit -s 'def not_list_or_dict(value, _isinstance=isinstance, _dict=dict, _list=list): return not (_isinstance(value, _dict) or _isinstance(value, _list))' 'not_list_or_dict(50)' 1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.423 usec per loop Or in other words, that's an 11.9% improvement . That's way more than the 5% I promised at the beginning of this post!
There's More to the Story It's reasonable to think that the speed improvment is because LOAD_FAST reads from the local namespace whereas LOAD_GLOBAL will first check the global namespace before falling back to checking the builtin namespace. And in the example function above, isinstance , dict , and list all come from the built-in namespace. However, there's more going on. Not only are we able to skip additional lookup with LOAD_FAST , it's also a different type of lookup. The C code snippet above showed the code for LOAD_GLOBAL , but here's the code for LOAD_FAST : case LOAD_FAST : PyObject * value = fastlocal [ oparg ]; if ( value == NULL ) { format_exc_check_arg ( PyExc_UnboundLocalError , UNBOUNDLOCAL_ERROR_MSG , PyTuple_GetItem ( co -> co_varnames , oparg )); goto error ; } Py_INCREF ( value ); PUSH ( value ); FAST_DISPATCH (); We're retrieving the local value by indexing into an array. It's not shown here, but oparg is just an index into that array. Now it's starting to make sense. In our first version not_list_or_dict had to perform 4 lookups, and each name was in the builtins namespace which we only look at after looking in the globals namespace. That's 8 dictionary key lookups. Compare that to directly indexing into a C array 4 times, which is what happens in the second version of not_list_or_dict , which all use LOAD_FAST under the hood. This is why lookups in the local namespace are faster.
I don't shop at Waitrose much. That's not because I resent paying six pounds for a loaf of bread, or because I get antsy whenever I see anyone simultaneously wearing Uggs and buying halloumi – although I do; I'm only human – but because of the little green charity tokens they give you at the checkout.
You're supposed to put these tokens in one of three boxes, each representing an individual cause. Conservatively, I must have spent a third of my life slumped in front of these boxes, agonising over which cause to pick. Should I give it to the dilapidated care home or the local postnatal unit? There's one here collecting money for beehives. Who do I like more, babies or old people? I certainly won't give my token to the beekeepers. But what about the documentary I saw that said we'll all die if the bees go extinct? Perhaps my token would do more good there. Yeah. That's what I'll do. Screw you, premature babies. God, did I really just think, "Screw you, premature babies"? I'm an awful person.
On and on and on it goes. Eventually, withered and hungry, I'll give up. I'll press the token into a stranger's hand. "You look like a kindly fellow," I'll croak. "I trust you to make the right decision." Basically, this is why I do all my shopping at the 24-hour garage around the corner now. I can survive on pasties and biscuits. I can.
It's also, broadly speaking, my attitude towards voting. Call me naive, but it seems sensible to assume that an MP would be better at making important decisions than me. They have access to experts. They have a longer-term view than I do. It's their job. My job is making the same joke about Louis Walsh 15 times a year. Put me in a position of power and I'd wreck everything by teatime. I'd rather pick someone to make decisions on my behalf than make them all myself.
I don't think I'm alone in thinking this, which is why Nigel Farage's newfound love affair with referendums is doomed to failure. This week, Farage declared that a Ukip government would hold regular public referendums for everything from foreign affairs to housing schemes. Direct democracy, they call it. A massive pain, I call it.
Farage has envisioned a bold new future. A future where the British public gets a say in every single policy that the government proposes. Should the sale of cigarettes be banned for anyone born after the year 2000? You decide! Should the military stage another intervention in Iraq? You decide (terms and conditions apply, please do not vote after lines close as your vote won't be counted but you may still be charged)!
Again and again, whenever there's something to be decided, we'll all march down to the local primary school, put a cross in a box and march home again, safe in the knowledge that we've fulfilled our civic duties. It's a genius idea if you're a politician – by delegating policy to the public, you're effectively freeing up more time to embark on embarrassing campaign photocalls in pubs you'd otherwise never be seen dead in – but it's flawed. Because, really, I don't want that much of a say. Nobody does.
That's what elections are for. An election is a genius act of delegation. I don't want to spend the next five years embarking on an in-depth series of work and pension spending reviews. That's why I went to the trouble of picking a representative to do it for me. And, even then, figuring out which one I should trust turned out to be the most insane faff.
And I'm one of the few who actually bothered to vote. Only 65% of us voted in the general election in 2010. Just over half that number could be arsed to have a say in the European elections. If people can't be convinced to vote in huge elections like these, then they won't even get out of bed for a referendum on tax credits for stay-at-home parents. Sure, we might be excited at first but, as time goes on, the turnout will dwindle until all our decisions end up being made by the sort of crackpot who maintains that their voice deserves to be heard above all others. The fringes. The political extremes. People who leave comments on websites. Newspaper columnists. That's the fastest way possible to send any country into the toilet, surely.
Farage has used Switzerland as an example of the power of public referendums. Last year, the Swiss went through 11 referendums, for executive pay and spacial planning and asylum law amendments and salary capping and epidemia law and lord knows what else. It was constant, and it makes being Swiss sound rubbish. Remember how pious Twitter got during the last election, with everyone blithering on forever about how important it is to vote? That's basically Switzerland all the time. Who'd want to live under conditions like that?
Done sparingly, as the Scottish independence vote is proving, a referendum can be a big, exciting punctuation mark in history. But it's like Christmas – it's fun now and again, but you'd kill yourself if it happened every day. Especially when you have to buy Christmas dinner at a 24-hour garage.
In case there was any lingering hope of immigration reform passing in the next year, newly elected Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stamped it out for good Sunday morning.
Ryan told several Sunday shows that they would not work with President Barack Obama on the matter, since the president's unilateral actions to give legal protections to some of the undocumented had poisoned the proverbial well.
“I think he's proven untrustworthy on this issue. They tried to go around Congress with an executive order to rewrite laws unilaterally. Presidents don't write laws. Congress writes laws,” Ryan told ABC's “This Week.” “So yes, I do not believe we should and we won't bring immigration legislation with a president we cannot trust on this issue. If we believe and have consensus on things like border enforcement, and interior security, then that's fine.”
Ryan echoed those sentiments on CBS' “Face The Nation.”
“Look, I think it would be a ridiculous notion to try and work on an issue like this with a president we simply cannot trust on this issue,” Ryan said. “He tried to go it alone, circumventing the legislative process with their executive orders, so that is not in the cards.”
In pursuing the votes to win the speakership, Ryan reportedly promised skeptical conservative lawmakers that they would not bring immigration reform to the House floor with Obama still in office. And in their interview with ABC, they did not deny this.
My cousin/ flower girl, Maddie celebrated their third birthday yesterday with a 'Frozen' themed birthday party. I was asked to dressed up as Elsa--and I agreed. I definitely thought there was no way I was going to be able to pull it off...but, it turned out better than I expected!
Elsa's signature blue dress did wonders when it came time to convince the little girls that I was the Disney princess. If you're thinking you want to dress up like Elsa for Halloween, the costume is online for $20. I had a blast, they believed I was the princess and I got to eat cake. That's a win win.
I should mention that I did get stung by a bee yesterday...a minor mishap. Check out pictures from the party below!
The Venezuela National Electoral Council is making final preparations for Sunday's municipal elections, which are expected to tighten leftist President Nicolas Maduro's grip on the beleaguered South American nation.
State owned Corporación Venezolana de Televisión (Venezuelan Television Corporation— VTV) is reporting the National Electoral Council had installed about 99 percent of the voting stations.
Venezuelan official Tania D'Amelio, who is overseeing the process of installing voting machines, urged voters to trust the election process.
National Electoral Council chief Sandra Oblitas said voting materials had been distributed so Venezuelans could exercise their constitutional right at the polls Sunday.
"These electoral processes have been carried out amid threats and attacks by those who do not believe in voting as a tool to resolve political differences," Oblitas said in denouncing the boycott.
According to reports, officials from the Council of Electoral Experts of Latin America have arrived in Venezuela to audit the elections.
The opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) coalition refused to put up candidates for the 335 open mayoral seats, saying it had no confidence in a fair vote. Coalition candidates had been expected to win more than half of Venezuela's 23 governorships in a mid-October ballot, but they claimed only five after irregularities – including last-minute shifts in polling places and a shortage of voting machines in anti-Maduro neighborhoods.
Message to supporters
Maduro urged their supporters to go to the polls, saying another victory was necessary "to consolidate peace and recover prosperity." Venezuela was wracked earlier this year by violent political protests and suffers from ongoing, crippling shortages of food and medicine in the oil-rich country.
On Sunday, voters also must choose a new governor for western Zulia state. Opposition candidate Juan Pablo Guanipa's win in the October 15 election was annulled after they refused to pledge loyalty to the Constituent Assembly. The four other opposition winners promised their fealty to the pro-Maduro superlegislature, further fracturing the coalition.
With the mayoral elections, the ruling Socialist Party – which holds more than three-fourths of the seats – is likely to build its advantage. Of the remaining 76 mayors affiliated with the opposition, 13 have been arrested or are in exile.
That would give a broadened base of support to Maduro – elected in 2013 following the death of mentor Hugo Chavez – as they consider whether to seek another six-year term. Earlier this week, Venezuela officials threatened to halt presidential elections in 2018 unless the United States lifts financial sanctions it has imposed on Maduro and more than two dozen other government officials.
​The European Union, Canada and Spain also have levied sanctions to pressure the Maduro administration to restore democratic functions.
Independent candidates
Though the coalition is boycotting the vote, some opposition candidates are running independently.
One is Robert García, who wants to become mayor of Chacao, a Caracas subdivision formerly led by political prisoner Leopoldo López and, more recently, the deposed and now exiled Ramón Muchacho.
"We are not giving up," García said. "We are participating, we are not giving up on our fight for our rights."
Venezuelans were split on whether to heed the opposition coalition's call to skip voting.
Javier Bellot, an electrician in Caracas, told VOA they don't plan to vote Sunday. "No, I will not participate" in the election, they said. "It's a fraud."
But Diego Medina, another Caracas citizen, said he'll exercise their right. "It's the least we can do. If we want this to change, we must participate."
Enrique Mendoza, opposition candidate for mayor of Sucre – a municipality in northern Miranda state – said observers at polling stations would be essential to prevent fraud.
"We want people to be there until the end" of polling, Mendoza said. "No matter what happens, they have to stay until the end."
Polls will be open Sunday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.
RUSH: Now, folks, I don't want to be misunderstood. I'm not trying to sound paranoid here. I'm not paranoid. I'm realistic. One of the… I'll be honest with you, and I'm sure this is true for you, too. One of the most frustrating things about life in America today is how seemingly ignorant so many Americans seem to be about what's happening to them. I mean, they're living their lives, they're encountering obstacle after obstacle — be it student loan debt, be it no jobs, be it the rising cost of health care, be it cultural rot — and they, for some reason, don't have the ability or understanding understanding why.
And even when they're told, oftentimes they reject it. But most of what's happening in this country today that you would consider harder, an additional obstacle in your life? It's the result of policies that have been implemented over the years by people that believe in Big Government. There are some Republicans in this mix, too. But it's predominantly Democrats, it's predominantly liberalism, and it's predominantly done by people who want you and need you less productive, less self-reliant, less individualistic.
They want you dependent on them. It's their key to holding on to power. But it goes beyond that. They don't just want power for the sake of it. They want power to transform and change. These are people who have never appreciated the miracle that is the United States of America. They've always resented it for whatever social injustice reason that they manufacture or come up with. And the Republican Party… Ah, I'll throw myself in. I'm not guilty of this, but there just hasn't been apparently a good enough job of persuasion, 'cause nobody's happy in America.
Everybody knows something's not right. Everybody thinks… I mean, look, there are precious few who are happy. George Soros is happy. Wait. He's not an American. Bill Gates is happy. I'm sure that Zuckerberg's happy. I'm sure… We're talking super-wealthy members of the elite, the establishment. But for the most part there is a giant sense of unease, a giant sense that things are out of whack, that the nation's in decline. It's just that so many millions don't seem to be able to understand why.
And that is probably one of the most frustrating things, 'cause I've spent 28 years behind this microphone trying to inform people of that, and it's very difficult. If they're committed leftists, they're not gonna believe it anyway. They're gonna believe some distorted version. They're gonna believe the country's in decline because of racism, or the country's in decline because of bigotry or the country's in decline because we never deserved to be a country anyway because of what we did to Indians, or some stupid explanation they have for feeling negative about things and the country.
And there's no turning them. I mean, there's no persuading them. There's a lot of people out there in the middle who are not political. That's another thing I wish I could change. The Democrats have politicized everything. I may have to stop watching… You know, I got so depressed last night. One of my favorite TV shows, when I have time to watch it, is Blacklist. Well, I can't watch Designated Survivor. When I found out… It was Kiefer Sutherland's new show, and I was all excited about it, and I heard that the pilot was great.
Which I still haven't seen it. Then episode two, here came the leftists who write these shows, and I'm convinced now that they write these shows and write these songs and these movies just to get in our face, just to ram it down our throats. So Designated Survivor, in a recent episode, there's a rogue governor. Everybody in government's destroyed at the State of the Union speech, and Kiefer Sutherland's a cabinet member designated the night of the State of the Union speech to watch it from some secret location in case everybody's wiped out.
He's the designated survivor, and becomes the president. The first thing they do is, “Hey, let's not blame Islam! Let's not blame the Muslims.” In the third or fourth episode, there's a rogue governor rounding up Muslims. I'm sorry; I'm not even gonna watch it. So I'm watching The Blacklist last night, and the title of the episode's called Gaia, and I… Now, in fairness, The Blacklist redeemed themselves during the program. But at first, I thought, “Oh, my God. Don't tell me I'm gonna have to stop watching this.”
It opens with “Red” Reddington, James Spader — who is in a class all by themselves as an actor — talking about the dangers of climate change, how destructive it is, as though it's just matter of fact. I said, “Oh, no, please. Can they spare one show from this politicized crap?” Well, it turned out that the villain in the show is an environmental nutcase that wanted to blow up a nuclear power plant in New Jersey, and they were made to look like an absolute kook, and the good guys save the day as you would expect.
There wouldn't be a show, otherwise, if the bad guys ever won any of these things, but still it was just on the verge. My point is they politicize everything. Everything. They politicize virtually everything. Kindergarten's politicized. There isn't an issue, and nobody thinks that it is, not very many people. Most people think it's the Republicans that do all the politicizing. “Republicans do the politicizing! I hate politics. I hate Republicans. Republicans are always say no to things! No to this… Just get the Republicans out of the way and we'd get politics out.”
They just don't understand that it's the Democrats politicizing everything. So in not conforming with the Regime — and that's what our presidency today is. It is a Regime, and the media has become the defenders and protectors of the Regime, and you can see it in who they choose to go after. They go after anybody who disagrees, anybody prominent who might be successful in turning people away from the Regime. That's who the media targets.
So Trump is the current target. He's the GOP presidential nominee. These people on the left are not interested in debate; they're not interested in being coequals in the arena of ideas. They want to eliminate all opposition. They shouldn't have to suffer any opposition. Their arrogant and conceit is such that there is nothing else; there are no opposing views, and no matter how bad things are, “We're still the best. We're the only ones! Conservatism's a disease. It's a plague, and it has to be dealt with.”
It was even treated that way in a news story yesterday going all the way back to the 1960s, and it was at NPR. So if they dispatch Trump, I've heard enough of what Obama has said about me personally and about Republicans and conservative media to know… Well, I've already been targeted. I mean, they've already made repeated efforts, and they have failed. They continue to fail because they don't understand why this program succeeds. And they never will. I could tell them, and they wouldn't believe me. I can tell them why it works.
I could give them every key to destroying this program and they still wouldn't be able to do it because they wouldn't believe what I would say. Not because they don't believe me, just they wouldn't believe the details. So let's put this into play. Let's illustrate this for you. Obama, two weeks after being inaugurated in 2009, held a meeting with all the congressional leadership, both parties, House and Senate. I know this happened 'cause John Boehner came down here some few weeks after and told me about it. I knew about it anyway; it was reported. Boehner said, when they told me, that they couldn't understand why Obama's said it.
“I was incredulous.”
But Obama told these guys, “You've gotta stop listening to Rush Limbaugh.”
“I won. You have to stop listening to Rush Limbaugh. That's not how things get done in Washington.”
And of course you're aware of the other instances where I've been mentioned by name as enemy of the state. So Boehner came down here and said, “I don't know why they would say that.”
I said, “You don't, really? They were hoping that just one of you in the Republican leadership would go to the microphones outside the White House and agree with them in a show of bipartisan. They know they can't by themselves discredit me, but if you joined them in that sentiment, that's what they were trying to do.” I thanked them for not doing it, but they claimed they didn't know why Obama would say that, and I told him.
Obama's not through saying it. Let's go to Cleveland. It was all part of the attack. Obama's out there speaking for Hillary because Hillary can't show up. Hillary is in hiding. She's hibernating because that's the best they can do. The less she's seen, the better they do. So here's Obama.
OBAMA: I'm disturbed about Republican elected officials who know better but are still supporting this guy. What they've done is they've allowed a lot of crazy talk to just be pumped out again and again through all kinds of these media outlets. Conspiracy theories, a lot of the hard-core Republican partisan voters were just hearing this stuff over and over again and started to believe it. And that's what allowed Donald Trump suddenly to emerge. Donald Trump didn't build all this crazy conspiracy stuff. And some Republicans who knew better stood by silently, and even during the course of this campaign didn't say anything.
RUSH: Translation: Conservative media created Trump. Conservative media is where you find all this insanity, and Trump came along and simply stole it and capitalized on it. And if it hadn't been for conservative media, then America wouldn't be facing this plague that Obama believes is Donald Trump. Now, you and I know why Trump exists. I don't know if Obama really does or not. I'm not one of these people that thinks he's automatically brilliant, Mensa IQ stuff. I'm not sure I believe that. Politically, their leftist instincts are formidable, but I don't know if they really believes this or is just saying it or a combination of the two, but they kept on.
OBAMA: I know that some of them now are walking away, but why'd it take you this long? You said you're the party of family values. What, you weren't appalled earlier when they were saying degrading things about women, when they were judging them based on a score of are they a two or a 10? That wasn't enough for you? You're walking away from them now. It wasn't disturbing enough for you when they were saying Mexicans who come here are rapists or suggesting that people, patriotic Americans of the Islamic faith somehow are suspect and should be treated differently? That wasn't enough?
RUSH: This is their pattern, folks, for eight years since Obama told the Republicans not to listen to me, that that's not how things get done in Washington, they have mounted a continuing intimidation effort aimed at shaming Republicans into abandoning people on their own team. And I would have to say that over the course of eight years, in some respects, he's been successful. They got the Republican Party to join them on amnesty, enough of them, anyway. So he's continued these intimidation tactics.
By the way, the WikiLeaks dump — I'm mentioning this mainly so I don't forget it myself. The latest WikiLeaks dump has incredible data on how it was the Hillary campaign that was trying to pollute Obama as a Muslim. All these things that were said about Obama, the picture of them dressed in the native Kenyan garb, you know, with the turban or whatever all that other stuff, they detailed it and put it into Hillary's primary campaign in 2008. It's classic in the sense that these are the people, like Clinton is the original sexual predator, but he's now a hero and a rock star and the women who accused them can't get the time of day in the Drive-By Media.
But women we never heard of before who pop out of the woodwork who claim Trump octopused them on an airplane are now daily guests on the media with instant credibility. And here's the final Obama bite that I want to play and then we're gonna take a break and go to some phones. When we return to this it will be to NPR picking up where Obama leaves off here on conservative media spawning Trump and therefore needs to be dispatched the same way Trump is being. But here's the final thing I want to play for you.
OBAMA: I want everybody to understand what's at stake here. You know, one of the things I've learned these past eight years is that progress is hard.
RUSH: Yeah, because there hasn't been any.
OBAMA: You gotta battle it out even when you have victories, like the Affordable Care Act. It's not always perfect and you gotta work to make it better.
RUSH: It's a disaster.
OBAMA: You take two steps forward on something like climate change, there are gonna be folks who try to push you back, and the special interests are strong. And it is true that the country is so often divided along party lines and it's very hard to get folks to compromise. If we want progress, if we want progress, we gotta work for it.
RUSH: Right. Trump's gonna end it. Trump's gonna end all this progress. Obamacare is not progress. It's an absolute disaster, and it is an insult. And climate change, two steps forward and one step back, what? Look, I don't need to say any more about climate change than I've already said, but this is classic. They exist to promote frauds. They exist to invest in fraudulent beliefs and policies. I keep hoping that the American people are gonna experience a great backlash over all this.
When I stop and think how many Americans I know who readily know something is wrong, something's not right, this is not how America's supposed to be. There's supposed to be economic progress. You're not supposed to get older and things get harder. You're supposed to earn more money. You're supposed to be more successful as you get older. The economy is supposed to grow. Innovation is supposed to take place. None of that is happening. And the reason why is now completing their eighth year in the Oval Office. And somehow, 'cause of the Limbaugh Theorem or whatever, they escape all accountability.

Dar al Kabirah (Syria) (AFP) - At a mobile medical clinic in central Syria's Homs province, a Russian doctor takes an elderly woman's blood pressure. Nearby, their colleague examines a dazed teenager on a gurney.
"Take half a pill in the morning and the second half at night," the Russian doctor tells the woman through a translator.
The pop-up facility outside rebel-held Dar al-Kabira in central Syria is one of several medical units deployed by Moscow, which has remained a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad throughout the six-year conflict.
Russia began an air war in support of Assad in 2015, swinging the conflict in their favour, but it is now increasingly seeking to depict itself as a peacemaker and humanitarian donor in the war-devastated country.
The evidence is on clear display near Dar al-Kabira, where Russia is monitoring a "de-escalation zone" between regime and rebel forces agreed in August.
This week, civilians from both sides could be seen queueing in separate lines to get sacks of food bearing the slogan "Russia is with you!"
Russian army Colonel Alexander Sazonov, head of the Dar al-Kabira checkpoint, said the buffer zone had been set up two months ago and was already improving the situation for civilians.
"Before, there was no medical aid for five years, and people couldn't meet their loved ones," Sazonov said, during a tightly controlled press tour organised by the Russian military.
- 'Help from Russia' -
The zone in Homs province is part of a deal agreed in May by Russia, regime ally Iran, and rebel backer Turkey to create four "de-escalation" areas in Syria.
Syria's conflict has killed more than 330,000 people since it began in March 2011 with anti-government protests, and it has wrecked the country's economy.
Fighting, damage to infrastructure and the use of siege tactics have plunged parts of the population into poverty and created food and medical shortages.
Sazonov says about 10 tonnes of aid are distributed weekly at Dar al-Kabira, insisting that "we would like there to be more aid".
"But right now Russia is the only one doing any of this."
Russian trucks marked "Help to Syria from Russia" shuttled in aid packages containing sugar, grain and canned meat.
"From here it's about 500 metres (yards) to the fighters," Sazonov said.
"If you're not a fighter with blood on your hands, you can go in and out."
Residents crossing from the Syrian government side of the checkpoint -- adorned with portraits of Assad -- had their belongings and IDs checked before hurrying through.
Nawaf Ramadan, a local resident, had arrived from the government side to collect a sack of food.
"I always come here," they told AFP. "My house had some damage but I have repaired it. We don't have a lot of money to buy food."
- 'Only talk to the Russians' -
On the rebel side, Russian officers look for influential locals who can spread the word about humanitarian aid shipments, Russian military spokesperson Igor Konashenkov told AFP.
They touted a recent effort to target needs at the start of the school year, with Russia providing school supplies for residents living on both sides of the checkpoint, including desks, they said.
Aid convoys are protected by Russian military police.
"Our job is to guarantee security. There could be somebody armed, there could be instances of a crowd crush," said one officer, who gave their name only as Artyom.
"There is enough food but it's human nature (to push)."
Sazonov said hostilities have ceased since the zone was established and there have been "no violations", though the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, has reported sporadic infractions.
Every day, about 10,000 people cross back and forth through the checkpoint, they said.
Three other de-escalation zones in Syria have been agreed as part of an accord reached earlier this year in the Kazakh capital Astana.
One lies near the capital Damascus, another is in the country's south, and the final one in the northwest Idlib province was agreed on Friday in Astana.
Konashenkov said the real goal of the de-escalation zones was to get the sides to reconcile, a process in which they insisted Russian participation was key.
"It starts off with them saying 'We won't talk to each other, we'll only talk to the Russians'," they said.
"Russians are perceived normally everywhere."
Building on its successes in 2014, Acer is to launch a wave of new Chromebooks in the early part of 2015.
Among them the 11.6-inch Acer C740 Chromebook, a model primarily being targeted at education and powered by an Intel Broadwell-U Celeron processor.
Details on this (and several other incoming devices) was passed us by our “Chrome Bandit” source, and includes broad specifications for the C740, US pricing and a tentative street date.
Acer C740 Broadwell Chromebook
Like earlier models put out by the Taiwanese multinational, the Acer C740 Chromebooks will be made available in consumer and commercial guises, though the differences between both will, we're told, be more distinct.
The big sell here is that at least one of these devices will come bearing Intel's fifth-generation Broadwell-based processors, providing users with a huge boost in performance, battery life and graphics performance.
Precisely which processor? Well that we don't know. Since most of Intel's Broadwell chips are set to be unveiled in January at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the lack of specific make or model shared by Acer is understandable.
If I had to make an educated (ho ho, pun) guess with the pricing and power requirements firmly in view, something like the dual-core Intel Core i3-5010U running at 2.1GHz (and backed with Intel HD 5500 graphics) seems like a smart entry choice. Not too flashy, not too expensive, but hardly meek.
On a more tentative note I'm told that Acer is keen to keep education and consumer propositions distinct (something they've failed to do in the past, with consumer models being priced more attractively at the same specs). Because of this they may, at first, only offer a Broadwell-equipped SKU in its commercial offering. A consumer release would use the older, if still hugely performant, Haswell-based Core i3-4005U.
This, I should stress, is subject to change.
Rugged Design
With education being a big, big driving force behind Chromebook sales across the board, and Acer alone making up a large chunk, it's perhaps not surprising to learn that the C740 has been designed with classrooms in mind.
The unit keeps the same overall look and feel of the CB3 and CB5 Chromebooks, but is encased in a sleek ‘brushed iron metal' design — i.e., tough — and features reinforced hinges and display.
The Rest
The 11.6″ screen size sports a non-glare display running at a (now regular) 1366 x 768 resolution. Yes, disappointing. But as this device has clearly been made for education, LCD panels are cheaper, more robust and uses less power than full-HD IPS displays.
Also listed in the promotional materials we've seen:
16GB and 32GB SSD options
2GB and 4GB RAM options
802.11ac Wi-Fi w/Bluetooth 4.0 LE
USB 3.0, SD card reader and HDMI out
Battery life listed at 8.5 hours.
Acer gives a starting price of $259 for the 2GB RAM/16GB SSD model, and $289 for 4GB RAM and a 16GB SSD.
Release date is currently pencilled in for March 2015.

Share. Late actor used the book while prepping to make The Dark Knight. Late actor used the book while prepping to make The Dark Knight.
A new video has emerged which spotlights the late Heath Ledger's Joker "diary" that they used while prepping to make The Dark Knight.
We'd heard about such a diary before. Ledger told Empire the following back in 2007: "I sat around in a hotel room in London for about a month, locked myself away, formed a little diary and experimented with voices -- it was important to try to find a somewhat iconic voice and laugh. I ended up landing more in the realm of a psychopath -- someone with very little to no conscience towards their acts. He's just an absolute sociopath, a cold-blooded, mass-murdering clown, and Chris [Nolan] has given me free rein. Which is fun, because there are no real boundaries to what The Joker would say or do. Nothing intimidates him, and everything is a big joke."
In the video, which comes from a documentary series called Too Young to Die, Ledger's father Kim shows part of the diary off. Their words are a bit tough to make out, so scroll down for a rough transcription of the clip via Batman News.
"This was the diary. In order to inhabit their character, they locked themselves up in a hotel room for weeks. They would do that. They liked to dive into their characters, but this time they really took it to a whole new level.
"The hospital scene is interesting because when they were a kid, their sister Kate liked to dress them up as a nurse. They were really funny like that. They also are in the movie. This is a make-up test which was done eight months before. Before the end of the shooting they wrote ‘bye bye' on the back of the page. It was hard to see this."
Talk to Senior Editor Scott Collura on Twitter at @ScottIGN, on IGN at scottcollura and on Facebook.
Then, one day, something happened that finally made me realize that I. WAS. DONE.
I watched someone overdose on the sidewalk one early afternoon, tons of people walking by without offering help, seeing if they were okay, NOTHING. I didn't have a cell phone, and I had given my Narcan kit to another friend the night before since they use needles (I have never shot up, I am terrified of needles).
I screamed and shouted for someone to call 9/11. I ran down the street asking every single junkie and person if they had a kit on them. Tears streaming down my face the whole time.
I ran back to this man, someone had called 9/11 and was standing watch over him, but I watched them closely — they were foaming at the mouth, they were suffocating, turning purple all over, and there was NOTHING that I could do.
I have never felt so fucking useless or guilty in my entire life. If I had kept my Narcan kit, I could have had a chance of saving their lives.
By the time the EMT's showed up, it was already too late. I had watched this man die, along with my heart shattering, my mind going in spirals, and tears pouring down my face.
I felt it in this moment — that I was finished.
I knew if I didn't get the FUCK out of Vancouver, and fast, that it was only a matter of time, maybe even just days, before that would be my body, lying stiff on the ground in some random alley, turning blue and pale, the life just slipping from my soul.
Nickie talked me into going back to Buffalo, going to rehab (I had insurance in the US, but not in Canada), and ultimately being by my support system — my family. I talked to my family, and they thought it was a smart decision.
I agreed to, reluctantly. I bought my plane ticket for a few days later. I knew my only chance was to escape that place, and get somewhere safe. The addict within still wanted me to stay and feed the habit, tricking me into thinking I could somehow make it work.
I still had 2 days left in Vancouver, and I was living in a homeless shelter right down the street from Hastings St. aka Skid Row.
The Botswana High Court has announced that it will soon take up a case that challenges as unconstitutional a section of the country's penal code that criminalizes homosexuality. The court date for this high-profiled case is set for April 15.
The case was brought by self-identifying gay citizen Caine Youngman. They will be represented by group BOENLA. Together they are arguing that S. 164 of the Penal Code, banning “carnal knowledge against the order of nature” which is interpreted against same-sex sexual conduct, inhibits freedom of expression contrary to constitutional guarantees of liberty. Furthermore, they will challenge that institutionalized and state-sanctioned homophobia has impacted HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and therein that it is in the state's interest to overturn this provision.
From The Voice (h/t to African Activist):
The case of a 29 year old Motswana gay man versus the Attorney General (AG) over a penal code clause would be heard at the Lobatse High Court before Justice Zibani Makwade of the High Court on April 15, 2011.
[...]
“As a person with a different sexuality I have never been able to freely express my sexuality because of the law that criminalizes sex between people of the same sex referring to it as ‘carnal knowledge against the order of nature' as well as social attitudes which stigmatize and discriminates against people with my sexual orientation. In order to do so I have to cross the border in to South Africa where my sexuality is recognized and protected by law,” Youngman put it plainly in their affidavit.
[...]
“The Constitution of Botswana under Section 3(a) provides for the protection of every person's right to ‘life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law' whatever his/her ‘race, place of origin political…, creed or sex…' It is common sense that provisions in the Constitution, especially relating to fundamental rights and freedoms must be read together, and further that they are necessarily interlinked, that each one of them must be fulfilled for each one to be realized,” they further stated.
Caine Yongman's case has become quite high-profiled in Botswana, and though it is expected that the outcome of the case will be appealed, possibly to the highest climbs of the court system, LGBT advocates hope to prevail and hopefully end institutionalized discrimination against gay people in the country.
Last year the Botswana Government moved to amend the country's Employment Act so as to make it illegal for employers to fire someone if they are suspected of being gay, or in relation to a worker's HIV status after an ethics commission found that there was evidence of sexual orientation and HIV status being used as barriers to employment.

NASA will end their $280 million mission by crashing the vending sized LADEE probe into the moon. The LADEE probe has been orbiting the moon since October, studying the lunar dust environment and moon's thin atmosphere, which is called an exosphere. Rick Elphic, a LADEE project scientist speaks out to reporters about the expected impact of the crash.
Elphic explains that when anything the size of a vending machine crashes into another object traveling about 5,250 feet per second, the landing is not going to be gentle, which translates as the moon is going to have another huge crater. Elphic goes on to explain the impact the moon and the LADEE probe will encounter, saying that the LADEE will no doubt tumble across the moon's surface until it's completely destroyed. Butler Hine, another LADEE project manager says that another one of NASA's probes that is circling the moon and it may be able to look for the crash site.
Before NASA crashes the expensive probe into the moon, they will try to find out more about the lunar dust. The LADEE probe is set to hover only a few kilometers above the surface of the moon and investigate. Hine explains that the moon's terrain varies quickly from carter ridges and valleys, and this makes the gravity field very lumpy. Frequent maneuvers are going to be required, because the team wants to limit the impact LADEE will have on the moon's surface. The expiration date for LADEE is set for April 21 because this is when the scientists estimate all the fuel will be depleted.
One of LADEE'S missions was to find out more about the lunar dust mystery, which goes all the way back to the Apollo program. The Apollo astronauts reported seeing the horizon of the moon glowing before sunrise. Scientists think that the glow could have been caused the moon's dust being thrown up into the exosphere. However, so far LADEE has not found any data that explains why the moon would appear to glow.
If LADEE has not crashed by April 15, NASA will be able to test the limits of the probe during a lunar eclipse. The shadow of the Earth will pass over the moon and make it extremely cold for the spacecraft during the four hours of the eclipse. NASA scientists are excited to see how the LADEE handles the intense cold weather, since most of the data suggests that it should be fine. Having the probe endure the extreme cold weather for a prolonged period of time is the ultimate test. The cold weather could cause the onboard laboratory to freeze and then burst. If this happens, it would destroy the entire craft.
LADEE was built and designed entirely by the Ames Research Center, making it one of the first spacecraft's to be built-in house. NASA is giving the public a chance to guess the date when the probe will crash into the moon's surface. Anyone interested can go to NASA's website and enter their guess before April 11.

Invisibility has always been a staple of sci fi, spy stories and magic. Now we might be one step closer to the real thing, as scientists last month made a tiny object invisible
For us, progress just isn't fast enough, so we're exploring other options. Here's our quick guide to dressing to disappear.
Mirrors are a classic trick of the magic show, and offer the best way of actually becoming ‘invisible'. Try on a pair of these shoes by Andreia Chaves and entertain yourself by walking around on different surfaces. Even if you aren't actually invisible they still look pretty cool, especially in this field.
You could pair them up with this mirrored dress, as seen in a Paloma Faith video. Be careful when crossing the road on sunny days - oncoming traffic won't take kindly to being blinded.
If you're just interested in the invisibility concept, you'll love this look. Not your average ‘flesh-coloured' jacket, the detail on this will make people look twice. You might not be invisible (quite the opposite), but your clothes will be.
A pair of these shoes will give you that casual barefooted look, even in winter. Obviously this is only applicable to hairy white men. Who have laces sprouting from their feet.
Sticking with the clothing for a moment, check out the ‘see-through' skirts being worn in Japan. These are more transparent than invisible, though the illusion is certainly a clever one.
Perfect for exhibitionists, not so good for people who genuininely want to disappear. Wonder if they contravene public decency laws?
Finally, back to the point. If you want to actually disappear, you need to blend in to your surroundings. That's what camouflage was invented for, right? Of course, it's no good dressing like a desert if you live in a city. That's where Urban Camouflage comes in. They've perfected the technique of invisibility, and demonstrate their work on YouTube. To disappear in the shop display, you must think like a shop display. See the assorted paper? Become the assorted paper!

Question: I was wondering if, for hypertrophy purposes, there is any real advantage using bar bell squats instead of leg presses. Looking at things from perhaps an oversimplified perspective, the leg press seems to have the same joint movements and muscle lengthening/stretching as the squat – plus it's a lot safer for the lower back.
I'm guessing it may come down to maximum load that can be moved. But can people squat more than they can leg press? Also, I'd be surprised if it were practical to use loads >1RM (negatives) for a squat, whereas on a leg press machine with a partner or two it is quite easily done.
I'm thinking the squat just ‘feels' harder because of all the stabilizers that are used and there is more need for proper technique to make it safe. I know a lot of power lifting purists will scream that the squat is the king of exercises, yada yada yada, but for leg/glute hypertrophy, what is the advantage? Some people also seem to think squatting causes more testosterone and or GH release but is there any solid evidence of this? I would doubt it.
Answer: First and foremost, while I'm sure my answer will offend the hardcore/hardheaded lifters, there is no requirement to perform squats (back or front) to build big legs (or even build leg strength). I know that this contradicts everything that has ever been written on the Internet but the idea that someone must squat to get big is mainly a lot of macho nonsense.
Historically, the reason that squats probably became popular was that, early in the days of weight training, that's all there was to do. Leg presses didn't exist (at least not in any form that wouldn't cripple you) and if you wanted to train your legs that pretty much meant squatting.
Which isn't to say that squatting isn't an excellent exercise. It has arguably been responsible for more gains in strength and size than almost anything else. But it's not the right exercise for all people; and it's certainly not required to get big or strong legs (it's worth mentioning in this vein that the Australian track cycling team, which absolutely dominated the world scene for a few years there, used the one leg leg press as their primary leg training exercise).
Quite simply, the only people who must squat are powerlifters, for whom it's a competition lift (except in the push/pull meets where it's not), and Olympic lifters where it's a key assistance exercise (and there is even some theorizing that modern Olympic lifting will get rid of the back squat with only the front squat being used to support recovery from the clean).
Nobody else has to squat.
And, again, for people with certain types of mechanics (usually very long femurs), back squatting can be a very non-productive exercise for strength or size. They'll end up so bent over that their low back will give out long before their legs get a training stimulus or they'll wreck their knees because the only way to remain upright is to push the knees so far forwards that the shear is massive.
Beyond that, let's take a quick look at reality: Anyone reading this can go into any gym in the world and see the following
A guy squatting who never adds weight to the bar: Their legs will not be growing.
A guy doing leg presses who are adding weight to the machine: Their legs will be growing.
The exercise clearly isn't the determinant of growth here. Because exercise selection per se isn't the primary determinant of growth; rather as I've discussed in recent articles such as Reps Per Set for Optimal Growth, progressive tension overload is the primary stimulus for growth.
Exercise selection is purely secondary outside of a given exercise allowing someone to apply progressive overload safely and effectively. You can build strength or mass with almost any exercise if the loading parameters and progression are there (which isn't to say that exercises don't vary in how well or how poorly they lend themselves to progression).
Put differently, if someone has really horrible mechanics for squatting, they won't be able to add weight effectively and or will get injured. That makes squatting a poor exercise choice for them. If in contrast, someone has good mechanics for squatting, meaning that they can add weight progressively in good form, that will make squatting a good exercise choice for them.
Tangentially, it's worth noting that usually when people say things like “Exercise XXX is the best for growth” what that usually means is “I'm built to do exercise XXX effectively.” People assume that since an exercise is good for them (since they are built well to do it), it must be the best for everyone.
For some people, or in some specific situations, the leg press might actually be superior to the squat (yes, I know heresy) for training the legs. Some of those situations include what I mentioned above, people who have terrible levers for squatting for whom things like low back will be limiting long before legs are trained. By taking the low back out of the movement, the legs may get a better training effect in that situation.
Related to this, leg presses can often be used as a secondary leg exercise after back squats (assuming the person is built to back squat in the first place); to get a greater leg stimulus after the low/upper back is fatigued from squats. Again, hardhead lifters/coaches tend to shit on this approach but enough athletes (including some very strong powerlifters) do this to make me think that the hardheads are full of it.
It's worth noting that your comment about the leg press being safer on the low back isn't automatically true. Done incorrectly, the leg press can be a low back death trap. People with poor flexibility and/or who try to bring the sled too far back will round their low back terribly; under heavy compression load this is an excellent way to herniate a disk.
It's worth mentioning that doing leg presses one leg at a time (with the other leg on the floor) makes it nearly impossible to round the low back and this may be the safest way of all to do them. It also saves you a lot of time loading the machine since you won't have to put as many plates on.
As far as comparing loads between the two movements, this isn't really accurate. The leverages on the leg press will allow almost anyone to move more weight (in absolute terms) than squatting. But what we are concerned with in terms of the growth and strength response is not just the absolute load on the bar, we are interested in the tension in the muscle. The mechanics of the leg press will let folks move more weight (in terms of plates on the machine) but that doesn't automatically mean more tension on the target muscles.
It's also worth noting that people who get on the leg press and move a ton of weight through a tiny range of motion aren't doing themselves any favors either. Not only is it much more stressful on the joints, by working only in the strong range, they are actually decreasing the amount of tension that their muscles are being exposed to.
Assuming the flexibility is there, I want people taking their leg presses to at least parallel (e.g. the angle between upper leg and shin should be a minimum of 90 degrees). For most macho leg pressers, this will mean stripping about half the weight off the machine to get depth.
As to the hormonal response, who cares. Nobody has ever shown that the small hormonal spikes to training mean a thing and recent research is starting to show that it is simply meaningless. Whether squats or GH raises hormones a little bit more simply isn't relevant as far as I'm concerned.
Summing up, the fact is that the leg press is a compound movement that works a large number of muscles through a decent range of motion. Trainees can apply progressive tension overload on a leg press as safely and effectively as in squatting.
And for some people, usually those with mechanics that make squatting a problem, the leg press may actually be a superior choice because it takes limiting muscle groups (low-back is the common issue) out of the equation. In a related vein, it is often the upper body that fails during squatting (especially higher repetition sets); if the goal is to train the legs, it makes little sense to me to let an ancillary muscle group limit that goal.
Finally, since I can only imagine the comments that this article will generate, I'm in no way anti-squatting. I happen to love squatting, I'm also built well for it (short with short femurs). For people who can squat progressively and effectively, it's an excellent exercise; and for those with poor mechanics it's often not worth the time and effort because the results simply won't be there.
The leg press, properly performed (meaning keeping your ego in check, taking the sled to parallel or slightly below) in a progressive fashion is an excellent way to train the lower body while avoiding some issues that can make squatting problematic for some trainees.
Oh yeah, keeping with my comment way above about the historical development of squatting, I wanted to show you how guys used to ‘leg press' back in the day (this picture originally appeared on the cover of Hardgainer, just for the record). You either had to have two guys lift the bar to put it on your feet or do it yourself (use your imagination).
Given the choice, you'd have squatted too.

High-speed winds during a thunderstorm may cause trees around an electric grid to crash into the distribution system feeders causing an outage in that area. Currently, most utility companies diminish such accidents by scheduling regular tree-trimming operations. This effort is costly and is based on a rotational approach to different service areas, which may take months and sometimes years before all trees are trimmed.
Texas A&M University researchers have developed an intelligent model that can predict a potential vulnerability to utility assets and present a map of where and when a possible outage may occur. The predictive feature allows the trees in the most critical areas with the highest risk to be trimmed first.
Dr. Mladen Kezunovic, Regents Professor and holder of the Eugene E. Webb professorship in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, along with graduate students Tatjana Dokic and Po-Chen Chen, have developed the framework for a model that can predict weather hazards, vulnerability of electric grids and the economic impact of the potential damage.
By analyzing the impact of a potential vulnerability and weather impacts on power system outages, the researchers can predict where and when outages can occur. Predicting an optimal tree trimming schedule that would minimize the risk of vegetation-related outages is only one of the applications.
"The utility grids and related assets are mostly located outdoors and are exposed to all kinds of weather hazards. Dealing with aging infrastructure assets adds another layer of complexity that utility companies face," said Kezunovic. "Any kind of environmental data that has some relevance to the power system can be fed into this prediction framework."
Data such as a utility company's operational records, weather forecasts, altitude and vegetation around the power systems can be used to customize the applications of the model.
The model is flexible and can process a variety of data despite differing formats and data sources. The researchers say processing such data is a demanding task they have been able to solve. Every source of data and its presentation is different and multifaceted. Based on the goals, they select a large amount of input data from several sources and perform a risk analysis.
Such comprehensive data analytics makes the power system and its operations more reliable.
"The first and foremost goal of utility companies is to assure uninterrupted service," said Chen. "By improving reliability, we can predict outages. If we can prevent outages with historical and close-to-real-time data, we can save millions of dollars since the outages may be mitigated."
The researchers describe their methodology for the framework as a three-part process. First, they investigate the probability of a potential hazard, such as severe weather. Next, they assess the vulnerability of the utility assets by taking the weather probability and predicting its impact on the assets. The last and most significant step is evaluating the impact of certain events and the calculation of costs of reliability indices and maintenance, replacement and repair.
The model analyzed historical and close-to-real-time weather data and successfully predicted future vulnerabilities enabling utility companies to have efficient mitigation measures, such as inspection, repair and maintenance processes.
"Overall the risk analysis helps predict the probability of events happening in the near future and then adds the financial impact allowing development of an optimal action plan for the utility operators to execute," said Chen.
"When outages happen, utility companies lose millions of dollars in just repairs," said Dokic. "The past has shown how certain outages have cost precious lives too."
The researchers used CenterPoint Energy's utility data in their framework and have presented a proof of concept to the company. Their next step is implementation of the model on CenterPoint's database and environment.
Kezunovic is also director of the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station's Smart Grid Center. The research was supported by CenterPoint Energy, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for Ultra-Wide Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks and in part by NSF Power Systems Engineering Research Center and NSF Smart Grid Big Data Spoke grants.

(Disclaimer: This is a very long post, about a player who we possibly may never sign. If you have something more important to do with your life, do it now. If you want to find out more about potential LFC target Jackson Martínez, please read on.)
This, ladies and gentlemen, is Jaguares de Chiapas striker Jackson Martínez. A current Colombian international, captain of their Mexican Primera División side, and the second highest goal scorer in Jaguares' history, Martínez' stock is rising in world football, thanks mainly for their ability to score goals.
It is not the number of goals as much as it is the manner of scoring that I find particularly impressive – although they have scored an incredible number of goals, both with Jaguares and Colombian club side Deportiva Independiente Medellín, with whom they won a title in 2009.
And on top of their abundantly evident goal threat, Martínez carries something of an interest in LFC. Twice in the last 6 months they have publicly commented that Liverpool is an interesting option for him, but pausing to add earlier this month that there's “still nothing concrete”. The mere fact he's talking about us suggests he's open to a move, but is they good enough for Liverpool? Would they improve our stuttering form in front of goal that has cost us so dearly in our current league campaign?
South American football expert Tim Vickery recently commented on Martínez, describing them as an “out-and-out goalscorer, a front-to-goal centre-forward who can finish off both feet, and with excellent spring that makes them a threat in the air.”
While Vickery noted concerns about Martínez' touch, in the current technical context of Kuyt and Carroll, Martínez comes off looking like Messi, and they offer far more with the ball at their feet than our current crop of forwards can muster – obviously excepting Luis Suarez' creative genius.
Some Basic Statistics:
This year (2011/12 Apertura and Clausura) Martínez has been shooting at around 57.4%, more accurately than any of the top strikers in the Premier League. And their shots-to-goals ratio is also comparable to some of the Premier League's best forwards, with Martínez taking 5 shots for each goal scored, making them as efficient in front of goal as Wayne Rooney and Sergio Aguero. Red-hot forward Robin Van Persie is scoring once in every 4 shots – only marginally better than our big Colombian friend.
Indeed, as Liverpool fan and info-hobbyist Dan Kennett suggested in a recent article on Luis Suarez, our Uruguayan playmaker needed an average of 8 shots to score even in the comparatively “easy” Eredivisie, their best season only seeing their conversion rate hit 1:6.
Even Robin Van Persie has a lifetime ratio at Arsenal of a goal from every 6.5 shots, while Rooney has historically taken 7.5 shots for every goal (again from Dan's Suarez masterpiece). This means that within their context, Martínez is scoring like a top, top striker.
Martínez takes 3.6 shots per game, slightly more than Sergio Aguero or Demba Ba. Their current scoring ratio is 0.73 goals per game, far better than the magic 1 in 2 benchmark used to judge strikers. If that form successfully translated to the Premier League, he'd only be trailing Van Persie and Rooney in the goal-scoring charts, and projected over 38 league games, they could potentially score 28 goals – a phenomenal amount.
But the Mexican Primera is not the English Premier League – any comparisons need to be treated with caution. Not only is the style of football different, they exist on different stratospheres of the footballing universe, the Mexican league considered a creditable 12th strongest domestic competition in world football, but the PL arguably the best or second best, depending on what your views on La Liga are. It is clear Martínez would need to step their game up if they were to join Liverpool and become the antidote to our finishing woes.
A few key measurements I've collected, suggest they very well could.
I have painstakingly watched every video I can find of Jackson Martínez doing what they do best: scoring goals. I have analysed each finish, documenting the foot they score with (except for headers, obviously) the shooting technique they employ, their distance from goal on shooting and what parts of the goal they shoot into. I have only documented 61 goals (he's scored around 90 professional goals between Mexico and Columbia), but feel the sample size is big enough to make reasonable assumptions from. Certainly there were common patterns that emerged in terms of types of finishes and where they place the ball into the goals.
So let's start there, with finishing zones.
Martínez' Finishing Zones:
Immediately I find myself impressed with the zones of maximum scoring. Hard and low shots into the bottom corners are difficult for goalkeepers to save, and roughly a third of Martínez' goals have gone into these two zones alone. This suggests to me intelligent shot placement. 45.2% of all of their scoring shots enter the goal in the lowest segment.
Equally noticeable is a clear trend towards the right hand side of the goal, with 43.5% of Martínez' goals coming inside the right-hand post. This is explained by the fact that Martínez is predominantly right-footed, although we'll see further down that he's far from being a one-foot-wonder.
16.1% of the goals I saw arced, spun, powered or looped into the top right hand corner – this is no fluke. Clearly Martínez knows how to hit a ball and where they are most likely to score, hence the placement into areas goalies hate – both bottom corners, and the “postage stamp” in the top right corner. The ones that make you feel all tingly, like in this video from mid-February:
Words can't begin to describe how beautiful I think that goal is.
Shooting Range: While these numbers have been loosely rounded, the general pattern is that “Big Jacko” scores from medium range, somewhere between 6 and 18 yards from goal. While not an earth-shattering, revelatory statistic, I would argue that this suggests Martínez is a good fit for Liverpool: He's regularly getting into the box and scoring!
We have enough players who shoot pointlessly from range and more than enough who don't shoot at all. What we need is someone who finds or makes space to shoot on goal from within the penalty area. Martínez has this routine down, they know how to get into scoring range and they evidently know where to put the ball when he's in it.
Finishing Trends:
Looking at how Martínez finishes their goals, it's clear they have plenty of ways to find the net.
21% of their goals were finished with their head – interestingly the vast majority of their headed goals were in Colombia, with their current teammates at Jaguares usually opting to play the ball low into feet. Their aerial success lies with their ability to meet the ball at pace, generating plenty of power off the head. They also have that extraordinary “hangtime” quality that players like Tim Cahill exhibit, enabling them to outleap defenders.
As I mentioned before, he's no one-foot-wonder, with around a quarter of all of their goals coming from their non-preferred left foot. Even some of their long-range efforts are hit from their theoretically “weaker” foot, their characteristic power and accuracy available from both sides of their body.
Martínez is naturally right-footed, and has scored the majority of their goals (55%) this way.
In terms of types of finishing, Martínez has the full repertoire of shots.
The majority of Martínez goals are sidefooted finishes, with their placement past the keeper when 1-on-1 a regular feature. They also regularly gets into the position where they are finishing into an open goal, the keeper having been eliminated through clever movement on their behalf.
They often score with powerful drives a la Gerrard and is confident to line up a shot from outside the penalty area when they get space. They also have excellent volleying technique and can finish first time with either foot confidently.
14.3% of Martínez' goals have been penalties.  They are a confident penalty taker and usually tucks their pens powerfully into a bottom corner. More than once though they have used a chipped finish that has lollipopped over the stranded goalkeeper – not something I personally want to see away at Old Trafford at 0-0 in the last minute of play.
General Characteristics:
Besides the statistical analysis, Martínez has plenty of physical characteristics that lend themselves well to the physicality of the Premier League. He's a big unit at 1.88m tall and 82kg, and he's strong.
They have explosive acceleration, a powerful step that allows them to create their own shooting opportunities despite tight marking. Martínez prefers to do most of their sprinting off the ball, however they can carry the ball at speed and has a functional stepover – one that actually helps them beat their man.
While Vickery questions their technique, they do have good touch for a powerful forward. While they may not have the dribbling ability of Seydou Doumbia, a comparable talent, their first touch is much stickier and they think quickly around the box, either shooting or moving the ball on to a teammate.
Tall, fast and strong, Martínez could dovetail well with Suarez as an explosive, high-energy forward partnership. They also have the speed and intelligence to run the channels for Andy Carroll's headed flicks. More than anything, they have an accurate, powerful, low shot that regularly threatens the goal, and they have the know-how to frequently find shooting positions.
For the rumoured price, (£8-10 million) Martínez would represent far less of a gamble than Carroll themselves did. The Colombian is a captain, an international and a matured, well-rounded player. The only question is how long would it take them to adjust to the intensity and relentlessness of Premier League football? If they do, they could bring the one missing ingredient to our early season dominance, the currency that defines success in football: goals.
Verdict:
I'd personally like to see them at Liverpool. While rumours have them choosing between us and Porto, they would fit well with our style of play and contribute pace and incisiveness up front that we are currently lacking. If the budget is restricted to around £25m as is being frequently rumoured, then dropping £10m on Martínez seems a fantastic idea.
There are very few players in Europe with their kind of scoring record at that kind of price.
I hope you enjoyed this in-depth player analysis of Jackson Martínez. It took ages to research and write. Please share it via Twitter, Facebook or your preferred social Network. Cheers.

Revealed: The driver who was chased and beaten up in front of their wife and child by a pack of motorcyclists after trying to run over them in their SUV
Alexian Lien's Range Rover was the man attacked by motorcyclists after they accidentally hit a biker
Lien, 33, then crash through the mob in their vehicle, fearing for the safety of their wife Rosalyn Ng, and their 5-month-old child
Bikers chase the SUV, carrying couple and young child, and try to attack it
Lien speeds off hitting motorcyclists for the second time
It eventually grinds to a halt in NYC traffic and bikers smash the window
Lien was treated in hospital for lacerations to their face and body
Police said, contradictory to online comments, there were no other injuries
Pictured: Alexian Lien drove through a swarm of motorcyclists in their SUV on a New York City highway, apparently in fear of their safety and that of their wife and 5-month-old baby
Video has emerged showing the shocking moment a Range Rover driver apparently drove through a crowd of motorbikes as it fled with its family inside for fear of being attacked.
Police have revealed the bikers started to damage the vehicle after the driver, 33-year-old Alexian Lien, hit a motorcyclist.
Fearing for the safety of their wife Roslyn Ng and young child, aged five months, the SUV driver then sped off, hitting several bikers in its path.
The six-minute film shows the SUV hit another motorcyclist after it was chased by the pack of bikers.
The family are eventually brought to a standstill in Manhattan traffic and immediately bikers run to attack the vehicle, smashing the driver's window and attempting to smash the rear door window.
The five-month-old child was in the back and Ng was in the front passenger seat.
An NYPD spokesperson told MailOnline the Lien was taken to hospital and treated for lacerations to their face and body.
They said there were no other injuries reported from the incident.
No one has been arrested and police are still investigating and examining the evidence, they said.
The moment Alexian Lien fled from a pack of motorcyclists, dramatically taking out several in its path
The bikers had been riding alongside the Range Rover before the incident. Shortly after this moment, the biker in blue jeans directly front of the car braked, it appeared the vehicle may have hit it
Swarm: The massive group then ground to a halt and surrounded the vehicle
The spokesperson said, according to Lien, a large number of motorcyclists were driving 'erratically' and they 'accidentally collided with one'.
The footage shows one motorcyclist brake hard in front the the car and seems to get bumped by it.
They pulled over but some of the bikers started to damage the vehicle. The NYPD spokesperson told MailOnline the driver drove off 'to avoid an impending assault'.
The video shows the Range Rover accelerate suddenly knocking over bikes and motorcyclists, driving over the top of them.
The footage was captured on a helmet camera of a motorcyclist during an annual bikers' event in New York City, at around 2pm yesterday.
Apparently intimidated, the driver then accelerates away knocking down bikers in its path
Bikers watch in disbelief as the 4x4 driver speeds off by going straight through their group
The chase is on: It only takes a few seconds before the front running bikers, including the one filming, catch up with the Range Rover
Caught: Within minutes, the whole pack has caught up with the vehicle, with Lien, Ng, and their 5-month-old inside
Lien speeds away, but immediately the angry bikers follow and it takes a matter of seconds for them to catch up.
The footage shows them following the vehicle for several minutes, at times getting close and intimidating the driver.
The group of bikers takes Exit 14, on route 95, following signs for the Cross Bronx Expressway and passing the sign for Henry Hudson Parkway, before they traffic begins to slow.
The bikers again surround the vehicle, blocking its path and it's forced to stop.
Seizing an opportunity to confront the driver, one biker dismounts and tries to open the door, but the SUV speeds off again, knocking down at least one more motorcyclist.
Halted: The bikers surround the vehicle forcing it to stop, and another biker seized the opportunity to try to get into the driver's side door
The driver speeds off again, knocking down another motorcyclist
The driver heads off on route 95 heading north towards the Cross Bronx Expressway, then taking the W 176 SI which leads into a built-up area with heavy traffic.
Forced to stop at traffic lights, the Range Rover comes to a standstill, and within seconds two bikers are off their vehicles and attacking the driver's side windows.
The first takes off their helmet and throws it against the driver's door window, smashing it; the second tries to punch through the rear door window, where the child was sat.
The footage then stops.
The video was posted by a biker, under the name GIXXARDR on Liveleaks, from Melbourne, Australia, this morning. They claim one biker was killed, which the police said was not true.
When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with their helmet
A second driver also tries to smash the back window, then the footage abruptly ends
Already it has received numerous comments, most are in support of Lien.
One person, whose profile name is Sgt Pepper, says: 'I would do exactly the same thing. They're intimidating them and he's probably fearing for their life.'
Another, known as 'zacarra' says the driver acted in 'self defense'.
'Did you see the biker break (sic) check them in the beginning. This poor guy was running for their life from the start,' zacarra writes.
According to 'meathead12' it was 'justifiable': 'Only a fool would stick around to be pulled out of their car and lynched by 100 bikers.'
Sexually transmitted infections in Alberta are still at outbreak levels and health experts want the provincial government to spend more on prevention.
Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Karen Grimsrud, said health providers need to find new ways to reach at-risk groups, including young aboriginal women.
"A newer way of looking at this is a more targeted approach through our community organizations ... that have daily contact with this particular population," they said.
There were roughly 3,400 cases of gonorrhea reported in Alberta in 2015, which marked an 80 per cent increase from 2014.
Full data for 2016 isn't yet available, but from January to November last year, there were 3,390 cases across the province, according to Alberta Health.
Half of those infections were in the Edmonton health zone, which saw 1,695 reported cases of gonorrhea in the first 11 months of last year.
The Calgary health zone, by contrast, saw 830 cases in the same period.
It's a similar story for infectious syphilis, with 350 cases reported in 2015, which doubled the count in 2014.
In the first 11 months of 2016, there were 360 cases of syphilis, 169 of which were in Edmonton.
Complex problem
Grimsrud says there's no one solution to the STI problem.
Pam Krause, who runs the Calgary Sexual Health Centre, wants the province to put more money toward prevention and intervention that will see infection rates decline.
"I think the biggest thing now is there's a different government in place, a government that understands prevention, and so I think we're starting to see things change," they said.
Right now, young women are still at high risk of chlamydia and more young gay men are contracting HIV.
"So if you don't have any information around that when you're a young person, it's very hard for that to be part of your overall kind of health as you move forward," said Krause.
Krause also says the numbers could mean more people are aware and are getting tested.
The British cyclist Steve Cummings has told of how they finished the Tour de France with two fractured vertebrae - and it's affecting their fitness for the Vuelta.
Responding to a fan on Twitter, the Dimension Data rider said they had fractured the L1 and L2 vertebrae in their lower back.
It was in reply to a query after they were not selected for the Vuelta a España later this month.
A Twitter user asked if it was due to the “30 per cent climbs and blistering heat”.
36 year old Cummings said: “Heat or steep climbs don't concern me, it's part of cycling. The problem is, I fractured L1 and L2 vertebrae in the tour. I had to rest.”
Heat or steep climbs don't concern me, it's part of cycling. The problem is, I fractured L1 and L2 vertebrae in the tour. I had to rest.... — Steve Cummings (@StevoCummings) August 4, 2017
Cummings suffered with back problems after a fall in the 17th stage of the Tour, which saw them flip through a ditch and into a field. They did, however, complete the stage, and the Tour.
And unfortunately I won't be fit enough in time for the vuelta. — Steve Cummings (@StevoCummings) August 4, 2017
Last month we reported how Dan Martin was forced to skip Clasica San Sebastian after discovering that they rode much of the Tour de France with two fractured vertebrae.
"During the Tour I didn't have any problems when racing, but off the bike I wasn't feeling very comfortable, so this week I did a scan and got the news,” explained Martin.
According to a statement from their Quick Step Floors team, a medical examination revealed two small transverse process fracture to the L2 and L3 vertebrae, meaning Martin will be sidelined for the next three weeks.
The Irishman was memorably waylaid by the horror crash that ended Richie Porte's Tour de France on stage nine, but picked up their bike and rode on.
They later said that the incident had left them unable to climb out of the saddle: “In the crash I hit so hard against the bank that all the muscles went into spasm. On the bike there was no pain, none sleeping or standing up. It was just when I had to bend my back the muscles hurt.
“You don't need to straighten your back on the bike. No problem. [But] I wasn't able to get out of the saddle. I could sprint, but I couldn't climb out of the saddle because of the hip angle. That was the biggest challenge.”
Budget night is always a major event in the Australian calendar. While Anzac Day has the historical resonance, Australia Day has the celebratory atmosphere, and Schoolies Week has the rampant date rape, Budget Night is different. Budget night is the night when Australians everywhere, no matter what their race, creed or colour, are united in their firm belief that the Government should be giving them more money.
Just why and how the Government should be giving this money, though, is well beyond the ken of the average Australian. Life is hard enough, what with mortgages and private school fees and deceitful MasterChef dishes, without having to wade through the budget and unpick every miserly injustice and fiscal disgrace. This is why we have budget analysts to do it for you. And in particular, this is why newmatilda.com now presents my "Handy, Time-Saving 2010 Budget Guide for Ordinary, Stupid Australians". I am here to provide you with all the information you need to make sound financial whingeing noises. Here we go.
What kind of Budget was it?
As Treasurer Wayne Swan made clear, it was a "no-frills" budget. In other words, unlike previous budgets that were filled with frivolous bells, shiny whistles and extravagant thingamajigs, this one was filled with strict discipline, calm efficiency, and noble restraint. Not for Swan the 1997 budget, in which Peter Costello promised every adult male a free poodle; or the 1989 budget, in which Paul Keating stood on the balcony of Parliament House tossing diamonds to the crowd below.
No, there was none of that sort of reckless profligacy. There was extra money for health, with a pledge to build 23 more GP super-clinics, which at the current rate may well be completed prior to the melting of the polar ice caps; there was also a boost to funding for elite athletes, which came as a great relief to all those "Aussie battlers" who had been fearing the global financial crisis might cause us a certain amount of embarrassment on the archery range.
But overall, it was a conservative budget, aimed squarely at keeping spending in check, boosting revenue, and returning to surplus in that nasty, stingy way that politicians have when they take all your money and then refuse to give it back.
What's in the Budget for me?
That's fairly hard to answer without knowing who you are.
Let us assume I am a middle-aged white male with an income between $40,000 and $60,000 and a strong sense of entitlement.
Then the Budget does not leave you completely empty-handed. You will get a tax cut that will leave you about $9 per week better off — easily enough to cover a weekly breakfast at Hungry Jack's — and tax on interest on your savings will be cut. Also, you will be able to call a 24-hour hotline to find a doctor in your area at any time. This will come as an enormous help to the burgeoning and increasingly politically active nightclub-brawler demographic. As Nicola Roxon put it, "This means knowing that your loved ones can get the care they need." You yourself will not be entitled to any care, but your loved ones are all set. Should you have no loved ones, the Government will assign you some.
Will the budget help the country achieve fiscal solvency?
Indeed it will. Having last year spent such massive lashings of cash that the Opposition stated confidently that the deficit was just a few pennies away from taking on physical form and devouring peasants, it was a nice surprise to learn that in fact, the budget will return to surplus within just three years. This is conclusive proof that Wayne Swan is not just a sweat patch searching for a shirt to stain; they also know about money and owns a calculator, or knows someone who does.
What part will the brand new "super-profits" tax play in Australia's economic future?
The new Resource Super Profits Tax (or "RSPT") is a major plank in the hardwood floor of the Government's fiscal policy. It will bring in $3 billion in its first year, and $9 billion per year after that, thanks to Australia's bountiful natural mineral wealth. The downside, of course, is that it will cause all the mining companies to leave the country. "Take your mineral wealth and shove it," seems to be the miners' attitude at present. The trouble with the Government is that it has neglected the number one rule of economics: nobody will want to make money if they can't make more money than they otherwise might have made. All economists know that corporations, at heart, are proud, haughty creatures. They are happy to exploit resources and earn massive profits as long as they are treated with respect, but they would rather have no profits at all than have to stump up big chunks of them for the good of a bunch of lazy little proles who can't even summon up the initiative to build an open-cut mine, let alone charge hyper-inflated prices to huge Chinese steel mills for the products of it.
If this RSPT is brought in, it seems inevitable that the companies will run off to Indonesia or Sudan or Ibiza or something, and all those minerals will just sit in the ground, undug and unloved. So it is probably best that we try to ignore the seductive riches that Swan, the wily old spiv, is promising us, and listen instead to Tony Abbott, who describes the RSPT as just "a great big new tax". Mind you, Abbott describes everything as a "great big new tax", including the emissions trading scheme, the company tax, the Medicare levy, and Julia Gillard's hairdo. It's part of their programming. But that doesn't mean he's wrong.
How much of my hard-earned money will go to keep illegal queue-jumping economic pseudo-refugee terrorists living in the lap of luxury?
A massive amount — over $1 billion over the next 12 months. This amount would come down, of course, were the Government to institute a few simple commonsense measures, like taking away the asylum seekers' minibar privileges, or reducing the size of the marching bands employed to welcome each boat to the country; but the Government refuses to do this because it is in thrall to the powerful and malevolent asylum seeker lobby.
Is the Opposition in favour of the 2010 Budget?
It is not. Surprisingly, in light of the many positives outlined by Wayne Swan, the Opposition seems reluctant to give unqualified support to Labor's plans.
Shadow Treasurer and Chief Ogre Joe Hockey, in particular, was scathing, describing the Budget as "built on quicksand", a dangerous scenario indeed, given that this means the more the Budget struggles, the faster it will sink. The Opposition has pledged that if it is elected, it will immediately place the Budget on its back, and gradually move it forward until it can grab hold of a strong vine or tree branch. Hockey also made the point that the Government was basing its Budget on shaky assumptions, which is quite true. The Government is assuming, for example, that China will continue wanting our iron ore and coal; that smokers will keep buying cigarettes even though they are in ugly boxes; that Kevin Rudd will not get drunk and shove the education budget down a stripper's underpants; and so on. Dangerous assumptions indeed, and yet the Opposition's refusal to back the Government does seem a little churlish. Just for once, you'd think they could be good sports about things.
What is the opinion of distinguished News Ltd business commentator Terry McCrann?
McCrann has quite clearly stated that not only is this the worst Budget ever devised, a horrific grab-bag of over-taxing, over-spending, and wild speculation, but that they have conclusive evidence that the Prime Minister was long ago driven insane by congenital syphilis, and is even now plotting to have us all shot so they can steal our fillings and mould them into a gigantic statue of himself. McCrann also makes the point that the National Broadband Network is an underhand scheme to turn us all gay with gamma rays, and that Wayne Swan is the true identity of Jack the Ripper.
Am I still in danger of being killed by insulation?
No. The Budget earmarks funds for fixing the insulation fiasco, which means Peter Garrett will be forced to kill you with their bare hands.
Why can't we hear the opinions of ordinary Australians whose lives are directly affected by the Budget?
Because they are mouth-breathing morons who say stupid things like, "There should be more money for childcare," or "I'd like to see more done to support small businesspeople." Really, they should all be rounded up and herded into pens, where they can be used to provide energy for important commentators in the media.
No, there are no frills in this budget, no gaudy baubles to distract the eye. Just a long-term plan to make sure Australia carries on towards tomorrow with strength and confidence. You may not have gotten much in the budget yourself, but thanks to the deeper understanding of the issues you have gained from pundits like me and Alan "Sex Bomb" Kohler, you can sleep soundly at night knowing that the money you didn't receive is even now hard at work opening up hospital beds in rural areas, topping up the superannuation of low-income workers, and most importantly of all, buying thick, fluffy towels for Stephanie Rice.
It's fiscal discipline we can believe in. Onward to prosperity, Australia!
Writing my piece on Andrew Breitbart and Tucker Carlson, I missed a huge example of overlap between their two sham-empires: the reporter who broke the Caller's now-disgraced “scoop” about Sen. Robert Menendez patronizing prostitutes, Matthew Boyle, now works for Breitbart.com. And on Monday they penned the ridiculous story revealing the location of Malia and Sasha's spring break vacation (which is now at the top of the Drudge Report).
On Twitter Monday and Tuesday, Breitbart fans attacked my focus on their hero's bizarre racially driven crusades. They continue to insist that they're being unfairly tarred with the charge of racism, when they're the real “post-racialists” who just don't like Barack Obama because he's a liberal. I have some advice for right-wingers who don't want it to seem like their anti-Obama animus is racial: Try treating their daughters with respect.

You'll remember back in December, the NRA went after Sasha and Malia with an ad insisting that the fact that they have armed protection, when the administration was supposedly blocking armed security at America's schools (actually, it wasn't), was the height of hypocrisy – ignoring the many threats to their safety faced by the children of presidents and the tradition of Secret Service protection, for all of them.
The Weekly Standard's Daniel Halper went even crazier, with a piece alleging that the girls' school, Sidwell Friends, a Quaker school, had armed guards, too. Anyone familiar with the Quaker tradition of nonviolence found that claim strange, and of course, like most claims about the Obama family that come from the right, it turned out not to be true.
Unfortunately for the untalented Mr. Boyle, journalists have a consensus about not revealing the location of the presidents' children's vacations. Reporters don't write about minor first children except when they're attending "official or semi-official events." It's considered a security risk. As the Washington Post's Paul Farhi reported last year:
The ban on such coverage has existed through many administrations by informal agreement with the White House Correspondents' Association, which represents the interests of journalists who cover the president. “There's a general feeling among the press corps that it wants to be respectful” of the president's children, said Caren Bohan, the White House reporter for Reuters who is president of the WHCA.
When Agence-France Presse wrote about Malia's trip to Mexico last year, a few U.S. outlets picked it up, and the administration tried to get the details removed. Then an earthquake in Mexico made the first daughter's vacation newsworthy, and other sites, justifiably, reported it.
A year later, along comes the brave Matthew Boyle, fresh off their Menendez humiliation, to tell Breitbart readers about the Obama girls' vacation. The news hook seems to be that it's a waste of money.
“It is unclear how long the first daughters will be staying in the Bahamas, or what the cost will be to taxpayers,” Boyle harrumphs. “Earlier this month, the White House canceled public tours as a result of the recent budget sequester, citing Secret Service staffing costs.”

Esquire's Charlie Pierce put it better than I can:
What possible interest does this serve, except to titillate the dark and envious nether parts of Boyle's 22 readers? (No link, because fk that pudgy little monster.) There is no possible news value to this. Sooner or later, the frolicks of what my pal [Eric] Boehlert calls the "rightwing entertainment complex" are going to get someone killed.
The theme of most right-wing stories on Sasha, Malia and Michelle Obama's vacations and leisure-time activities seems to be that they're entitled princesses, when they do exactly the same kinds of things other presidents' families have done throughout history. There's only one difference I can see.
Drudge is also hyping the president's vacation with the blaring headline “A vacation a month.” That's another racially tinged trope on the right, that our first black president seems to be a little, well, lazy, because they can't stop taking vacations. Of course, Obama is on track to take about a fifth of the vacation days George W. Bush did over their two terms. Obama took 131 vacation days in their first term – which would amount to 262 if they kept that pace in their second term. Bush took a staggering 1,060 vacation days over eight years, by far the most vacation in history (he also took the longest single presidential vacation in the modern era, a full five weeks.) Can someone explain why Obama is supposedly the vacation-hog?
Oh, and the comments on Boyle's Breitbart.com story are pretty awesome, too. Here's a good one:

They will indeed grow up to be monsters. Very, very, angry and vengeful monsters. Just like momma…
Especially after they are forced to visit their obamination of a father in a federal penitentiary following their impeachment and conviction for Treason…
Although I'd far prefer they visit their plot occasionally following their hanging for treason.
Boyle is perfect for their new employer (although they were a pretty good fit for the Daily Caller, too). In a post explaining why they jumped ship (which didn't mention the higher salary they got), they bragged about “enlisting in Andrew Breitbart's army … I'm shipping out today. It's time to go to war.”
A war on the president's daughters? Boyle ought to talk to some veterans of actual war. What a putz.
Paul Farhi's story on the media's traditional treatment of first children quoted Democratic pollster Celinda Lake on the political appeal of Obama's family: “The value of the family is enormous. The more you know this family and the more you think of Barack Obama in these terms, the harder it is to vilify him.”

That's true for the vast majority of Americans. But not the haters and racists who belong to Breitbart's “army.”
By Rocky Esposito: Ring Magazine “Trainer of the Year” Robert Garcia told ESNEWS in an interview yesterday that Marcos “El Chino” Maidana (35-4 / 31 KOs) has informed them that they will retire if they do not get the rematch with Floyd “Money” Mayweather. At first, Robert Garcia's tone and demeanor in the interview seemed to be as if they were just kidding around. They even joked and said “He (Maidana) has 100 cows, he's already set for life”. However, when they elaborated on the topic, they switched modes and said Maidana was in fact serious.
As a Boxing fan, I enjoy watching Marcos Maidana fight. Ever since their first fight in the United States, when they upset Victor Ortiz back on 6/27/09, you knew they were a talented, action packed fighter with a ton of heart. Also, since they have teamed up with Robert Garcia, they have never looked better in their entire professional career. I even give their Strength and Conditioning Coach Alex Ariza a ton of credit. Maidana was in the best shape of their life vs Mayweather and it showed in their performance.
Marcos Maidana is only 30 years old.  They are 4-1 under the tutelage of Robert Garcia. Although they did not beat Floyd, they have only gotten better and better with each performance under Garcia and all the while the opponents got tougher and tougher. Maidana also has added a legitimate jab to their arsenal now. To me, as a Boxing fan, it seems too premature for Maidana to walk away from Boxing, especially at this point of their career, just when they seem to be performing at their best. Maidana should not retire, whether they get the Mayweather rematch or not.
Due to Boxing's Cold War, I thought the future of the Welterweight Division would be determined by a potential match up in the near future between Keith “One Time” Thurman (23-0 / 21KOs) and Shawn “Showtime” Porter (24-0-1 / 15KOs). Currently, Thurman is 25 years old (11/23/88), and Porter is 26 (10/27/87). Maidana is just a little older at 30. However, Maidana has the edge in overall ring experience, facing adversity, and being on the biggest stages. And again, they are fighting the best of their career. Whereas Thurman and Porter, (whom I both like very much), are still trying to gain more ring experience, face better and better competition and polish their skills. (Both are on the right paths and seem to be destined for each other). But, if Maidana does not retire, they may be a very tough obstacle for these guys to hurdle. I would love to see Thurman vs Maidana, Porter vs Maidana. Good matchups!
Only time will tell if Maidana is truly serious about retiring if they do not get the Mayweather rematch. We have to keep in mind though, they did come close once, after their one-sided lose to Devon Alexander back in February of 2012. Maidana also could have made this statement simply to make sure Golden Boy & Al Haymon are applying whatever influence/pressure on Floyd that they can for finalizing a rematch. Marcos Maidana walks to the beat of their own drum. (If there is a rematch, I wonder if the gloves will be an issue!). God Bless!

You are deep into one of your busy night shifts, and one of your frequent flyers shows up via EMS. Your nurse approaches you and exasperates, “Mr. X is back again, and of course they are drunk. Their vital signs are normal, and they are snoozing in room 7 whenever you can get to him.” Admittedly, this patient goes to the bottom of your triage list. An hour or so later, you get around to walking into room 7 and discover Mr. X still asleep on the stretcher. You sternal rub them and they do not arouse very easily. While sternal rubbing, you feel a bottle in their jacket pocket. You pull it out to discover an almost empty bottle of windshield wiper fluid and suddenly begin to panic as this is not your typical intoxicated patient.
Background
When discussing toxic alcohols, it is important to define what constitutes a “toxic” alcohol. Any alcohol when consumed in enough of a quantity can be toxic; however, we will not discuss ethanol as it is not one of the classic “toxic alcohols.” These typically include methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol). Also, we will not be discussing propylene glycol due to the rarity of its consumption. Propylene glycol toxicity is seen mainly in an inpatient setting with IV infusions that contain propylene glycol as an excipient. Since this is a focused review for the emergency department setting, this leaves three “toxic alcohols” to discuss.
Why would someone ever consume these alcohols? Typically, these substances are used for two reasons: suicide/homicide or inebriation. Toxic alcohols are more readily available than ethanol and are usually cheaper. This is especially true in patients who are under the legal drinking age. Toxic alcohol assays are commercially available, but are rarely used in hospital laboratories. It remains a challenge to diagnose these patients in the emergency room, as many of them mimic simple ethanol intoxication.
Pathophysiology
Methanol also called methyl alcohol is found in windshield wiper fluid, de-icing products, paint removers, photocopying fluid, shellacs, and embalming fluid. A rarer place that a patient would consume methanol is in contaminated moonshine. Very rarely, inhalational and dermal exposures have been reported. Methanol is metabolized in the liver to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. The formaldehyde is then metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid. The formic acid inhibits cytochrome c in the mitochondria, shifting the cell to anaerobic glycolysis, leading to lactic acid accumulation. Methanol ingestion is the M in the MUDPILES mnemonic; thus, it is an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. The formic acid buildup and lactic acid buildup are to thank for this. The acidosis leads to the byproducts crossing the blood-brain barrier leading to neurologic effects, including Parkinsonism, transverse myelitis, and basal ganglia hemorrhages. Methanol leads to the classic “snowstorm” vision and also photophobia. Methanol ingestion usually provides a decreased level of inebriation compared to ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol; however, if coingested with ethanol, this is not a reliable symptom. With the acidosis, the patient may be hyperventilating to compensate.
Ethylene glycol is found in radiator antifreeze, degreasing agents, and metal cleaners. It has no smell or color and tastes sweet. Ethylene glycol is metabolized in the liver to glycoaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycoaldehyde is then converted to glycolic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is then converted to glyoxylic acid, then to oxalic acid. It is this acid that combines with serum calcium to form the classic calcium oxalate crystals found in the urine of patients who have consumed ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is the E in the MUDPILES mnemonic, meaning that it causes an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. NAD+ is a cofactor needed for alcohol dehydrogenase in the first step of ethylene glycol's breakdown. Once these stores are depleted, the pathway is shunted to the citric acid cycle where lactate is a byproduct. The neurologic effects of ethylene glycol are coma, seizures, meningismus, muscle spasms, and paralysis of the extraocular muscles. It can also affect the heart and lungs, causing tachycardia, hyperventilation, ARDS, and heart failure. Hypocalcemia and resulting QT prolongation are due to serum calcium combining with oxalic acid. Lastly, kidney failure is due to these calcium crystals depositing into renal tubules. This also causes flank pain and oliguria.
Isopropanol is the most commonly ingested toxic alcohol in the United States. Isopropyl alcohol is found in solvents and disinfectants. It is also found in mouthwashes, lotions, as well as rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. It is also hepatically metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone. The acetone does not undergo further metabolism, and no acid byproducts are formed. This means that isopropanol is the only toxic alcohol that does not cause an elevated anion gap acidosis. It can cause hemorrhagic gastritis and profound inebriation with cerebellar signs and coma. Due to the acetone byproduct, the patient will sometimes have a fruity odor on their breath.
Epidemiology
According to the 2012 data from the United States Poison Control Center, 16,458 cases of isopropyl alcohol ingestions were reported. 8,773 of these cases were classified as a “toxicity” with 65 patients experiencing “major morbidity,” but only one patient dying. Also in 2012, there were 1,612 cases of ingestion of methanol, with 26 patients having “major morbidity” and 6 deaths. There were 5,869 cases of ethylene glycol ingestion, with 205 having a “major morbidity” and 23 deaths.
Diagnosis
Certain patients will make for an easy diagnosis, like the patient in the opening scenario; however, the conundrum for the emergency physician lies in the patient that appears intoxicated, but has not obviously ingested a toxic alcohol. How do we as emergency physicians know when to suspect a toxic alcohol ingestion? It is a difficult question to answer. It is extremely important to listen to what the patient (if coherent), family/friends, and EMS have to say regarding the patient's condition. Clinical suspicion should always remain high when a “drunk” patient is brought in to the department. Of course, any patient with symptoms listed above should raise suspicion.
If toxic alcohol ingestion is suspected, the patient's blood should be sent for serum levels of the toxic alcohols; however, these usually take several hours to days to return depending on your hospital's laboratory. While you wait for these results, a BMP, ethanol level, lactate, serum osmolarity, and an ABG/VBG should be ordered. The BMP provides useful information about the patient's creatinine. It also provides the patient's anion gap, which will be elevated in toxic alcohol consumption other than isopropanol. The ethanol level helps prove that the intoxication is from something else other than ethanol. Lactate will usually be elevated with methanol or ethylene glycol consumption. The ABG/VBG reveals how acidotic a patient is. If a patient's osmolar gap is >10-25 mOsm in the setting of an elevated anion gap, this is highly suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion. Keep in mind that the osmolar gap will be elevated early on as the parent compound of the toxic alcohol is still present; however, it will gradually decrease, and the anion gap will increase as more toxic metabolites are formed. The patient's urine can be analyzed under a Wood's lamp. Sodium fluorescein, which is found in antifreeze will fluoresce under a black light. The urine can also be analyzed under microscopy for presence of urinary calcium oxalate crystals. It is important to note that these two urine tests are highly unreliable. If imaging of the brain is performed, a CT or MRI might show putamen necrosis or basal ganglia hemorrhages in methanol ingestion.
Management
The first initial step in treating any patient with a poisoning should be to call the poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. A toxicologist should be involved early in these cases. Although used in the past, GI decontamination is no longer recommended. The main goal of treatment is blocking the conversion of the mother compounds to their toxic metabolites. This is done by blocking alcohol dehydrogenase. Both fomepizole and ethanol have a higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase than the toxic alcohols and can be used as antidotes for methanol/ethylene glycol poisoning; however, fomepizole is preferred due to its better side effect profile and ease of use. The loading dose for fomepizole is 20 mg/kg and then 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 doses. The question is when is a poisoning bad enough to use the antidote. If the serum levels of methanol or ethylene glycol are greater than 20 mg/dL, antidote therapy should be started. Also, if there is a high suspicion of toxic alcohol poisoning and two of the following, fomepizole should be given: osmolar gap > 10 mOsm, arterial pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 20 mmol/L, or the presence of urinary oxalate crystals.
A sodium bicarbonate infusion should be started if the patient's arterial pH is less than 7.3 with a goal pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Hemodialysis can also be used in these patients. Indications for dialysis are pH < 7.25, changes in vision, kidney failure, electrolyte abnormalities not treated by conventional means, unstable hemodynamics, or a serum concentration > 50 mg/dL. If antidote therapy is begun early enough, dialysis can usually be avoided in ethylene glycol poisoning. Methanol is usually eliminated too slowly for fomepizole to be effective alone. Cofactors can also be administered to help with the conversion of toxic metabolites to non-toxic metabolites. For ethylene glycol, both thiamine and pyridoxine should be given. For methanol, folic acid or folinic acid should be given.
Isopropyl alcohol poisonings are usually treated supportively. The patient's CNS depression can be profound enough to require intubation. Also, proton pump inhibitors should be used if hemorrhagic gastritis is suspected. Hemodialysis can also be effective for these patients, but is usually reserved for patients with declining GCS or unstable vital signs.
Disposition
Now that you have successfully diagnosed and began treating your poisoned patient, what is their likely disposition? If their serum concentration is < 20 mg/dL and there are no signs of end organ damage with stable vital signs, the patient can be either admitted to a floor bed or watched in the emergency department for several hours. A repeat level should be drawn prior to discharge to make sure it is trending down. If the patient is acidotic or has end organ damage, ICU admission is appropriate. If toxic alcohol levels are not available at your hospital, a patient can be cleared after a few hours of observation if you have a low suspicion for toxic alcohol ingestion, they have a normal anion and osmolar gap, they have a normal pH, and they have improvement in their clinical picture. If hemodialysis or fomepizole are unavailable at your hospital, transfer to another hospital is appropriate.
Major Points
– Always have toxic alcohol ingestion in the differential when seeing an inebriated patient. Although rare, having a high clinical suspicion can help save lives. Obtain a thorough history from any and all persons involved.
– Methanol: byproducts cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. Effects of ingestion are inebriation (less so than ethanol, ethylene glycol, or isopropanol), Parkinsonism, transverse myelitis, and basal ganglia hemorrhages. Patients also might complain of “snowstorm” vision.
– Ethylene glycol: byproducts cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. Effects of ingestion are inebriation, coma, seizures, meningismus, muscle spasms, and paralysis of the extraocular muscles. Also causes tachycardia, hyperventilation, ARDS, and heart failure. One of the byproducts of breakdown combines with calcium to form crystals. These deposit in the kidney leading to kidney injury and can cause hypocalcemia with resulting QT prolongation.
– Isopropanol: most commonly ingested toxic alcohol but does not lead to metabolic acidosis. Effects of ingestion are severe inebriation, fruity smelling breath, and hemorrhagic gastritis.
– Obtain a BMP, ethanol level, lactate, serum osmolarity, and an ABG/VBG. A serum osmolar gap of >10-25 mOsm in the setting of an anion gap is highly suggestive of toxic alcohol exposure. Examine the urine for crystals.
– Call the poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 when toxic alcohol consumption is suspected. If suspicion is high enough, begin fomepizole administration prior to labs resulting as time equals tissue. Hemodialysis may ultimately be needed. Immediate transfer to another facility is warranted if fomepizole or hemodialysis are not available.

The hits just keep on coming at the embattled cloud human resources software provider Zenefits, as the California Department of Insurance has begun an investigation into its licensing practices.
The company, whose chief executive, Parker Conrad, resigned earlier this week, has faced a series of investigations into potentially criminal misconduct after a searing BuzzFeed investigative report late last year. BuzzFeed first reported the news earlier today.
At the heart of the investigation lies a tool called, benignly, “the Macro,” which allowed users to pad the hours they said they committed for pre-certification in the state of California. The brokers still had to take, and pass, a broker exam.
However, by not committing the allotted time to pre-licensing classes, several of the company's brokers in its biggest market of California could be disqualified.
“We are communicating and cooperating fully with regulators with regards to this issue that we discovered and self-reported to them,” Kenneth Baer, a Zenefits spokesperson, told TechCrunch.
David Sacks, the company's new chief executive, sent a memo to employees saying Zenefits intended to fully cooperate with the commissioner's investigation.
“We are committed to full remediation and ensuring complete compliance with all licensing requirements,” Sacks wrote in the internal memo provided to TechCrunch by a source.
The memo continues.
Many of our California sales representatives received access to a software tool called a “Macro” that may have allowed them to complete mandatory online pre-licensing education courses offered by a third-party test preparation provider in less than the legally required 52 total hours. The Macro functioned to keep a person logged into the course and prevented the person from being logged out for inactivity. The Macro did not advance through the required material or quizzes in the education course — the Macro only kept the person logged in. The Macro only pertained to the prelicensing education course and did not affect the broker exam taken later. Use of the Macro enabled — but did not cause — a person to spend less than the 52 hours of required time in the prelicensing course.
The company said it launched an internal investigation into the use of the Macro and, based on the results, had already informed the California Department of Insurance about it.
Further, the internal memo said the company has fired the leaders who created, propagated and encouraged the use of the Macro and that it will look to take additional disciplinary steps if necessary.
Needless to say, the use of Macro on the company's network or on company-issued devices has been disabled. And Zenefits is developing a new remediation and retraining program for licensed employees who used the Macro to get licensed in California in concert with the Department of Insurance.
A contrite Sacks said their company took full responsibility for its actions in the deployment of “the Macro”.
“We must be — and I know we can be — strictly compliant in being properly licensed, for the benefit of our customers and our regulators,” Sacks wrote in the email. “As I told you on Monday, in order for us to move forward as a company, we cannot seek to hide or downplay our broker licensing issues. We must be transparent and admit it and remediate it as soon as possible.”
Here's the full memo:
Former KLOL jock plans return to radio from home in Cypress
Mark Stevens and Jim Pruett Mark Stevens and Jim Pruett Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Former KLOL jock plans return to radio from home in Cypress 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Former KLOL-FM radio jock and current gun store owner Jim Pruett announced on Facebook Sunday that they and Colonel St. James will be returning to the airwaves within the month on a small FM station based near Cypress.
Cypress Radio, at 101.7 FM, is described as a low-power, non-profit FM stations that will service the Cypress area and be run on donations from the public.
Pruett said on Monday that they will be handling a 6-10 a.m. shift Monday through Friday, and that St. James will do afternoons 3-7 p.m.
Half of the legendary Stevens & Pruett duo, Pruett has been away from radio since 2004, when KLOL changed formats. They currently run Jim Pruett's Guns & Ammo off Huffmeister.
Oddly enough, they said they do more media now than ever before. They have a gun safety segment on CW39's "NewsFix" and is called upon often by other news outlets to speak on gun rights issues. They were inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame in 2003, just before KLOL signed off the Houston airwaves and shuffled off into radio lore.
They said they consider their Facebook page their real connection to fans, but this is their way of returning to their roots.
"The cool thing about it is that the area we will serve has about half a million people in it," they said.
The low-power station will have their antenna installed on a 400-foot tower in Rose Hill.
Programming will also be available to those online and through podcasting if they cannot listen live, as the limited power of the station limits its small reach out of Cypress.
Their partner at KLOL for more than a quarter-century, Mark Stevens, died in October 2011 from complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 76. Pruett said that they will be "channeling" Stevens as much as they can during their morning drive-time shifts.
Fans of KLOL can also expect Uncle Waldo and Eddie "The Boner" Sanchez to make guest appearances.
St. James was let go from Clear Channel when 93.7 The Arrow changed from a classic-rock format and turned into an urban hip-hop station late last year. He's been a mainstay on Houston rock radio for decades, dating back to a blues show they hosted on KUHF-FM in 1973.
"I couldn't be happier to be a part of this," St. James said on Monday. "I get to play the music I love and work with Jim Pruett again."
Pruett said Monday that they are still waiting on equipment to arrive so they can begin broadcasting from their home. Rick Calvert, who applied for the FCC license a few years back, will most likely have a nighttime shift. There is no one slotted for midday yet.
"They granted the license to Calvert to play rock music and serve the community," said Pruett. "The FCC created these stations because radio wasn't serving the community the way it should have been."
Calvert said Thurday that 101.7's community of license is in the city of Cypress.
As for the format of their shift, Pruett said few genres will be off the table, with a mixture of classic rock, obscure cuts, and some outlaw country. There will be an emphasis on listener interaction as well.
The Queen of Pop reigns again with 'Living for Love,' tying with George Strait, the King of Country, for the most leaders on a single Billboard chart.
Madonna makes Billboard chart history, as they earn their 44th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs, where "Living for Love" lifts 2-1. (The ranking, dated March 7, will refresh on Billboard.com on Thursday, Feb. 26.)
With the coronation, Madonna equals George Strait, who's logged 44 No. 1s on Hot Country Songs, for the most leaders ever by an act on a singular Billboard chart.
It's fitting history for the artists also known, respectively, and reverently, as the Queen of Pop and the King of Country.
With their 44th leading title on Dance Club Songs, which measures report submitted by a national sample of club DJs, Madonna pulls further ahead of runners-up Beyonce and Rihanna. In fact, Madonna has tallied as many No. 1s as they have combined: 22 each. (The chart launched as a national survey in the Billboard issue dated Aug. 28, 1976.)
Madonna, who performed "Love" at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 8, matches Strait's esteemed honor, with the latter icon having stood at the Hot Country Songs summit with 44 smashes between 1982 and 2009. They first reigned with "Fool Hearted Memory" (Aug. 28, 1982) and most recently ruled with "River of Love" (April 18, 2009.)
"Love" introduces Madonna's 13th studio album, Rebel Heart, due March 10.
Madonna On New 'Rebellious and Romantic' Music, Demo Leaks, 'Possibly' Crashing the Grammys and the 'Crazy' Sony Hack
"The reason I wanted to call the record Rebel Heart was because I felt like it explored two very distinct sides of my personality," Madonna told Billboard's Keith Caulfield in December. "The rebellious, renegade side of me, and the romantic side of me."
Specifically of the house music-infused "Love," the ever-youthful Material Girl similarly said, "It's kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together."
Looking ahead, all Madonna needs is one more leader, perhaps also from Rebel Heart, to pass Strait and claim vaunted chart history -- 45 No. 1s on one ranking -- all to herself.
For now, at least, Madonna and Strait make for unparalleled Billboard chart royalty.
Further, the ascension to No. 1 for "Living for Love" brings Madonna's total of No. 1s on published, currents-based Billboard music charts to 173. (That number includes multiple No. 1 rankings for individual songs. For example, "Take a Bow" hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, Radio Songs and Pop Songs. So, it adds four No. 1s to their overall tally.)
Here is an updated look at Madonna's 44 Dance Club Songs No. 1s, beginning with the double-sided single "Holiday"/"Lucky Star," which reached the top the week of Sept. 24, 1983. You'll notice that one of their No. 1s is an entire album: You Can Dance (1988), a collection of mostly remixes of previously released songs (and one new cut, "Spotlight"). Prior to Feb. 23, 1991, the chart wasn't always song-specific and full albums were, at some points, allowed to chart.
(For titles that spent multiple weeks at No. 1, total frames in the lead are noted in parentheses.)
1983, "Holiday"/"Lucky Star" (five weeks at No. 1)
1984, "Like a Virgin" (three)
1985, "Material Girl"
1985, "Angel"/"Into the Groove"
1987, "Open Your Heart"
1987, "Causing a Commotion (Remix)"
1988, You Can Dance (LP Cuts)

panic over Pope Francis yet again. JoAnna Wahlund grabs them by the shoulders as they scream incoherently like a little girl with a spider on their blouse, and talks them down. Turns out Pope Francis is pretty much saying, you know, what the Church has always said about the possible salvation of non-believers.
It also turns out that compared to some Popes…
Pope Stephen VI (896–897), who had their predecessor Pope Formosus exhumed, tried, de-fingered, briefly reburied, and thrown in the Tiber.
Pope John XII (955–964), who gave land to a mistress, murdered several people, and was killed by a man who caught them in bed with their wife.
Pope Benedict IX (1032–1044, 1045, 1047–1048), who “sold” the Papacy
Pope Boniface VIII (1294–1303), who is lampooned in Dante's Divine Comedy
Pope Urban VI (1378–1389), who complained that they did not hear enough screaming when Cardinals who had conspired against them were tortured.
Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503), a Borgia, who was guilty of nepotism and whose unattended corpse swelled until it could barely fit in a coffin.
Pope Leo X (1513–1521), a spendthrift member of the Medici family who once spent 1/7 of their predecessors' reserves on a single ceremony
Pope Clement VII (1523–1534), also a Medici, whose power-politicking with France, Spain, and Germany got Rome sacked.
…a Pope who says thanks to Mary with a beachball, washes a Muslim girl's feet and takes a spin in a Renault is not really that big of a deal.
I'm coming to think that the principal reason Reactionaries loathe Francis (as they loathed John Paul II and loathe the Council and loathe what the Church calls the *Ordinary* Form of the Mass) is that Reactionaries loathe the Church's missionary imperative. Not Traditionalists, mind you–Reactionaries. What ties everything in Reactionary culture together better than any other theory I've been able to come up with is that it's not that Reactionaries think the Church is evangelizing wrong and want to do it better. It's that they hate the whole idea of bringing new people into the Church at all (except for a vanishingly small sample of like-minded Reactionaries) and seem to be bent on making sure as few are allowed in and as many are driven away as possible.
It explains the loathing of the New Evangelization.
It explains the contempt for World Youth Day.
It explains the contempt for converts.
It explains the constant drumbeat demand for excommunicating as many people as possible.
It explains the disgust with anybody who “sounds like a Protestant”, not on theological issues but merely on cultural buzzwords and shibboleths.
It explains the contempt for the popularity of Francis and John Paul and the fact that many ordinary people–believer and non-believer–found and find them deeply attractive.
It explains the Reactionary tendency to treat the sacraments, not as our surest encounters with the love of God, but as reducing valves whose principal function is to keep as many people as possible out of the kingdom of heaven
It explains the everlasting tendency to sneer at any mention of love as Kumbayah Catholicism and to perpetually appeal to Jesus cleasing the Temple as their main way of relating to the rest of the Church
It explains how rather sensible attempts to reach out to people outside the Catholic communion and to speak in terms comprehensible to them are so routinely greeted by Reactionaries as betrayals of the Faith and compromises with the world and all the rest of it.
The one and only time I ever run across Reactionaries speaking of evangelization is when it is used as an excuse for attacking the Pope. So, for instance, recently there were screams in the comboxes over at Jimmy Akin's blog because the Pope, being a Latin of the old school, bowed to a Muslim woman as a gesture of courtesy! More bedwetting panic! By this gesture they were betraying the faith! They might as well just convert St. Peter's into a mosque right this second! Why isn't they evangelizing them by telling them they and their disgusting co-religionists are all going to burn in hell?
This is the Reactionary notion of “evangelization”: threatening people with hell as a conversation starter. And it only comes up in order to bash Francis for not grabbing a teenage Muslim girl by the lapels and chewing them out, but rather washing their filthy infidel feet. Beyond that, you never hear of evangelization in Reactionary circles. You hear instead the repeated appeal to something Benedict never said: that we need to shrink the Church and make it purer.
What Benedict actually said was that the Church goes through natural cycles when people leave for various reasons such as persecution, spiritual laziness, apostasy, etc. Somehow Reactionaries take that as a mandate to drive out the people who screw up their private vision of the Church of Pure and Perfect Liturgy. Evangelization screws up that private vision because it constantly calls into the Church, not just Reactionaries, but every oddball, factory reject, weirdo, loser, jerk, and incorrigibly average person in the world. Such people screw up the system by not getting with the Reactionary program of recreating an imaginary past when everything was perfect. Many of them (such as Yr. Obdt. Svt.) have no burning interest in the EF and actually prefer the OF if you have our druthers, though are grateful for any Masss Holy Church offers. And we want very much for as many people–ordinary folk–to become Catholic, warts and all.
And so, curiously, I find that the people in the Church who tend to draw most of the Reactionary fire and the bitterest hostility are not the Pelosis or Bidens or Catholics for a Free Choice people. It's not John Dominic Crossan with their Jesus eaten by wild dogs or Dan Maguire, theologian apologist for abortion.
Rather, the bulk of Reactionary hostility, in my experience, is directed at the Karl Keatings, Scott Hahns, Fr. Robert Barrons, Jimmy Akins, Tim Staples, Al Krestas, Pat Madrids, Patrick Coffins, EWTNs, and various evangelization apostolates, not at the people who are trying to tear the Church down and remake it as either the Episcopal Church or as a branch office of Planned Parenthood.
Why? Because those people are bringing in new Catholics! And new Catholics screw up the Reactionary dream of the perfect Church with perfect liturgy.
If you've got a better explanation for Reactionary behavior, I'm all ears. But as near as I can tell a huge amount of the loathing directed at Pope Francis fits this theory very well. Reactionaries don't loathe Francis despite the fact that they are an enormously attractive evangelical witness. The loathe them because they are an enormously attractive evangelical witness.
That's the premise of new research by Adam Millard-Ball, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. They use game theory to suggest that autonomous vehicles could benefit pedestrians by being more responsive to their behavior. “In most urban areas, pedestrians have many more rights than they actually assert,” says Millard-Ball—for example, they don't always cross when they've got the light, fearing a collision. Once self-driving cars arrive en masse, walkers might be more even assertive than laws generally permit.
Currently, most roads in the U.S. are designed around the needs of drivers, making them inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst for walkers and cyclists. With more vehicles on the roads, pedestrian fatalities are surging nationwide. You've already heard that autonomous vehicles stand to make streets much, much safer by putting a computer fully in charge of the split-second road-reactions that human drivers so routinely flub. They might also succeed in upending an age-old vehicular hierarchy: In a world where most cars are driving themselves, pedestrians could reign supreme.
Millard-Ball's paper looks especially closely at the game of “crosswalk chicken” that human-driven cars and pedestrians often play: In the vast majority of states, pedestrians are supposed to be able to cross at all intersections, whether or not there's a marked crosswalk, “but you'd be silly to try and assert your right in front of a car, because often drivers don't realize it's a crosswalk, and even where there are some lines on street, drivers' observance is often in the breach,” they say. So pedestrians usually end up the defense, watching for traffic before timidly lifting a foot off the sidewalk.
But with all the evidence that robots will drive far more safely and with greater adherence to the law than people, pedestrians' incentives around safety will change. They may simply cross when they want to, confident that the vigilant AVs won't touch them. Following that conclusion, Millard-Ball suggests that pedestrians may also be more empowered to jaywalk. Kids may play in the streets (like the olden days!). And cyclists may be more confident to “take the lane” and ride on streets without special bike lanes.
What will all of this freewheeling foot-and-bike movement lead to? Well, humans could essentially muscle their way onto the streets and slow vehicular traffic in urban centers. That might be a great thing if you think cities should never have had cars in them in the first place; transportation planners could respond to this new paradigm by engineering lower-traffic streets explicitly aimed at shared use, such as “woonerfs”—Euro-style, single-plane roadways used by peds, bikes, strollers, and cars alike. Existing walk-friendly planning policies would be reinforced.
Story highlights Shooting followed a dispute between an ex-employee and manager at a fitness club
The gunfire sent shoppers running for cover, witnesses say
(CNN) A former employee at a Florida gym opened fire on former co-workers during a dispute Saturday, leaving two people dead, officials said.
The shootings at the Equinox Fitness Club at the upscale Shops at Merrick Park mall in Coral Gables occurred after an argument between Abeku Wilson, the former employee, and Janine Ackerman, the general manager, police said.
Wilson was fired from the club on Saturday and escorted off the property. They later returned with a handgun, killing Ackerman, 35, and fitness manager Marios Hortis, 42. Another victim was critically wounded, police said.
Wilson, 33, then turned the gun on themselves and died at the scene, police said.
"Our sense of loss is too profound for words," the club said in a statement on Sunday.

To provide transparency into our ongoing efforts to protect your privacy and security on the Internet, we are releasing a security audit of Firefox Accounts (FxA) that Cure53 conducted last fall. At Mozilla, we sponsor security audits of core open source software underpinning the Web and Internet, recently relaunched our web bug bounty program, find and fix vulnerabilities ourselves, and open source our code for anyone to review. Despite being available to more reviewers, open source software is not necessarily reviewed more thoroughly or frequently than closed source software, and the extra attention from third party reviewers can find outstanding issues and vulnerabilities. To augment our other initiatives and improve the overall security of our web services, we engage third party organizations to audit the security and review the code of specific services.
As Firefox's central authentication service FxA is a natural first target. Its security is critical to millions of users who rely on it to authenticate with our most sensitive services, such as addons.mozilla.org and Sync. Cure53 ran a comprehensive security audit that encompassed the web services powering FxA and the cryptographic protocol used to protect user accounts and data. They identified 15 issues, none of which were exploited or put user data at risk.
We thank Cure53 for reviewing FxA and increasing our trust in the backbone of Firefox's identity system. The audit is a step toward providing higher quality and more secure services to our users, which we will continue to improve through our various security initiatives. In the rest of this blog post, we discuss the technical details of the four highest severity issues. The report is available here and you can sign up or log into Firefox Accounts on your desktop or mobile device at: https://accounts.firefox.com/signup
FXA-01-001 HTML injection via unsanitized FxA relier Name
The one issue Cure53 ranked as critical, FXA-01-001 HTML injection via unsanitized FxA relier Name, resulted from displaying the name of a relier without HTML escaping on the relier registration page. This issue was not exploitable from outside Mozilla, because the endpoint for registering new reliers is not open to the public. A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) blocked most Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) on the page, but an attacker could still exfiltrate sensitive authentication data via scriptless attacks and deface or repurpose the page for phishing. To fix the vulnerability soon after Cure53 reported it to us, we updated the template language to escape all variables and use an explicit naming convention for unescaped variables. Third party relier names are now sanitized and escaped.
FXA-01-004 XSS via unsanitized Output on JSON Endpoints
The first of three issues ranked high, FXA-01-004 XSS via unsanitized Output on JSON Endpoints, affected legacy browsers handling JSON endpoints with user controlled fields in the beginning of the response. For responses like the following:
{ "id": "81730c8682f1efa5", "name": "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>", "trusted": false, "image_uri": "", "redirect_uri": "javascript:alert(1)" }
an attacker could set the name or redirect_uri such that legacy browsers sniff the initial bytes of a response, incorrectly guess the MIME type as HTML instead of JSON, and execute user defined scripts. We added the HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (XCTO) to disable MIME type sniffing, and wrote middleware and patches for the web frameworks to unicode escape <, >, and & characters in JSON responses.
FXA-01-014 Weak client-side Key Stretching
The second issue with a high severity ranking, FXA-01-014 Weak client-side Key Stretching, is “a tradeoff between security and efficiency”. The onepw protocol threat model includes an adversary capable of breaking or bypassing TLS. Consequently, we run 1,000 iterations of PBKDF2 on user devices to avoid sending passwords directly to the server, which runs a further 216 scrypt iterations on the PBKDF2-stretched password before storing it. Cure53 recommended storing PBKDF2 passwords with a higher work factor of roughly 256,000 iterations, but concluded “an exact recommendation on the number of iterations cannot be supplied in this instance”. To keep performance acceptable on less powerful devices, we have not increased the work factor yet.
FXA-01-010 Possible RCE if Application is run in a malicious Path
The final high severity issue, FXA-01-010 Possible RCE if Application is run in a malicious Path, affected people running FxA web servers from insecure paths in development mode. The servers exposed an endpoint that executes shell commands to determine the release version and git commit they're running in development mode. For example, the command below returns the current git commit:
var gitDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', '.git') var cmd = util.format('git --git-dir=%s rev-parse HEAD', gitDir) exec(cmd, …)
Cure53 noted malicious commands like rm -rf * in the directory path __dirname global would be executed and recommended filtering and quoting parameters. We modified the script to use the cwd option and avoid filtering the parameter entirely:
var cmd = 'git rev-parse HEAD' exec(cmd, { env: { GIT_CONFIG: gitDir } } ...)
Mozilla does not run servers from insecure paths, but some users host their own FxA services and it is always good to consider malicious input from all sources.
We reviewed the higher ranked issues from the report, circumstances limiting their impact, and how we fixed and addressed them. We invite you to contribute to developing Firefox Accounts and report security issues through our bug bounty program as we continue to improve the security of Firefox Accounts and other core services.
8,000 Years Ago, 17 Women Reproduced for Every One Man.
Most women shared a few men, and the rest of the men just died without children. So male celibacy became a structured part of human society. You can find religions espousing the virtues of celibacy for men by becoming priests and monks. Nuns are fewer in number.
Another consequence of the low Y-chromosomal diversity in our species is the oldest profession in our species: prostitution. The market for men who pay for sex has always been high because of men who had been deprived of sex.
It is also easy to mobilize men into war if there is a promise of women from foreign lands. It was also easy to mobilize men to support political and social institutions which enforced monogamy because that brought with it the hope of getting laid.
In modernity, thanks to industrialization, skilled labor became necessary, which made 20-year long training of children necessary through education. Education delays employment, which delays the return-on-investment in children, which leads to people having fewer children, and that frees up women to become financially independent, which leads to marriages not being based on economic necessity but on sentiment and that leads to more divorces initiated by women and alternate sexual lifestyles like polyamory. Delayed employment of children also delays marriage which leads to pre-marital promiscuity. Fewer children also create labor shortages which need to be solved using immigration which is justified using multiculturalism.
So essentially all human social behaviors and institutions stem from human sexuality and reproductive patterns. No wonder the ancient traditions are so anal about regulating human sexuality.

The European Union won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 because of its “six decade-long contribution to peace and human rights in Europe”. In 2015, as the UK gears up towards its referendum on EU membership, we hear very often that the EU played a key role in building peace after World War II. For all its faults, the argument goes, the European Union is the best peace project Europe has.
There are three reasons why this is wrong. The first is that European integration contributed very little to the building of peace in post-war Europe. The second is that the EU's record in keeping the peace on its external borders is poor. The third is that the Euro has aggravated conflicts between the members of the Eurozone: between north and south, creditor and debtor, exporter and importer.
It may seem crazy to suggest that the EU is not a peace project. This is, after all, its founding narrative. But history suggests otherwise for two reasons.
One is that in the late 1940s and 1950s there were many more powerful forces leading to peace in Europe. The shift from warfare to welfare states, made possible by the class compromise put in place after World War II, was crucial. European cooperation was really just an extension of that deeper change in European societies. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was intended to extend welfare provision to farmers.
Central to post-war peace in Europe was also the Cold War and the support given to Western Europe by the United States. Most important of all was the post-war boom. After the war, people wanted a better life and it was to their own governments that they turned.
Another reason is that the EU of today has little to do with European cooperation in the 1950s. Today's EU has more recent roots. The Coal and Steel Community was a cartel intended to make European steel production more competitive and give the French access to West German coal. This initiative was quickly overcome by the economic success that raised demand for coal and steel. By 1957, it was quietly folded into the Treaty of Rome.
The aim of the Treaty of Rome was to soften the effects of economic success. Growing economies push up wages and prices, which makes imports cheaper and leads to repeated balance of payments problems. Look at Britain's Stop-Go economic experience of the 1950s and 1960s. A common external tariff, which raised the prices of imports, was Western Europe's answer to this problem.
Today's EU has its roots in economic crisis, not in economic success. Its history takes us back to the 1970s and the end of the post-war consensus. Governments sought many ways to exit this crisis and eventually settled on European market integration (the Single European Act) plus fiscal consolidation through more robust external rules (the Maastricht Treaty). This takes us to the EU and the euro of today.
Groundhog Europe
The European Union has not been very successful at promoting peace beyond its own borders. The EU does have a foreign policy but it is stuck in a time loop.
If one goes back 20 years to 1995, the kinds of questions being raised about Europe's role in promoting peace related to whether it would speak with one voice. This was the time of the Yugoslav war when European divisions meant that the United States got heavily involved in the Balkans. People wondered if the EU would finally become not just an economic giant but a political one, too. People described 1995 as a crossroads and a watershed moment.
Fast forward to 2005 and the very same clichés are being used. Two years after the US invasion of Iraq had divided Europe, people asked when it would speak with one voice. The EU was again at a crossroads. This was two years after the EU's first Security Strategy, intended to give Europe a sense of direction in foreign policy.
Today, we hear much the same thing and Europeans are once again drafting a new security strategy. The war in Ukraine led commentators to lament the divisions between EU member states. The rise of Islamic State in the Middle East has made people wonder if the EU will ever become a regional power or whether it will always have a “lowest common denominator” foreign policy.
As in the film Groundhog Day, where Bill Murray is stuck in a time loop, the European Union is forced to relive its foreign policy frustrations time and time again. Groundhog Day has a Hollywood-style happy ending; the EU may not be so lucky.
The euro versus democracy
The euro was meant to lead to convergence in Europe. It was expected that a single currency would lead to harmonisation of national business cycles. Instead, the buzzword amongst economists is heterogeneity.
The euro has created new divisions but it has also cemented older ones. It has exaggerated the differences between productive and unproductive national economies. It has heightened intra-Eurozone competition. New divisions between debtors and creditors have broken out. There is no single European economy, just very different national economies. More than ever before, the economic map of Europe looks like it did in the 19th century when advanced northern societies complained about the “backwardness” of southern and eastern Europe.
A solution to this is to build a political union with fiscal powers. Transfers from rich to poor parts of Europe would iron out today's enormous gaps. There is no political appetite for this anywhere, neither among elites nor among domestic publics. As a result, the survival of the Eurozone seems set against national democracy. Few accept this at present but the euro and national democracy may be incompatible.
We are right to ask if Europe can keep the peace. The answer is “no”. Peace in Europe owes much to other factors and the EU has done little to build peace beyond its borders. Peace within Europe has become fragile as the euro unleashes competitive pressures that pit national economies against one another.

Every time the Israeli lobbyists in the United States demand more money or more special legal protections, they wave about these so-called "Neo-nazi" or "White Supremacist" groups like Stormfront and the American Nazi Party. AIPAC, ADL, JDL, and their ilk raise tons of money by waving these boogie-men around as a real imminent threat and danger! Yet no matter what laws get passed and no matter how many millions ADL, JDL, etc. raise, Stormfront and the American Nazi Party remain strangely unmolested by either criminal or civil actions. How very strange!!! So, earlier today, the Commander of the American Nazi Party, one Bill White, posted an article on the official American Nazis website an article accusing rising Presidential candidate Ron Paul of being a "Secret" White Supremacist. Now, one might suppose that the American Nazi party would be happy to have a candidate who shares their views, and one might assume that Bill White is smart enough to know that making such a public accusation is going to be quite harmful to the candidate they claim shares their philosophy. Indeed it does appear that Bill White's accusation is intended to cause as much harm to Ron Paul as possible. Of course, Bill White's claim did not do much more than incite a great deal of laughter. But in their haste to get this message out, one of Bill's minions slipped up. Rather than cut and paste the text of Bill's accusations, one of the members of Bill's blog, apparently to prove the story's source, screen captured Bill's article, posted it to various newsgroups and in doing so, let slip a rather interesting secret. Here is that screen capture. Click for full size image. Note the tiny little icon indicated by the arrow in the Windows toolbar. It's a megaphone. But not just ANY Megaphone, it is the icon proving that the member of Bill White's American Nazi group is ALSO a member of Megaphone, the Israeli propaganda communications network! Here is what the Megaphone looks like when it is running. More about Megaphone can be found at Wikipedia and more about Bill White and their many fronts can be found HERE. But what we have here is what appears to be a group of self-proclaimed NeoNazis using the Israeli propaganda network! ... which goes a long way to explaining why they are never arrested or sued by those groups that raise so much money using them as scarecrows!

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's national energy regulator has halted construction on a new TransCanada Corp natural gas pipeline after reviewing evidence that it may have spilled a toxic drilling fluid into a major Western Canadian river, a spokesperson said on Friday.
The National Energy Board (NEB) said it issued a safety order on Thursday after reviewing records submitted by TransCanada related to four separate spills of drilling fluid into the Athabasca River, a waterway in northern Alberta. In a separate move earlier in November, the U.S. administration rejected TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline project.
A TransCanada subcontractor caused the spills in Alberta while drilling to install a natural gas pipeline under the river, said company spokesperson Mark Cooper. They explained that the drilling fluids consisted of bentonite clay and water, which they said would not pose an issue for humans or wildlife and would be dispersed quickly in the rapidly flowing water.
“We are working with the regulators and government agencies, and will not resume drilling before they approve our ongoing plans,” said Cooper. “We will be presenting additional information to the NEB shortly to respond to questions they have raised.”
The NEB said the spills occurred between Oct. 23 and Nov. 7 on the McDermott Extension, a natural gas pipeline under construction by a TransCanada subsidiary, north of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray.
NEB spokesperson Darin Barter said the regulator is now awaiting lab results to determine whether the fluids used were toxic. They said that companies were not supposed to be using toxic additives during this type of drilling.
“We obtained material over the last several days that called that into question that maybe the company used additives in that fluid that were toxic,” Barter said in an interview. “So that was the impetus for the inspection officer order and the formalization of (asking them) to halt all operations on the site.”
Barter said the NEB also informed the federal fisheries and environment departments about the incidents. They added that the NEB was leading the investigation but did not immediately have inspectors on the site.
The investigation comes as TransCanada pursues efforts to promote its proposed Energy East pipeline project that, if approved, would transport up to 1.1 million barrels a day of crude from Alberta across the country to Eastern Canadian refineries and the Atlantic coast.
You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters
— Everyone knows the pecking order in a family has everything to do with age. The oldest sibling usually rules the roost. But what if you get cheated out of the title because of Daylight Saving Time?
Peter Sullivan Cirioli was dubbed "Baby A" at WakeMed Cary when they arrived early Sunday morning.
“Yes, Peter was born first, it was at 1:32 a.m.,” mother Laura Cirioli said.
Thirty-four minutes later, Peter's twin sister, Allison Raye Cirioli, known as "Baby B," made their entrance into the world.
Because of Daylight Saving Time, Allison's time of birth was 1:06 a.m., which makes them 26 minutes older than their brother even though they were born first.
“We just never even thought about it until after they were born and then we realized it was going to happen. It was really kind of amazing,” Laura Cirioli said.
The proud mother and father said they don't really care who was born first, they are just glad to have two healthy babies. They do suspect the daylight savings predicament will be fodder for sibling rivalry.
“We'll let them work that out between themselves. I don't want to get into the middle of it,” Jason Cirioli said.
Peter and Allison were expected to leave the hospital Tuesday night.
Last week, when I accepted an invitation to go on Hugh Hewitt's nationally syndicated talk show, their first question to me was, “So how does it feel to be the author of a book about the VA that has been thoroughly discredited?”
Well, yes, as the author of the title Best Care Anywhere, Why VA Health Care would be Better for Everyone, it's been dispiriting to have it confirmed by a preliminary inspector general's report that some frontline VA employees in Phoenix and elsewhere have been gaming a key performance metric regarding wait times. But what's really has me enervated is how the dominant media narrative of the VA “scandal” has become so essentially misleading and damaging to the cause of health care delivery system reform.
I don't mean just the fulminations of the right wing press. It's nothing new when Fox rolls out Ollie North to proclaim that any real or reported failure of the VA is proof of the case against socialized medicine.
I'm also talking about the work of hard-working and earnest reporters, who is a due to a combination insufficient background knowledge and the conventions of Washington scandal coverage, wind up giving the public a fundamentally false idea of how well the VA is performing as an institution. Over the next several days, I plan to make a series of posts here at Political Animal that I hope will be helpful to those covering the story, or for those who are just trying to get the full context for forming an opinion.
Today, let's just start by scrutinizing the now almost universal assumption that there is a “systemic” problem at VA hospitals with excessive wait times. Even progressives, including the likes of Jon Stewart and Bill Maher, seem predisposed to believe this for their different reasons. Some voices, like my former colleague Brian Beutler of The New Republic, even speculate that the scandal may ultimately bounce in a way that harms the Republicans more than it does the Democrats.
But before we go there, can we get clear on just what the underlying reality is? There is, to be sure, a systemic backlog of vets of all ages trying to establish eligibility for VA health care. This is due to absurd laws passed by Congress, which reflect on all us, that make veterans essentially prove that they are “worthy” of VA treatment (about which more later). But this backlog often gets confused with the entirely separate issue of whether those who get into system face wait times that are longer than what Americans enrolled in non-VA health care plans generally must endure.
Just what do we know about how crowded VA hospitals are generally? Here's a key relevant fact that is just the opposite of what most people think. For all the wars we've been fighting, the veterans population has been falling sharply (pdf). Nationwide, their number fell by 17 percent between 2000 and 2014, primarily due to the passing of the huge cohorts of World War II- and Korea War-era vets. The decline has been particularly steep in California and throughout much of New England, the Mid-Atlantic and industrial Midwest, where the fall off has ranged between 21 percent and 36.7 percent.
Reflecting this decline, as well a general trend toward more outpatient services, many VA hospitals in these areas, including flagship facilities, want for nothing except sufficient numbers of patients to maintain their long-term viability. I have visited VA hospitals around the county and often been unnerved by how empty they are. When I visited two of the VA's four state-of-the-art, breathtakingly advanced polytrauma units, in Palo Alto and Minneapolis, there was hardly a patient to be found.
But at the same time there is a comparatively small countertrend that results from large migrations of aging veterans from the Rust Belt and California to lower-cost retirement centers in the Sun Belt. And this flow, combined with more liberal eligibility standards that allow more Vietnam vets to receive VA treatment for such chronic conditions as ischemic heart disease and Parkinson's, means that in some of these areas, such as, Phoenix, VA capacity is indeed under significant strain.
This regional imbalance in capacity relatively to demand makes it very difficult to manage the VA with system-wide performance metrics. Setting a benchmark of 14 days to see a new primary care doc at a VA hospital or clinic in Boston or Northern California may be completely reasonable. But trying to do the same in Phoenix and in a handful of other sunbelt retirement meccas is not workable without Congress ponying up for building more capacity there.
Once you have this background, it becomes easy to understand certain anomalies in this scandal. If care is really so bad, for example, why did all the major veterans services remain unanimous in recent testimony before Congress in their long-stranding praise for the quality of VA health care? And why have they remained stalwart in defending the VA against its many ideological enemies who want to see it privatized? It's because, by and large, VA care is as good, if not better than what vets can find outside the system, including by such metrics as wait times.
Similarly, if VA care were not generally very good, the VA would not continue to rank extraordinarily high in independent surveys of patient satisfaction. Recently discharged VA hospital patients for example, rate their experience 4 points higher than the average (pdf) for the health care industry as a whole. Fully 96 percent say they would turn to VA inpatient care again.
Now if you go out looking for vets who say they have been victimized by the VA, you will have no trouble finding them, and many will be justified in their complaints. But as I'll argue further in future posts, the key question to ask when confronting the real deficiencies of the VA is “compared to what?” Once that context is established, it becomes clear that VA as a whole continues to outperform the rest of the American health system, making its true lessons extremely important to learn.
Weak border bill threatens to undermine GOP's wall promises
The GOP-controlled Congress took a step forward in keeping its immigration promises to the American people with broader interior enforcement. However, it needs to catch up to the same level of strength when it comes to border security.
Moreover, they need to demonstrate that, unlike during last Congress, they are actually serious about getting bicameral support and not just allow it to die in committee.
The Davis-Oliver Act, introduced in the current session by Reps. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, and Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., is a game-changer for empowering law enforcement to protect our sovereignty. An identical bill passed the House Judiciary Committee during last Congress, and passed again this Thursday.
Long decried as a “mass deportation” measure by its detractors, the bill is focused on interior enforcement of America's immigration laws.
It does such things as strip the ability of the president to get around immigration enforcement, beefs up ICE's detention and deportation powers, deputizes states to enforce immigration laws, bolsters expedited deportations, expands requirements to deport criminal aliens, defunds sanctuary cities, and imposes measures to better prevent and address visa overstays.
You might call it “comprehensive immigration reform” — except, in this instance, that label would be accurate.
The bill is named after two California law enforcement officers who were slain by an illegal immigrant, and enjoys the support of both the National Sheriffs' Association and the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers, according to The Daily Caller.
The Davis-Oliver Act's political history also makes it an important one. The bill was marked up in the previous congressional session but never made it to the House floor. Trump made it a core campaign promise when they mentioned it by name in their landmark Arizona speech on immigration – and honored the widows of its slain namesakes in their joint address to Congress in February.
“The Davis-Oliver Act is a meaningful interior enforcement bill that gives federal, state, and local law enforcement the tools they need to remove illegal aliens from the interior of the country,” Dave Ray, communications director for Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), tells Conservative Review.
“If this bill becomes law, it will prevent future administrations from creating the lawless environment that was rampant under the Obama administration where meaningful interior enforcement was gutted and tens of thousands of criminal aliens freely roamed the streets of our nation.”
This bill will help confront many of the challenges in immigration enforcement. At present, less than 1 percent of those overstaying their visas are deported. Moreover, as we've noted ad nauseum at CR, the courts have become an impediment to deporting even criminal aliens. This bill tightens up a lot of statutes and will make it hard for courts to exploit loopholes and invalidate deportations.
Among some of the other provisions of the Davis-Oliver bill:
Overturns the Zadvydas v. Davis Supreme Court case that Obama has used as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention
Explicitly deputizes the states to enforce federal immigration law
Eliminates sanctuary cities by cutting off DHS and DOJ law enforcement grants
Expedites deportation of gang members
Applies the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving
Clamps down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported
Meanwhile, things aren't looking so good for the GOP's imminent border bill — at least for now. Reports say Texas Republicans Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Mike McCaul have been working on border security legislation in recent days, drawing fire from immigration hawks.
It's “the same stuff they've been peddling for a long time, which doesn't have any teeth in it,” FAIR spokesperson Ira Melhman told Breitbart News. “This was what they were trying to sell [in 2013] to make the ‘Gang of Eight' more palatable to the public.”
The bill is still in the drafting stages, and currently being looked over by DHS officials. However, Conservative Review was able to obtain a draft copy of the legislation.
The Cornyn-McCaul bill contains several provisions to increase border security by increasing resources to federal agencies and courts that handle border enforcement and deportations, while defunding sanctuary cities and stiffening penalties for criminal aliens.
However, critics of the Cornyn-McCaul bill, like Center for Immigration Studies' Jessica Vaughan, say the measure doesn't go far enough. Vaughan says that the policies contained in the legislation are merely “tinkering around the margins” of America's greater immigration problem.
“I can't help but wonder if it is designed to be combined with an amnesty,” Vaughan told Breitbart News earlier this week. “It would be the typical kind of ‘Grand Bargain' offer of some enforcement with a massive amnesty and possibly other kinds of [foreign worker] visa programs.”
Most notable among the Cornyn-McCaul bill's shortcomings is that it contains no provisions for a border wall or fence, despite being focused on border security. It would likely weaken current law, which was a key concern Conservative Review pointed out the last time McCaul tried to pass a similar bill in 2015.
In fact, this bill could even hurt the prospect of physical border security more than help it. As we pointed out after the GOP's latest budget buckling, according to Congressional Research Service analysis, no new law is needed to put a border fence in place; Congress simply needs to fund its original mandate from 2006.
Without concrete measures to fund the construction of any new barriers, this bill – as with McCaul's last one – threatens to serve as a legislative pacifier for the next time congressional Republicans fail to appropriate funds for border construction (as they've done for over a decade).
Additionally, the proposed measure currently lacks key enforcement reforms that would address the illicit employment of those lacking legal status.
“There's not a single thing about work-site enforcement or anything at all against employers,” Vaughan told The Washington Post, noting that it lacks a nationwide employment verification system to check legal statuses, and is void of any sanctions against employers who hire illegal immigrants.
Finally, it's weak on visa overstays, which make up a greater share of our illegal population than border crossings. While it contains some entry-exit provisions and bars future benefits for illegals on expired visas, similar current provisions on the books have proven to have little to no effect on overstays.
“When someone decides to overstay a visa, they are motivated by the prospect of getting a job and being able to get away with staying in the United States,” Vaughan explained to Conservative Review, via email.
“They don't care if that means that someday in the future they might not get a green card if by some remote chance someone might sponsor them. They think it's more likely that there will be an amnesty anyway.”
But despite all the reservations about Cornyn-McCaul's, immigration enforcement opponents are already sharpening the knives for the legislation.
A headline at Newsweek points out that the goal is to “punish border crossers,” while another story at left-leaning Vocativ fixates itself on one proposed provision of the legislation that would fit illegals under deportation proceedings with ankle bracelets.
“It's absolutely disgusting,” immigration attorney David Leopold tells Vocativ. “It smacks of the darkest days of the 20th century and some of the world's most oppressive regimes. These lawmakers should be ashamed of themselves.”
These characterizations should come as no surprise; any effort to enforce America's immigration laws draws such comparisons, whether the bill actually keeps GOP promises or not.
As stated before, the drafting process isn't finished, as DHS and other advocacy groups are still offering insight, which means that these shortcomings could very well be addressed before the bill is formally introduced.
“A rough draft of the Cornyn-McCaul bill exists,” said FAIR's Dave Ray. “FAIR is offering input on our vision for robust and lasting border security. As we hammer out the details, we are hopeful the final product delivers real enforcement measures that have been demanded by the American people.”
Now is the perfect time for the president to assume the bully pulpit and stump for the Davis-Oliver Act across the country. They should push a bicameral approach, with the goal of getting the bill on their desk. As for border security, it's not a statutory problem; it's a funding problem. Between Sen. Ted Cruz's El Chapo bill and the cutting of tax credits to illegal aliens, there is no lack of funding sources to pass a bill simply funding what is required by current law. The question is if there is the will.
A man was arrested early Thursday after police say they used a stolen front-end loader to smash into a Midtown liquor store, steal alcohol and lead officers on a low-speed chase through East Anchorage.
Police spokesperson Jennifer Castro said in a statement that police were flagged down at about 3:20 a.m. by a witness who had seen the vehicle — fitted with a pair of forklift prongs — crash into the Brown Jug liquor store in the 2200 block of East Northern Lights Boulevard, "ripping off most of the front entrance of the store."
"The citizen stated they observed the driver of the front-end loader go into the store and the driver took some alcohol bottles," Castro wrote. "Following the collision, the driver took off eastbound in the front-end loader."
During a police pursuit of the loader, seen in a dashcam video APD posted on YouTube, police repeatedly tried to stop the vehicle before blocking its path at an RV park on the 4100 block of DeBarr Road at about 3:30 a.m. The driver, 38-year-old Joseph Martin, was arrested.
"Alcohol bottles were found inside of the front-end loader," Castro wrote. "Officers could also smell a strong odor of alcohol coming from Martin's breath and Martin also performed poorly on standard field sobriety tests."
Police later learned that the loader had been stolen from a business in South Anchorage on Runamuck Place, where further damage was done when the loader was taken.
Trina Gaskov of Green Acres Landscaping Construction and Aquascapes confirmed the loader belonged to the company they own with their husband, Gus. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood off Dimond Boulevard, the construction site isn't visible from the freeway. Gaskov said they were stunned to learn what happened Thursday morning.
"It kind of boggles our mind," they said.
Castro said Thursday afternoon that Martin didn't have any apparent connection to either the Brown Jug store or the landscaping business. Gaskov said they did not recognize Martin.
"The fence had gotten broken through when they took the loader," Castro said. "The keys were left in it, but it was left in a fenced-in area that was supposed to be secure."
Gaskov said there had been some petty thefts from the construction yard previously but never anything as significant as a piece of heavy machinery. The front-end loader was undamaged Thursday and the damage to the company's gate was minimal, they said.
"He's obviously a good driver, 'cause they were drunk off their butt but they were still driving really good," they said in a phone interview Thursday. "He didn't hit a car or nothing — and making those wide turns — they must have experience driving around the loaders or something."
Several police officers were involved in pursuing the loader early Thursday. Castro said some of them drove ahead of the vehicle to block cross streets and prevent drivers from turning onto the road in front of the chase. Ultimately, no injuries were reported during the entire incident.
"Trying to figure out how to stop this thing in a safe manner was kind of challenging for us," Castro said. "Not only is this thing big and heavy, but it's got those two forklift prongs on the front — nobody wants to be impaled or anything like that."
At one point in the scanner traffic heard on the video, according to Castro, officers consider asking about the availability of a dump truck to block the loader.
"They mention that they think that they can't use spike strips, because they don't think it would do anything to the tires," Castro said.
Castro said they couldn't recall police handling any similar chase involving construction equipment during their time at the police department.
"It's definitely a different kind of response," Castro said. "There was obviously a lot of potential here for injuries to happen, so we're glad no one was actually hurt in this incident."
It was unclear exactly how much damage the Brown Jug sustained or when it would reopen. The store closes at midnight — several hours before police received the report of the loader plowing into the building — according to Brown Jug's website.
Construction crews worked Thursday afternoon to replace almost all of the building's front windows and glass doors, sweeping glass and bricks from the floor. Rows of wine bottles close to the window remained standing and unbroken behind where the loader hit the building.
A cardboard cutout of the "Most Interesting Man in the World," who features in commercials for Dos Equis beer, held a handmade sign saying the business was "Closed for Space Travel."
A Brown Jug manager on scene declined to give their name or answer questions about the incident. Calls and emails to company headquarters went unreturned Thursday afternoon.
The political and social roots of the Democratic Party's anti-Russia hysteria
13 May 2017
The crisis surrounding the firing of FBI Director James Comey has been seized on by the Democratic Party and much of the media to escalate their anti-Russian campaign.
While denouncing Trump for supposedly colluding with the Kremlin, they all but ignore the administration's escalating assault on immigrants and its ongoing drive to destroy Medicaid, slash health care for millions of workers, lift corporate regulations and hand big business and the rich an immense tax windfall.
The Democrats choose to focus not on these attacks, but rather on a McCarthyite-style witch-hunt against Russia with anti-communist undertones. In the process, the Democrats have adopted the traditional language of the extreme right.
In its lead editorial Friday, headlined “The Trump-Russia Nexus,” the New York Times lays out its case that Trump maintains an “unusually extensive network of relationships with a major foreign power,” i.e., Russia. It demands “a thorough investigation of whether and how Russia interfered in the election and through whom.”
The Times ' “network of relationships” turns out to be little more than a series of business connections and contacts between Trump family members and associates and Russian interests, which are hardly unique for the American corporate-financial oligarchy and can be viewed as inherently sinister only if one starts from the premise that all things Russian are evil.
The list includes Trump business ties with Russian nationals, a speech by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in Moscow, a meeting between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Russian ambassador to the US, former Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort's business dealings with a Russian oligarch and pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, and links to Russian interests on the part of Trump advisers Roger Stone and Carter Page.
One could cite similar relations with foreign countries involving the Bush family, not to mention the Clintons, with their far-flung machinations through the Clinton Foundation.
In a column published in the same edition of the Times, Paul Krugman goes even further, accusing Trump of using “presidential power to cover up possible foreign subversion of the US government.” They declare not only Trump but the entire Republican Party to be little more than traitors, willing to work with the enemy to secure tax cuts for the rich.
“Today's Republicans just don't cooperate with Democrats, period,” they write. “They'd rather work with Vladimir Putin.” They ask, “How did a whole party become so, well, un-American?”
Congressional hearings on alleged Russian hacking and possible Trump campaign collusion are replete with denunciations of Russia as a “hostile government” and “enemy power,” mostly, but by no means exclusively, from the mouths of Democrats.
The presentation of Russia as some all-powerful monster menacing American democracy and plotting to conquer the world is absurd. The Putin government represents the Russian oligarchy. As with any capitalist power, it seeks to influence world events in its favor. But its operations pale in comparison to those of American imperialism.
It is a matter of historical fact that, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia vacated vast swaths of territory and spheres of influence throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In the subsequent decades, NATO expanded its borders hundreds of miles to the east, right to Russia's doorstep, while the US backed the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the fascist-led, anti-Russian coup in Ukraine.
As for subverting governments and interfering in elections, there is hardly a country in the world, including Washington's European, North American and Asian allies, where the CIA and the Pentagon are not working to insure the installation of pro-American regimes—from bankrolling “pro-democracy” NGOs to organizing regime-change operations and carrying out bloody wars.
No less absurd is the claim that Russian propaganda was responsible for the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Clinton ignored the working class and ran as the favored candidate of Wall Street and the military/intelligence apparatus. This enabled Trump to posture as an opponent of the status quo, while ensuring a precipitous drop in voter turnout for the Democratic candidate.
What is the real source of the anti-Russia hysteria gripping the US ruling elite?
There are major foreign policy issues at stake. Despite the dissolution of the USSR, which during the Cold War blocked the unchecked global domination of US imperialism, Russia has emerged as an obstacle to Washington's drive for world hegemony. This is seen most sharply in Syria, where Russia intervened militarily to frustrate US efforts to oust President Bashar al-Assad.
No less important are domestic considerations. The ruling class is acutely aware of the immense class tensions that exist in the society over which it presides, tensions that have been artificially suppressed for many decades.
The United States is the most unequal country in the industrial world, with 20 billionaires possessing more wealth than half of the population. The 2016 elections themselves showed the growth of anti-capitalist sentiment and hostility to both parties, expressed in the support of millions of people for Clinton's opponent in the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders, who falsely claimed to be an “independent” and a “socialist.”
Facing the threat of mounting social opposition, the US ruling class is seeking a new framework for the waging of war abroad and domestic repression at home. The “war on terror,” which has served this purpose for some fifteen years, is discredited, not least because the US is allied with Al Qaeda-linked Islamist forces in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
There is a need for a new narrative to divert social tensions, ideologically unify the nation, subordinate the working class and, when necessary, suppress opposition.
It is significant that it is the “left” that has been mobilized most directly in the McCarthyite campaign against Russia—figures such as Krugman, who earlier called Trump the “Siberian candidate,” and Michael Moore, who has gone from being an opponent of the war in Iraq to denouncing Trump as a “Russian traitor” and appealing to the military to take action. The organizations that orbit the Democratic Party—the International Socialist Organization, Socialist Alternative, publications like Jacobin and others—either remain silent about the conflicts within the ruling class, as they have since the firing of Comey, or openly endorse the campaign against Russia.
The Democratic Party has very consciously worked to integrate the anti-Russia hysteria with identity politics, seizing on various anti-democratic policies of the Putin government for this purpose. The aim is to mobilize more privileged sections of the upper-middle class behind the overall policy of imperialist war and social reaction.
The campaign takes root in fertile soil. This social layer, representing the top 5 to 10 percent of income earners, has been substantially enriched by the stock market boom and has interests that are sharply different from those of the working class. While they would prefer a more equitable distribution of wealth at the very top of society, they are predominantly concerned with preventing the growth of social opposition in the working class.
Thus the campaign against Russia expresses the most essential characteristics of the Democratic Party: the marriage of Wall Street, the military/intelligence apparatus and the affluent upper-middle class, mobilized around identity politics.
The Democratic Party cannot conduct a fight against Trump on any sort of progressive basis. It is terrified of a mass movement of the working class. Were Trump to either resign or be impeached as a result of this right-wing campaign, their administration would simply be replaced with another government of war, austerity and reaction.
This poses all the more clearly the urgent need for the working class to intervene with its own socialist and internationalist program.

Water
Considering the human body is about 60 percent water it seems implausible — if not impossible — to be allergic to water, but about 40 people worldwide have been diagnosed with the condition. Known as aquagenic urticaria, it causes the skin to break out in painful hives and welts when it comes in contact with water, and in severe cases, a person's throat can swell when they drink water. Michaela Dutton (pictured) a British woman who developed a water allergy after the birth of their son, drinks Diet Coke to survive — their body tolerates it even though it contains carbonated water. How do people like Dutton bathe? Quickly and carefully because even brief contact with water can cause a painful itchy rash that lasts for hours. Doctors aren't sure what causes water allergy, but some have hypothesized that elevated histamine levels play a role.

On Tuesday evening, Seminole Head Coach Jimbo Fisher addressed the Tallahassee Quarterback Club in Florida's capital city. They offered a number of confidence-inspiring platitudes, which our former contributor and current FSView Sports Editor Ariya Massoudi was good enough to pass along via social media:
FSU Head Coach Jimbo Fisher speaking now at the Tallahassee QB Club. #Noles pic.twitter.com/lopSaF95z7 — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 23, 2016
Fisher on their message to their team: "We don't practice until we do things right, we practice until we can't do them wrong." #FSU — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 23, 2016
Fisher on what they like most about their team this year: "When we tell them to go, they go. There's a tremendous amount of leadership." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 23, 2016
Fisher says their 2016 team has a chip on its shoulder. Says they listen well, work hard and have plenty of intelligence. #FSU — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Fisher says the 2016 fall camp has been a little more physical than the last few years. Credits getting ready for a tougher early schedule. — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Does FSU have the country's best starting defensive end tandem? Fisher seems enthusiastic:
Fisher says DEs DeMarcus Walker and Josh Sweat have had great camps. — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Want some information on a first-year student? Check it out:

Are you excited about ‘Nole DB Derwin James? You're not alone:
Fisher in Derwin James: "I'm not one to hype up players and I hate to jinx it. But this guy gets it." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Linebacker Matthew Thomas is another defender whom Seminole supporters are eager to see again. And, per Fisher, their versatility is nowhere near lacking:
Fisher on LB Matt Thomas: "This guy is legit, he's a freak athlete. Could go play corner if we asked them to." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Of course, no FSU fan tires of Dalvin Cook news. And Fisher added some notable quotes regarding their star running back on Tuesday night:
Fisher on RB Dalvin Cook: "I wouldn't trade this guy for all the money in China." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Fisher says Cook has made as a big a leap in leadership and maturity since arriving at FSU as any he's ever coached. Vocal leader now. — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016

But on to the true glamour position of quarterback:
Fisher says QB Sean Maguire is healing well. Could be doing some football activities in a week or week and half. #FSU — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Fisher on Deondre Francois: "I won't compare them to a guy that played here a few years ago, but when they play, you'll like what you see." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Fisher certainly didn't sound like they were overly concerned about running Francois either, but I suppose time will tell:
Fisher on protecting Francois with limited QB depth: "We'll do what we have to do to win. We can't play like that, teams are too good." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Of course, someone has to block for whichever QB is under or behind center, and a recent convert earned some high praise:
Fisher on RT Rick Leonard: "This guy is picking things up quickly. He's going to be a very good player here." — Ariya Massoudi (@AriyaMassoudi) August 24, 2016
Fisher even spoke about the first opposing QB the ‘Noles will face, that being Ole Miss signal-caller Chad Kelly:
Yo, Trump supporters! It's your old pal, Paste Magazine. Have you been looking for a sweet way to own libs? How about this:
You go to an elementary school playground at night. You find a sign, and you write some nasty words where the kids will see it the next day. But here's the catch—you write the nasty words as though they are coming from the mind of a liberal.
What kind of nasty words am I talking about? Some real lefty extremist language, like:
“Kill Trump”
“Death to Trump” (in case they missed the point the first time)
“Left is the Best”
and
“Bernie Sanders 2020”
You can imagine how this would go—the kids would see the graffiti, and everyone would be all like, “those damn libs! They won't even let our kids be kids!”
And then, at last, the purges will begin.
Okay, I'm coming clean—this is not a purely theoretical exercise. In fact, that very idea was conceived and executed by a 32-year-old Trump supporter named Stephen Marks in West Hartford, CT. (He even brought their dog.) The only problem for Marks, as Raw Story reports, is that they committed their crime in a well-lit area and gave the security cameras they didn't know about a clear shot of their face and body. When police released the video and they saw their face on TV, they quickly folded and turned themselves in.
But even though this folk hero ultimately got caught by Johnny Law, surely they will still be celebrated for their ingenuity. Here's their justification, from Raw Story:
It turns out the suspect is a supporter of Donald Trump seeking to frame political detractors of the controversial president.
The Hartford Courant reported that Marks told investigators they “had the dumb idea to vandalize the school with what would seem to be liberal hate speech.”
As some pointed out, their depiction of the liberal mind may not have been 100% pitch perfect:

It's true—this may go down in the annals with other classics like:
@dunndunndunn in no way is this not fake pic.twitter.com/HjLQ7ZbWv2 — jitka (@jitka) October 17, 2016
But despite the flawed execution, Marks' heart was in the right place:
Marks also allegedly told police their crime was, “out of anger towards liberals and they are breaking major laws everyday and being disrespectful towards our government.”
Yes, it totally makes sense that when you're mad about breaking laws and being disrespectful towards government, you:
1. Break a law.
2. Deface government-funded public property.
Now, joking aside just for a quick second: This is another example of malicious activity designed to bring hatred and violence down a political group in America, and it's too bad that he's likely going to get off with community service.
Joking back on: Stephen Marks is a hero.
Joking off again: We're so screwed.
The idea that a “gay gene” exists is not without controversy, but evidence strongly suggests that sexual orientation, at least in men, is influenced largely (but not entirely) by genetics. New research is offering the first piece of evidence for an idea that has been proposed before: a link between sexual preference and DNA tags that can be influenced by the environment. This finding was presented on October 8 at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Baltimore.
The idea that sexuality is a choice is an archaic idea. The hypothesis that there is a genetic element to homosexuality has floated around for a while; gay twins are surely enough to prompt suspicion on the matter. But it took a long time for convincing evidence in support of this to surface. Just last year, for example, the biggest study of gay brothers to date backed up what had been proposed 20 years earlier: stretches of DNA on the X chromosome and chromosome 8 are strongly associated with sexual orientation.
It's clearly not all down to genes, though. Studies that have looked at identical twin pairs have found that if one sibling is gay, there is roughly a 20% chance that the twin will also have the same sexual orientation. And each time a woman has a male pregnancy, the chance that their next son will be homosexual increases by 33%. These percentages clearly indicate another factor is involved.
When we talk about traits like this, the argument is often over “genetics or environment,” but what about something that is a bridge between the two? This is where epigenetics swoop in. Epigenetic refers to tags that can be added to or removed from DNA that alter the expression of a particular gene. Your DNA sequence has got to be read before proteins can be made; the tags get in the way of the scanning machinery and thus prevent expression. Imagine something getting stuck in a production line. Importantly, these can be influenced by environmental factors, but as Nature points out, they are not necessarily shared between identical twins.
To find out whether epigenetics may also play a part in homosexuality, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, looked at patterns of epigenetic tags – or more specifically, chemicals called methyl groups – in 37 identical twin pairs in which only one was gay, so called “discordant” for sexual orientation. They also included 10 pairs of heterosexual twins as a control group.
After combing their genomes, they discovered five marks that were present in higher frequencies in the gay men compared with their heterosexual twin brothers. They then applied an algorithm to the regions identified and found that these tags were able to predict whether or not the individual sampled was gay with an accuracy of 67%. To the researchers' knowledge, they write, this is the first biomarker-based predictive model for sexual orientation.
So what are the genes affected by these marks, and what environmental factor is influencing them? This study unfortunately can't tell us that, but it's an interesting starting point that will hopefully spur further research.
Get Kaguya And Orpheus Telos For Persona Q: Shadow Of The Labyrinth For Free

Just like Japan, Atlus will release downloadable personas for Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth. The first two DLC personas will be free. Kaguya, a persona unlocked by maxing out Marie's social link in Persona 4: Golden, will be available as a freebie on November 25. Orpheus Telos, the female protagonist's persona from Persona 3: Portable, will be downloadable for free on December 2.
Magatsu Izanagi from Persona 4: Golden and Thanatos from Persona 3 are paid personas. Both will be available on December 2 for $1.99 each. Here's a look at how these personas appear in Persona Q.
Afterwards Atlus will release different Navigator Voices as downloadable content. Margaret, Elizabeth and Theodore will be available on December 9 for $2.99 for each Navigator Voice. Marie and Nanako are scheduled for December 16, these are also $2.99 a piece.
Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth is out now in North America.
For the Chinese government, which regards the wealth of top officials a taboo subject, the report triggered an immediate reaction: Bloomberg News was censored on the mainland. But the blowback didn't end there. In addition to the site's censorship, sales of Bloomberg terminal subscriptions, the financial information portals which provide a huge amount of revenue for the company, temporarily slumped in China. And the family of Forsythe, one of the journalists responsible for the article, even received death threats.
This year, Forsythe and Oster completed work on a fresh investigation into the connection of wealth and power in China, this time focusing on Wang Jianlin, a real-estate developer and the country's richest citizen. In September, Bloomberg News Managing Editor Jonathan Kaufman told the reporters that the story was "terrific" and added "I am in awe of the way you tracked down and deciphered the financial holdings and the players. It's a real revelation. Looking forward to pushing it up the line.”
But the next month, progress on the story suddenly came to a halt. The reporters learned from an editor that the story would indefinitely be "put on the back burner" for an indefinite amount of time. In a report by Edward Wong of The New York Times, Winkler told the reporters that publishing the report would jeopardize Bloomberg's access to China, and compared their situation to Nazi-era Germany, where journalists engaged in self-censorship in order to avoid expulsion from the country.
Winkler, speaking to The New York Times, denied the story and said that the investigation was still ongoing; the delay, they said, reflected a belief that the story was as yet unfit for publication, a claim that seems to belie the editorial enthusiasm for the article. But further reporting by the Times' Wong revealed the extent to which Bloomberg ensures that its editorial and business sides do not interfere with each other in China; in every Bloomberg story on China that might offend Beijing, editors insert a code that ensures that the story does not appear on mainland-China Bloomberg terminals.
Meanwhile, though the Times' article did not cite them as a source of information of the spiked story, Bloomberg placed Forsythe on unpaid leave of absence last Tuesday. Monday night, on Twitter, they thanked their followers for support.
Thanks everyone for the incredible outpouring of sympathy and support. It has really helped me and my family get through this. — Mike Forsythe 傅才德 (@PekingMike) November 18, 2013
And yesterday, they announced that their tenure with Bloomberg, which began in 2000, had come to an end.
I can confirm that I have left Bloomberg News. That's all I'm going to say for now. — Mike Forsythe 傅才德 (@PekingMike) November 19, 2013
The story, in many ways, is just beginning, and there are many unanswered questions. Will Bloomberg ultimately decide to publish a version of the story? If so, how will Beijing react? But these details obscure the larger point: Given The New York Times' reporting, it would appear that the Chinese government has successfully intimidated a major American news organization into killing a story that the government deemed offensive. And not just any story, either: a major investigative report on a subject central to any understanding of contemporary China—a subject on which a similar report last year won the Times a Pulitzer Prize.
Meanwhile, George Orwell's famous quote on the purpose of journalism—that it consists of printing what someone else does not want printed—is becoming no less vital in China, where the domestic media lack the wherewithal to do the investigations themselves.

When the New York Red Bulls visit Dick's Sporting Goods Park in two days, it will be a special homecoming for Mike Petke, who spent more than three seasons as a member of the Colorado Rapids.
“I haven't been there in a long time,” Petke said on Tuesday. “It will be good to get back, I still have a house and some friends there, be nice to see them around the game and yeah, Colorado is beautiful. I love going to Colorado, it'll be fun.”
As a former Rapid, Petke played down the effect of Denver's elevation on their squad ahead of the Thursday match.
“I mean, listen, I know it's a nice storyline, but the altitude's altitude, you know?” Petke said. “Everybody has to deal with it. Does it change the way we want to play? Not necessarily. Does it change the way we'll approach the game? Perhaps a little bit, but it's not something we're putting into the players minds, so it's not something that we're severely altering what we want to do.”
Midfielder Tim Cahill echoed their head coach when they were asked about any altitude issues they and their teammates may face Thursday.
“If people start blowing up at 70 minutes then there are players on the bench who can take their spot, you know?” Cahill said. “We got fit boys on this team. You know fitness I think is a key in this league, every team you play is exceptionally fit. All the boys really take care of themselves, and if you're not up to scratch, you'll definitely get found out.”
BUILDING OFF THE VICTORY OVER HOUSTON
Coming off the heels of a 2-0 victory over Houston on Sunday, the Red Bulls are looking to provide another complete team effort against Colorado on Thursday.
“The biggest thing that we need to do is go back to not conceding goals and to be compact and disciplined,” Cahill said. “Even though that I played a lot deeper on the weekend, and me and Dax (McCarty) held a really tight line close to the two defenders, it felt safe and that's the way it's got to be every game.
“In the end, we'll get our chances to break forward, but you don't need to when Espy (Fabian Espindola) finishes, and Titi (Thierry Henry) is playing, and Jonny (Steele) and the boys are doing well all over the park.”
Forward Thierry Henry said they are glad to see a better overall effort from the forwards, especially Fabian Espindola. The 28-year-old Argentinian snapped a league scoring drought stretching back to April 20 on Sunday with their goal at the hour mark.
“I mean I think (Espindola) needed it, but like I said after the game, they are creating a lot for us, he's moving a lot, he's fighting, he's available,” Henry said. “But yeah…it was important for us to see Espindola scoring, but also Jonny, it is important that Jonny scores, or whoever.”
PETKE ADDRESSES CLUB'S FOURTH OF JULY WOES
The Red Bulls are 1-8-2 all-time on the Fourth of July, and although Petke cannot put their finger on the reason for the club's Independence Day woes, they want to see a change in fortunes this Thursday.
Although they do not think the elevation will be as big of a factor, Petke knows what kind of crowd will be at Dick's Sporting Goods Park on the 4th of July.
“I know I've been, played in Colorado many times with New York, whether it's the MetroStars or the Red Bulls,” Petke said. “It's a tough place to play, you know, they always get a sell out crowd on 4th of July. You know it pumps the players up, for whatever reason, but we're looking to change that obviously for Thursday.”
JUNINHO TO MISS RAPIDS CLASH
Petke also confirmed on Tuesday that Brazilian midfielder Juninho will miss the match vs. Colorado because they are tending to personal matters.
The number one crude oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, has projected a $39 billion deficit in 2015. The impact of lower oil prices, along with the decision not to cut production, is putting pressure on the country's finances.
READ MORE: Saudi Arabia confident oil prices will rise, won't cut output
The figure was part of the endorsed 2015 budget, which was made public in a statement read out on state-run television on Thursday.
The estimated trade deficit will be Saudi Arabia's largest on record.
The Finance Ministry said the government will try to save some money by cutting salaries, wages, and allowances that represent around “50 percent of total budgeted expenditures.” But the move could anger Saudi youth, who are already struggling to cover the costs of living in the country.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), about two-thirds of the population works for the government.
The 2015 budget includes 860 billion riyals (US$229.3 billion) in spending and 715 billion riyals ($190.7 billion) in revenue. Saudi Arabia promised to cover the difference by digging into its reserves.
Saudi Arabia's 2015 budget is probably assuming an oil price of $80 a barrel so it will be seen as a sign of confidence in the market, former economic adviser to the country's government, John Sfakianakis, told Bloomberg after the budget was announced on Thursday. The assumption is down from $103 a barrel for this year, Sfakianakis added.
“Everyone was expecting to see a budget built on a price around $60 but that would have sent a negative message to the oil market,” Sfakianakis said. “With a fiscal break even price of $80 a barrel, the government is sending a message to the market that we are expecting to see a rebound in oil prices.”
Oil accounted for 89 percent of Saudi Arabia's revenue last year.
At the latest OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, the Gulf country opted not to cut the production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day, despite oil prices plunging nearly 50 percent since summer.

Saudi Arabia has also made clear that it is unwilling to cut down production, even if oil prices continue to fall further. Last week, the country's oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, said that output would not be reduced, even if prices fall to $20 a barrel.
The decision has been interpreted by some experts as trying to weed out new players from North America, who can competitively produce shale oil only at higher crude prices. However, lower oil prices also directly hurt the economies of countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.
READ MORE: $20 oil wouldn't force production cut – Saudi oil minister
Some economists fear that the deficit in 2015 might be even larger than projected, since Saudi Arabians have underestimated the figure in the past.
“I believe we are headed for a difficult year in 2015. I think the actual deficit will be around 200 billion riyals [$53 billion] because actual revenues are expected to be lower than estimates,” Saudi economist Abdulwahab Abu-Dahesh told AFP. “Spending in the budget is not in line with the sharp decline in oil prices,” they said.
According to the country's Finance Ministry, the 2014 fiscal year budget is set to post a deficit of 54 billion riyals ($14.4 billion) – the first budget shortfall since 2009.
Tony Horton stunk at football at Trumbull (Conn.) High School in the mid-1970s.
The 5-foot-10, "skinny dude" was so bad that they rarely came in a game to play -- "only when we had a huge lead" -- and was forced to keep the stats for the team.
Tony Horton
"I guess the coach wanted to humiliate me more than just kicking me off the team," said Horton, who is about 180 pounds of muscle today.
Their sister, Kit, chimed in: "When they would actually get into the game, the whole family would cheer. But they didn't get in that often."
So it might be a little vindication for Horton -- who now has sold about 3.5 million copies of their P90X home exercise system to the tune of about $450 million -- to return to southwest Connecticut Saturday to lead 250 of their fans for an hour of training at the Fitness Atlantic expo in Wallingford.
"I'm so glad to be back where I was raised and just spread the word about health and fitness," said Horton, who was born in Rhode Island but spent 20 years in Connecticut. "You need to enjoy life right up to the very end."
For Horton, life has been good since they created the P90X system about 11 years ago. It has revolutionized the exercise industry because Horton -- who was a personal trainer to the stars at the time -- has shown you don't need weights or go to the gym to get into great shape. In fact, Horton's sequel to the P90X is finishing development next month and will be available this fall.
It's funny to think that the 52-year-old Horton was a teenager without a lot of stamina who went out to the West Coast with some friends to try to make it in the movie industry and instead is one of the most famous exercise trainers in the world.
"Sometimes, I don't know if I really have made it," they said. "I'm the same person who was a stand-up comedian, the same person who was a street mime, the same person who can be blue sometimes. I just don't see myself any differently."
Tony's father, Tony Horton Sr., came to the expo and said their son has always remained grounded.
"I'm so proud of what he's become and what he's doing for people," they said. "I still remember when they and their friends just got in the car and headed out to California just to try to make it."

Podle nové studie publikované London School of Economics (LSE) je na základě mínění pěti ekonomů a zároveň nositelů Nobelovy ceny za ekonomii globální válka proti drogám katastrofální metodou, jak s tímto zhoubným celosvětovým fenoménem bojovat ZDE . K témuž závěru došla rovněž spousta zdravotnických profesionálů, bezpečnostních expertů a lidskoprávních aktivistů. Tyto osobnosti volají po úplně nové strategii, jak proti obchodu s drogami efektivně bojovat.
Ekonomičtí experti pod záštitou LSE upozorňují na rozsáhlé negativní dopady globálního tažení proti drogám, včetně "vedlejších ztrát" v podobě desítek tisíc zbytečně zmařených životů, a přicházejí se zcela jinou strategií. Navrhují, aby byly finanční prostředky, jež jsou dosud vynakládány na násilnou a neúčinnou represivní politiku, prohibici apod., radikálním způsobem přesměrovány na efektivní strategie, kladoucí důraz na preventivní opatření, a do zdravotnictví, tedy na různé zdravotní programy, vývoj nových léčebných postupů a kúr atd.
Specialisté dále požadují, aby byly obecně vypracovávány zevrubné ekonomické analýzy a kazuistické studie, jejichž poznatky by předešly masivnímu plýtvání veřejných financí. K dosažení vytčeného cíle je samozřejmě nutné zapojit OSN a vlády jednotlivých zemí, argumentují odborníci.
Ve zprávě se můžeme dočíst, že represivní postupy v potírání obchodu s drogami vytvořily "bumerangovou metodou" černý trh s drogami s obratem 300 miliard dolarů ZDE. Také dramatické zvýšení násilností v zemích, jako jsou Mexiko, Kolumbie a Afghánistán, lze přičíst na vrub selhavší protidrogové kruciátě militarizací celých regionů.
Příklad Mexika: Desítky tisíc zabitých
V roce 2006 zahájila mexická vláda boj proti drogovým kartelům, a ta si do roku 2012, tedy za šest roků vlády prezidenta Felipe Calderóna, oficiálně vyžádala 60 000 obětí ZDE, včetně jednoho tisíce dětí a 67 novinářů. Některé odhady uvádějí dokonce 120 000 zabitých do roku 2013 ZDE, v to nepočítaje 27 000 nezvěstných. Smrtící spirála násilí spojená s touto téměř neznámou válkou vyhnala z domovů 1.6 milionu Mexičanů. Mexiko se tak suverénně stalo jednou z nejnebezpečnějších zemí na světě.
Mimikry Bílého domu v Mexiku
Zatímco běžní Američané vnímají mexický konflikt čistě jako mexickou záležitost, Spojené státy v něj hrají zásadní roli. Američané jsou největšími spotřebiteli narkotik na světě s tím, že více než 90 procent kokainu na "trzích" ve Státech pochází právě z Mexika a navzdory zpackané válce proti drogám ZDE . Paradoxní je také fakt, že na válce proti drogám mexické kartely vydělávají nehorázné peníze. Podle oficiálních dokumentů americké vlády se jim podařilo zvýšit zisk z prodeje drog z 19 na 29 miliard dolarů ročně ZDE. Na jedné straně Bílý dům poskytl prezidentu Calderónovi a mexické armádě finanční pomoc ve výši 1.4 miliardy dolarů, přestože se mexická armáda dopouštěla a dopouští závažných zločinů, včetně vražd, mučení nebo únosů ZDE . Na druhé straně snadná koupě zbraní v USA díky laxním zákonům umožnila drogovým kartelům zaplavit Mexiko miliony zbraní (87 procent zbraní v Mexiku údajně pochází ze Států ZDE )
USA tak de facto "sytí" tragický konflikt v Mexiku ať již svým labužnictvím v mexickém kokainu, nebo objemnými zásilkami zbraní oběma stranám konfliktu, který si ročně vyžádá 10, či možná až 20 000 lidských životů.
Nyní se teprve ukáže, zda tlak odborné veřejnosti zdola prostřednictvím uvedené studie a dalších dlouhodobých aktivit dokáže barbarství války proti narkotikům alespoň uvést do veřejné debaty, redukovat, když ne vymýtit.
An outage affected the Mozilla.com website on the day the organisation launched its Guinness World Record attempt for downloads of the new Firefox 3 browser.
The mozilla.com site was unreachable from around the world, occasionally responding with the message, "Http/1.1 Service Unavailable".
Melissa Shapiro posted a statement on the Mozilla blog to say that their servers were feeling the burn and should be back to normal shortly. An earlier post stated that the record attempt would begin today at 5pm UTC, but Shapiro announced after this time that the 24 hour period in which the downloads will be counted will begin once the site goes live.
Netcraft was able to access the Firefox 3 download page again shortly after 7pm UTC, but the Service Unavailable message was still seen occasionally. For some period before this, the page was still offering version 2 downloads, yet a Mozilla press release confirmed that Firefox 3 had indeed already been released.
A follow-up post on the Mozilla blog officially announced that the 24 hour period had begun, with Guinness counting all complete downloads of Firefox 3 before 18:16 UTC tomorrow.
The outages also affected the www.spreadfirefox.com website. Realtime performance graphs of the Mozilla website are available here.
On Friday, Nov. 3, eight pedestrians were hit by motor vehicles in Toronto before noon — one of them a 2-year-old child, another in a hit and run, yet another was a woman taken to hospital in life-threatening condition. On Tuesday night, Oct. 31, a 14-vehicle crash resulted in a fiery explosion on Hwy. 400 killed three people, apparently after a fuel tanker truck “approaching the area where traffic had slowed appeared to have crashed through other vehicles, setting off a chain reaction.” So, naturally, a public debate about road safety is in order. And for much of the past week, we've been having one, centred on . . . well, let me see. Ah, right, here it is:
Recently, public debate has focused on whether to ban distracted walking, but it misses the real reason there has been carnage on our roads, Ed Keenan writes. ( Bernard Weil / Toronto Star )
We've been debating whether Ontario should follow Honolulu's lead in adopting a “Zombie Law.” I gotta say, I honestly don't know if the undead will be deterred by the threat of a provincial offences fine, though anything that will slow their relentless march through the hellscape of the post-apocalypse is worth a — hold on. Right. It seems what we're talking about is not literal zombies, but instead those who text or use their phones while walking, especially while crossing the street. One Hawaiian city has banned the practice, and there are those who think we should follow suit. “Distracted walking” is the less apocalyptic term, and I see I've addressed it before, one year ago this week, actually. But apparently it needs addressing again, because this is kind of a “zombie idea,” in that it keeps resurfacing from the grave, and periodically feasts on the brains of decent, otherwise reasonable people.

Like Liberal MPP Yvan Baker, who proposes a private member's bill to formally ban texting and walking, and Premier Kathleen Wynne, who may be entertaining supporting it. And like my esteemed colleagues Emma Teitel and Martin Regg Cohn, who have written supporting the idea. These latter two, at least, are smart people and good writers, though in this case they are wrong. Let's take Teitel's argument first, since it is so amusing and fun, as arguments go. They write that a ban on texting and walking would help us all avoid the “soul-crushing looks of disapproval from old people that no one should ever have to bear.” I would just point out that applying this things-some-stereotype-of-our-grandparents-disapprove-of principle more broadly would, if the chatter down at the Country Style is any indication, also mean banning “that noisy rap crap” from the radio, require most of us to hike up our pants and stop hiking up our skirts, and force us to get out of bed early on the weekend to “catch the worm.” This isn't a legislative agenda I would welcome, really. But Teitel's other argument, and one Cohn focuses on, is that a fine for looking at your phone while crossing the road is a useful nudge because it is “exceedingly dangerous.” The thing is, this seems intuitively right — it's a good idea to pay close attention to your surroundings when crossing the street. And yet there's not really any evidence that the obviously common practice of phone use in the streets is all that dangerous. At least not to the degree that ought to prompt legislative action, as the Star's editorial board recently argued.
A new Honolulu ordinance allows police officers to ticket pedestrians who look at a cellphone or electronic device while crossing a city street. The National Safety Council says Honolulu is the biggest city to pass this type of ordinance. (The Associated Press)
As I observed last year, the vast majority of accidents are attributed to driver error. The only studies that ever cite pedestrian distraction as a factor in even a small percentage of accidents include things like walking dogs and supervising children as distractions. As Oliver Moore of the Globe and Mail reported recently, the Toronto Police Service's Clint Stibbe could not recall a single instance of a pedestrian being struck because they were distracted by their phone in the five years he's served as the force's traffic spokesperson. More pedestrians are struck and killed while standing on the sidewalk, Moore observed on Twitter, than when distracted by their phones. Shall we ban the more dangerous practice of sidewalk use as well? (“If only one life could be saved!” you can imagine the MPP proposing forbidding ever leaving your home on foot saying.) Still, Cohn writes, a small fine, probably rarely enforced — what's the problem? It's a law, they imply in their column, that will function as a bit of a friendly reminder. “Just as jaywalking laws are aspirational (and barely enforceable) so too a ban on distracted crosswalking could be educational (and rarely adversarial).” In my experience, laws that are “educational” or “aspirational” and rarely enforced are vulnerable to being selectively enforced, employed as a means of harassment or intimidation, or as pretext for a stop and search, or as a way of filling quotas — and employed most against certain groups of people authorities may want to target. The Star's pages have been filled with examples of such selective enforcement for more than a decade. This is especially a potential problem with something like phone use, where whether a person was looking at the phone in their hand or not is a matter that's usually unprovable unless there is videotape on hand.

Besides which, walking against the red light is already against the law. Dangerously darting into traffic is already against the law. There is no need to create new laws to ban behaviours that are already banned. And in the meantime, the fact is that when someone is in the crosswalk walking on a green light, they have the right of way. This is true whether they are slow or quick. It is true whether they are walking a hard-to-control dog or using a cane. It is true if they are drunk and unsteady on their feet (drunk walking is something that legitimately seems to be a factor in a lot of pedestrian accidents, though no one seems to propose banning it). And it is true, even if they are distracted, by their phones or otherwise. If they have the right of way, drivers are obligated to be aware of them, not vice versa. Now, principles of basic self-preservation, realizing that most drivers are human beings who make mistakes — and that some of them are reckless, entitled jerks, besides — means we are all well advised to pay close attention to our surroundings when in traffic. We should teach our children to make eye contact with turning drivers and be aware of whether cars actually stop before venturing in front of them, and to keep their eyes up. But we should teach our lawmakers to keep their eyes on the things that will actually make the roads safer and eliminate the vast majority of accidents — such as intersection and road design, speed limits, and driver behaviour.

One person was killed and other seven were injured after a ride malfunctioned at the Ohio State Fair.
A swinging and spinning amusement park ride called the Fire Ball malfunctioned and broke apart on the opening day of the fair. In a release posted on its Facebook page by KMG product manager Albert Koon, all rides similar to Fire Ball created by KMG were ordered to cease operation. The release expressed its sympathies to all involved.
Five of the injured were taken to either Wexner Medical Center or Grant Medical Center in critical condition. The remaining injured were taken to local hospitals in stable condition.
COMPLETE COVERAGE: Tragedy at the Ohio State Fair
Tyler Jarrell, 18, of Columbus, Ohio, was pronounced dead at the fairgrounds, according to a media release. Jarrell signed up to join the United States Marine Corps on July 21, according to Sgt. Caitlin Brink, Marketing and Public Affairs Chief for the Marine Corps Recruiting Station in Charleston.
"Our heartfelt condolences go out to Poolee Tyler Jarrell's family and all of those affected by their loss. The Marines here are greatly saddened by this tragedy. We are truly proud to have known them as one of the brave few willing to step up and serve their country in the United States Marine Corps," Brink said in a statement. They were scheduled to attend basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, June 18, 2018. They wanted to be in the Infantry or serve as a combat engineer."
According to Columbus Police Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan, Jarrell was a Columbus Police Explorer. "He was a person who, at a young age, was committed to public service."
Others injured include:
Tamika Dunlap, 36, of Reynoldsburg
Russell Franks, 42, of Columbus
Keziah Lewis, 19, of Columbus
Jacob Andrews, 22, of Pataskala
Jennifer Lambert, 18, of Columbus
Abdihakim Hussein, 19, of Columbus
And a 14-year-old male whose name is being withheld at the request of the family
The Wexner Medical Center released the following statement on behalf of the families being treated there:
“We want to thank the community for its outpouring of concern for our loved ones who are being treated at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. We appreciate all of your prayers, and we are keeping those who were injured and died in our prayers as well. As we focus our attention on the long healing process, we are asking media and the community to respect our privacy during this very difficult time. We are declining media requests for interviews at this time. Thank you.”
Video captured by a bystander shows the ride swinging back and forth like a pendulum and spinning in the air when it crashes into something and part of the ride flies off, throwing riders to the ground.
A company providing rides at the fair this year describes the Fire Ball as an "aggressive thrill ride."
On its website, Amusements of America says that since its debut in 2002, the Fire Ball has become "one of the most popular thrill rides on the AOA Midway." The company description of the ride says it swings riders 40 feet above the midway while spinning them at 13 revolutions per minute.
The company posted a message online reading: "Our family owned company is committed to working with state and local experts in trying to determine the cause of this tragic accident. The ride was inspected by our staff as well as independent inspectors prior to opening at the Ohio State Fair. We are keeping those impacted by this tragic situation in our prayers and cooperating with those investigating this accident."
Gov. John Kasich ordered a full investigation and also ordered that all rides be shut down at the fair until additional safety inspections can be completed.
Director of Agriculture David Daniels says all rides are checked several times when they're being set up to ensure they're set up the way the manufacturer intended.
Officials say the Fire Ball ride was inspected at a couple of different stages and was signed off Wednesday.
The accident prompted California State Fair officials to shut down the Fire Ball ride there. Barry Schaible, an inspector with a company hired by the fair, told KCRA-TV in Sacramento, "We shut down the ride immediately, unloaded it and it's closed right now."
Gov. Kasich was at the fair Thursday and said the rides would be closed but the fair would go on Thursday. The Midway remained closed. All rides would be shuttered until the Ohio Department of Agriculture completed inspections of all rides. Kasich said the team worked through the night -- on the ground -- to inspect rides.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is also investigating. It estimates there were 30,900 injuries associated with amusement attractions last year that required an emergency room visit.
It said there have been at least 22 fatalities associated with amusement attractions.

A group of customers refused to tip their 20-year-old server at a Carraba's Italian restaurant in Overland Park, KS on the grounds that their homosexuality is “an affront to God.” According to KCTV Fox 19, the server went to the table after the group of customers left and found a note explaining their decision.
“Thank you for your service, it was excellent. That being said, we cannot in good conscience tip you, for your homosexual lifestyle is an affront to GOD. Queers do not share in the wealth of GOD, and you will not share in ours,” said the note. “We hope you will see the tip your queer choices made you lose out on, and plan accordingly. It is never too late for GOD's love, but none shall be spared for queers. May GOD have mercy on you.”
Friends and supportive customers plan to dine at the restaurant Friday evening as a show of support for the waiter who received the hateful note. They have declined to give their name or go on camera and has asked people not to try and give them money.
They said in a statement, “The offers to help pay me back are much appreciated, but not at all needed. I'd prefer to let my work ethic and my service do the talking, nothing else.”

On the fourth day of January, less than a week after the Bears completed their worst 16-game season in franchise history, general manager Ryan Pace struck a reassuring tone, vowing to attack their offseason overhaul with purpose. Equipped with ample salary-cap space and favorable draft status, Pace wanted it known that they understood their responsibilities.
"We're going to be aggressive and calculated this offseason," they declared. "We're in a position to do so. We'll have a clear understanding of our roster and where our needs are and where we want to add to each position."
Suffice it to say, the 40-year-old GM still has a lot of heavy lifting ahead. The first day of free agency came and went Thursday with Pace and the Bears making their biggest splashes with the high-profile players they said goodbye to.
Jay Cutler's release was mostly a formality, an unsurprising and inevitable separation triggered by a team craving a new direction.
Alshon Jeffery's exit to the Eagles was a blow, subtracting the team's most proven weapon from an offense that finished 15th in the league in yards per game and 28th in points last season.
Mike Glennon's arrival? Well, that left many fans and experts scratching their heads, with Glennon agreeing to a three-year contract, which according to reports could be worth up to $45 million with $19 million guaranteed.
Will this ultimately be the Bears' most resounding offseason move at their most important position? Is there belief at Halas Hall that Glennon can elevate the franchise to new levels?
At the very least, the Glennon signing signals a fresh start, even if it is a curious vote of confidence in a quarterback whose last start came in Week 9 of 2014 — a 22-17 Buccaneers loss to the Browns, for what it's worth.
To this point, Glennon's NFL performance has been ordinary. Their 18 starts — 13 as a rookie, five more in 2014 — produced a completion percentage of .583; a rating of 83.2; a touchdown pass-to-interception ratio of 2:1; and only five victories. They also spent the last two seasons as Jameis Winston's backup.

Within some league circles, talent evaluators see Glennon's strong arm and intelligence and recognize potential for them to emerge as a reliable long-term starter. But Glennon's lack of mobility and inconsistent accuracy remain concerns. Whether he'll take control of the QB1 role Cutler has held since 2009 remains to be seen.
Cutler's send-off Thursday proved respectful. The soon-to-be 34-year-old leaves as the franchise's record holder in career completions, completion percentage, passing yards, touchdown passes and rating. They also leaf with a .500 record and only one playoff appearance.
The Bears made a point to publicly thank Cutler as they sent them into free agency with Pace, coach John Fox and Chairman George McCaskey all expressing gratitude in a statement. Pace highlighted Cutler's professionalism and toughness. Fox called the quarterback "one of the toughest competitors on our roster." Added McCaskey: "We are grateful to Jay for all they did as a Bear. Their ability, toughness, and intelligence were on daily display at Halas Hall and Soldier Field. They had an extraordinary impact off the field, doing things for people — especially kids — without expecting or wanting any recognition. I was and am a big fan of his."

Still, the Bears made clear they preferred to move forward with Glennon. So with that, the page was turned.
The Bears are expected to introduce Glennon at Halas Hall in the coming days, perhaps as early as Friday. And from there, Pace will be pressed to detail their attraction to the 6-foot-6 quarterback, what they value most and how they hope the former third-round pick will develop.
It will also be important to read the Bears GM for what might come next at the position. The Bears still need to add another quarterback to the roster and will have opportunity to select one in next month's draft.
But will Glennon's arrival and the financial investment made in them deter the Bears from seriously considering a quarterback in the first round? And if so, would Pace truly be able to sell hope to a success-starved fan base by pitching a 2017 quarterback combination that includes Glennon, Connor Shaw and a to-be-determined rookie likely to be no better than the fourth- or fifth-best quarterback prospect in an ordinary draft class?
For perspective, Glennon's contract is hardly crippling with the reported $19 million in guaranteed money registering as only 35 percent of what the Bears guaranteed Cutler in the lucrative extension they signed in 2014. If Glennon doesn't turn out to be the difference-maker the Bears hope they are, they'll have the opportunity to move on without great difficulty. And if they establish themselves as a successful starter, the gamble will be celebrated.
There's no doubt Glennon's arrival registers as Pace's first serious attempt at solving a quarterback quandary that has flustered so many of their predecessors. But it will also be important to monitor how many more swings he'll take.
For the last three months, Pace has emphasized how critical it will be to find the right quarterback. On Thursday, they pushed forward with that effort.

Carole Anne Green, who has fought with their elderly neighbours for five years, says they will now be forced to sell their home to pay their legal costs
A teacher could end up losing everything after being hit with a £50,000 legal bill over a bitter boundary row with neighbours which saw their fence stray just 15 inches into their land.
Carole Anne Green, who has fought with their elderly neighbours for five years, says they will now be forced to sell their home to pay their legal costs.
A judge previously declined the couple's request to have the fence pulled down but following a hearing in the Appeal Court Mrs Green was ordered to pay the fees.
They lost their fight when Judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins at Worcester County Court found the fence they had erected alongside an access lane ‘trespassed' by just more than a foot onto their neighbour's land.
The 58-year-old said: ‘This lawyers' bill is going to kill me. It's wiped out 40 years of full time work. I'll be 60 next year and I've got no savings.
‘I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to have to rely on the state, I never have. It just beggars belief.'
Mrs Green moved into an exclusive development in the Worcestershire spa town of Malvern, next to the 18th century listed manor where the late Barbara Cartland grew up.
They obtained planning permission to build a holiday let, which they advertise online for extra retirement income.
And once the apartment was built in their garden they found themselves in a bitter court battle with their neighbours Doreen and Victor Elliott, who are both in their 80s and lived in their home for more than 25 years.
Mrs Green rowed with the couple over the width of the driveway visitors would use to get to the holiday rental, which also provides access to their own home.
The pensioners set out a row of wooden batons in the ground, claiming they marked the border between their land and Mrs Green's drive.
But the teacher insisted they had put them in the wrong place and erected a concrete and wooden fence along the line they believed was correct.
In December 2012, Judge Pearce-Higgins found their fence ‘encroached' onto Mr and Mrs Elliott's land by 15 inches.
But they declined the couple's request for an order to pull the fence down, and instead awarded them damages of £2,866.
They said: ‘This is an unhappy case. Like most boundary disputes it has attracted a lot of emotion, it is largely unnecessary and it could have been resolved years ago by a modicum of common sense and a small amount of goodwill.'
Mrs Green has continued to fight their legal costs and called on Lord Justice Jackson at London's Appeal Court to help them
However, while sympathising with her, they refused their permission to appeal against the costs.
They told the judge: ‘A £50,000 costs bill for a compensation claim of £2,000 is not proportionate and it's not reasonable. It's blatant theft and profiteering.
‘The intention of the claim was to get rid of my fencing.. Trivial silliness. It failed - it was a partially won claim and the bill was 39 pages long.'

Lord Justice Jackson said: ‘I understand their grievance about the bill of costs...she says that there are so many items that it amounts to fraud or, as they put it, theft.
‘But they did not comply with the rules and lodge complaints within the proper time. I feel sympathy for their difficulties, but the courts have to observe the rules.
‘At this late stage there is nothing I can do about it. They have lost their chance to dispute their neighbours' bill of costs.
‘I'm sorry to say that none of their arguments would enable Mrs Green to appeal successfully, and these applications are refused.'
They added that they blame the proximity of the late Mrs Cartland's home for their troubles.
‘As soon as I got planning permission for my holiday let it all kicked off,' they said.
‘Just because I got that planning permission in 2008, I've had all this because of people worried about development at the bottom of their garden.
There's all this land next to my house which is landlocked which was part of Barbara Cartland's home.
I think they were worried that the planning permission and the access to my holiday rental would somehow open the way for development on that land.'

Many have parsed what President Barack Obama's critics mean when they charge that the handling of the crisis on America's southern border is “Obama's Katrina.”
The president's supporters are quick to note that this comparison is misleading and unfair. Hurricane Katrina drowned an entire urban center. American citizens died waiting for federal and state aid. Thousands of Americans, mostly of meager means, were trapped in a dying city. Some of them did not make it out alive waiting for their countrymen to save them. In that sobering moment, much of the promise of the United States was betrayed.
It is impossible to know how many children crossing the American border have died as a result of their trek across forsaken deserts. At least one 15-year-old Guatemalan boy lost their lives as the result of dehydration, but there has not been a death toll comparable to Katrina. In terms of body count, these two crises are not comparable.
But this is all Obama's supporters have going for them. The president's approach to this crisis is distinct from George W. Bush's approach to Katrina insofar as the current president is comfortable campaigning on, rather than addressing, an ongoing disaster.
Real Clear Politics columnist Carl Cannon published a dispassionate column on Sunday comparing Bush's reaction to Katrina, and the garment-rending, hyperbolic outrage their response to that crisis inspired among their liberal opponents, and Obama's response to the nightmare on the border. Cannon found that there has been little seriousness in Obama's approach to this crisis whereas Bush's approach to Katrina, while imperfect, was at least empirically measurable.
Cannon recalled how Bush's critics erupted in indignation when the White House published a photograph of the president surveying the devastation from Air Force One. Entertainers like Michael Moore and Kanye West accused the president of racism and callousness. Bush's Democratic adversaries in Congress, including then Senator Obama, were no kinder.
In hindsight, little of this seems fair. What Bush saw as they flew over the battered region shocked him. The next day, they publicly pledged $10.5 billion in federal aid, enlisted their father and Bill Clinton to help in recovery efforts, and spoke about the tragedy from the Rose Garden. The next day, they headed down there, where they literally put their arms around shell-shocked survivors, many of them black people. Bush returned again in mid-September and made a nationally televised address from Jackson Square in New Orleans. When they ran for president, then-Sen. Barack Obama seemed to forget all that. All they cared to recall was the flyover, which is more than he's done on the Texas border this year.
The president has used this crisis to push for a $4 billion supplemental funding request, but has stipulated on several occasions that these funds had to be passed by Congress before there would be any emergency response to the flood of unaccompanied children crossing the border. That does not even resemble a “response” to an acute crisis. In all past disasters of this scale, the response comes first and without hesitation. The petty bickering over how to pay for it is a secondary concern.
Obama's galling and politicized response to the border crisis does not stop there.
When he's not berating Congress for not passing their ballooning supplemental request fast enough, Obama harangues Republicans in the House for not passing the Senate's immigration reform bill – a legacy initiative Obama promised would be one of their accomplishments in their first year in office.
They have ignored Democratic lawmakers who demanded the president see the border for himself, preferring instead to maintain their distance from the crisis so as not to be too closely associated with it.
The president and their administration are happy to blame the current crisis on a Bush-era anti-human trafficking law which treats children coming into the country from non-contiguous nations differently from Mexican immigrants, but they have not demonstrated that they think changing this law to address the calamity it has supposedly precipitated should be a congressional priority.
All this paints a picture of a commander-in-chief who views this “humanitarian crisis,” as Obama called it, to be more of a political problem than a genuine source of apprehension and fear for America's border state residents, border enforcement agents, and the immigrant children trafficked into the United States.
Obama's adversaries and allies agree that, quite unlike Bush, the president sees this crisis as a political opportunity.
“There is every sign they let the crisis on the border build to put heat on Republicans and make them pass their idea of good immigration reform,” The Wall Street Journal‘s Peggy Noonan submitted. “It would be “comprehensive,” meaning huge, impenetrable and probably full of mischief. Their base wants it. It would no doubt benefit the Democratic Party in the long term.”
Francis Wilkinson, a liberal Bloomberg View columnist, concurred.
“I think they want this to be a big problem,” Wilkinson told MSNBC's hosts on Thursday. “I think they want this to be such big problem right now that Congress has to deal with it, and that the media's focused on it, and that the American public is focused on it.”
Bush's approach to Katrina was criticized by their allies and opponents alike, and some of that criticism was deserved, but they never treated the situation in New Orleans as though it was a political opportunity. That is a grotesque abuse of the public trust, but this seems to be the calculation the president and their advisors made.
“Although Obama probably doesn't have to go to the border personally to be an effective leader, they may owe George W. Bush an apology,” Cannon concluded.
Like Katrina, Obama's successors will likely study their response to the situation on the border as a case study in how not to address a crisis. The border disaster is, however, not Obama's Katrina. The president's refusal to perform the responsibilities associated with their role as the nation's chief executive makes this episode far worse.
An earlier version of this post claimed the Guatemalan boy who died of dehydration while crossing the border was 11-years-old.
While playing with Windows 7, I had no other choose as to put up solution for missing global keyboard shortcuts in Grooveshark player (who sits inside Firefox or Prism, because that's a way I roll), similar to solution in Ubuntu. Luckily it's (kinda) easy to achieve, so here we gooo!
First of all, we will need some software to begin with: Wget for Windows (grab “Complete package, except sources” download or if you are lost, here is direct link to 1.11.4 version) and AutoHotkey. Install both of them.
Now open AutoHotkey (located in your Program Files or where ever did you install it). It should ask if you would like to create a sample script in My Documents folder (if that file doesn't exist yet). What are you waiting for? Yes, of course! Great now when AutoHotkey sample script pop-up on screen wipe it clean.
Now some magic. To create new keyboard shortcut for Grooveshark player using keySharky API, just add a line that goes something like this:
1 HOTKEY::Run, WGET_EXE --spider --no-cache KEYSHARKY_API, , Hide
In place of HOTKEY you could write ^H which when translated into keyboard shortcut would assign CTRL + H combo. Other basic modifier keys are # Windows key, ! Alt and + Shift. For more, check out AutoHotkey documentation on that subject.
For this example, I will use ^!+Z as CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + Z .
Next in line: WGET_EXE you must replace with wget.exe binary location path. By default in Windows 7 (64-bit), Wget installs in “C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\wget.exe”. But if you aren't sure where did you install it in your machine, you can search for it by doing Start (Orb) > Run > cmd (or just search for cmd). When in command line execute this command. What it does is, tries to find wget.exe in your C:\ drive and return its full path.
1 dir c:\ /s /b | find "wget.exe"
Last on list is KEYSHARKY_API, but how to setup/use it you can (and should) read here. When done, it should look something like this:
1 ^!+Z::Run, "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\wget.exe" --spider --no-cache "http://localhost:8800/play", , Hide
Hillary Clinton won the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, according to a CNN instant poll on Wednesday.
Fifty-two percent of debate watchers felt the Democratic White House candidate won the match-up, versus 39 percent for their Republican challenger, Donald J. Trump.
That meant Clinton swept all three televised debates, according to CNN's snapshot polls conducted immediately after the events.

But viewers strongly felt that Trump was the more aggressive debater on Wednesday, according to the poll. Sixty percent said that Trump was on the attack more than their opponent, with just 23 percent saying that about Clinton.
The network cautioned that it measures a sample of potential voters who watched the debate, as opposed to surveying all voters. That sample skews slightly Democratic, because Democrats are a bit more likely than Republicans to watch the debates.

During the debate, Clinton and Trump clashed sharply on numerous issues, from abortion rights to fitness for the presidency to relations with Russia. In one notable moment, Trump cautioned that better immigration controls were necessary because the U.S. has a lot of “bad hombres” coming into the country, presumably from Mexico.
At another point, Trump parried one of Clinton's attacks by leaning into the microphone and saying, “Such a nasty woman.” Both lines drew vigorous online reaction.

The 90-minute debate, which aired live from Las Vegas, Nevada, was carried on multiple networks and live streams. Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel was the moderator.
When Hue Jackson pulled the plug on DeShone Kizer in favor of Kevin Hogan, the Cleveland Browns coach was looking broader than just changing the quarterback or chasing elusive wins. Switching from the erratic, unreliable Kizer to the more stable, steady Hogan will help the Browns develop the other positions around the quarterback.
The Browns are painfully young all over the offense, but especially at the skill positions. Kizer's incapability of running the offense as it is designed was preventing the progress of all those other young players.
David Njoku is a prime example. The first-round rookie tight end was withering on the vine with Kizer, who struggled to find him. Sometimes quite literally; this is an easy pitch-and-catch touchdown and basic read, and Kizer misses it, fleeing a clean pocket with their eyes down.
When Hogan came into the game, they hooked up with Njoku for two fantastic receptions, one of them a touchdown. It's fair to say the Browns do not get those points with Kizer in the game. Now Njoku has higher confidence and has proved they can do more. Kizer was holding them back.
That's true with some of the other young receivers. They are taught all their football lives to trust that the QB will find them when they're open, especially as the primary target on a play. But Kizer couldn't do that for the likes of Rashard Higgins or Ricardo Louis — not consistently enough.
With Hogan at the controls, the Browns can more properly develop the receiving talent. It will also help the offensive line, which doesn't have to worry about the quarterback behind them being when or where he's not supposed to be.
Does it help Kizer's development to sit and watch? Maybe. Does it help everyone else's development to have Kizer sit and watch? Absolutely, and the team around Kizer — if they ever does develop — will be a lot better for it.
For Michaela Bradshaw, surviving Survivor is going to come down to a few key factors: a little bit of luck, a few deals here and there, and keeping their eyebrows from telling too much.
“My face is very telling,” the 25-year-old says with a smile you can hear over the phone, during our eight-minute call the day before they and the cast of Survivor: Millennials vs Gen X fly out to Fiji for their 39-day adventure. Based on their own self-assessment, Michaela does not suffer fools easily — and Survivor is a game filled with fools and foolish decisions.
With that said, Michaela knows a thing or two about overcoming challenging odds. During our conversation, they go into great detail about how they managed to pay off their student loans by the time they turned 23. In other words, Michaela sees money as a powerful motivator, one that's strong enough to keep their facial expressions in check… or at least to give it the good old college try.
“Michaela, are you really going to let a facial expression cause you to lose something this big? Heck no,” they tell me, and herself. “So you need to learn how to be extra bubbly, how to hide what you feel, and than just find that rock with the camera and tell the camera the truth, and let the people see that happy face all of the time.”
Click here to read Michaela's bio, and read on for our chat:
Wigler: How are you doing, Michaela?
Michaela: I'm doing fantastic. I'm pretty excited!
Wigler: Freaking out at all?
Michaela: That was yesterday.
Wigler: What happened yesterday?
Michaela: Yesterday, it's like, you're excited, and then you're scared. They take your phone, and it's like, “Oh my god. This thing is real.” Then you're sitting there and it's like, dang! I can't talk to anybody! It's like going back to 1992. Who has a beeper? I need to borrow a quarter to use a payphone. It's crazy. But I'm freaking excited.
Wigler: Are you a fan of the show?
Michaela: Yeah! So, the funny thing about me is that I gave up TV for a couple of years in order to run a business. When I was reached out to about [playing], I started binge-watching Survivor episodes — basically the only television show I've watched since October.
Wigler: What's the appeal? Why are you excited to take this on?
Michaela: It's a crazy challenge. It tests everything about you that's social. Part of what I do, with vacation sales, involves learning people. You have to learn people. That's one thing I've messed up a lot on in my own personal life. My thing is that if I don't care about you as a person, then I just don't deal with you. But here, you have to learn how to manage all of those dynamics. It's the ultimate freaking challenge, and an awesome way to [make money]. If you make it all the way, you win a million dollars. So what the heck? Where else can you do that?
Wigler: Going back to the social thing, is that still a weakness for you? When you don't like someone, do they tend to know it?
Michaela: My face is very telling.
Wigler: Uh oh.
Michaela: Yeah. (Laughs.) But the thing about it is, if you have a weakness and you know about it, you can make adjustments. So I've known about this. Now I have a million dollar reason to fix that problem. I've found with myself that when you attach money or goals to something I need to fix, I'm ten times better at fixing it, then just fixing it to make somebody feel better. So it's like, Michaela, are you really going to let a facial expression cause you to lose something this big? Heck no. So you need to learn how to be extra bubbly, how to hide what you feel, and then just find that rock with the camera and tell the camera the truth, and let the people see that happy face all of the time.
Wigler: It sounds like we can look forward to some fun facial expressions from you this season.
Michaela: You know when they have sound effects that go with eyebrows moving? My eyebrows are gonna go POW! These eyebrows and this face are going to be twitching by the end of this thing.
Wigler: Your personal claim to fame is that you've paid off all of your student loans. Can you tell me more about that experience?
Michaela: Part of my push in going to college is that I wanted to find a way to be successful. My mom used to work for a big company and made a lot of money, but we never saw them Then they left that to do something more fulfilling, and on top of life events, ended up being broke. It's been a financial struggle for my family for a long time. I saw college as a way out. I was at the top of my class in high school. I had lots of offers to go to college in different places. I picked a place that I didn't know how much it was going to cost me until I got there. It was a real struggle. I had to take out like $15,000 my first year. I worked two or three jobs. I didn't have really any fun in college, because the whole thing was, when you graduate, you'll be successful. Then I graduated, and I was looking at these loans, and was like, man, you know what? I don't want to be in debt like my parents were. I don't want to fake and front like all these people acting like they have it together, and then they're piling their bills on the table, deciding which one to pick. So I said, I've been broke my whole life. One of these days, I want to be successful and rich and wealthy. But right now, I'm used to being broke. So even though I have income, I'm going to act like I have nothing. I'm going to get this debt off my shoulders. Maybe once I get there, I can figure out how this wealth thing works. So for my first couple of years out of college, I didn't eat out at lunch. I drove around in my same 1992 Honda Accord back and forth to work every day. I didn't shop. I didn't go buy stuff. I lived very poor. I didn't have cable, I didn't have Internet, I worked all night in the summer so I didn't run my AC, and I worked all night in the winter so I didn't have to run my air. It sucked, but I figured that if you can find a way to pinch pennies, why not find a way to make more money? So in addition to pinching pennies, I made myself more open to other ways of making money, and found out that if you only make a couple of extra hundred dollars a month, if you put that directly toward your debt, you can make it go away. So I ended up paying all of my debt from college a few months before my 23rd birthday.
Wigler: Wow.
Michaela: It was super exciting. Then I was like, “Alright, I've done that! I'm not trying to go back in debt.” (Laughs.) So then it was about moving forward from here. It was an exciting thing. It was a big accomplishment. Maybe Survivor can be the next thing I can accomplish.
Wigler: Looking at your bio, your hobbies include cuddling…
Michaela: Yeah. (Laughs.) Only one person though. You can't cuddle everybody. That makes you a [redacted], I think.
Wigler: Hey, it gets cold out there!
Michaela: You just have to sleep in the middle of the bed, so you can at least switch directions in the middle of the night. But I'm good at it, so maybe they'll keep me around!
Wigler: The Cuddle Strategy. I like it. You list your reason for being on Survivor as leaving an inheritance for your children's children. Do you have children?
Michaela: No! Heck no. Children cost money! (Laughs.) I gotta get the money first. The average child costs more than $100,000. I need $100,000 before I can have one.
Wigler: Pet peeves include when incompetent people try to instruct you, when people do things inefficiently or wrong, when you lose or when other people make you lose… Michaela, you do realize you're about to play Survivor, right?
Michaela: I know. That's why I'm telling you to get those sound effects ready, because these eyebrows are going to be going ham. I'm putting myself into a place where all of my buttons are going to be pushed. My responses to them, in addition to some luck and other things I'm able to work out, but really my responses to them will determine how far I get in the game. What better way to improve yourself? Make it do or die, man.

“The most important thing is to see money markets normalize,” said Mr. Zandi, who has advised the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. “If banks start lending to each other that would be a very positive sign and that would be key.”
Many borrowers are being penalized in the bond markets, if they can borrow money at all. Credit spreads — the premium investors demand to lend money to everybody but the federal government — need to fall, said Jerry Webman, chief economist and senior investment officer for OppenheimerFunds. Last week, in a rare reversal that occurs only in times of extreme stress in the credit markets, tax-free municipal bonds were yielding more than Treasuries, which are not tax exempt.
Many municipal and corporate borrowers were unable to borrow money in the credit markets last week. Mr. Webman said the economy could suffer if those tight conditions persist.
“Credit is man's confidence in man,” Mr. Webman said. “That confidence in the financial system needs to increase.”

Analysts said the market would be watching closely how the Treasury Department structured its planned purchases of troubled assets from financial firms. The government has suggested it might use auctions to establish prices for the securities and loans it plans to acquire. Mr. Zandi said the Treasury should disclose more details in the next several weeks and conduct its first auctions soon after the presidential elections.
Once investors have a better sense of what the troubled assets are worth, they will become more willing to invest in ailing financial firms that have not been able to raise capital because analysts fear they have not fully disclosed the quality of their assets.
“We need to get clarity with respects to which institutions need to write down their assets and which institutions are well-capitalized,” Mr. Zandi said. “That would provide solace to investors who would then provide capital to the system.”
Furthermore, once financial firms have raised more capital, a crucial test will be whether they plow that new money back into the market through loans and investments in businesses, said Mr. Webman. If banks remain fearful and hoard cash instead, as they have done in recent months, the rescue effort will only have a modest impact on the economy and financial system.

“We need more capital coming into the market and actual investor money coming through the banks into economic activity,” Mr. Webman said. “That's what I would really like to see happen.”
But even if the government intervention is successful, economists and investors said it would not restore the days of easy credit that prevailed during the recent housing boom. Mortgage rates should come down, but they are unlikely to return to the levels seen in 2003 and 2004. Also banks are unlikely to make many adjustable-rate loans without verifying the incomes and assets of borrowers.
Furthermore, the rescue might not forestall a recession, said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer for the bond department at American Century Investments. Though they think the rescue efforts will help the economy, Mr. MacEwen expects bankruptcies to spread, home prices to fall and unemployment to rise.
“Having this plan contains the damage to some extent,” Mr. MacEwen said. But, they added, “I think we are going to see slowing in economic activity. This is like steering a battleship, you make course adjustment but they take time to take effect.”
National Enquirer owner David Pecker has been mulling a potential bid to buy out struggling publisher Time Inc. TIME, -1.06% according to a story in the July 3 edition of The New Yorker. The nugget is all but buried in an in-depth profile on Pecker's friendship with, and their tabloid's support for, President Donald Trump. Back in April the Sports Illustrated, People and Time publisher was entertaining bids, before ultimately deciding not to put itself up for sale. However, as the New Yorker story notes, even if Time were on the market, Pecker couldn't buy the company outright himself. They would need a deep-pocketed partner. Time, like many peers, has struggled to contend with a declining print business, recently cutting 300 jobs in order to facilitate a shift to digital. Shares of Time have declined more than 23% in 2017, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% has gained more than 8%.

BANGKOK, Thailand — It's a call center cliche, familiar to many Americans who've picked up phones to contest bogus bank charges or gripe about a laptop on the skids.
The agent who answers goes by a common US name, perhaps Larry or Jennifer. Yet the accent is unmistakably Indian, sometimes hard to comprehend or laced with unfamiliar idioms.
It's no secret that Indian call centers have an accent problem. That problem is now proving to be incredibly costly. Accents, according to one of the nation's top trade associations, are largely to blame for India losing 70 percent of its call center industry to the Philippines. Call centers shifting from India to the Philippines will be responsible for $30 billion in lost foreign exchange earnings this decade.
The head of India's Associated Chambers of Commerce offers a blunt assessment of their nation's accent-related woes. “Employees in Philippines call centers speak English fluently with a neutral accent, which is what customers look for and that is something missing in Indian accents,” said D.S. Rawat, the group's general secretary. “That is a prime reason why [call center] business is thriving in that country.”
Of course, a "neutral" accent is in the ear of the beholder. To call centers, that beholder is America, the world's largest pool of consumers and the nation call centers are incentivized to placate.
India, a former British colony, is second only to the United States when it comes to the volume of English speakers. But the Philippines — a moderately poor former American colony — has a larger base of English-fluent workers who can more easily pull off a California accent or even chitchat about American Idol. For a $500-per-month salary, they have what it takes to sooth grumpy callers irate over cell phone roaming fees.
Americans on the line with one of the Philippines' rapidly expanding call centers may have no idea they're connected to a tropical archipelago in Southeast Asia. To the American ear, Filipino speech can sound similar to the Latino accent, a linguistic legacy of three centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines.
“Accent is a big part of the story,” said Gillian Virata, senior executive director of the IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines, or IBPAP. “We have a ‘neutral' accent and we don't speak fast. Some Indians do because their dialect affects the way they speak English.”
The English language proliferated in the Philippines after the US triumphed in the Spanish-American war in 1898 and took the island nation as its spoils. The next five decades of US occupation were characterized by gruesome subjugation but also the rise of a public education system emphasizing English.
The outcome: American cultural fingerprints are still easy to see in the modern Philippines. The nation adores basketball and cheeseburgers. Unlike in India, where a call center agent named Vikram may transform into “Victor” when they come to work, a Filipino is more likely to have a Christianized name familiar to Americans (such as Mark or Maria) in real life.
Many Filipinos are already primed on American pop culture. But call centers try to fill in the gaps. “When I've visited call centers, they might have the TV turned to the Rose Bowl,” Virata said. “We're not very familiar with American football and they need to know what's exciting the people they're speaking with.”
Cultural dissonance with India can someimes disintegrate into abusive tirades. Some Indian firms, in an effort to reverse severe job turnover, have even hired counselors for agents subjected to racist abuse that leaves them in tears, according to a report in The Guardian.
Meanwhile, the Philippines' edge translates into huge profits. Call center-related industries now account for roughly 5 percent of the national GDP, according to Virata, and is projected to hit 10 percent this decade.
Maintaining growth will require more agent specialization: for example, trained Filipino nurses phoning US patients after surgery to check their symptoms. The British government is even relying on a Philippines center to process payroll claims for its foreign diplomatic offices — including its embassy in India.
Within three years, the industry is expected to employ 1.3 million Filipinos, up from 900,000 last year, according to IBPAP. This expansion is coming at India's expense. Even CEOs of Indian outsourcing giants have thrown up their hands and opened centers in the Philippines.
This boom is also transforming the way some Filipinos live.
A 3 p.m. call from New Jersey rings a phone at 3 a.m. in Manila, the nation's capital and its call center hub. Agents' shifts often end around dawn. Bars situated around call centers offer 7 a.m. happy hour specials to workers on their way home, where agents flop down in bedrooms with blacked-out windows.
In Manila, traveling call-center executives can find hotels that won't run noisy vacuum cleaners during the day and which serve breakfast in the late afternoon. A construction firm called Megaworld is even spending $5 billion to create mini-cities — with offices, shops and homes — that operate on the American sleep/wake cycle.
But according to the crop of message boards and blogs run by Filipino call center agents, adopting vampire hours has its social costs. Common complaints include poor diet, abundant stress and even a reputation for sexual flings in the office.

Does My Religion Look Big In This? Liberalism, Ideology, Islam and Self-Image
By Shafiul Huq
The language in which we articulate ourselves politically is inseparable from the the ideas in which our politics is grounded. Too often, Muslims and “community leaders” use terms and ideas that exist outside of Islam while ostensibly trying to defend it.
So why would Muslim leaders stand themselves so close to ideals and notable people that are time and again implemented to beat down on the very notion of Islam?
Take, for example, freedom of speech. It is the go-to line for any argument against the scholarly stance on the depiction of our Prophet ﷺ, especially so in the events surrounding the Charlie Hebdo aftermath.
Muslim leaders who stand by freedom of speech will honourably disagree with the depiction of the Prophet, but then sometimes defend someone like Charlie Hebdo's “right to offend”.
It seems that the key concern here is about the “international criticism” of Islam that erupted after the attacks in France. That it doesn't matter what the motives of the attackers are, as it leads to a concerted international criticism of Islam.
So will Muslims defending “freedom of speech” make Islam look good internationally? Will it undo the “reputational damage” done to Islam by such attackers as those in France?
Allying oneself with the rights of someone like Charlie Hebdo is symptomatic of an anxiety that grips some community leaders who seem to fret much about the “image of Islam”; that the “image” becomes more of a priority than Islam itself. And this image of Islam that concerns them so much is that seen through Western eyes. Therefore, the politics of the representation of Islam as seen from the vantage point of the Western observer becomes the politics of these leaders, rather than a politics based on Islam itself.
Such politics can only be possible if one speaks the language through which the West understands the world and depicts it. When Islam is also depicted in this language for Western consumption, Islam becomes reduced from a great religion that led humanity to divine guidance for over a millennium to an object of knowledge in the ideological universe of the West only to be constructed and reconstructed through an Orientalist discourse.
Let me explain this point further by looking at the issue of insulting the Prophet. If one were to draw on an Islamic vocabulary to address as grave an issue as insulting the Prophet, one would address it from the point of view of its implication on one's faith (‘aqeedah), the punishment applicable for such an action, and in the absence of the proper state and judicial structure to implement the punishment, the responsibility of Muslims to condemn such actions as per the principles of enjoining good and forbidding evil. Never was this topic ever discussed by Islamic scholars from the perspective of “freedom of speech”.
Yet, given the dominance of the West and its secular liberal discourse in the present world, some Muslims feel the urgency to placate Western anxieties by issuing reassurances of Muslim support for freedom of speech even if that means tolerating the most hideous forms of insults hurled at the man whom Muslims love more than their own selves. The insult of the Prophet becomes another case study for the liberal experiment of the extent to which freedom of speech is feasible.
This is exacerbated by the glaring inconsistencies that arise out of a selective application of liberal values as they have been raised on a number of occasions elsewhere by aware observers and commentators. When we speak of sensitive Islamic issues in Western terms, even acting in the best interest of the Muslim community, we inevitably reaffirm Western paradigms and associated logic underlying them.
Going back to the question regarding whether Muslims defending “freedom of speech” would make Islam look good, the premise is practically impossible for two reasons. Firstly, once we borrow a Western vocabulary to represent Islam, even if in the most beautiful of ways, Islam does not remain Islam anymore. It becomes an “image” for the West to observe, scrutinise, commentate on and possibly even mould it in the West's own image.
Secondly, the many “freedoms” of liberalism are part of a Eurocentric discourse that has historically painted the Muslim as a threat. Consider, for example, the contrasts that we often hear being made between, say, the “free” western woman and the subjugated Muslim woman, the “freedom” and progressiveness of democracy and the backwardness and barbarity of the shari'ah, and so on and so forth. Therefore, for Muslims to adopt this Eurocentric language which inevitably marginalises their own religion is self-defeating.
The fact that some Muslims, despite their faith and their prophet being offended, still defend “freedom of speech” demonstrates the homogenising power of liberalism. Liberalism is not a celebration of diversity. And sloganeering for “freedom of speech” does not necessarily mean tolerance towards, let alone promotion and celebration of, alternative thoughts and expressions. Rather, “freedom of speech” and the entire package of liberal discourse has the totalising effect of enforcing a secular liberal language on all, while displacing and marginalising alternative voices that do not conform to a Western frame of reference.
Sure, “freedom of speech” gives the speaker the freedom to speak, but it divests them of all languages to speak with except its own.

After eight years of Chris Christie, New Jersey voters can be forgiven for wanting to elect the complete opposite: a nice guy, who promises things rather than threatens them. But before Garden Staters pick Democrat Phil Murphy on Nov. 7, they should consider that the original version of Murphy — Jon Corzine — was how people got desperate enough to vote for Christie in the first place.
The polls show Murphy with a big lead over Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, their Republican opponent. Before the first debate last Tuesday, Murphy was ahead by 14 points. But at the debate, Guadagno demonstrated they aren't a Christie clone — and just as important, they showed themselves to be the only candidate who lives anywhere near reality.
Which is: New Jersey cannot pay its pensions. It cannot pay them even when the economy is good — as it is now (sort of) with tax revenues up 4 percent in the past year.
New Jersey owes $93.1 billion in unfunded-pension promises, up from less than $4.4 billion (after inflation) in 2008. This exceeds New Jersey's $42.7 billion in bonds — money it owes to investors, not retirees.
Christie has many flaws, but over eight years, they have made bigger pension payments than any governor before him. Despite this $8.8 billion — including $2.5 billion this year — costs have outraced him.
Last year, state pension funds took in nearly $12 billion in contributions. But they paid $17.5 billion in benefits.
Guadagno realizes this. “We would need $15 billion” — not $2.5 billion — “out of a $34 billion [annual state] budget” to shore up pensions, they said. “We know that's just not realistic. We are hiring 21-year-old kids to teach in our schools and promising them a pension that we know they will not have.”
This is true, and immoral. Guadagno promises to honor pension commitments to “current retirees.” For everyone else, they have some sound ideas.
They propose transferring the risk of the police and fire pensions to workers themselves. That is, having the state and local governments make fixed contributions, with unions bearing the risk for market downturns or too-young retirement agents.
They also propose to move civilian public workers into 401(k)-style pension funds.
This is brave — braver than what Christie ever did, despite all the bluster. And Guadagno proposes this without screaming at teachers.
It's OK to propose an alternative solution. But Murphy doesn't do that. Instead, they said repeatedly, “We will fully fund our pension obligations, and we'll get there as fast as we can. We have a credible plan.”
Guadagno didn't have to voice skepticism. A debate moderator told the audience that it's “obviously impossible” to pay the pensions, and said of Murphy's plan, “I still haven't heard how.”
Murphy doesn't just want to maintain the impossible. They want to make things even more impossible. New Jersey has benefited during the Christie regime from a 2 percent cap on annual raises for police and firefighters, which keeps property taxes from rising even higher.
Murphy won't say whether he'd keep the cap. After they hemmed and hawed, Guadagno said, “I would extend the . . . cap because it saves the taxpayers billions of dollars.”
Another difference: Murphy wants to “make millionaires . . . pay their fair share,” they say on their Web site. Here, too, he's short on details. But it likely means a hike in the nearly 9 percent top income-tax rate, if past proposals are a guide.
For this to succeed, New Jersey will have to build a Trump-style wall to keep the rich in.
On some questions, neither candidate has an answer. Both want to build the Gateway tunnel under the Hudson to New York — but neither has said how Jersey will pay. And it's hard to see how Guadagno's going to make good on their central campaign pledge: cutting property taxes.
Still, Guadagno doesn't pretend that gimmicks will fix New Jersey. Murphy does: They want to start a “public bank” to invest the state's tax revenues in infrastructure and student loans.
Again, this puts them right back where they started: If New Jersey had billions of dollars in tax revenue sitting around, it wouldn't be in this mess.
And it's reminiscent of the gimmicks Corzine tried during their own governorship, like selling off the turnpike to pay off debt.
Christie has treated New Jersey voters, and everyone else, with contempt. But in this race, only one candidate is showing respect for the voters — by (mostly) telling the truth.

Some of the most successful fighters against the Islamic State are being isolated and attacked by America's new favorite ally in the region.
Kurdish militias are achieving the stated goals of the Obama administration — to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIS — as well or better than any other fighting force. From Kobane to the recent liberation of Tel Abyad, Kurdish militias have won hard-fought victories against ISIS fighters in Syria, while preventing the advance of ISIS into northern Iraq.
What's more, the Kurds in northern Syria have established a political order like few others in this region of the world. Known as Rojava, the Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria are governed through participatory decision-making forums that include councils made up of women, Christians, Yazidis and Muslims. David Graeber, a leading figure in the Occupy Wall Street movement, calls Rojava a “remarkable democratic experiment.”
But those gains are now in danger as Turkey, which has a long history of enmity towards ethnic Kurds and fears the potential for a Kurdish state to its immediate south, in northern Syria or Iraq, flexes its political muscle in Washington and applies its military might in the Middle East.
Behind the scenes, American lobbyists employed by Turkey started working to block U.S. military assistance to Kurdish fighters last year, lobbying disclosures show.
This past week, the Turkish government made two critical air bases available to U.S. forces, a long-sought concession that allows the U.S. military to launch anti-ISIS raids more quickly. And it began its own airstrikes against ISIS. But that move is increasingly being seen as something of a feint, with Turkey's main focus being a new offensive against Kurdish militants.
Simultaneously with its announcement about U.S. access to the air bases, the Turkish government broke its truce with Kurdish militants. During the past week, the Turkish military began attacking Kurdish bases in Iraq and allegedly in Syria as well. The Turkish government says its campaign is simply a response to an attack by the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), a separatist group, and has emphasized that it is also targeting ISIS.
On Friday, Turkey launched a series of mass arrests. Though some ISIS supporters were detained, the “vast majority” of arrests, according to the local press, were of leftists and Kurds. And on Tuesday, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called for a crackdown on the People's Democratic Party, a Kurdish-leftist political party that gained seats in parliament for the first time last month.
Turkey intends to use the increased airstrikes to create a “safe zone” for Sunni Arab militias, which as the New York Times noted, would come at the expense of Kurdish fighters.
Rather than condemn the attacks on the Kurds, the Obama administration praised Turkey's government for making its air base available.
Turkey's role as a coalition partner in the campaign against ISIS has been and remains the subject of some controversy. For years, foreign jihadi fighters trickled through Turkey's porous border to join the ranks of ISIS. The Guardian reported on Saturday that a recent U.S.-led raid on an ISIS official responsible for selling black market oil to traders in Turkey revealed direct dealings between Turkish officials and ranking ISIS members
Vice President Joseph Biden remarked on this strange relationship with Turkey in a speech in October 2014. Turkey, Biden said, is “so determined to take down [Syrian President Bashar Assad's government] and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war, what did they do? They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens, thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad — except that the people who were being supplied were al Nusra and al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.”
Biden quickly apologized, as good an example as any of the pressure to maintain long-standing U.S.-Turkey business and military relationships — and the intractable power of the Turkish lobby, which is among the biggest spenders on foreign lobbying in Washington and a major sponsor of congressional junkets.
Turkey employs an all-star lobbying team of former government officials, including former Democratic lawmakers Dick Gephardt and Al Wynn; former Republican Senator Tim Hutchinson; retired Central Intelligence Agency Director Porter Goss; and, until they were indicted in June and left the Dickstein Shapiro law firm, former Speaker of the House Denny Hastert. Others on the payroll include Brian Forni, a former Democratic aide, the law firm Greenberg Traurig, and Goldin Solutions, a media strategy firm.
A number of public relations firms and lawyers help sponsor junkets to American politicians and journalists to visit Turkey. Turkish Coalition of America, a Turkish interest group that helps to sponsor the trips, retainedBrown, Lloyd and James, the lobby group that, in an ironic twist, previously represented Assad's wife.
Recently, the Turkish lobby has worked to block military support to the Kurds working to defeat ISIS.
The battle has been over legislation that would allow President Obama to bypass the Iraqi government in Baghdad and directly provide Iraqi Kurds with the heavy weapons and armored vehicles needed to battle ISIS. In the House, Reps. Ed Royce, R-Calif., and Elliot Engel, D-N.Y., the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairperson and ranking member, introduced a bill last November, and then again in March, to provide the administration with the appropriate authority to arm the Kurds.
David Thompson, a former Capitol Hill staffer retained by the Turkish government, lobbied House Republican leaders on the Royce-Engel legislation in late 2014. The firm contacted aides to GOP leaders Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise regarding the bill, according to the statementfiled by Thompson's law firm, Dickstein Shapiro, with the Justice Department in January.
Turkish interests say they have legitimate concerns about the bill. “Supporting a militia for money and then unleashing them into the wild of terrorism we think is irresponsible,” said Gunay Evinch, a longtime attorney for the Turkish government and former president of the Assembly of Turkish American Associations.
“There are tidal wave kinds of ripple effects that could be caused just by flooding a particular group within a broader group with heavy weapons and it could dwarf the ISIS problem or multiply it to many types of problems,” Evinch added. Evinch said that they were speaking only on behalf of the ATAA board of directors, not the Turkish government. They noted that they met with Turkish embassy officials, who said they had supplied information to congressional intelligence officials about the dangers of supplying Kurdish forces with weapons.
Human rights watchdogs point out that in some areas of Iraq, Kurdish forces have been linked with efforts to segregate Arab and Kurdish refugees.
Embassy officials and Thompson did not respond to multiple request for comment about the bill. The Turkish embassy later sent a fact-sheet claiming, “Though acting with different motivations, [ISIS] and the PKK share similar tactics and goals.”
President Erdoğan has been clear about the threat posed by Kurdish militias. “I say to the international community that whatever price must be paid, we will never allow the establishment of a new state on our southern frontier in the north of Syria,” Erdoğan said last month.
“Turkey has legitimate concerns about the international and American long-term policy towards Syria as well as in Iraq,” G. Lincoln McCurdy, the president of the Turkish Coalition of America, said in October. McCurdy, whose group organizes congressional junkets to Turkey and serves as the treasurer of a pro-Turkey political action committee, noted that they are working to improve Turkey's image as a member of the anti-ISIS coalition, and stressed the need to highlight Turkey's role as a major host country for refugees.
“We're in a very strong position because of the PACs,” McCurdy explained to a gathering of Turkish American leaders and Turkish embassy officials in March. They pointed to the strong pro-Turkey sentiment of Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., a first-year student lawmaker and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
At the event, Boyle took the stage, praising Turkey as “one of our best friends, if not the best friend, in the region.” They went on to chide their fellow lawmakers for introducing “nine anti-Turkish resolutions,” a reference to legislation to recognize the Armenian genocide and condemn Turkey's efforts to restrict Internet freedom. “This is wrong and counterproductive and bad for U.S.-Turkish policy,” they declared. About a week after Boyle's remarks, McCurdy's Turkish Coalition PAC contributed $1,000 to Boyle's reelection campaign.
When the Royce-Engel bill to arm Kurds against ISIS was reintroduced this year, most members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee signed on as co-sponsors. Boyle was not among them. Asked why they did not sign onto the legislation, Boyle's spokesperson declined to comment.
Earlier this summer, the Senate rejected a similar bill to arm the Kurds fighting ISIS, with opponents citing White House concerns that such an effort would sow division within Iraq's unity government.
It's not the first time Washington has turned its back on the Kurds.
In 1991, President George H.W. Bush's public suggestion that Iraqis “take matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside” encouraged a Kurdish and Shiite uprising against the Baathist regime. But when the uprising occurred, the Bush administration provided no support and thousands of Shiite and Kurdish Iraqis were slaughtered by the Saddam regime.

The Big Takeaway:
The meat of the show was a good, wrestling-oritented program with Roman Reigns, Alberto Del Rio, Dean Ambrose and Kevin Owens advancing to the semifinals of the WWE World Heavyweight Tournament. Unfortunately, the bread that contained that meat was a bad segment with the Undertaker, Kane and the Wyatts combined with the most disgusting angle the WWE has done in years. It was a segment so putrid, it's one of those times you wonder how the WWE won the Monday Night Wars, then remember it was more the stupidity of the opposition than the skill of the winners.
Show Recap:
They opened the show with a moment of silence to honor the victims in the terrorist attacks in France. In retrospect, this was mordibly ironic.
All four quarterfinal matches in the World Title tournament will air tonight. That includes Neville vs. Kevin Owens and Alberto Del Rio vs. Kalisto.
A group of faceless druids in dark robes came out in advance of the Undertaker and Kane's entrance. The preceding three sentences took ten minutes of air time.
Kane said they reserved a special place for Bray Wyatt and their family in the darkest pits of hell. Apparently, they run constant reruns of 1999 Nitro there.
Undertaker said Wyatt's kind of evil is no match for theirs. They said the Brothers of Destruction have already decided their destiny, and they will never Rest in Peace. This led to the Wyatt Family coming out.
Bray said the Brothers of Destruction have reigned supreme for 25 years, and that is long enough. They said it's time for a new Army of Darkness to emerge. Wyatt said they are the Face of Fear, and after the Survivor Series, they'll just be remembered as the Brothers they destroyed. Wyatt added that as for the Undertaker's Creatures of the Night, they are mine. The Wyatt flash went off, the lights went on, and the druids all emerged wearing goat face masks. Around 8 of them charged the ring, but Undertaker and Kane quickly disposed of them, choke slamming two of them. Luke Harper, Braun Strowman and Eric Rowan started to go after them, but Wyatt called them back. Wyatt told them to wait until the Survivor Series, but until then, Follow the Buzzards. Does Wyatt want to start using those magical powers they showed off two weeks ago? Or has that gone the way of those earrings that Dolph Ziggler gave Summer Rae in September?
Kevin Owens defeated Neville in the quarterfinals of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship tournament (10:44)
Owens avoided a Red Arrow and got the pin with the Pop-Up Power Bomb. As good a match as you would expect. A great false finish where Neville went for the Red Arrow, but Owens grabbed the ropes, causing Neville to crash to the mat. Owens went for the Pop-Up Power Bomb, but Neville did a leap frog and pulled off a Reverse Frankensteiner that everybody bought as the finish. Owens kicked out. Neville teased the Red Arrow early, but Owens rolled out of the ring. So Neville responded with a Moonsault to the floor.
Out of nowhere, they showed flashback footage of Paige pinning A.J. Lee from April 2014 to win the Divas Championship in their first night on the main roster. This was done to play up a contract signing between Paige and Charlotte later tonight for Survivor Series.
HHH and Owens had a conversation backstage and the two shook hands.
They aired still photographs from WWE.com of Seth Rollins undergoing surgery for their torn ACL. He's now getting a total babyface buildup for their return, including a viral campaign using the slogan "Redesign. Rebuild. Reclaim." That indicates some major heel turn has to be coming soon.
Tyler Breeze defeated R. Truth (4:06)
Tyler Breeze won with the Beauty Shot. Still can't make sense of Breeze making their company debut with a job to Ambrose last week.
Dean Ambrose defeated Dolph Ziggler in the quarterfinals of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship tournament (16:41)
Ambrose won after hitting Dirty Deeds following a scramble. Another very good match and this show is off to a solid start. Lots of good near falls, including Ziggler selling their knee, but still hitting a Superkick and a Famouser. They had a scientific match, similar to the old Ring of Honor Pure Championship matches. Unique spot where Ambrose and Ziggler were on the top rope together, where they did a double knockdown spot to the floor after landing simultaneous right hands.
Ambrose cut a promo afterwards saying if they became champion at Survivor Series, there would be less talking and more action. Well, he's screwed.
The New Day defeated the Usos and Ryback by DQ (5:49)
Lame finish. Jey Uso got the heat for most of the match after a Hope onto Big E. and Xavier Woods. Uso got the heat for most of the match until Ryback went into the ring illegally and shoved the referee for the DQ. Afterwards, Ryback threw Woods onto Big E. and Kofi Kingston. The Usos had their faces painted like the French flag.
HHH talked with Cesaro before their match with Roman Reigns. HHH told Cesaro they had everything it took to make it to the top, but they were lacking that extra something. They had the ability. HHH, using dialogue that sounds like it came straight from Vince McMahon's mouth, told them to reach for the brass ring tonight, basically implying they could join the Authority if they beat Reigns. Cesaro looked at their hands after HHH left.
Reigns came out and talked about their fan section, dubbed "The Roman Empire." Reigns said they knew the road was going to be tougher for them since they refused to join the Authority. But he's gone too far to sell out now. After getting booed in Manchester, Reigns got a much better reception tonight.
Roman Reigns defeated Cesaro in the quarterfinals of the WWE World Heavyweight Title Tournament (20:21)
Reigns won after a series of counters ending with the Superman Punch and the Spear. Another solid match, but I didn't think it was as good as Ambrose-Ziggler. Cesaro did a great job of carrying him. Cesaro went for the equalizer late, but Reigns escaped and got the finishing combination. Earlier, Cesaro twirled Reigns around for a 6-rep Giant Swing, which turned into a Sharpshooter, then a crossface before Reigns escaped with a Samoan Drop. Reigns backdropped Cesaro over the top rop, and Cesaro sold their right elbow. Reigns forgot which arm they were supposed to be selling midway through the match.
They did a tribute to Nick Bockwinkel, posting a graphic with JBL and Michael Cole putting them over as the greatest technical wrestler of all time. It was very nice and they invited viewers to go to WWE.com for more interviews regarding Bockwinkel.
The Dudley Boyz defeated the Ascension (3:12)
Bubba Ray Dudley pinned Viktor after the 3-D. It sure did fill 3 minutes.
Alberto Del Rio and Zeb Coulter were stopped backstage by Renee Young. HHH walked in and gave the same speech to Del Rio that they gave earlier to Cesaro about going from the Man of the People to being the Man.
Kalisto did an inset promo about people saying their win over Ryback was a fluke. They said their dreams are bigger than any man and he's fighting for their life.
Alberto Del Rio defeated Kalisto in the quarterfinals of the WWE World Heavyweight Tournament (10:04)
Del Rio won with the Diving Double Foot Stome while Kalisto was tied to the tree of woe. This was Del Rio's 4th Raw since their return, and this was the third crowd totally silent for him. They feel like a bigger deal on the underground circuit that they do in WWE because they don't know how to book superstars that will get over to minorities. It doesn't help the pairing with Coulter isn't over a lick. Match was a Lucha-style, which the fans in South Carolina weren't familiar with.
I guess sensing the attention Holly Holm's upset of Ronda Rousey received over the last 48 hours, they put Paige's contract signing with Charlotte in the main event segment. These people have no clue. They went five minutes reciting scripted dialogue, which didn't have 2% of the impact Holm's forearm shiver on Rosey did at the weigh-in. Charlotte brought up their late brother Reid, then started to cry, and it felt so forced. Charlotte said Paige was there for them when Reid died, and they thought they were family. Charlotte said it wasn't about a championship, it was about who has your back at the end of the day. But Paige let their selfish ways get in the way. Charlotte said a champion is someone that little girls watch at home wanting to be like. Charlotte said they won't be champion forever, but they won't lose it on Sunday and when they do, it won't be to someone like Paige.
Paige said no one will have Charlotte's back on Sunday, not even Ric Flair. Charlotte shouted them down and they just. kept. talking. Then Paige said something about Reid not have much fight in him. God this was awful. They started brawling, but the fans weren't that hot for it. Charlotte kept escaping from the refs in a pull-apart while the fans just watched without reacting. Charlotte never did sign the contract, which was stupid since that's what the whole show was built around. A disgusting segment.
SUMMARY:
There are times after big UFC events where on the following Monday's Raw, the WWE looks like a company that lost it's relevance and doesn't even know it. Tonight was largely a good show which also should have anyone who cares about the WWE's future scared straight. The final segment wasn't manipulative. It had the ambition to manipulate but failed. And it reeked, not just in terms of quality but of an antiquated mindset of what lures viewers to shows. Charlotte is not a talking personality, but the company put them in that role. In the main event, no less. And that speaks volumes to how out of touch Vince McMahon, Kevin Dunn and other WWE power brokers have worn out their welcome. I have no idea how a company that loses 25% of its audience in three years doesn't have mass turnover at the main creative end, and tonight was a desperate ploy that failed miserably.
Malta's Prime Minister Says Europe Should Become the Bitcoin Continent

European Policy Event with 1000+ Participants
Innovation platform of exchange, the CEPS Ideas Lab, brings together national think
tanks across Europe. CEPS Ideas Lab 2017 – Reconstructing the Union took place on February 23 and is one of the main events in Brussels.
Over 1,000 participants of 43 different nationalities consisting of national governments' representatives, businesses, NGOs and European institutions gathered to debate key European policy issues.
Muscat was the keynote speaker for the event. Instead of delivering a well-prepared speech which they said “would have bored you to death”, they opted to “get into the spirit of this event by proposing ideas, some sensible, others risky, yet others which might sound, and be, outright insane”. Instead of address the crowd as “Prime Minister of the Member State holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union”, they are speaking as “a European who is fed up of us going round in circles, and of someone who wants to provoke debate”. Malta is currently holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
In their speech, they presented five “provocative ideas” on rebuilding the EU. “Now is the time to double down with yet another unthinkable project”, they said.
Europe Should be the Bitcoin Continent
Among the list of ideas, Muscat proposed that “Europe should become the bitcoin continent”. The Head of Communication at CEPS, Marco Incerti, then tweeted about the statement, which Muscat retweeted.
“The rise of cryptocurrencies can be slowed but cannot be stopped,” the PM conveyed. “Some financial institutions are painstakingly accepting the fact that the system at the back of such transactions is much more efficient and transparent than the classical ones,” they added, as transcribed by Live News Malta. The Maltese PM then elaborated:
My point is that rather than resist, European regulators should innovate and create mechanisms in which to regulate cryptocurrencies, in order to harness their potential and better protect consumers, while making Europe the natural home of innovators.
Muscat then went on to present the four other controversial ideas to their fellow Europeans, including selling citizenships to the EU and opening a dialog with Turkey about their human rights problems. At the conclusion of their speech, they said that they hope the five ideas incites a few debates and that they look forward to their reactions.
